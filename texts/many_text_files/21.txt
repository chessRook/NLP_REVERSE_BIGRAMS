interest himself in the troubles  of young people     oct  ah  scapin  if you could find some scheme  invent some plot  to  get me out of the trouble i am in  i should think myself indebted to  you for more than life     sca  to tell you the truth  there are few things impossible to me  when i once set about them  heaven has bestowed on me a fair enough  share of genius for the making up of all those neat strokes of mother  wit  for all those ingenious gallantries to which the ignorant and  vulgar give the name of impostures  and i can boast  without vanity   that there have been very few men more skilful than i in expedients  and intrigues  and who have acquired a greater reputation in the  noble profession  but  to tell the truth  merit is too ill rewarded  nowadays  and i have given up everything of the kind since the  trouble i had through a certain affair which happened to me     oct  how  what affair  scapin     sca  an adventure in which justice and i fell out     oct  justice and you     sca  yes  we had a trifling quarrel     sil  you and justice     sca  yes  she used me very badly  and i felt so enraged against the  ingratitude of our age that i determined never to do anything for  anybody  but never mind  tell me about yourself all the same     oct  you know  scapin  that two months ago mr  geronte and my father  set out together on a voyage  about a certain business in which they  are both interested     sca  yes  i know that     oct  and that both leandre and i were left by our respective fathers   i under the management of silvestre  and leandre under your  management     sca  yes  i have acquitted myself very well of my charge     oct  some time afterwards leandre met with a young gipsy girl  with  whom he fell in love     sca  i know that too     oct  as we are great friends  he told me at once of his love  and  took me to see this young girl  whom i thought good looking  it is  true  but not so beautiful as he would have had me believe  he never  spoke of anything but her  at every opportunity he exaggerated her  grace and her beauty  extolled her intelligence  spoke to me with  transport of the charms of her conversation  and related to me her  most insignificant saying  which he always wanted me to think the  cleverest thing in the world  he often found fault with me for not  thinking as highly as he imagined i ought to do of the things he  related to me  and blamed me again and again for being so insensible  to the power of love     sca  i do not see what you are aiming at in all this     oct  one day  as i was going with him to the people who have charge  of the girl with whom he is in love  we heard in a small house on a  by street  lamentations mixed with a good deal of sobbing  we  inquired what it was  and were told by a woman that we might see  there a most piteous sight  in the persons of two strangers  and that  unless we were quite insensible to pity  we should be sure to be  touched with it     sca  where will this lead to     oct  curiosity made me urge leandre to come in with me  we went into  a low room  where we saw an old woman dying  and with her a servant  who was uttering lamentations  and a young girl dissolved in tears   the most beautiful  the most touching sight that you ever saw     sca  oh  oh     oct  any other person would have seemed frightful in the condition  she was in  for all the dress she had on was a scanty old petticoat   with a night jacket of plain fustian  and turned back at the top of  her head a yellow cap  which let her hair fall in disorder on her  shoulders  and yet dressed even thus she shone with a thousand  attractions  and all her person was most charming and pleasant     sca  i begin to understand     oct  had you but seen her  scapin  as i did  you would have thought  her admirable     sca  oh  i have no doubt about it  and without seeing her  i plainly  perceive that she must have been altogether charming     oct  her tears were none of those unpleasant tears which spoil the  face  she had a most touching grace in weeping  and her sorrow was a  most beautiful thing to witness     sca  i can see all that     oct  all who approached her burst into tears whilst she threw  herself  in her loving way  on the body of the dying woman  whom she  called her dear mother  and nobody could help being moved to the  depths of the heart to see a girl with such a loving disposition     sca  yes  all that is very touching  and i understand that this  loving disposition made you love her     oct  ah  scapin  a savage would have loved her     sca  certainly  how could anyone help doing so     oct  after a few words  with which i tried to soothe her grief  we  left her  and when i asked leandre what he thought of her  he  answered coldly that she was rather pretty  i was wounded to find how  unfeelingly he spoke to me of her  and i would not tell him the  effect her beauty had had on my heart     sil    to  octave   if you do not abridge your story  we shall  have to stop here till to morrow  leave it to me to finish it in a  few words    to  scapin  his heart takes fire from that moment   he cannot live without going to comfort the amiable and sorrowful  girl  his frequent visits are forbidden by the servant  who has  become her guardian by the death of the mother  our young man is in  despair  he presses  begs  beseeches  all in vain  he is told that  the young girl  although without friends and without fortune  is of  an honourable family  and that  unless he marries her  he must cease  his visits  his love increases with the difficulties  he racks his  brains  debates  reasons  ponders  and makes up his mind  and  to cut  a long story short  he has been married these three days     sca  i see     sil  now  add to this the unforeseen return of the father  who was  not to be back before two whole months  the discovery which the uncle  has made of the marriage  and that other marriage projected between  him and a daughter which mr  geronte had by a second wife  whom  they  say  he married at tarentum     oct  and  above all  add also the poverty of my beloved  and the  impossibility there is for me to do anything for her relief     sca  is that all  you are both of you at a great loss about nothing   is there any reason to be alarmed  are you not ashamed  you   silvestre  to fall short in such a small matter  deuce take it all   you  big and stout as father and mother put together  you can t find  any expedient in your noddle  you can t plan any stratagem  invent  any gallant intrigue to put matters straight  fie  plague on the  booby  i wish i had had the two old fellows to bamboozle in former  times  i should not have thought much of it  and i was no bigger than  that  when i had given a hundred delicate proofs of my skill     sil  i acknowledge that heaven has not given me your talent  and that  i have not the brains like you to embroil myself with justice     oct  here is my lovely hyacintha           scene iii   hyacintha  octave  scapin  silvestre     hya  ah  octave  is what silvestre has just told nerine really true   is your father back  and is he bent upon marrying you     oct  yes  it is so  dear hyacintha  and these tidings have given me a  cruel shock  but what do i see  you are weeping  why those tears  do  you suspect me of unfaithfulness  and have you no assurance of the  love i feel for you     hya  yes  octave  i am sure that you love me now  but can i be sure  that you will love me always     oct  ah  could anyone love you once without loving you for ever     hya  i have heard say  octave  that your sex does not love so long as  ours  and that the ardour men show is a fire which dies out as easily  as it is kindled     oct  then  my dear hyacintha  my heart is not like that of other men   and i feel certain that i shall love you till i die     hya  i want to believe what you say  and i have no doubt that you are  sincere  but i fear a power which will oppose in your heart the  tender feelings you have for me  you depend on a father who would  marry you to another  and i am sure it would kill me if such a thing  happened     oct  no  lovely hyacintha  there is no father who can force me to  break my faith to you  and i could resolve to leave my country  and  even to die  rather than be separated from you  without having seen  her  i have already conceived a horrible aversion to her whom they  want me to marry  and although i am not cruel  i wish the sea would  swallow her up  or drive her hence forever  do not weep  then  dear  hyacintha  for your tears kill me  and i cannot see them without  feeling pierced to the heart     hya  since you wish it  i will dry my tears  and i will wait without  fear for what heaven shall decide     oct  heaven will be favourable to us     hya  it cannot be against us if you are faithful     oct  i certainly shall be so     hya  then i shall be happy     sca    aside    she is not so

 to marry without his father s consent     sca  yes  there is something to be said against it  but my opinion is  that you should make no fuss about it     arg  this is your opinion  but not mine  and i will make as much fuss  as i please  what  do you not think that i have every reason to be  angry     sca  quite so  i was angry myself when i first heard it  and i so far  felt interested in your behalf that i rated your son well  just ask  him the fine sermons i gave him  and how i lectured him about the  little respect he showed his father  whose very footsteps he ought to  kiss  you could not yourself talk better to him  but what of that  i  submitted to reason  and considered that  after all  he had done  nothing so dreadful     arg  what are you telling me  he has done nothing so dreadful  when  he goes and marries straight off a perfect stranger     sca  what can one do  he was urged to it by his destiny     arg  oh  oh  you give me there a fine reason  one has nothing better  to do now than to commit the greatest crime imaginable  to cheat   steal  and murder  and give for an excuse that we were urged to it by  destiny     sca  ah me  you take my words too much like a philosopher  i mean to  say that he was fatally engaged in this affair     arg  and why did he engage in it     sca  do you expect him to be as wise as you are  can you put an old  head on young shoulders  and expect young people to have all the  prudence necessary to do nothing but what is reasonable  just look at  our leandre  who  in spite of all my lessons  has done even worse  than that  i should like to know whether you yourself were not young  once  and have not played as many pranks as others  i have heard say  that you were a sad fellow in your time  that you played the gallant  among the most gallant of those days  and that you never gave in  until you had gained your point     arg  it is true  i grant it  but i always confined myself to  gallantry  and never went so far as to do what he has done     sca  but what was he to do  he sees a young person who wishes him  well  for he inherits it from you that all women love him  he thinks  her charming  goes to see her  makes love to her  sighs as lovers  sigh  and does the passionate swain  she yields to his pressing  visits  he pushes his fortune  but her relations catch him with her   and oblige him to marry her by main force     sil    aside    what a clever cheat     sca  would you have him suffer them to murder him  it is still better  to be married than to be dead     arg  i was not told that the thing had

think i would tell you an untruth     arg  then he should have gone at once to a lawyer to protest against  the violence     sca  it is the very thing he would not do     arg  it would have made it

side the rights of a father  and can i  not have satisfaction for the violence done to my son     sca  this is a thing he will not consent to     arg  he will not consent to it     sca  no     arg  my son     sca  your son  would you have him acknowledge that he was frightened   and that he yielded by force to what was wanted of him  he will take  care not to confess that  it would be to wrong

thinking of your son s conduct     arg  yes  i acknowledge that it grieves me deeply     sca  ah  sir  life is full of troubles  and we should always be  prepared for them  i was told  a long time ago  the saying of an  ancient philosopher which i have never forgotten     arg  what was it     sca  that if the father of a family has been away from home for ever  so short a time  he ought to dwell upon all the sad news that may  greet him on his return  he ought to fancy his house burnt down  his  money stolen  his wife dead  his son married  his daughter ruined   and be very thankful for whatever falls short of all this  in my  small way of philosophy  i have ever taken this lesson to heart  and  i never come home but i expect to have to bear with the anger of my  masters  their scoldings  insults  kicks  blows  and horse whipping   and i always thank my destiny for whatever i do not receive     arg  that s all very well  but this rash marriage is more than i can  put up with  and it forces me to break off the match i had intended  for my son  i have come from my solicitor s to see if we can cancel  it     sca  well  sir  if you will take my advice  you will look to some  other way of settling this business  you know what a law suit means  in this country  and you ll find yourself in the midst of a strange  bush of thorns     arg  i am fully aware that you are quite right  but what else can i  do     sca  i think i have found something that will answer much better  the  sorrow that i felt for you made me rummage in my head to find some  means of getting you out of trouble  for i cannot bear to see kind  fathers a prey to grief without feeling sad about it  and  besides  i  have at all times had the greatest regard for you     arg  i am much obliged to you     sca  then you must know that i went to the brother of the young girl  whom your son has married  he is one of those fire eaters  one of  those men all sword thrusts  who speak of nothing but fighting  and  who think no more of killing a man than of swallowing a glass of  wine  i got him to speak of this marriage  i showed him how easy it  would be to have it broken off  because of the violence used towards  your son  i spoke to him of your prerogatives as father  and of the  weight which your rights  your money  and your friends would have  with justice  i managed him so that at last he lent a ready ear to  the propositions i made to him of arranging the matter amicably for a  sum of money  in short  he will give his consent to the marriage  being cancelled  provided you pay him well     arg  and how much did he ask     sca  oh  at first things utterly out of the question     arg  but what     sca  things utterly extravagant     arg  but what     sca  he spoke of no less than five

you were not a man to be duped in that fashion   and of whom anyone can ask five or six hundred pistoles  however   after much talking  this is what we decided upon   the time is now  come   he said   when i must go and rejoin the army  i am buying my  equipments  and the want of money i am in forces me to listen to what  you propose  i must have a horse  and i cannot obtain one at all fit  for the service under sixty pistoles      arg  well  yes  i am willing to give sixty pistoles     sca  he must have the harness and pistols  and that will cost very  nearly twenty pistoles more     arg  twenty and sixty make eighty     sca  exactly     arg  it s a great deal  still  i consent to that     sca  he must also have a horse for his servant  which  we may expect   will cost at least thirty pistoles     arg  how  the deuce  let him go to jericho  he shall have nothing at  all     sca  sir     arg  no  he s an insolent fellow     sca  would you have his servant walk     arg  let him get along as he pleases  and the master too     sca  now  sir  really don t go and hesitate for so little  don t have  recourse to law  i beg of you  but rather give all that is asked of  you  and save yourself from the clutches of justice     arg  well  well  i will bring myself to give these thirty pistoles  also     sca   i must also have   he said   a mule to carry         arg  let him go to the

justice   look at the number of appeals  of stages of jurisdiction  how many  embarrassing procedures  how many ravening wolves through whose claws  you will have to pass  serjeants  solicitors  counsel  registrars   substitutes  recorders  judges and their clerks  there is not one of  these who  for the merest trifle  couldn t knock over the best case  in the world  a serjeant will issue false writs without your knowing  anything of it  your solicitor will act in concert with your  adversary  and sell you for ready money  your counsel  bribed in the  same way  will be nowhere to be found when your case comes on  or  else will bring forward arguments which are the merest shooting in  the air  and will never come to the point  the registrar will issue  writs and decrees against you for contumacy  the recorder s clerk  will make away with some of your papers  or the instructing officer  himself will not say what he has seen  and when  by dint of the  wariest possible precautions  you have escaped all these traps  you  will be amazed that your judges have been set against you either by  bigots or by the women they love  ah  sir  save yourself from such a  hell  if you can   tis damnation in this world to have to go to law   and the mere thought of a lawsuit is quite enough to drive me to the  other end of the world     arg  how much does he want for the mule     sca  for the mule  for his horse and that of his servant  for the  harness and pistols  and to pay a little something he owes at the  hotel  he asks altogether two hundred pistoles  sir     arg  two hundred pistoles     sca  yes     arg    walking about angrily    no  no  we will go to law     sca  recollect what you are doing     arg  i shall go to law     sca  don t go and expose yourself to

advice  evidence  and his days  in court  you must have money for the consultations and pleadings of  the counsel  for the right of withdrawing the briefs  and for  engrossed copies of the documents  you must have money for the  reports of the substitutes  for the court fees     at the conclusion   for registrar s enrolment  drawing up of deeds  sentences  decrees   rolls  signings  and clerks  despatches  letting alone all the  presents you will have to make  give this money to the man  and there  you are well out of the whole thing          epices    spices   in ancient times  equalled   sweetmeats   and were given to the judge by the side which  gained the suit  as a mark of gratitude  these  epices  had long  been changed into a compulsory payment of money when moliere wrote   in racine s  plaideurs   act ii  scene vii   petit jean takes  literally the demand of the judge for  epices   and fetches the  pepper box to satisfy him     arg  two hundred pistoles     sca  yes  and you will save by it  i have made a small calculation in  my head of all that justice costs  and i find that by giving two  hundred pistoles to your man you will have a large margin left  say   at least a hundred and fifty pistoles  without taking into  consideration the cares  troubles  and anxieties  which you will  spare yourself  for were it only to avoid being before everybody the  butt of some facetious counsel  i had rather give three hundred  pistoles than go to law   footnote  what would moliere have said if  he had been living now      arg  i don t care for that  and i challenge

with me  from that moment  he followed me everywhere  and  like all young men  he imagined that  he had but to speak and things would go on as he liked  but he met  with a pride which forced him to think twice  he spoke of his love  to the people in whose power i was  and found them ready to give me  up for a certain sum of money  but the sad part of the business was  that my lover found himself exactly in the same condition as most  young men of good family  that is  without any money at all  his  father  although rich  is the veriest old skinflint and greatest  miser you ever heard of  wait

to leave this town to day  and my lover would have  lost me through his lack of money if  in order to wrench some out of  his father  he had not made use of a clever servant he has  as for  that servant s name  i remember it very well  his name is scapin  he  is a most wonderful man  and deserves the highest praise     ger    aside    ah  the wretch     zer  but just listen to the plan he adopted to take in his dupe  ah   ah  ah  ah  i can t think of it without laughing heartily  ah  ah   ah  he went to that old screw  ah  ah  ah   and told him that while  he was walking about the harbour with his son  ah  ah   they noticed  a turkish galley  that a young turk had invited them to come in and  see it  that he had given them some lunch  ah  ah   and that  while  they were at table  the galley had gone into the open sea  that the  turk had sent him alone back  with the express order to say to him  that  unless he sent him five hundred crowns  he would take his son  to be a slave in algiers  ah  ah  ah  you may imagine our miser  our  stingy old curmudgeon  in the greatest anguish  struggling between  his love for his son and his love for his money  those five hundred  crowns that are asked of him are five hundred dagger thrusts  ah   ah  ah  ah  he can t bring his mind to tear out  as it were  this  sum from his heart  and his anguish makes him think of the most  ridiculous means to find money for his son s ransom  ah  ah  ah  he  wants to send the police into the open sea after the turk s  galley  ah  ah  ah  he asks his servant to take the place of his son  till he has found the money to pay for him  money he has no intention of  giving  ah  ah  ah  he yields up  to make the five hundred crowns  three  or four old suits which are not worth thirty  ah  ah

ah  cursed galley  ah  scoundrel  of a turk   at last  after many hesitations  after having sighed and  groaned for a long time   but it seems to me that my story does not make  you laugh  what do you say to it     ger  what i say  that the young man is a scoundrel  a good for nothing  fellow  who will be punished by his father for the trick he has played him   that the gypsy girl is a bold

the middle space  went by a path  that to a valley strikes   which e en thus high exhal d its noisome steam           canto xi    upon the utmost verge of a high bank   by craggy rocks environ d round  we came   where woes beneath more cruel yet were stow d   and here to shun the horrible excess  of fetid exhalation  upward cast  from the profound abyss  behind the lid  of a great monument we stood

thy wishes tend   my son  within these rocks   he thus began    are three close circles in gradation plac d   as these which now thou leav st  each one is full  of spirits accurs d  but that the sight alone  hereafter may suffice thee  listen how  and for what cause in durance they abide      of all malicious act abhorr d in heaven   the end is injury  and all such end  either by force or fraud works other s woe  but fraud  because of man peculiar evil   to god is more displeasing  and beneath  the fraudulent are therefore doom d to  endure  severer pang   the violent occupy  all the first circle  and because to force  three persons are obnoxious  in three rounds  hach within other sep rate is it fram d   to god  his neighbour  and himself  by man  force may be offer d  to himself i say  and his possessions  as thou soon shalt hear  at full   death  violent death  and painful wounds  upon his neighbour he inflicts  and wastes  by devastation  pillage  and the flames   his substance   slayers  and each one that smites  in malice  plund rers  and all robbers  hence  the torment undergo of the first round  in different herds   man can do violence  to himself and his own blessings  and for this  he in the second round must aye deplore  with unavailing penitence his crime   whoe er deprives himself of life and light   in reckless lavishment his talent wastes   and sorrows there where he should dwell in joy   to god may force be offer d  in the heart  denying and blaspheming his high power   and nature with her kindly law contemning   and thence the inmost round marks with its seal  sodom and cahors  and all such as speak  contemptuously  of the godhead in their hearts      fraud  that in every conscience leaves a sting   may be by man employ d on one  whose trust  he wins  or on another who withholds  strict confidence   seems as the latter way  broke but the bond of love which nature makes   whence in the second circle have their nest  dissimulation  witchcraft  flatteries   theft  falsehood  simony  all who seduce  to lust  or set their honesty at pawn   with such vile scum as these   the other way  forgets both nature s general love  and that  which thereto added afterwards gives birth  to special faith   whence in the lesser circle   point of the universe  dread seat of dis   the traitor is eternally consum d      i thus   instructor  clearly thy discourse  proceeds  distinguishing the hideous chasm  and its inhabitants with skill exact   but tell me this  they of the dull  fat pool   whom the rain beats  or whom the tempest drives   or who with tongues so fierce conflicting meet   wherefore within the city fire illum d  are not these punish d  if god s wrath be on them   and if it be not  wherefore in such guise  are they condemned

these words  continu d   where thou saidst  that usury  offends celestial goodness  and this knot  perplex d unravel    he thus made reply    philosophy  to an attentive ear   clearly points out  not in one part alone   how imitative nature takes her course  from the celestial mind and from its art   and where her laws the stagyrite unfolds   not many leaves scann d o er  observing well  thou shalt discover  that your art on her  obsequious follows  as the learner treads  in his instructor s step  so that your art  deserves the name of second in descent  from god   these two  if thou recall to mind  creation s holy book  from the beginning  were the right source of life and excellence  to human kind   but in another path  the usurer walks  and nature in herself  and in her

was the thunder             shown himself alive to them          with many sure proofs  appearing to them at intervals during          forty days  and speaking of the kingdom of god             and while in their company he charged them not to leave          jerusalem  but to wait for the father s promised gift            this you have heard of   he said   from me             for john indeed baptized with water  but before many days          have passed you shall be baptized with the holy spirit              once when they were with him  they asked him   master  is this          the time at which you are about to restore the kingdom of israel               it is not for you   he replied   to know times or epochs          which the father has reserved within his own authority             and yet you will receive power when the holy spirit has come          upon you  and you will be my witnesses in jerusalem and in all          judaea and samaria and to the remotest parts of the earth              when he had said this  and while they were looking          at him  he was carried up  and a cloud closing beneath him          hid him from their sight             but  while they stood intently gazing into the sky as he went           suddenly there were two men in white garments standing by them             who said   galilaeans  why stand looking into the sky           this same jesus who has been taken up from you into heaven          will come in just the same way as you have seen him          going into heaven              then they returned to jerusalem from the mountain called          the oliveyard  which is near jerusalem  about a mile off             they entered the city  and they went up to the upper room which          was now their fixed place for meeting   their names were peter          and john  james and andrew  philip and thomas  bartholomew          and matthew  james the son of alphaeus  simon the zealot           and judas the brother of james             all of these with one mind continued earnest in prayer           together with some women  and mary the mother of jesus           and his brothers             it was on one of these days that peter stood up in the midst          of the brethren  the entire number of persons present being          about      and said              brethren  it was necessary that the scripture should be fulfilled            the prediction  i mean  which the holy spirit uttered by          the lips of david  about judas  who acted as guide to those          who arrested jesus             for judas was reckoned as one of our number  and a share          in this ministry was allotted to him               now having bought a piece of ground with the money paid for his          wickedness he fell there with his face downwards  and  his body          bursting open  he became disembowelled             this fact became widely known to the people of jerusalem           so that the place received the name  in their language           of achel damach  which means  the field of blood                for it is written in the book of psalms    let his encampment          be desolate   let there be no one to dwell there   and   his          work let another take up               it is necessary  therefore  that of the men who have been with us          all the time that the lord jesus went in and out among us              beginning from his baptism by john down to the day on which he          was taken up again from us into heaven  one should be appointed          to become a witness with us as to his resurrection              so two names were proposed  joseph called bar sabbas            and surnamed justus  and matthias             and the brethren prayed  saying   thou  lord  who knowest the hearts          of all  show clearly which of these two thou hast chosen            to occupy the place in this ministry and apostleship from          which judas through transgression fell  in order to go          to his own place              then they drew lots between them   the lot fell on matthias           and a place among the eleven apostles was voted to him             at length  on the day of the harvest festival  they had all met          in one place             when suddenly there came from the sky a sound as of a strong          rushing blast of wind   this filled the whole house where          they were sitting             and they saw tongues of what looked like fire distributing          themselves over the assembly  and on the head of each person          a tongue alighted             they were all filled with the holy spirit  and began to speak          in foreign languages according as the spirit gave them          words to utter             now there were jews residing in jerusalem  devout men from every          part of the world             so when this noise was heard  they came crowding together           and were amazed because everyone heard his own language spoken             they were beside themselves with wonder  and exclaimed            are not all these speakers galilaeans             how then does each of us hear his own native language          spoken by them             some of us are parthians  medes  elamites   some are inhabitants          of mesopotamia  of judaea or cappadocia  of pontus or the          asian province  of phrygia or pamphylia             of egypt or of the parts of africa towards cyrene           others are visitors from rome  being either jews or converts          from heathenism  and others are cretans or arabians             yet we all alike hear these galilaeans speaking in our own          language about the wonderful things which god has done              they were all astounded and bewildered  and asked one another            what can this mean              but others  scornfully jeering  said   they are brim full          of sweet wine              peter however  together with the eleven  stood up and addressed          them in a loud voice    men of judaea  and all you inhabitants          of jerusalem   he said   be in no uncertainty about this          matter but pay attention to what i say             for this is not intoxication  as you suppose  it being only          the third hour of the day             but that which was predicted through the prophet joel has happened              and it shall come to pass in the last days  god says           that i will pour out my spirit upon all mankind  and your sons          and your daughters shall prophesy  and your young men shall          see visions  and your old men shall have dreams             and even upon my bondservants  both men and women  at that time           i will pour out my spirit  and they shall prophesy             i will display marvels in the sky above  and signs on the earth below           blood and fire  and pillars of smoke             the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood           to usher in the day of the lord  that great and illustrious day             and every one who calls on the name of the lord shall be saved               listen  israelites  to what i say   jesus  the nazarene           a man accredited to you from god by miracles and marvels          and signs which god did among you through him  as you          yourselves know  him              delivered up through god s settled purpose and foreknowledge            you by the hands of gentiles have nailed to a cross and have          put to death             but god has raised him to life  having terminated the throes          of death  for in fact it was not possible for him to be held          fast by death             for david says in reference to him    i constantly fixed my          eyes upon the lord  because he is at my right hand in order          that i may continue unshaken             for this reason my heart is glad and my tongue exults           my body also shall rest in hope             for thou wilt not leave me in the unseen world forsaken           nor give up thy holy one to undergo decay             thou hast made known to me the ways of life   thou wilt fill          me with gladness in thy presence               as to the patriarch david  i need hardly remind you  brethren           that he died and was buried  and that we still have his          tomb among us             being a prophet  however  and knowing that god had solemnly          sworn to him to seat a descendant of his upon his throne             with prophetic foresight he spoke of the resurrection of the christ           to the effect that he was not left forsaken in the unseen world           nor did his body undergo decay             this jesus  god has raised to life  a fact to which all          of us testify              being therefore lifted high by the mighty hand of god  he has          received from the father the promised holy spirit and has          poured out this which you see and hear             for david did not ascend into heaven  but he says himself             the lord said to my lord  sit at my right hand            until i make thy foes a footstool under thy feet               therefore let the whole house of israel know beyond          all doubt that god has made him both lord and christ            this jesus whom you crucified              stung to the heart by these words  they said to peter and the rest          of the apostles   brethren  what are we to do               repent   replied peter   and be baptized  every one of you           in the name of jesus christ  with a view to the remission          of your sins  and you shall receive the gift of the holy spirit             for to you belongs the promise  and to your children           and to all who are far off  whoever the lord our god may call              and with many more appeals he solemnly warned and entreated them           saying   escape from this crooked generation              those  therefore  who joyfully welcomed his message were baptized           and on that one day about three thousand persons were          added to them             and they were constant in listening to the teaching of the          apostles and in their attendance at the communion  that is           the breaking of the bread  and at prayer             fear came upon every one  and many marvels and signs were done          by the apostles             and all the believers kept together  and had everything in common             they sold their lands and other property  and distributed          the proceeds among all  according to every one s necessities             and  day by day  attending constantly in the temple with one accord           and breaking bread in private houses  they took their meals          with great happiness and single heartedness             praising god and being regarded with favour by all the people           also  day by day  the lord added to their number those whom          he was saving             one day peter and john were going up to the temple for the hour          of prayer  the ninth hour  and  just then             some men were carrying there one who had been lame from birth           whom they were wont to place every day close to the beautiful gate           as it was called  of the temple  for him to beg from the people          as they went in             seeing peter and john about to go into the temple  he asked          them for alms             peter fixing his eyes on him  as john did also  said   look at us              so he looked and waited  expecting to receive something from them              i have no silver or gold   peter said   but what i have  i give you           in the name of jesus christ  the nazarene  walk              then taking his hand peter lifted him up  and immediately          his feet and ankles were strengthened             leaping up  he stood upright and began to walk  and went into          the temple with them  walking  leaping  and praising god             all the people saw him walking and praising god             and recognizing him as the man who used to sit at the beautiful gate          of the temple asking for alms  they were filled with awe          and amazement at what had happened to him             while he still clung to peter and john  the people  awe struck  ran up          crowding round them in what was known as solomon s portico             peter  seeing this  spoke to the people    israelites   he said            why do you wonder at this man   or why gaze at us  as though          by any power or piety of our own we had enabled him to walk             the god of abraham  isaac  and jacob  the god of our forefathers           has conferred this honour on his servant jesus  whom you          delivered up and disowned in the presence of pilate           when he had decided to let him go             yes  you disowned the holy and righteous one  and asked          as a favour the release of a murderer             the prince of life you put to death  but god has raised him          from the dead  and we are witnesses as to that             it is his name  faith in that name being the condition            which has strengthened this man whom you behold and know           and the faith which he has given has made this man sound          and strong again  as you can all see              and now  brethren  i know that it was in ignorance that you          did it  as was the case with your rulers also             but in this way god has fulfilled the declarations he made          through all the prophets  that his christ would suffer             repent  therefore  and reform your lives  so that the record          of your sins may be cancelled  and that there may come seasons          of revival from the lord             and that he may send the christ appointed beforehand          for you  even jesus             heaven must receive him until those times of which god has spoken          from the earliest ages through the lips of his holy prophets            the times of the reconstitution of all things             moses declared    the lord your god will raise up a prophet          for you from among your brethren as he has raised me           in all that he says to you  you must listen to him             and every one  without exception  who refuses to listen to that          prophet shall be utterly destroyed from among the people              yes  and all the prophets  from samuel onwards  all who have spoken            have also announced the coming of this present time              you are the heirs of the prophets  and of the covenant which god          made with your forefathers when he said to abraham   and through          your posterity all the families of the world shall be blessed              it is to you first that god  after raising his servant from          the grave  has sent him to bless you  by causing every one          of you to turn from your wickedness              while they were saying this to the people  the priests           the commander of the temple guard  and the sadducees          came upon them             highly incensed at their teaching the people and proclaiming          in the case of jesus the resurrection from among the dead             they arrested the two apostles and lodged them in custody till          the next day  for it was already evening             but many of those who had listened to their preaching believed           and the number of the adult men had now grown to be about                   the next day a meeting was held in jerusalem of their          rulers  elders  and scribes             with annas the high priest  caiaphas  john  alexander  and the          other members of the high priestly family             so they made the apostles stand in the centre  and demanded          of them   by what power or in what name have you done this              then peter was filled with the holy spirit  and he replied            rulers and elders of the people             if we to day are under examination concerning the benefit          conferred on a man helplessly lame  as to how this man          has been cured             be it known to you all  and to all the people of israel           that through the name of jesus the anointed  the nazarene           whom  you  crucified  but whom  god  has raised from among          the dead  through that name this man stands here before you          in perfect health             this jesus is the stone treated with contempt by you the builders           but it has been made the cornerstone             and in no other is the great salvation to be found  for  in fact           there is no second name under heaven that has been given          among men through which we are to be saved              as they looked on peter and john so fearlessly outspoken            and also discovered that they were illiterate persons           untrained in the schools  they were surprised  and now they          recognized them as having been with jesus             and seeing the man standing with them  the man who had been cured            they had no reply to make             so they ordered them to withdraw from the sanhedrin while they          conferred among themselves              what are we to do with these men   they asked one another           for the fact that a remarkable miracle has been performed          by them is well known to every one in jerusalem  and we          cannot deny it             but to prevent the matter spreading any further among the people           let us stop them by threats from speaking in the future          in this name to any one whatever              so they recalled the apostles  and ordered them altogether          to give up speaking or teaching in the name of jesus             but peter and john replied   judge whether it is right in god s          sight to listen to you instead of listening to god             as for us  what we have seen and heard we cannot          help speaking about              the court added further threats and then let them go           being quite unable to find any way of punishing them on account          of the people  because all gave god the glory for the thing          that had happened             for the man was over forty years of age on whom this miracle          of restoration to health had been performed             after their release the two apostles went to their friends           and told them all that the high priests and elders had said             and they  upon hearing the story  all lifted up their voices          to god and said   o sovereign lord  it is thou who didst make          heaven and earth and sea  and all that is in them             and didst say through the holy spirit by the lips of our forefather          david thy servant    why have the nations stamped and raged           and the peoples formed futile plans             the kings of the earth came near  and the rulers assembled          together against the lord and against his anointed                they did indeed assemble in this city in hostility to thy holy          servant jesus whom thou hadst anointed  herod and pontius pilate          with the gentiles and also the tribes of israel              to do all that thy power and thy will had predetermined          should be done             and now  lord  listen to their threats  and enable thy servants          to proclaim thy message with fearless courage             whilst thou stretchest out thine arm to cure men  and to give          signs and marvels through the name of thy holy servant jesus              when they had prayed  the place in which they were assembled shook           and they were  one and all  filled with the holy spirit           and proceeded to tell god s message with boldness             among all those who had embraced the faith there was but one heart          and soul  so that none of them claimed any of his possessions          as his own  but everything they had was common property             while the apostles with great force of conviction delivered          their testimony as to the resurrection of the lord jesus           and great grace was upon them all             and  in fact  there was not a needy man among them           for all who were possessors of lands or houses sold them           and brought the money which they realised             and gave it to the apostles  and distribution was made to every          one according to his wants             in this way joseph  whom the apostles gave the name of bar nabas            signifying  son of encouragement   a levite  a native of cyprus             sold a farm which he had  and brought the money and gave it          to the apostles             there was a man of the name of ananias who  with his wife sapphira           sold some property but             with her full knowledge and consent  dishonestly kept back          part of the price which he received for it  though he brought          the rest and gave it to the apostles              ananias   said peter   why has satan taken possession of your heart           that you should try to deceive the holy spirit and dishonestly          keep back part of the price paid you for this land             while it remained unsold  was not the land your own           and when sold  was it not at your own disposal           how is it that you have cherished this design in your heart           it is not to men you have told this lie  but to god              upon hearing these words ananias fell down dead  and all who          heard the words were awe struck             the younger men  however  rose  and wrapping the body up           carried it out and buried it             about three hours had passed  when his wife came in           knowing nothing of what had happened             peter at once questioned her    tell me   he said            whether you sold the land for so much     yes   she replied            for so much               how was it   replied peter   that you two agreed to try          an experiment upon the spirit of the lord   the men who have          buried your husband are already at the door  and they will          carry you out              instantly she fell down dead at his feet  and the young men came          in and found her dead   so they carried her out and buried          her by her husband s side             this incident struck terror into the whole church  and into          the hearts of all who heard of it             many signs and marvels continued to be done among the people          by the apostles  and by common consent they all met          in solomon s portico             but none of the others dared to attach themselves to them           yet the people held them in high honour              and more and more believers in the lord joined them           including great numbers both of men and women              so that they would even bring out their sick friends into          the streets and lay them on light couches or mats  in order          that when peter came by  at least his shadow might fall          on one or other of them             the inhabitants  too  of the towns in the neighbourhood          of jerusalem came in crowds  bringing sick persons and some          who were harassed by foul spirits  and they were cured           one and all             this roused the high priest   he and all his party  the sect          of the sadducees  were filled with angry jealousy            and laid hands upon the apostles  and put them into the public jail             but during the night an angel of the lord opened the prison          doors and brought them out  and said              go and stand in the temple  and go on proclaiming to the people          all this message of life              having received that command they went into the temple           just before daybreak  and began to teach   so when the high priest          and his party came  and had called together the sanhedrin          as well as all the elders of the descendants of israel           they sent to the jail to fetch the apostles             but the officers went and could not find them in the prison           so they came back and brought word             saying   the jail we found quite safely locked  and the warders          were on guard at the doors  but upon going in we found          no one there              when the commander of the temple guards and the high priests heard          this statement  they were utterly at a loss with regard to it           wondering what would happen next             and some one came and brought them word  saying   the men you          put in prison are actually in the temple  standing there           teaching the people              upon this the commander went with the officers  and brought          the apostles  but without using violence  for they were afraid          of being stoned by the people             so they brought them and made them stand in front of the sanhedrin           and then the high priest questioned them              we strictly forbad you to teach in that name  did we not   he said            and see  you have filled jerusalem with your teaching           and are trying to make us responsible for that man s death              peter and the other apostles replied   we must obey god          rather than man             the god of our forefathers has raised jesus to life  whom you          crucified and put to death             god has exalted him to his right hand as chief leader and as saviour           to give israel repentance and forgiveness of sins             and we  and the holy spirit whom god has given to those who obey him            are witnesses as to these things              infuriated at getting this answer  they were disposed to          kill the apostles             but a pharisee of the name of gamaliel  a teacher of the law           held in honour by all the people  rose from his seat and requested          that they should be sent outside the court for a few minutes              israelites   he said   be careful what you are about to do          in dealing with these men             years ago theudas appeared  professing to be a person of importance           and a body of men  some four hundred in number  joined him           he was killed  and all his followers were dispersed and annihilated             after him  at the time of the census  came judas  the galilaean           and was the leader in a revolt   he too perished  and all          his followers were scattered             and now i tell you to hold aloof from these men and leave          them alone  for if this scheme or work is of human origin           it will come to nothing             but if it is really from god  you will be powerless to put          them down  lest perhaps you find yourselves to be actually          fighting against god              his advice carried conviction   so they called the apostles in  and            after flogging them  ordered them not to speak in the name          of jesus  and then let them go             they  therefore  left the sanhedrin and went their way           rejoicing that they had been deemed worthy to suffer disgrace          on behalf of the name             but they did not desist from teaching every day           in the temple or in private houses  and telling the good news          about jesus  the christ             about this time  as the number of disciples was increasing           complaints were made by the greek speaking jews against          the hebrews because their widows were habitually overlooked          in the daily ministration             so the twelve called together the general body of the disciples          and said   it does not seem fitting that we apostles should          neglect the delivery of god s message and minister at tables             therefore  brethren  pick out from among yourselves seven          men of good repute  full of the spirit and of wisdom           and we will appoint them to undertake this duty             but  as for us  we will devote ourselves to prayer and to          the delivery of the message              the suggestion met with general approval  and they          selected stephen  a man full of faith and of the          holy spirit  philip  prochorus  nicanor  timon  parmenas           and nicolas  a proselyte of antioch             these men they brought to the apostles  and  after prayer           they laid their hands upon them             meanwhile god s message continued to spread  and the number          of the disciples in jerusalem very greatly increased           and very many priests obeyed the faith             and stephen  full of grace and power  performed great marvels          and signs among the people             but some members of the so called  synagogue of the freed men            together with some cyrenaeans  alexandrians  cilicians and men          from roman asia  were roused to encounter stephen in debate             they were quite unable  however  to resist the wisdom and          the spirit with which he spoke             then they privately put forward men who declared   we have heard          him speak blasphemous things against moses and against god              in this way they excited the people  the elders  and the scribes           at length they came upon him  seized him with violence           and took him before the sanhedrin             here they brought forward false witnesses who declared            this fellow is incessantly speaking against the holy place          and the law             for we have heard him say that jesus  the nazarene  will pull          this place down to the ground and will change the customs          which moses handed down to us              at once the eyes of all who were sitting in the sanhedrin          were fastened on him  and they saw his face looking just          like the face of an angel             then the high priest asked him   are these statements true              the reply of stephen was   sirs  brethren and fathers  listen to me           god most glorious appeared to our forefather abraham when          he was living in mesopotamia  before he settled in haran             and said to him    leave your country and your relatives           and go into whatever land i point out to you               thereupon he left chaldaea and settled in haran till after          the death of his father  when god caused him to remove into          this country where you now live             but he gave him no inheritance in it  no  not a single square          yard of ground   and yet he promised to bestow the land          as a permanent possession on him and his posterity after him            and promised this at a time when abraham was childless             and god declared that abraham s posterity should for four          hundred years make their home in a country not their own           and be reduced to slavery and be oppressed               and the nation  whichever it is  that enslaves them           i will judge   said god   and afterwards they shall come out           and they shall worship me in this place               then he gave him the covenant of circumcision  and under this          covenant he became the father of isaac  whom he circumcised          on the eighth day   isaac became the father of jacob           and jacob became the father of the twelve patriarchs              the patriarchs were jealous of joseph and sold him into slavery          in egypt   but god was with him            and delivered him from all his afflictions  and gave him favour          and wisdom when he stood before pharaoh  king of egypt           who appointed him governor over egypt and all the royal household             but there came a famine throughout the whole of egypt and canaan            and great distress  so that our forefathers could find no food             when  however  jacob heard that there was wheat to be had           he sent our forefathers into egypt  that was the first time             on their second visit joseph made himself known to his brothers           and pharaoh was informed of joseph s parentage             then joseph sent and invited his father jacob and all his family           numbering seventy five persons  to come to him             and jacob went down into egypt   there he died  and so          did our forefathers             and they were taken to shechem and were laid in the tomb          which abraham had bought from the sons of hamor at shechem          for a sum of money paid in silver              but as the time drew near for the fulfilment of the promise          which god had made to abraham  the people became many times          more numerous in egypt             until there arose a foreign king over egypt who knew          nothing of joseph             he adopted a crafty policy towards our race  and oppressed          our forefathers  making them cast out their infants so that they          might not be permitted to live             at this time moses was born  a wonderfully beautiful child           and for three months he was cared for in his father s house             at length he was cast out  but pharaoh s daughter adopted him           and brought him up as her own son             so moses was educated in all the learning of the egyptians           and possessed great influence through his eloquence          and his achievements              and when he was just forty years old  it occurred to him          to visit his brethren the descendants of israel             seeing one of them wrongfully treated he took his part           and secured justice for the ill treated man by striking          down the egyptian             he supposed his brethren to be aware that by him god was sending          them deliverance  this  however  they did not understand             the next day  also  he came and found two of them fighting           and he endeavoured to make peace between them     sirs   he said            you are brothers   why are you wronging one another               but the man who was doing the wrong resented his interference           and asked    who appointed you magistrate and judge over us             do you mean to kill me as you killed the egyptian yesterday               alarmed at this question  moses fled from the country and went          to live in the land of midian   there he became the father          of two sons              but at the end of forty years there appeared to him in the desert          of mount sinai an angel in the middle of a flame of fire          in a bush             when moses saw this he wondered at the sight  but on his going          up to look further  the voice of the lord was heard  saying               i am the god of your forefathers  the god of abraham  of isaac           and of jacob     quaking with fear moses did not dare gaze               take off your shoes   said the lord   for the spot on which you          are standing is holy ground             i have seen  yes  i have seen the oppression of my people          who are in egypt and have heard their groans  and i have come          down to deliver them   and now i will send you to egypt               the moses whom they rejected  asking him   who appointed you          magistrate and judge    that same moses we find god sending          as a magistrate and a deliverer by the help of the angel          who appeared to him in the bush             this was he who brought them out  after performing marvels          and signs in egypt and at the red sea  and in the desert          for forty years             this is the moses who said to the descendants of israel    god          will raise up a prophet for you  from among your brethren           just as he raised me up               this is he who was among the congregation in the desert           together with the angel who spoke to him on mount sinai          and with our forefathers  who received ever living utterances          to hand on to us              our forefathers  however  would not submit to him  but spurned          his authority and in their hearts turned back to egypt             they said to aaron    make gods for us  to march in front of us           for as for this moses who brought us out of the land of egypt           we do not know what has become of him               moreover they made a calf at that time  and offered a sacrifice          to the idol and kept rejoicing in the gods which their own          hands had made             so god turned from them and gave them up to the worship          of the host of heaven  as it is written in the book of          the prophets    were they victims and sacrifices which you          offered me  forty years in the desert  o house of israel             yes  you lifted up moloch s tent and the star of the god rephan            the images which you made in order to worship them           and i will remove you beyond babylon               our forefathers had the tent of the testimony in the desert           built as he who spoke to moses had instructed him to make it          in imitation of the model which he had seen             that tent was bequeathed to the next generation of our forefathers           under joshua they brought it with them when they were taking          possession of the land of the gentile nations  whom god drove          out before them   so it continued till david s time             david obtained favour with god  and asked leave to provide          a dwelling place for the god of jacob             but it was solomon who built a house for him             yet the most high does not dwell in buildings erected by men s hands           but  as the prophet declares               the sky is my throne  and earth is the footstool for my feet           what kind of house will you build for me  says the lord           or what resting place shall i have             did not my hand form this universe               o stiff necked men  uncircumcised in heart and ears           you also are continually at strife with the holy spirit            just as your forefathers were             which of the prophets did not your forefathers persecute           yes  they killed those who announced beforehand the advent          of the righteous one  whose betrayers and murderers you          have now become              you who received the law given through angels  and yet have          not obeyed it              as they listened to these words  they became infuriated          and gnashed their teeth at him             but  full of the holy spirit and looking up to heaven  stephen saw          the glory of god  and jesus standing at god s right hand              i can see heaven wide open   he said   and the son of man          standing at god s right hand              upon this  with a loud outcry they stopped their ears           rushed upon stephen in a body             dragged him out of the city  and stoned him  the witnesses          throwing off their outer garments and giving them into the care          of a young man called saul             so they stoned stephen  while he prayed   lord jesus           receive my spirit              then  rising on his knees  he cried aloud   lord  do not reckon          this sin against them    and with these words he fell asleep             and saul fully approved of his murder   at this time a great          persecution broke out against the church in jerusalem           and all except the apostles were scattered throughout          judaea and samaria             a party of devout men  however  buried stephen  and made loud          lamentation over him             but saul cruelly harassed the church   he went into house          after house  and  dragging off both men and women           threw them into prison             those  however  who were scattered abroad went from place          to place spreading the good news of god s message             while philip went down to the city of samaria and proclaimed          christ there             crowds of people  with one accord  gave attention to what          they heard from him  listening  and witnessing the signs          which he did             for  with a loud cry  foul spirits came out of many possessed by them           and many paralytics and lame persons were restored to health             and there was great joy in that city             now for some time past there had been a man named simon living there           who had been practising magic and astonishing the samaritans           pretending that he was more than human             to him people of all classes paid attention  declaring   this man          is the power of god  known as the great power              his influence over them arose from their having been           for a long time  bewildered by his sorceries             but when philip began to tell the good news about the kingdom          of god and about the name of jesus christ  and they embraced          the faith  they were baptized  men and women alike             simon himself also believed  and after being baptized remained          in close attendance on philip  and was full of amazement          at seeing such signs and such great miracles performed             when the apostles in jerusalem heard that the samaritans had          accepted god s message  they sent peter and john to visit them             they  when they came down  prayed for them that they might          receive the holy spirit             for he had not as yet fallen upon any of them   they had only          been baptized into the name of the lord jesus             then the apostles placed their hands upon them  and they          received the holy spirit             when  however  simon saw that it was through the laying          on of the apostles  hands that the spirit was bestowed           he offered them money              give me too   he said   that power  so that every one on whom          i place my hands will receive the holy spirit               perish your money and yourself   replied peter   because you          have imagined that you can obtain god s free gift with money             no part or lot have you in this matter  for your heart is not          right in god s sight             repent  therefore  of this wickedness of yours  and pray          to the lord  in the hope that the purpose which is in your          heart may perhaps be forgiven you             for i perceive that you have fallen into the bitterest          bondage of unrighteousness               pray  both of you  to the lord for me   answered simon            that nothing of what you have said may come upon me              so the apostles  after giving a solemn charge and delivering          the lord s message  travelled back to jerusalem  making known          the good news also in many of the samaritan villages             and an angel of the lord said to philip   rise and proceed          south to the road that runs down from jerusalem to gaza           crossing the desert              upon this he rose and went   now  as it happened  an ethiopian          eunuch who was in a position of high authority with candace           queen of the ethiopians  as her treasurer  had visited          jerusalem to worship there             and was now on his way home  and as he sat in his chariot          he was reading the prophet isaiah             then the spirit said to philip   go and enter that chariot              so philip ran up and heard the eunuch reading the prophet isaiah            do you understand what you are reading   he asked              why  how can i   replied the eunuch   unless some one explains          it to me    and he earnestly invited philip to come up          and sit with him             the passage of scripture which he was reading was this            like a sheep he was led to slaughter  and just as a lamb          before its shearer is dumb so he opened not his mouth             in his humiliation justice was denied him   who will make          known his posterity   for he is destroyed from among men               pray  of whom is the prophet speaking   inquired the eunuch            of himself or of some one else              then philip began to speak  and  commencing with that same          portion of scripture  told him the good news about jesus             so they proceeded on their way till they came to some water           and the eunuch exclaimed   see  here is water  what is there          to prevent my being baptized                            so he stopped the chariot  and both of them  philip and the eunuch            went down into the water  and philip baptized him             but no sooner had they come up out of the water than the spirit of          the lord caught philip away  and the eunuch did not see him again           with a glad heart he resumed his journey             but philip found himself at ashdod   then visiting town          after town he everywhere made known the good news until          he reached caesarea             now saul  whose every breath was a threat of destruction          for the disciples of the lord             went to the high priest and begged from him letters addressed          to the synagogues in damascus  in order that if he found          any believers there  either men or women  he might bring them          in chains to jerusalem             but on the journey  as he was getting near damascus           suddenly there flashed round him a light from heaven             and falling to the ground he heard a voice which said to him            saul  saul  why are you persecuting me               who art thou  lord   he asked    i am jesus  whom you          are persecuting   was the reply              but rise and go to the city  and you will be told what you          are to do             meanwhile the men who travelled with saul were standing dumb          with amazement  hearing a sound  but seeing no one             then he rose from the ground  but when he had opened his eyes           he could not see  and they led him by the arm and brought          him to damascus             and for two days he remained without sight  and did not eat          or drink anything             now in damascus there was a disciple of the name of ananias           the lord spoke to him in a vision  saying   ananias     i am          here  lord   he answered              rise   said the lord   and go to straight street  and inquire          at the house of judas for a man called saul  from tarsus           for he is actually praying             he has seen a man called ananias come and lay his hands upon          him so that he may recover his sight               lord   answered ananias   i have heard about that man from many           and i have heard of the great mischief he has done to thy          people in jerusalem             and here he is authorized by the high priests to arrest all          who call upon thy name               go   replied the lord   he is a chosen instrument of mine          to carry my name to the gentiles and to kings and to the          descendants of israel             for i will let him know the great sufferings which he must          pass through for my sake              so ananias went and entered the house  and  laying his two          hands upon saul  said   saul  brother  the lord  even jesus          who appeared to you on your journey  has sent me  that you          may recover your sight and be filled with the holy spirit              instantly there dropped from his eyes what seemed to be scales           and he could see once more   upon this he rose and received baptism             after which he took food and regained his strength           then he remained some little time with the disciples in damascus             and in the synagogues he began at once to proclaim jesus          as the son of god             and his hearers were all amazed  and began to ask one another            is not this the man who in jerusalem tried to exterminate          those who called upon that name  and came here on purpose          to carry them off in chains to the high priests              saul  however  gained more and more influence  and as for          the jews living in damascus  he bewildered them with his proofs          that jesus is the christ             at length the jews plotted to kill saul             but information of their intention was given to him           they even watched the gates  day and night  in order          to murder him             but his disciples took him by night and let him down through          the wall  lowering him in a hamper             so he came to jerusalem and made several attempts to associate          with the disciples  but they were all afraid of him           being in doubt as to whether he himself was a disciple             barnabas  however  came to his assistance   he brought saul          to the apostles  and related to them how  on his journey           he had seen the lord  and that the lord had spoken to him           and how in damascus he had fearlessly taught in the name of jesus             henceforth saul was one of them  going in and out of the city             and speaking fearlessly in the name of the lord   and he often          talked with the hellenists and had discussions with them             but they kept trying to take his life   on learning this           the brethren brought him down to caesarea  and then sent him          by sea to tarsus             the church  however  throughout the whole of judaea  galilee          and samaria  had peace and was spiritually built up           and grew in numbers  living in the fear of the lord and receiving          encouragement from the holy spirit             now peter  as he went to town after town  came down also to god s          people at lud             there he found a man of the name of aeneas  who for eight          years had kept his bed  through being paralysed             peter said to him   aeneas  jesus christ cures you           rise and make your own bed    he at once rose to his feet             and all the people of lud and sharon saw him  and they turned          to the lord             among the disciples at jaffa was a woman called tabitha           or  as the name may be translated   dorcas   her life was          wholly devoted to the good and charitable actions which she          was constantly doing             but  as it happened  just at that time she was taken ill and died           after washing her body they laid it out in a room upstairs             lud  however  being near jaffa  the disciples  who had heard          that peter was at lud  sent two men to him with an urgent          request that he would come across to them without delay             so peter rose and went with them   on his arrival they took          him upstairs  and the widow women all came and stood by his side           weeping and showing him the underclothing and cloaks and          garments of all kinds which dorcas used to make while she          was still with them             peter  however  putting every one out of the room           knelt down and prayed  and then turning to the body           he said   tabitha  rise    dorcas at once opened her eyes           and seeing peter  sat up             then  giving her his hand  he raised her to her feet and           calling to him god s people and the widows  he     gave her          back to them alive             this incident became known throughout jaffa  and many believed          in the lord             and peter remained for a considerable time at jaffa           staying at the house of a man called simon  a tanner             now a captain of the italian regiment  named cornelius           was quartered at caesarea             he was religious and god fearing  and so was every member          of his household   he was also liberal in his charities          to the people  and continually offered prayer to god             about three o clock one afternoon he had a vision           and distinctly saw an angel of god enter his house  who called          him by name  saying   cornelius              looking steadily at him  and being much alarmed  he said            what do you want  sir     your prayers and charities            he replied   have gone up and have been recorded before god             and now send to jaffa and fetch simon  surnamed peter             he is staying as a guest with simon  a tanner  who has a house          close to the sea              so when the angel who had been speaking to him was gone           cornelius called two of his servants and a god fearing soldier          who was in constant attendance on him             and  after telling them everything  he sent them to jaffa             the next day  while they were still on their journey          and were getting near the town  about noon peter went up          on the house top to pray             he had become unusually hungry and wished for food  but  while they          were preparing it  he fell into a trance             the sky had opened to his view  and what seemed to be an enormous          sail was descending  being let down to the earth by ropes          at the four corners             in it were all kinds of quadrupeds  reptiles and birds             and a voice came to him which said   rise  peter  kill and eat               on no account  lord   he replied   for i have never yet eaten          anything unholy and impure              again a second time a voice was heard which said   what god          has purified  you must not regard as unholy              this was said three times  and immediately the sail was drawn          up out of sight             while peter was greatly perplexed as to the meaning of the vision          which he had seen  just then the men sent by cornelius           having by inquiry found out simon s house             had come to the door and had called the servant  and were asking            is simon  surnamed peter  staying here              and peter was still earnestly thinking over the vision           when the spirit said to him   three men are now inquiring for you             rise  go down  and go with them without any misgivings           for it is i who have sent them to you              so peter went down and said to the men   i am the simon you          are inquiring for   what is the reason of your coming              their reply was   cornelius  a captain  an upright and          god fearing man  of whom the whole jewish nation speaks well           has been divinely instructed by a holy angel to send for you          to come to his house and listen to what you have to say              upon hearing this  peter invited them in  and gave them a lodging           the next day he set out with them  some of the brethren          from jaffa going with him             and the day after that they reached caesarea   there cornelius          was awaiting their arrival  and had invited all his relatives          and intimate friends to be present             when peter entered the house  cornelius met him  and threw          himself at his feet to do him homage             but peter lifted him up    stand up   he said   i myself          also am but a man              so peter went in and conversed with him  and found a          large company assembled             he said to them   you know better than most that a jew is          strictly forbidden to associate with a gentile or visit him           but god has taught me to call no one unholy or unclean             so for this reason  when sent for  i came without raising          any objection   i therefore ask why you sent for me               just at this hour  three days ago   replied cornelius   i was          offering afternoon prayer in my house  when suddenly a man          in shining raiment stood in front of me             who said    cornelius  your prayer has been heard  and your          charities have been put on record before god             send therefore to jaffa  and invite simon  surnamed peter           to come here   he is staying as a guest in the house of simon           a tanner  close to the sea               immediately  therefore  i sent to you  and i thank you heartily          for having come   that is why all of us are now assembled here          in god s presence  to listen to what the lord has commanded          you to say              then peter began to speak    i clearly see   he said            that god makes no distinctions between one man and another             but that in every nation those who fear him and live good lives          are acceptable to him             the message which he sent to the descendants of israel  when he          announced the good news of peace through jesus christ  he is          lord of all  that message you cannot but know             the story  i mean  which has spread through the length and          breadth of judaea  beginning in galilee after the baptism          which john proclaimed             it tells how god anointed jesus of nazareth with the holy spirit          and with power  so that he went about everywhere doing acts          of kindness  and curing all who were being continually          oppressed by the devil  for god was with jesus              and we are witnesses as to all that he did both in the country          of the jews and in jerusalem   but they even put him          to death  by crucifixion             that same jesus god raised to life on the third day           and permitted him to appear unmistakably             not to all the people  but to witnesses  men previously chosen          by god  namely  to us  who ate and drank with him after he          rose from the dead             and he has commanded us to preach to the people and solemnly          declare that this is he who has been appointed by god to be          the judge of the living and the dead             to him all the prophets bear witness  and testify that through          his name all who believe in him receive the forgiveness          of their sins              while peter was speaking these words  the holy spirit fell          on all who were listening to the message             and all the jewish believers who had come with peter were          astonished that on the gentiles also the gift of the holy spirit          was poured out             for they heard them speaking in tongues and extolling the majesty          of god   then peter said              can any one forbid the use of water  and object to these persons          being baptized  men who have received the holy spirit just          as we did              and he directed that they should be baptized in the name          of jesus christ   then they begged him to remain with them          for a time             now the apostles  and the brethren in various parts of judaea           heard that the gentiles also had received god s message             and  when peter returned to jerusalem  the champions of          circumcision found fault with him              you went into the houses of men who are not jews   they said            and you ate with them              peter  however  explained the whole matter to them          from the beginning              while i was in the town of jaffa  offering prayer   he said            in a trance i saw a vision   there descended what seemed          to be an enormous sail  being let down from the sky by ropes          at the four corners  and it came close to me             fixing my eyes on it  i examined it closely  and saw various          kinds of quadrupeds  wild beasts  reptiles and birds             i also heard a voice saying to me    rise  peter  kill and eat                on no account  lord   i replied   for nothing unholy or impure          has ever gone into my mouth               but a voice answered  speaking a second time from the sky             what god has purified  you must not regard as unholy               this was said three times  and then everything was drawn up          again out of sight              now at that very moment three men came to the house where we were           having been sent from caesarea to find me             and the spirit told me to accompany them without any misgivings           there also went with me these six brethren who are now present           and we reached the centurion s house             then he described to us how he had seen the angel come and enter          his house and say    send to jaffa and fetch simon  surnamed peter             he will teach you truths by which you and all your family          will be saved                and   said peter   no sooner had i begun to speak than          the holy spirit fell upon them  just as he fell upon us          at the first             then i remembered the lord s words  how he used to say             john baptized with water  but you shall be baptized          in the holy spirit               if therefore god gave them the same gift as he gave us when we          first believed on the lord jesus christ  why  who was i          to be able to thwart god              this statement of peter s silenced his opponents   they extolled          the goodness of god  and said   so  then  to the gentiles          also god has given the repentance which leads to life              those  however  who had been driven in various directions          by the persecution which broke out on account of stephen made          their way to phoenicia  cyprus and antioch  delivering the message          to none but jews             but some of them were cyprians and cyrenaeans  who  on coming          to antioch  spoke to the greeks also and told them the good news          concerning the lord jesus             the power of the lord was with them  and there were a vast          number who believed and turned to the lord             when tidings of this reached the ears of the church in jerusalem           they sent barnabas as far as antioch             on getting there he was delighted to see the grace which          god had bestowed  and he encouraged them all to remain           with fixed resolve  faithful to the lord             for he was a good man  and was full of the holy spirit and of faith           and the number of believers in the lord greatly increased             then barnabas paid a visit to tarsus to try to find saul             he succeeded  and brought him to antioch  and for a whole year          they attended the meetings of the church  and taught a large          number of people   and it was in antioch that the disciples          first received the name of  christians              at that time certain prophets came down from jerusalem to antioch             one of whom  named agabus  being instructed by the spirit           publicly predicted the speedy coming of a great famine          throughout the world    it came in the reign of claudius              so the disciples decided to send relief  every one in proportion          to his means  to the brethren living in judaea             this they did  forwarding their contributions to the elders          by barnabas and saul             now  about that time  king herod arrested certain members          of the church  in order to ill treat them             and james  john s brother  he beheaded             finding that this gratified the jews  he proceeded to seize          peter also  these being the days of unleavened bread             he had him arrested and lodged in jail  handing him over to          the care of sixteen soldiers  and intended after the passover          to bring him out again to the people             so peter was kept in prison  but long and fervent prayer was          offered to god by the church on his behalf             now when herod was on the point of taking him out of prison           that very night peter was asleep between two soldiers           bound with two chains  and guards were on duty outside the door             suddenly an angel of the lord stood by him  and a light shone          in the cell  and  striking peter on the side  he woke him          and said   rise quickly    instantly the chains dropped          off his wrists              fasten your girdle   said the angel   and tie on your sandals            he did so   then the angel said   throw your cloak round you           and follow me              so peter went out  following him  yet could not believe          that what the angel was doing was real  but supposed that          he saw a vision             and passing through the first ward and the second  they came          to the iron gate leading into the city   this opened to them          of itself  and  going out  they passed on through one of          the streets  and then suddenly the angel left him             peter coming to himself said   now i know for certain that the lord          has sent his angel and has rescued me from the power of herod          and from all that the jewish people were anticipating              so  after thinking things over  he went to the house of mary           the mother of john surnamed mark  where a large number          of people were assembled  praying             when he knocked at the wicket in the door  a maidservant named          rhoda came to answer the knock             and recognizing peter s voice  for very joy she did not open          the door  but ran in and told them that peter was standing there              you are mad   they said   but she strenuously maintained          that it was true    it is his guardian angel   they said             meanwhile peter went on knocking  until at last they opened the door          and saw that it was really he  and were filled with amazement             but he motioned with his hand for silence  and then described          to them how the lord had brought him out of the prison            tell all this to james and the brethren   he added           then he left them  and went to another place             when morning came  there was no little commotion among the soldiers           as to what could possibly have become of peter             and when herod had had him searched for and could not find him           after sharply questioning the guards he ordered them away          to execution   he then went down from judaea to caesarea          and remained there             now the people of tyre and sidon had incurred herod s          violent displeasure   so they sent a large deputation to wait on him           and having secured the good will of blastus  his treasurer           they begged the king to be friendly with them again           because their country was dependent on his for its food supply             so  on an appointed day  herod  having arrayed himself in royal robes           took his seat on the tribunal  and was haranguing them             and the assembled people kept shouting   it is the voice of a god           and not of a man              instantly an angel of the lord struck him  because he had not          given the glory to god  and being eaten up by worms  he died             but god s message prospered  and converts were multiplied             and barnabas and saul returned from jerusalem  having discharged          their mission  and they brought with them john  surnamed mark             now there were in antioch  in the church there  as prophets          and teachers  barnabas  symeon surnamed  the black            lucius the cyrenaean  manaen  who was herod the tetrarch s          foster brother   and saul             while they were worshipping the lord and fasting           the holy spirit said   set apart for me  now at once           barnabas and saul  for the work to which i have called them              so  after fasting and prayer and the laying on of hands           they let them go             they therefore  being thus sent out by the holy spirit           went down to seleuceia  and from there sailed to cyprus             having reached salamis  they began to announce god s message          in the synagogues of the jews   and they had john          as their assistant             when they had gone through the whole length of the island          as far as paphos  they there met with a jewish magician          and false prophet  bar jesus by name             who was a friend of the proconsul sergius paulus           the proconsul was a man of keen intelligence   he sent          for barnabas and saul  and asked to be told god s message             but elymas  or  the magician   for such is the meaning of the name           opposed them  and tried to prevent the proconsul from          accepting the faith             then saul  who is also called paul  was filled with the          holy spirit  and  fixing his eyes on elymas             said   you who are full of every kind of craftiness and          unscrupulous cunning  you son of the devil and foe to all that          is right  will you never cease to misrepresent the straight          paths of the lord             the lord s hand is now upon you  and you will be blind for a time          and unable to see the light of day    instantly there fell          upon him a mist and a darkness  and  as he walked about           he begged people to lead him by the hand             then the proconsul  seeing what had happened  believed  being struck          with amazement at the teaching of the lord             from paphos  paul and his party put out to sea and sailed          to perga in pamphylia   john  however  left them and          returned to jerusalem             but they themselves  passing through from perga  came to          antioch in pisidia   here  on the sabbath day  they went          into the synagogue and sat down             after the reading of the law and the prophets  the wardens          of the synagogue sent word to them    brethren   they said            if you have anything encouraging to say to the people  speak              so paul rose  and motioning with his hand for silence  said            israelites  and you others who fear god  pay attention to me             the god of this people of israel chose our forefathers           and made the people great during their stay in egypt           until with wondrous power he brought them out from that land             for a period of about forty years  he fed them  like a nurse           in the desert             then  after overthrowing seven nations in the land of canaan  he          divided that country among them as their inheritance for about          four hundred and fifty years             and afterwards he gave them judges down to the time of          the prophet samuel             next they asked for a king  and god gave them saul the son          of kish  a benjamite  who reigned forty years             after removing him  he raised up david to be their king           to whom he also bore witness when he said    i have found david          the son of jesse  a man i love  who will obey all my commands               it is from among david s descendants that god  in fulfilment          of his promise  has raised up a saviour for israel  even jesus             before the coming of jesus  john had proclaimed to all the people          of israel a baptism of repentance             but john  towards the end of his career  repeatedly asked          the people    what do you suppose me to be   i am not the christ           but there is one coming after me whose sandal i am not          worthy to unfasten               brethren  descendants of the family of abraham  and all among          you who fear god  to us has this message of salvation been sent             for the people of jerusalem and their rulers  by the judgement          they pronounced on jesus  have actually fulfilled the predictions          of the prophets which are read sabbath after sabbath           through ignorance of those predictions and of him             without having found him guilty of any capital offence they          urged pilate to have him put to death             and when they had carried out everything which had been written          about him  they took him down from the cross and laid him          in a tomb              but god raised him from the dead             and  after a few days  he appeared to the people who had gone          up with him from galilee to jerusalem and are now witnesses          concerning him to the jews             and we bring you the good news about the promise made          to our forefathers             that god has amply fulfilled it to our children in raising up jesus           as it is also written in the second psalm   thou art my son           to day i have become thy father              and as to his having raised him from among the dead  never again          to be in the position of one soon to return to decay           he speaks thus    i will give you the holy and trustworthy          promises made to david              because in another psalm also he says   thou wilt not give up          thy holy one to undergo decay              for david  after having been useful to his own generation          in accordance with god s purpose  did fall asleep  was gathered          to his forefathers  and did undergo decay             but he whom god raised to life underwent no decay              understand therefore  brethren  that through this jesus          forgiveness of sins is announced to you             and in him every believer is absolved from all offences           from which you could not be absolved under the law of moses             beware  then  lest what is spoken in the prophets should come          true of you              behold  you despisers  be astonished and perish  because i am          carrying on a work in your time  a work which you will utterly          refuse to believe  though it be fully declared to you               as paul and barnabas were leaving the synagogue  the people          earnestly begged to have all this repeated to them on          the following sabbath             and  when the congregation had broken up  many of the jews          and of the devout converts from heathenism continued with paul          and barnabas  who talked to them and urged them to hold fast          to the grace of god             on the next sabbath almost the whole population of the city          came together to hear the lord s message             seeing the crowds  the jews  filled with angry jealousy           opposed paul s statements and abused him             then  throwing off all reserve  paul and barnabas said            we were bound to proclaim god s message to you first           but since you spurn it and judge yourselves to be unworthy          of the life of the ages  well  we turn to the gentiles             for such is the lord s command to us     i have placed thee   he says          of christ   as a light to the gentiles  in order that thou mayest          be a saviour as far as the remotest parts of the earth               the gentiles listened with delight and extolled the lord s message           and all who were pre destined to the life of the ages believed             so the lord s message spread through the whole district             but the jews influenced the gentlewomen of rank who worshipped          with them  and also the leading men in the city  and stirred          up persecution against paul and barnabas and drove them out          of the district             but they shook off the dust from their feet as a protest          against them and came to iconium             and as for the disciples  they were more and more filled          with joy and with the holy spirit             at iconium the apostles went together to the jewish synagogue          and preached  with the result that a great number both of jews          and greeks believed             but the jews who had refused obedience stirred up the gentiles          and embittered their minds against the brethren             yet paul and barnabas remained there for a considerable time           speaking freely and relying on the lord  while he bore witness          to the message of his grace by permitting signs and marvels          to be done by them             at length the people of the city split into parties  some siding          with the jews and some with the apostles             and when a hostile movement was made by both gentiles and jews           with the sanction of their magistrates  to maltreat and stone them             the apostles  having become aware of it  made their          escape into the lycaonian towns of lystra and derbe           and the neighbouring country             and there they continued to tell the good news             now a man who had no power in his feet used to sit in the streets          of lystra   he had been lame from his birth and had never walked             after this man had listened to one of paul s sermons  the apostle           looking steadily at him and perceiving that he had faith          to be cured             said in a loud voice   stand upright upon your feet              so he sprang up and began to walk about   then the crowds           seeing what paul had done  rent the air with their shouts          in the lycaonian language  saying   the gods have assumed          human form and have come down to us              they called barnabas  zeus   and paul  as being the          principal speaker   hermes              and the priest of zeus  the temple of zeus being at the entrance          to the city  brought bullocks and garlands to the gates           and in company with the crowd was intending to offer          sacrifices to them             but the apostles  barnabas and paul  heard of it  and tearing          their clothes they rushed out into the middle of the crowd           exclaiming   sirs  why are you doing all this             we also are but men  with natures kindred to your own           and we bring you the good news that you are to turn from these          unreal things  to worship the ever living god  the creator          of earth and sky and sea and of everything that is in them             in times gone by he allowed all the nations to go their own ways             and yet by his beneficence he has not left his existence unattested            his beneficence  i mean  in sending you rain from heaven and          fruitful seasons  satisfying your hearts with food and joyfulness              even with words like these they had difficulty in preventing          the thronging crowd from offering sacrifices to them             but now a party of jews came from antioch and iconium  and           having won over the crowd  they stoned paul and dragged him          out of the town  believing him to be dead             when  however  the disciples had collected round him           he rose and went back into the town   the next day he went          with barnabas to derbe             and  after proclaiming the good news to the people there          and gaining a large number of converts  they retraced their          steps to lystra  iconium  and antioch             everywhere they strengthened the disciples by encouraging          them to hold fast to the faith  and warned them saying            it is through many afflictions that we must make our way          into the kingdom of god              and in every church  after prayer and fasting  they selected          elders by show of hands  and commended them to the lord          on whom their faith rested             then passing through pisidia they came into pamphylia             and after telling the message at perga they came down to attaleia             thence they sailed to antioch  where they had previously been          commended to the grace of god in connexion with the work          which they had now completed             upon their arrival they called the church together and proceeded          to report in detail all that god  working with them  had done           and how he had opened for the gentiles the door of faith             and they remained a considerable time in antioch with the disciples             but certain persons who had come down from judaea tried          to convince the brethren  saying   unless you are circumcised          in accordance with the mosaic custom  you cannot be saved              between these new comers and paul and barnabas there was          no little disagreement and controversy  until at last it          was decided that paul and barnabas and some other brethren          should go up to consult the apostles and elders in jerusalem          on this matter             so they set out  being accompanied for a short distance          by some other members of the church  and as they passed          through phoenicia and samaria  they told the whole story          of the conversion of the gentiles and inspired all the brethren          with great joy             upon their arrival in jerusalem they were cordially received          by the church  the apostles  and the elders  and they reported          in detail all that god  working with them  had done             but certain men who had belonged to the sect of the pharisees          but were now believers  stood up in the assembly  and said            yes  gentile believers ought to be circumcised and be ordered          to keep the law of moses              then the apostles and elders met to consider the matter             and after there had been a long discussion peter rose to his feet            it is within your own knowledge   he said   that god originally          made choice among you that from my lips the gentiles were          to hear the message of the good news  and believe             and god  who knows all hearts  gave his testimony in their favour          by bestowing the holy spirit on them just as he did on us             and he made no difference between us and them  in that he          cleansed their hearts by their faith             now  therefore  why try an experiment upon god  by laying          on the necks of these disciples a yoke which neither our          forefathers nor we have been able to bear             on the contrary  we believe that it is by the grace of the          lord jesus that we  as well as they  shall be saved              then the whole assembly remained silent while they listened          to the statement made by paul and barnabas as to all          the signs and marvels that god had done among the gentiles          through their instrumentality             when they had finished speaking  james said   brethren           listen to me             symeon has related how god first looked graciously on the gentiles          to take from among them a people to be called by his name             and this is in harmony with the language of the prophets  which says                afterwards i will return  and will rebuild david s fallen tent           its ruins i will rebuild  and i will set it up again             in order that the rest of mankind may earnestly seek the lord            even all the nations which are called by my name              says the lord  who has been making these things known from          ages long past               my judgement  therefore  is against inflicting unexpected          annoyance on those of the gentiles who are turning to god             yet let us send them written instructions to abstain from          things polluted by connexion with idolatry  from fornication           from meat killed by strangling  and from blood             for moses from the earliest times has had his preachers          in every town  being read  as he is  sabbath after sabbath           in the various synagogues              thereupon it was decided by the apostles and elders           with the approval of the whole church  to choose suitable          persons from among themselves and send them to antioch           with paul and barnabas   judas  called bar sabbas  and silas           leading men among the brethren  were selected             and they took with them the following letter    the apostles          and the elder brethren send greeting to the gentile brethren          throughout antioch  syria and cilicia             as we have been informed that certain persons who have gone          out from among us have disturbed you by their teaching          and have unsettled your minds  without having received any          such instructions from us             we have unanimously decided to select certain men and send them          to you in company with our dear friends barnabas and paul             who have endangered their very lives for the sake of our          lord jesus christ             we have therefore sent judas and silas  who are themselves          bringing you the same message by word of mouth             for it has seemed good to the holy spirit and to us to lay          upon you no burden heavier than these necessary requirements              you must abstain from things sacrificed to idols           from blood  from things strangled  and from fornication           keep yourselves clear of these things  and it will be well          with you   farewell              they  therefore  having been solemnly sent  came down          to antioch  where they called together the whole assembly          and delivered the letter             the people read it  and were delighted with the comfort          it brought them             and judas and silas  being themselves also prophets           gave them a long and encouraging talk  and strengthened them          in the faith             after spending some time there they received an affectionate          farewell from the brethren to return to those who had sent them                           but paul and barnabas remained in antioch  teaching and           in company with many others  telling the good news of          the lord s message             after a while paul said to barnabas   suppose we now revisit          the brethren in the various towns in which we have made known          the lord s message  to see whether they are prospering              barnabas  however  was bent on taking with them john           whose other name was mark             while paul deemed it undesirable to have as their companion          one who had deserted them in pamphylia and had not gone          on with them to the work             so there arose a serious disagreement between them  which resulted          in their parting from one another  barnabas taking mark          and setting sail for cyprus             but paul chose silas as his travelling companion  and set out           after being commended by the brethren to the grace of the lord             and he passed through syria and cilicia  strengthening the churches             he also came to derbe and to lystra   at lystra he found          a disciple  timothy by name  the son of a christian jewess           though he had a greek father             timothy was well spoken of by the brethren at lystra and iconium             and paul desiring that he should accompany him on his journey           took him and circumcised him on account of the jews in those parts           for they all knew that his father was a greek             as they journeyed on from town to town  they handed to the brethren          for their observance the decisions which had been arrived          at by the apostles and elders in jerusalem             so the churches went on gaining a stronger faith and growing          in numbers from day to day             then paul and his companions passed through phrygia and galatia           having been forbidden by the holy spirit to proclaim the message          in the province of asia             when they reached the frontier of mysia  they were about to          enter bithynia  but the spirit of jesus would not permit this             so  passing along mysia  they came to troas             here  one night  paul saw a vision   there was a macedonian          who was standing  entreating him and saying   come over into          macedonia and help us              so when he had seen the vision  we immediately looked          out for an opportunity of passing on into macedonia           confidently inferring that god had called us to proclaim          the good news to the people there             accordingly we put out to sea from troas  and ran a straight          course to samothrace   the next day we came to neapolis             and thence to philippi  which is a city in macedonia           the first in its district  a roman colony   and there we          stayed some little time             on the sabbath we went beyond the city gate to the riverside           where we had reason to believe that there was a place for prayer           and sitting down we talked with the women who had come together             among our hearers was one named lydia  a dealer in purple goods           she belonged to the city of thyateira  and was a worshipper          of the true god   the lord opened her heart  so that she gave          attention to what paul was saying             when she and her household had been baptized  she urged us           saying   if in your judgement i am a believer in the lord           come and stay at my house    and she made us go there             one day  as we were on our way to the place of prayer  a slave          girl met us who claimed to be inspired and was accustomed          to bring her owners large profits by telling fortunes             she kept following close behind paul and the rest of us           crying aloud   these men are the bondservants of the most high god           and are proclaiming to you the way of salvation              this she persisted in for a considerable time  until paul           wearied out  turned round and said to the spirit   i command          you in the name of jesus christ to come out of her            and it came out immediately             but when her owners saw that their hopes of gain were gone           they seized paul and silas and dragged them off to the magistrates          in the public square             then they brought them before the praetors    these men            they said   are creating a great disturbance in our city             they are jews  and are teaching customs which we  as romans           are not permitted to adopt or practise              the crowd  too  joined in the outcry against them  till at length          the praetors ordered them to be stripped and beaten with rods             and  after severely flogging them  they threw them into jail          and bade the jailer keep them safely             he  having received an order like that  lodged them in the          inner prison  and secured their feet in the stocks             about midnight paul and silas were praying and singing hymns          to god  and the prisoners were listening to them             when suddenly there was such a violent shock of earthquake          that the prison shook to its foundations   instantly the doors          all flew open  and the chains fell off from every prisoner             starting up from sleep and seeing the doors of the jail wide open           the jailer drew his sword and was on the point of killing himself           supposing that the prisoners had escaped             but paul shouted loudly to him  saying   do yourself no injury           we are all here             then  calling for lights  he sprang in and fell trembling          at the feet of paul and silas             and  bringing them out of the prison  he exclaimed   o sirs           what must i do to be saved               believe on the lord jesus   they replied   and both you          and your household will be saved              and they told the lord s message to him as well as to all          who were in his house             then he took them  even at that time of night  washed their wounds           and he and all his household were immediately baptized             and bringing the apostles up into his house  he spread a meal          for them  and was filled with gladness  with his whole household           his faith resting on god             in the morning the praetors sent their lictors with the order            release those men              so the jailer brought paul word  saying   the praetors have sent          orders for you to be released   now therefore you can go           and proceed on your way in peace              but paul said to them   after cruelly beating us in public           without trial  roman citizens though we are  they have thrown us          into prison  and are they now going to send us away privately           no  indeed   let them come in person and fetch us out              this answer the lictors took back to the praetors  who were alarmed          when they were told that paul and silas were roman citizens             accordingly they came and apologized to them  and  bringing them out           asked them to leave the city             then paul and silas  having come out of the prison  went to          lydia s house  and  after seeing the brethren and encouraging them           they left philippi             then  passing through amphipolis and apollonia  they went          to thessalonica   here there was a synagogue of the jews             paul  following his usual custom  betook himself to it           and for three successive sabbaths reasoned with them          from the scriptures             which he clearly explained  pointing out that it had been          necessary for the christ to suffer and rise again from the dead           and insisting   the jesus whom i am announcing to you          is the christ              some of the people were won over  and attached themselves          to paul and silas  including many god fearing greeks and not          a few gentlewomen of high rank             but the jealousy of the jews was aroused  and  calling to          their aid some ill conditioned and idle fellows  they got          together a riotous mob and filled the city with uproar           they then attacked the house of jason and searched for paul          and silas  to bring them out before the assembly of people             but  failing to find them  they dragged jason and some of the other          brethren before the magistrates of the city  loudly accusing them            these men   they said   who have raised a tumult throughout          the empire  have come here also             jason has received them into his house  and they all set caesar s          authority at defiance  declaring that there is another emperor            one called jesus              great was the excitement among the crowd  and among the magistrates          of the city  when they heard these charges             they required jason and the rest to find substantial bail           and after that they let them go             the brethren at once sent paul and silas away by night to beroea           and they  on their arrival  went to the synagogue of the jews             the jews at beroea were of a nobler disposition than those          in thessalonica  for they very readily received the message           and day after day searched the scriptures to see whether it          was as paul stated             as the result many of them became believers  and so did not          a few of the greeks  gentlewomen of good position  and men             as soon  however  as the jews of thessalonica learnt          that god s message had been proclaimed by paul at beroea           they came there also  and incited the mob to a riot             then the brethren promptly sent paul down to the sea coast           but silas and timothy remained behind             those who were caring for paul s safety went with him as far          as athens  and then left him  taking a message from him to silas          and timothy  asking them to join him as speedily as possible             while paul was waiting for them in athens  his spirit was stirred          within him when he noticed that the city was full of idols             so he had discussions in the synagogue with the jews and          the other worshippers  and in the market place  day after day           with those whom he happened to meet             a few of the epicurean and stoic philosophers also encountered him           some of them asked   what has this beggarly babbler to say             his business   said others   seems to be to cry up          some foreign gods    this was because he had been telling          the good news of jesus and the resurrection             then they took him and brought him up to the areopagus  asking him            may we be told what this new teaching of yours is             for the things you are saying sound strange to us           we should therefore like to be told exactly what they mean               for all the athenians and their foreign visitors used to devote          their whole leisure to telling or hearing about something new              so paul  taking his stand in the centre of the areopagus           spoke as follows    men of athens  i perceive that you are          in every respect remarkably religious             for as i passed along and observed the things you worship  i found          also an altar bearing the inscription   to an unknown god             the being  therefore  whom you  without knowing him  revere           him i now proclaim to you             god who made the universe and everything in it  he  being lord          of heaven and earth  does not dwell in sanctuaries built by men             nor is he ministered to by human hands  as though he needed anything            but he himself gives to all men life and breath and all things             he caused to spring from one forefather people of every race           for them to live on the whole surface of the earth  and marked          out for them an appointed span of life and the boundaries          of their homes             that they might seek god  if perhaps they could grope for him          and find him   yes  though he is not far from any one of us             for it is in closest union with him that we live and move          and have our being  as in fact some of the poets in repute          among yourselves have said   for we are also his offspring              since then we are god s offspring  we ought not to imagine          that his nature resembles gold or silver or marble  or anything          sculptured by the art and inventive faculty of man             those times of ignorance god viewed with indulgence           but now he commands all men everywhere to repent             seeing that he has appointed a day on which  before long           he will judge the world in righteousness  through the          instrumentality of a man whom he has pre destined to this work           and has made the fact certain to every one by raising him          from the dead              when they heard paul speak of a resurrection of dead men           some began to scoff   but others said   we will hear you          again on that subject              so paul went away from them             a few  however  attached themselves to him and believed           among them being dionysius a member of the council           a gentlewoman named damaris  and some others             after this he left athens and came to corinth             here he found a jew  a native of pontus  of the name of aquila           he and his wife priscilla had recently come from italy          because of claudius s edict expelling all the jews from rome           so paul paid them a visit             and because he was of the same trade  that of tent maker            he lodged with them and worked with them             but  sabbath after sabbath  he preached in the synagogue          and tried to win over both jews and greeks             now at the time when silas and timothy came down from          macedonia  paul was preaching fervently and was solemnly          telling the jews that jesus is the christ             but upon their opposing him with abusive language           he shook his clothes by way of protest  and said to them            your ruin will be upon your own heads   i am not responsible           in future i will go among the gentiles              so he left the place and went to the house of a person          called titius justus  a worshipper of the true god           his house was next door to the synagogue             and crispus  the warden of the synagogue  believed in the lord           and so did all his household  and from time to time many of          the corinthians who heard paul believed and received baptism             and  in a vision by night  the lord said to paul   dismiss          your fears   go on speaking  and do not give up             i am with you  and no one shall attack you to injure you           for i have very many people in this city              so paul remained in corinth for a year and six months           teaching among them the message of god             but when gallio became proconsul of greece  the jews with one accord          made a dead set at paul  and brought him before the court              this man   they said   is inducing people to offer unlawful          worship to god              but  when paul was about to begin his defence  gallio said          to the jews   if it had been some wrongful act or piece of          cunning knavery i might reasonably have listened to you jews             but since these are questions about words and names and your law           you yourselves must see to them   i refuse to be a judge          in such matters              so he ordered them out of court             then the people all set upon sosthenes  the warden of          the synagogue  and beat him severely in front of the court           gallio did not concern himself in the least about this             after remaining a considerable time longer in corinth  paul took          leave of the brethren and set sail for syria  and priscilla          and aquila were with him   he had shaved his head at cenchreae           because he was bound by a vow             they put in at ephesus  and there paul left his companions behind           as for himself  he went to the synagogue and had a discussion          with the jews             when they asked him to remain longer he did not consent             but took leave of them with the promise   i will return to you           god willing    so he set sail from ephesus             landing at caesarea  he went up to jerusalem and inquired after          the welfare of the church  and then went down to antioch             after spending some time in antioch  paul set out on a tour           visiting the whole of galatia and phrygia in order           and strengthening all the disciples             meanwhile a jew named apollos came to ephesus   he was a native          of alexandria  a man of great learning and well versed          in the scriptures             he had been instructed by word of mouth in the way of          the lord  and  being full of burning zeal  he used to speak          and teach accurately the facts about jesus  though he knew          of no baptism but john s             he began to speak boldly in the synagogue  and priscilla          and aquila  after hearing him  took him home and explained          god s way to him more accurately             then  as he had made up his mind to cross over into greece           the brethren wrote to the disciples in corinth begging them          to give him a kindly welcome   upon his arrival he rendered          valuable help to those who through grace had believed             for he powerfully and in public overcame the jews in argument           proving to them from the scriptures that jesus is the christ             during the stay of apollos in corinth  paul  after passing          through the inland districts  came to ephesus  where he found          a few disciples              did you receive the holy spirit when you first believed            he asked them    no   they replied   we did not even hear          that there is a holy spirit               into what then were you baptized   he asked            into john s baptism   they replied              john   he said   administered a baptism of repentance           bidding the people believe on one who was to come after him           namely  on jesus              on hearing this  they were baptized into the name of the lord jesus             and when paul laid his hands upon them  the holy spirit came          on them  and they began to speak in tongues and to prophesy             they numbered in all about twelve men             afterwards he went into the synagogue   there for three months          he continued to preach fearlessly  explaining in words which          carried conviction the truths which concern the kingdom of god             but some grew obstinate in unbelief and spoke evil of the new          faith before all the congregation   so paul left them  and           taking with him those who were disciples  held discussions          daily in tyrannus s lecture hall             this went on for two years  so that all the inhabitants          of the province of asia  jews as well as greeks           heard the lord s message             god also brought about extraordinary miracles through          paul s instrumentality             towels or aprons  for instance  which paul had handled used to be          carried to the sick  and they recovered from their ailments           or the evil spirits left them             but there were also some wandering jewish exorcists who undertook          to invoke the name of jesus over those who had the evil spirits           saying   i command you by that jesus whom paul preaches              there were seven sons of one sceva  a jew of high priestly family           who were doing this              jesus i know   the evil spirit answered   and paul i have          heard of  but who are you              and the man in whom the evil spirit was sprang on two of them           over mastered them both  and treated them with such violence           that they fled from the house stripped of their clothes and wounded             all the people of ephesus  jews as well as greeks  came to know          of this   there was widespread terror  and they began to hold          the name of the lord jesus in high honour             many also of those who believed came confessing without reserve          what their conduct had been             and not a few of those who had practised magical arts brought          their books together and burnt them in the presence of all           the total value was reckoned and found to be        silver coins             thus mightily did the lord s message spread and triumph             when matters had reached this point  paul decided in his own mind          to travel through macedonia and greece  and go to jerusalem            after that   he said   i must also see rome              but he sent two of his assistants  timothy and erastus  to macedonia           while he himself remained for a while in roman asia             now just at that time there arose no small commotion about          the new faith             there was a certain demetrius  a silversmith  who made miniature          silver sanctuaries of diana  a business which brought great          gain to the mechanics in his employ             he called his workmen together  and others who were engaged          in similar trades  and said to them   you men well know          that our prosperity depends on this business of ours             and you see and hear that  not in ephesus only but throughout          almost the whole province of asia  this fellow paul has led          away a vast number of people by inducing them to believe          that they are not gods at all that are made by men s hands             there is danger  therefore  not only that this our trade will          become of no account  but also that the temple of the great          goddess diana will fall into utter disrepute  and that before          long she will be actually deposed from her majestic rank            she who is now worshipped by the whole province of asia           nay  by the whole world              after listening to this harangue  they became furiously angry          and kept calling out   great is the ephesian diana              the riot and uproar spread through the whole city           till at last with one accord they rushed into the theatre           dragging with them gaius and aristarchus  two macedonians          who were fellow travellers with paul             then paul would have liked to go in and address the people           but the disciples would not let him do so             a few of the public officials  too  who were friendly to him           sent repeated messages entreating him not to venture          into the theatre             the people  meanwhile  kept shouting  some one thing and          some another  for the assembly was all uproar and confusion           and the greater part had no idea why they had come together             then some of the people crowded round alexander  whom the jews          had pushed forward  and alexander  motioning with his hand          to get silence  was prepared to make a defence to the people             no sooner  however  did they see that he was a jew  than there arose          from them all one roar of shouting  lasting about two hours            great is the ephesian diana   they said             at length the recorder quieted them down    men of ephesus            he said   who is there of all mankind that needs to be told          that the city of ephesus is the guardian of the temple of          the great diana and of the image which fell down from zeus             these facts  then  being unquestioned  it becomes you to maintain          your self control and not act recklessly             for you have brought these men here  who are neither robbers          of temples nor blasphemers of our goddess             if  however  demetrius and the mechanics who support his          contention have a grievance against any one  there are          assize days and there are proconsuls   let the persons          interested accuse one another             but if you desire anything further  it will have to be settled          in the regular assembly             for in connexion with to day s proceedings there is danger          of our being charged with attempted insurrection  there having          been no real reason for this riot  nor shall we be able          to justify the behaviour of this disorderly mob              with these words he dismissed the assembly             when the uproar had ceased  paul sent for the disciples           and  after speaking words of encouragement to them  he took          his leave  and started for macedonia             passing through those districts he encouraged the disciples          in frequent addresses  and then came into greece  and spent          three months there             the jews having planned to waylay him whenever he might be          on the point of taking ship for syria  he decided to travel          back by way of macedonia             he was accompanied as far as the province of asia by sopater          the beroean  the son of pyrrhus  by the thessalonians           aristarchus and secundus  by gaius of derbe  and timothy           and by the asians  tychicus and trophimus             these brethren had gone on and were waiting for us in the troad             but we ourselves sailed from philippi after the days of          unleavened bread  and five days later joined them in the troad           where we remained for a week             on the first day of the week  when we had met to break bread           paul  who was going away the next morning  was preaching to them           and prolonged his discourse till midnight             now there were a good many lamps in the room upstairs where          we all were             and a youth of the name of eutychus was sitting at the window           this lad  gradually sinking into deep sleep while paul          preached at unusual length  overcome at last by sleep           fell from the second floor and was taken up dead             paul  however  went down  threw himself upon him           and folding him in his arms said   do not be alarmed           his life is still in him              then he went upstairs again  broke bread  and took some food           and after a long conversation which was continued till daybreak           at last he parted from them             they had taken the lad home alive  and were greatly comforted             the rest of us had already gone on board a ship  and now we          set sail for assos  intending to take paul on board there           for so he had arranged  he himself intending to go by land             accordingly  when he met us at assos  we took him on board          and came to mitylene             sailing from there  we arrived the next day off chios           on the next we touched at samos  and on the day          following reached miletus             for paul s plan was to sail past ephesus  so as not to spend much          time in the province of asia  since he was very desirous of being          in jerusalem  if possible  on the day of the harvest festival             from miletus he sent to ephesus for the elders of the church          to come to him             upon their arrival he said to them   you elders well know           from the first day of my setting foot in the province of asia           the kind of life i lived among you the whole time             serving the lord in all humility  and with tears  and amid          trials which came upon me through the plotting of the jews              and that i never shrank from declaring to you anything that          was profitable  or from teaching you in public and in your homes             and urging upon both jews and greeks the necessity of turning          to god and of believing in jesus our lord              and now  impelled by a sense of duty  i am on my way to jerusalem           not knowing what will happen to me there             except that the holy spirit  at town after town  testifies to me          that imprisonment and suffering are awaiting me             but even the sacrifice of my life i count as nothing  if only i          may perfect my earthly course  and be faithful to the duty          which the lord jesus has entrusted to me of proclaiming           as of supreme importance  the good news of god s grace              and now  i know that none of you among whom i have gone          in and out proclaiming the coming of the kingdom will any          longer see my face             therefore i protest to you to day that i am not responsible          for the ruin of any one of you             for i have not shrunk from declaring to you god s whole truth              take heed to yourselves and to all the flock among which          the holy spirit has placed you to take the oversight for him          and act as shepherds to the church of god  which he has bought          with his own blood             i know that  when i am gone  cruel wolves will come among you          and will not spare the flock             and that from among your own selves men will rise up who will seek          with their perverse talk to draw away the disciples after them             therefore be on the alert  and remember that  night and day           for three years  i never ceased admonishing every one           even with tears              and now i commend you to god and to the word of his grace           he is able to build you up and to give you your inheritance          among his people             no one s silver or gold or clothing have i coveted             you yourselves know that these hands of mine have provided          for my own necessities and for the people with me             in all things i have set you an example  showing you that           by working as i do  you ought to help the weak  and to bear          in mind the words of the lord jesus  how he himself said             it is more blessed to give than to receive               having spoken thus  paul knelt down and prayed with them all             and with loud lamentation they all threw their arms round his neck           and kissed him lovingly             grieved above all things at his having told them that          after that day they were no longer to see his face           and they went with him to the ship             when  at last  we had torn ourselves away and had set sail           we ran in a straight course to cos  the next day to rhodes           and from there to patara             finding a ship bound for phoenicia  we went on board and          put to sea             after sighting cyprus and leaving that island on our left           we continued our voyage to syria and put in at tyre           for there the ship was to unload her cargo             having searched for the disciples and found them           we stayed at tyre for seven days  and  taught by the spirit           they repeatedly urged paul not to proceed to jerusalem             when  however  our time was up  we left and went on our way           all the disciples and their wives and children coming to see          us off   then  after kneeling down on the beach and praying             we took leave of one another  and we went on board           while they returned home             as for us  our voyage was over when having sailed from tyre          we reached ptolemais   here we inquired after the welfare          of the brethren  and remained a day with them             on the morrow we left ptolemais and went on to caesarea           where we came to the house of philip the evangelist           who was one of the seven  and stayed with him             now philip had four unmarried daughters who were prophetesses             and during our somewhat lengthy stay a prophet of the name          of agabus came down from judaea             when he arrived he took paul s loincloth  and bound his own feet          and arms with it  and said   thus says the holy spirit   so will          the jews in jerusalem bind the owner of this loincloth           and will hand him over to the gentiles               as soon as we heard these words  both we and the brethren          at caesarea entreated paul not to go up to jerusalem             his reply was   what can you mean by thus breaking my heart          with your grief   why  as for me  i am ready not only to go          to jerusalem and be put in chains  but even to die there          for the sake of the lord jesus              so when he was not to be dissuaded  we ceased remonstrating          with him and said   the lord s will be done              a few days afterwards we loaded our baggage cattle and continued          our journey to jerusalem             some of the disciples from caesarea also joined our party           and brought with them mnason  a cyprian  one of the early disciples           at whose house we were to lodge             at length we reached jerusalem  and there the brethren gave          us a hearty welcome             on the following day we went with paul to call on james           and all the elders of the church came also             after exchanging friendly greetings  paul told in detail all that          god had done among the gentiles through his instrumentality             and they  when they had heard his statement  gave the glory to god           then they said   you see  brother  how many tens of thousands          of jews there are among those who have accepted the faith           and they are all zealous upholders of the law             now what they have been repeatedly told about you is that you          teach all the jews among the gentiles to abandon moses           and that you forbid them to circumcise their children          or observe old established customs             what then ought you to do   they are sure to hear that you          have come to jerusalem             so do this which we now tell you   we have four men here who          have a vow resting on them             associate with these men and purify yourself with them           and pay their expenses so that they can shave their heads           then everybody will know that there is no truth in these          stories about you  but that in your own actions you yourself          scrupulously obey the law             but as for the gentiles who have accepted the faith  we have          communicated to them our decision that they are carefully          to abstain from anything sacrificed to an idol  from blood           from what is strangled  and from fornication              so paul associated with the men  and the next day           having purified himself with them  he went into the temple           giving every one to understand that the days of their purification          were finished  and there he remained until the sacrifice          for each of them was offered             but  when the seven days were nearly over  the jews from          the province of asia  having seen paul in the temple           set about rousing the fury of all the people against him             they laid hands on him  crying out   men of israel  help  help           this is the man who goes everywhere preaching to everybody          against the jewish people and the law and this place           and besides  he has even brought gentiles into the temple          and has desecrated this holy place               for they had previously seen trophimus the ephesian with          him in the city  and imagined that paul had brought him          into the temple              the excitement spread through the whole city  and the people rushed          in crowds to the temple  and there laid hold of paul and began          to drag him out  and the temple gates were immediately closed             but while they were trying to kill paul  word was taken up          to the tribune in command of the battalion  that all jerusalem          was in a ferment             he instantly sent for a few soldiers and their officers           and came down among the people with all speed   at the sight          of the tribune and the troops they ceased beating paul             then the tribune  making his way to him  arrested him           and  having ordered him to be secured with two chains           proceeded to ask who he was and what he had been doing             some of the crowd shouted one accusation against paul          and some another  until  as the uproar made it impossible          for the truth to be ascertained with certainty  the tribune          ordered him to be brought into the barracks             when paul was going up the steps  he had to be carried          by the soldiers because of the violence of the mob             for the whole mass of the people pressed on in the rear           shouting   away with him              when he was about to be taken into the barracks  paul said          to the tribune   may i speak to you     do you know greek            the tribune asked              are you not the egyptian who some years ago excited the riot          of the       cut throats  and led them out into the desert               i am a jew   replied paul   belonging to tarsus in cilicia           and am a citizen of no unimportant city   give me leave           i pray you  to speak to the people              so with his permission paul stood on the steps and motioned          with his hand to the people to be quiet  and when there was          perfect silence he addressed them in hebrew              brethren and fathers   he said   listen to my defence which i          now make before you              and on hearing him address them in hebrew  they kept all          the more quiet  and he said              i am a jew  born at tarsus in cilicia  but brought up in          this city   i was carefully trained at the feet of gamaliel          in the law of our forefathers  and  like all of you to day           was zealous for god             i persecuted to death this new faith  continually binding          both men and women and throwing them into prison             as the high priest also and all the elders can bear me witness           it was  too  from them that i received letters to the brethren          in damascus  and i was already on my way to damascus           intending to bring those also who had fled there  in chains          to jerusalem  to be punished              but on my way  when i was now not far from damascus  about noon          a sudden blaze of light from heaven shone round me             i fell to the ground and heard a voice say to me    saul  saul           why are you persecuting me                who art thou  lord    i asked     i am jesus           the nazarene   he replied   whom you are persecuting               now the men who were with me  though they saw the light           did not hear the words of him who spoke to me             and i asked    what am i to do  lord     and the lord said          to me    rise  and go into damascus   there you shall be told          of all that has been appointed for you to do               and as i could not see because the light had been so dazzling           those who were with me had to lead me by the arm  and so i          came to damascus              and a certain ananias  a pious man who obeyed the law and bore          a good character with all the jews of the city             came to me and standing at my side said    brother saul           recover your sight     i instantly regained my sight and looked          up at him             then he said   the god of our forefathers has appointed you to know          his will  and to see the righteous one and hear him speak             for you shall be a witness for him  to all men  of what you          have seen and heard             and now why delay   rise  get yourself baptized  and wash off          your sins  calling upon his name               after my return to jerusalem  and while praying in the temple  i fell          into a trance             i saw jesus  and he said to me    make haste and leave          jerusalem quickly  because they will not accept your          testimony about me                lord   i replied   they themselves well know how active i was          in imprisoning  and in flogging in synagogue after synagogue          those who believe in thee             and when they were shedding the blood of stephen  thy witness           i was standing by  fully approving of it  and i held the clothes          of those who were killing him                go   he replied   i will send you as an apostle to          nations far away               until they heard this last statement the people listened          to paul  but now with a roar of disapproval they cried out            away with such a fellow from the earth   he ought not to be          allowed to live              and when they continued their furious shouts  throwing their          clothes into the air and flinging dust about             the tribune ordered him to be brought into the barracks           and be examined by flogging  in order to ascertain the reason          why they thus cried out against him             but  when they had tied him up with the straps  paul said          to the captain who stood by   does the law permit you to flog          a roman citizen  and one too who is uncondemned              on hearing this question  the captain went to report the matter          to the tribune    what are you intending to do   he said            this man is a roman citizen              so the tribune came to paul and asked him   tell me  are you          a roman citizen     yes   he said              i paid a large sum for my citizenship   said the tribune            but i was born free   said paul             so the men who had been on the point of putting him under torture          immediately left him   and the tribune  too  was frightened          when he learnt that paul was a roman citizen  for he had          had him bound             the next day  wishing to know exactly what charge was being          brought against him by the jews  the tribune ordered his chains          to be removed  and  having sent word to the high priests and          all the sanhedrin to assemble  he brought paul down and made          him stand before them             then paul  fixing a steady gaze on the sanhedrin  said   brethren           it is with a perfectly clear conscience that i have discharged          my duties before god up to this day              on hearing this the high priest ananias ordered those who were          standing near paul to strike him on the mouth              before long   exclaimed paul   god will strike you           you white washed wall   are you sitting there to judge me          in accordance with the law  and do you yourself actually          break the law by ordering me to be struck               do you rail at god s high priest   cried the men who stood by him              i did not know  brethren   replied paul   that he was          the high priest  for it is written   thou shalt not speak          evil of a ruler of thy people               noticing  however  that the sanhedrin consisted partly          of sadducees and partly of pharisees  he called out loudly          among them   brethren  i am a pharisee  the son of pharisees           it is because of my hope of a resurrection of the dead that i          am on my trial              these words of his caused an angry dispute between the pharisees          and the sadducees  and the assembly took different sides             for the sadducees maintain that there is no resurrection           and neither angel nor spirit  but the pharisees acknowledge          the existence of both             so there arose a great uproar  and some of the scribes          belonging to the sect of the pharisees sprang to their feet          and fiercely contended  saying   we find no harm in the man           what if a spirit has spoken to him  or an angel                  but when the struggle was becoming violent  the tribune           fearing that paul would be torn to pieces by the people           ordered the troops to go down and take him from among them          by force and bring him into the barracks             the following night the lord came and stood at paul s side           and said   be of good courage  for as you have borne faithful          witness about me in jerusalem  so you must also bear          witness in rome              now  when daylight came  the jews formed a conspiracy and solemnly          swore not to eat or drink till they had killed paul             there were more than forty of them who bound themselves          by this oath             they went to the high priests and elders and said to them            we have bound ourselves under a heavy curse to take no food          till we have killed paul             now therefore you and the sanhedrin should make representations          to the tribune for him to bring him down to you  under the          impression that you intend to inquire more minutely about him           and we are prepared to assassinate him before he comes          near the place              but paul s sister s son heard of the intended attack upon him           so he came and went into the barracks and told paul about it             and paul called one of the captains and said   take this young          man to the tribune  for he has information to give him              so he took him and brought him to the tribune  and said   paul           the prisoner  called me to him and begged me to bring this          youth to you  because he has something to say to you              then the tribune  taking him by the arm  withdrew out of the          hearing of others and asked him   what have you to tell me               the jews   he replied   have agreed to request you to bring          paul down to the sanhedrin to morrow for the purpose of making          yourself more accurately acquainted with the case             i beg you not to comply  for more than forty men among them          are lying in wait for him  who have solemnly vowed that they          will neither eat nor drink till they have assassinated him           and even now they are ready  in anticipation of receiving          that promise of you              so the tribune sent the youth home  cautioning him            do not let any one know that you have given me this information            he said             then  calling to him two of the captains  he gave his orders            get ready two hundred men   he said   to march to caesarea           with seventy cavalry and two hundred light infantry           starting at nine o clock to night              he further told them to provide horses to mount paul on           so as to bring him safely to felix the governor             he also wrote a letter of which these were the contents              claudius lysias to his excellency  felix the governor           all good wishes             this man paul had been seized by the jews  and they were on          the point of killing him  when i came upon them with the troops          and rescued him  for i had been informed that he was          a roman citizen             and  wishing to know with certainty the offense of which they          were accusing him  i brought him down into their sanhedrin             and i discovered that the charge had to do with questions          of their law  but that he was accused of nothing for which          he deserves death or imprisonment             but now that i have received information of an intended attack          upon him  i immediately send him to you  directing his accusers          also to state before you the case they have against him              so  in obedience to their orders  the soldiers took paul          and brought him by night as far as antipatris             the next day the infantry returned to the barracks           leaving the cavalry to proceed with him             and  the cavalry having reached caesarea and delivered the letter          to the governor  they brought paul also to him             felix  after reading the letter  inquired from what province he was           and being told  from cilicia              he said   i will hear all you have to say  when your accusers          also have come    and he ordered him to be detained in custody          in herod s palace             five days after this  ananias the high priest came down to caesarea          with a number of elders and a pleader called tertullus           they stated to the governor the case against paul             so paul was sent for  and tertullus began to impeach him as follows            indebted as we are   he said   to you  most noble felix           for the perfect peace which we enjoy  and for reforms which          your wisdom has introduced to this nation             in every instance and in every place we accept them          with profound gratitude             but  not to detain you too long  i beg you in your forbearance          to listen to a brief statement from us             for we have found this man paul a source of mischief and a          disturber of the peace among all the jews throughout the empire           and a ringleader in the heresy of the nazarenes             he even attempted to profane the temple  but we arrested him                           you  however  by examining him  will yourself be able to learn          the truth as to all this which we allege against him              the jews also joined in the charge  maintaining that          these were facts             then  at a sign from the governor  paul answered   knowing  sir           that for many years you have administered justice to this nation           i cheerfully make my defence             for you have it in your power to ascertain that it is not more          than twelve days ago that i went up to worship in jerusalem             and that neither in the temple nor in the synagogues           nor anywhere in the city  did they find me disputing with any          opponent or collecting a crowd about me             nor can they prove the charges which they are now          bringing against me             but this i confess to you  that in the way which they style a heresy           i worship the god of our forefathers  believing everything          that is taught in the law or is written in the prophets             and having a hope directed towards god  which my accusers          themselves also entertain  that before long there will be          a resurrection both of the righteous and the unrighteous             this too is my own earnest endeavour  always to have a clear          conscience in relation to god and man              now after an interval of several years i came to bring alms          to my nation  and to offer sacrifices             while i was busy about these  they found me in the temple purified           with no crowd around me and no uproar  but there were certain          jews from the province of asia             they ought to have been here before you  and to have been          my prosecutors  if they have any charge to bring against me             or let these men themselves say what misdemeanour they found          me guilty of when i stood before the sanhedrin             unless it was in that one expression which i made use of when i          shouted out as i stood among them    the resurrection of the dead          is the thing about which i am on my trial before you to day               at this point felix  who was fairly well informed about the new faith           adjourned the trial  saying to the jews   when the tribune lysias          comes down  i will enter carefully into the matter              and he gave orders to the captain that paul was to be kept          in custody  but be treated with indulgence  and that his personal          friends were not to be prevented from showing him kindness             not long after this  felix came with drusilla his wife           a jewess  and sending for paul  listened to him as he spoke          about faith in christ jesus             but when he dealt with the subjects of justice  self control           and the judgement which was soon to come  felix became alarmed          and said   for the present leave me  and when i can find          a convenient opportunity i will send for you              at the same time he hoped that paul would give him money           and for this reason he sent for him the oftener to          converse with him             but after the lapse of fully two years felix was succeeded          by porcius festus  and being desirous of gratifying          the jews  felix left paul still in prison             festus  having entered on his duties as governor of the province           two days later went up from caesarea to jerusalem             the high priests and the leading men among the jews immediately          made representations to him against paul  and begged him              asking it as a favour  to paul s prejudice  to have him          brought to jerusalem   they were planning an ambush to kill          him on the way             festus  however  replied that paul was in custody in caesarea           and that he was himself going there very soon              therefore let those of you   he said   who can come           go down with me  and impeach the man  if there is anything          amiss in him              after a stay of eight or ten days in jerusalem  not more            he went down to caesarea  and the next day  taking his seat          on the tribunal  he ordered paul to be brought in             upon paul s arrival  the jews who had come down from jerusalem          stood round him  and brought many grave charges against him          which they were unable to substantiate             but  in reply  paul said   neither against the jewish law           nor against the temple  nor against caesar  have i committed          any offence whatever              then festus  being anxious to gratify the jews  asked paul   are you          willing to go up to jerusalem  and there stand your trial          before me on these charges               i am standing before caesar s tribunal   replied paul            where alone i ought to be tried   the jews have no real          ground of complaint against me  as in fact you yourself are          beginning to see more clearly             if  however  i have done wrong and have committed any offence for          which i deserve to die  i do not ask to be excused that penalty           but if there is no truth in what these men allege against me           no one has the right to give me up to them as a favour           i appeal to caesar              then  after conferring with the council  festus replied            to caesar you have appealed   to caesar you shall go              a short time after this  agrippa the king and bernice came          to caesarea to pay a complimentary visit to festus             and  during their rather long stay  festus laid paul s case          before the king    there is a man here   he said   whom felix          left a prisoner             about whom  when i went to jerusalem  the high priests          and the elders of the jews made representations to me           begging that sentence might be pronounced against him             my reply was that it is not the custom among the romans to give up          any one for punishment before the accused has had his accusers          face to face  and has had an opportunity of defending himself          against the charge which has been brought against him              when  therefore  a number of them came here  the next day          i took my seat on the tribunal  without any loss of time           and ordered the man to be brought in             but  when his accusers stood up  they did not charge him          with the misdemeanours of which i had been suspecting him             but they quarrelled with him about certain matters connected          with their own religion  and about one jesus who had died  but            so paul persistently maintained  is now alive             i was at a loss how to investigate such questions  and asked          paul whether he would care to go to jerusalem and there stand          his trial on these matters             but when paul appealed to have his case kept for the emperor s          decision  i ordered him to be kept in prison until i could          send him up to caesar               i should like to hear the man myself   said agrippa            to morrow   replied festus   you shall    accordingly  the next day           agrippa and bernice came in state            and took their seats in the judgement hall  attended by the tribunes          and the men of high rank in the city  and  at the command          of festus  paul was brought in             then festus said   king agrippa and all who are present          with us  you see here the man about whom the whole nation          of the jews made suit to me  both in jerusalem and here           crying out that he ought not to live any longer             i could not discover that he had done anything for which he deserved          to die  but as he has himself appealed to the emperor  i have          decided to send him to rome             i have nothing very definite  however  to tell our sovereign          about him   so i have brought the man before you all            and especially before you  king agrippa  that after he has been          examined i may find something which i can put into writing             for  when sending a prisoner to rome  it seems to me to be          absurd not to state the charges against him              then agrippa said to paul   you have permission to speak          about yourself    so paul  with outstretched arm  proceeded to          make his defence              as regards all the accusations brought against me by the jews            he said   i think myself fortunate  king agrippa  in being          about to defend myself to day before you             who are so familiar with all the customs and speculations          that prevail among the jews  and for this reason  i pray you           give me a patient hearing              the kind of life i have lived from my youth upwards           as exemplified in my early days among my nation and in jerusalem           is known to all the jews             for they all know me of old  if they would but testify to the fact            how  being an adherent of the strictest sect of our religion           my life was that of a pharisee             and now i stand here impeached because of my hope in the fulfilment          of the promise made by god to our forefathers              the promise which our twelve tribes  worshipping day and night          with intense devotedness  hope to have made good to them           it is on the subject of this hope  sir  that i am accused          by the jews             why is it deemed with all of you a thing past belief if god          raises the dead to life              i myself  however  thought it a duty to do many things          in hostility to the name of jesus  the nazarene             and that was how i acted in jerusalem   armed with authority          received from the high priests i shut up many of god s people          in various prisons  and when they were about to be put to death          i gave my vote against them             in all the synagogues also i punished them many a time           and tried to make them blaspheme  and in my wild fury i chased          them even to foreign towns              while thus engaged  i was travelling one day to damascus armed          with authority and a commission from the high priests             and on the journey  at noon  sir  i saw a light from heaven            brighter than the brightness of the sun  shining around me          and around those who were travelling with me             we all fell to the ground  and i heard a voice which said to me          in hebrew    saul  saul  why are you persecuting me   you are          finding it painful to kick against the ox goad                who art thou  lord    i asked     i am jesus whom you          are persecuting   the lord replied              but rise  and stand on your feet  for i have appeared to you          for the very purpose of appointing you my servant and my          witness both as to the things you have already seen and as          to those in which i will appear to you             i will save you from the jewish people and from the gentiles           to whom i send you to open their eyes             that they may turn from darkness to light and from the obedience          to satan to god  in order to receive forgiveness of sins          and an inheritance among those who are sanctified through          faith in me               therefore  king agrippa  i was not disobedient to          the heavenly vision             but i proceeded to preach first to the people in damascus           and then to those in jerusalem and in all judaea           and to the gentiles  that they must repent and turn to god           and live lives consistent with such repentance              it was on this account that the jews seized me in the temple          and tried to kill me             having  however  obtained the help which is from god  i have stood          firm until now  and have solemnly exhorted rich and poor alike           saying nothing except what the prophets and moses predicted          as soon to happen             since the christ was to be a suffering christ  and by coming back          from the dead was then to be the first to proclaim a message          of light both to the jewish people and to the gentiles              as paul thus made his defence  festus exclaimed in a loud voice            you are raving mad  paul  and great learning is driving you mad               i am not mad  most noble festus   replied paul   i am speaking          words of sober truth             for the king  to whom i speak freely  knows about these matters           i am not to be persuaded that any detail of them has escaped          his notice  for these things have not been done in a corner             king agrippa  do you believe the prophets   i know that          you believe them              agrippa answered   in brief  you are doing your best to persuade          me to become a christian               my prayer to god  whether briefly or at length   replied paul            would be that not only you but all who are my hearers to day           might become such as i am  except these chains              so the king rose  and the governor  and bernice  and those          who were sitting with them             and  having withdrawn  they talked to one another and said            this man is doing nothing for which he deserves          death or imprisonment              and agrippa said to festus   he might have been set at liberty           if he had not appealed to caesar              now when it was decided that we should sail for italy  they handed          over paul and a few other prisoners into the custody of julius           a captain of the augustan battalion             and going on board a ship of adramyttium which was about          to sail to the ports of the province of asia  we put          to sea  aristarchus  the macedonian  from thessalonica           forming one of our party             the next day we put in at sidon   there julius treated paul          with thoughtful kindness and allowed him to visit his friends          and profit by their generous care             putting to sea again  we sailed under the lee of cyprus           because the winds were against us             and  sailing the whole length of the sea that lies off cilicia          and pamphylia  we reached myra in lycia             there julius found an alexandrian ship bound for italy           and put us on board of her             it took several days of slow sailing for us to come with          difficulty off cnidus  from which point  as the wind did not          allow us to get on in the direct course  we ran under the lee          of crete by salmone             then  coasting along with difficulty  we reached a place called           fair havens   near the town of lasea             our voyage thus far had occupied a considerable time  and the          navigation being now unsafe and the fast also already over           paul warned them              sirs   he said   i perceive that before long the voyage will          be attended with danger and heavy loss  not only to the cargo          and the ship but to our own lives also              but julius let himself be persuaded by the pilot and by the owner          rather than by paul s arguments             and as the harbour was inconvenient for wintering in           the majority were in favour of putting out to sea  to try          whether they could get to phoenix  a harbour on the coast          of crete facing north east and south east  to winter there             and a light breeze from the south sprang up  so that          they supposed they were now sure of their purpose           so weighing anchor they ran along the coast of crete           hugging the shore             but it was not long before a furious north east wind           coming down from the mountains  burst upon us and carried          the ship out of her course             she was unable to make headway against the gale  so we gave          up and let her drive             then we ran under the lee of a little island called cauda           where we managed with great difficulty to secure the boat             and  after hoisting it on board  they used frapping cables          to undergird the ship  and  as they were afraid of being driven          on the syrtis quicksands  they lowered the gear and lay to             but  as the storm was still violent  the next day they began          to lighten the ship             and  on the third day  with their own hands they threw the ship s          spare gear overboard             then  when for several days neither sun nor stars were seen          and the terrific gale still harassed us  the last ray of hope          was now vanishing             when for a long time they had taken but little food           paul  standing up among them  said   sirs  you ought          to have listened to me and not have sailed from crete           you would then have escaped this suffering and loss             but now take courage  for there will be no destruction of life          among you  but of the ship only             for there stood by my side  last night  an angel of the god          to whom i belong  and whom also i worship             and he said    dismiss all fear  paul  for you must stand          before caesar  and god has granted you the lives of all who          are sailing with you               therefore  sirs  take courage  for i believe god  and am          convinced that things will happen exactly as i have been told             but we are to be stranded on a certain island              it was now the fourteenth night  and we were drifting through          the sea of adria  when  about midnight  the sailors suspected          that land was close at hand             so they hove the lead and found twenty fathoms of water           and after a short time they hove again and found fifteen fathoms             then for fear of possibly running on rocks  they threw out four          anchors from the stern and waited impatiently for daylight             the sailors  however  wanted to make their escape from the ship           and had lowered the boat into the sea  pretending that they          were going to lay out anchors from the bow             but paul  addressing julius and the soldiers  said   your lives          will be sacrificed  unless these men remain on board              then the soldiers cut the ropes of the ship s boat and let          her fall off             and continually  up till daybreak  paul kept urging all on board          to take some food    this is the fourteenth day   he said            that you have been anxiously waiting for the storm to cease           and have fasted  eating little or nothing             i therefore strongly advise you to take some food           this is essential for your safety   for not a hair will perish          from the head of any one of you              having said this he took some bread  and  after giving thanks          to god for it before them all  he broke it in pieces and began          to eat it             this raised the spirits of all  and they too took food             there were     of us  crew and passengers  all told             after eating a hearty meal they lightened the ship by throwing          the wheat overboard             when daylight came  they tried in vain to recognise the coast           but an inlet with a sandy beach attracted their attention           and now their object was  if possible  to run the ship aground          in this inlet             so they cut away the anchors and left them in the sea           unloosing at the same time the bands which secured          the paddle rudders  then  hoisting the foresail to the wind           they made for the beach             but coming to a place where two seas met  they stranded the ship           and her bow sticking fast remained immovable  while the stern          began to go to pieces under the heavy hammering of the sea             now the soldiers recommended that the prisoners should be killed           for fear some one of them might swim ashore and effect his escape             but their captain  bent on securing paul s safety  kept them          from their purpose and gave orders that those who could swim          should first jump overboard and get to land             and that the rest should follow  some on planks  and others          on various things from the ship   in this way they all got          safely to land             our lives having been thus preserved  we discovered that          the island was called malta             the strange speaking natives showed us remarkable kindness           for they lighted a fire and made us all welcome because of          the pelting rain and the cold             now  when paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and had thrown          them on the fire  a viper  driven by the heat  came out and          fastened itself on his hand             when the natives saw the creature hanging to his hand  they said          to one another   beyond doubt this man is a murderer  for           though saved from the sea  unerring justice does not permit          him to live              he  however  shook the reptile off into the fire and was unhurt             they expected him soon to swell with inflammation or suddenly          fall down dead  but  after waiting a long time and seeing          no harm come to him  they changed their minds and said          that he was a god             now in the same part of the island there were estates          belonging to the governor  whose name was publius           he welcomed us to his house  and for three days generously          made us his guests             it happened  however  that his father was lying ill of dysentery          aggravated by attacks of fever  so paul went to see him  and           after praying  laid his hands on him and cured him             after this  all the other sick people in the island came          and were cured             they also loaded us with honours  and when at last we sailed          they put supplies on board for us             three months passed before we set sail in an alexandrian vessel           called the  twin brothers   which had wintered at the island             at syracuse we put in and stayed for two days             from there we came round and reached rhegium  and a day later           a south wind sprang up which brought us by the evening          of the next day to puteoli             here we found brethren  who invited us to remain with them          for a week  and so we reached rome             meanwhile the brethren there  hearing of our movements           came as far as the market of appius and the three huts to meet us           and when paul saw them he thanked god and felt encouraged             upon our arrival in rome  paul received permission to live          by himself  guarded by a soldier             after one complete day he invited the leading men among the jews          to meet him  and  when they were come together  he said to them            as for me  brethren  although i had done nothing prejudicial          to our people or contrary to the customs of our forefathers           i was handed over as a prisoner from jerusalem into the power          of the romans             they  after they had sharply questioned me  were willing to set          me at liberty  because they found no offence in me for which i          deserve to die             but  at last  the opposition of the jews compelled me to appeal          to caesar  not however that i had any charge to bring          against my nation             for these reasons  then  i have invited you here  that i          might see you and speak to you  for it is for the sake of him          who is the hope of israel that this chain hangs upon me               for our part   they replied   we have not received any letters          from judaea about you  nor have any of our countrymen come          here and reported or stated anything to your disadvantage             but we should be glad to hear from you what it is that          you believe  for as for this sect all we know is that it          is everywhere spoken against              so they arranged a day with him and came to him in considerable          numbers at the house of the friends who were entertaining him           and then  with solemn earnestness  he explained to them          the subject of the kingdom of god  endeavouring from morning          till evening to convince them about jesus  both from the law          of moses and from the prophets             some were convinced  others refused to believe             unable to agree among themselves  they at last left him           but not before paul had spoken a parting word to them  saying            right well did the holy spirit say to your forefathers          through the prophet isaiah               go to this people and tell them  you will hear and hear           and by no means understand  and will look and look           and by no means see             for this people s mind has grown callous  their hearing has          become dull  and their eyes they have closed  to prevent          their ever seeing with their eyes  or hearing with their ears           or understanding with their minds  and turning back           so that i might cure them               be fully assured  therefore  that this salvation  god s salvation            has now been sent to the gentiles  and that they  at any rate           will give heed                            after this paul lived for fully two years in a hired house          of his own  receiving all who came to see him             he announced the coming of the kingdom of god  and taught          concerning the lord jesus christ without let or hindrance                       charitable donations in all    states of the united  states

alone swamp our small staff     please check the he made the ages             he brightly reflects god s glory and is the exact representation          of his being  and upholds the universe by his all powerful word           after securing man s purification from sin he took his seat          at the right hand of the majesty on high             having become as far superior to the angels as the name he          possesses by inheritance is more excellent than theirs             for to which of the angels did god ever say   my son          art thou   i have this day become thy father   and again            i will be a father to him  and he shall be my son              but speaking of the time when he once more brings his firstborn          into the world  he says   and let all god s angels worship him              moreover of the angels he says   he changes his angels into winds           and his ministering servants into a flame of fire              but of his son  he says   thy throne  o god  is for ever          and for ever  and the sceptre of thy kingdom is a sceptre          of absolute justice             thou hast loved righteousness and hated lawlessness           therefore god  thy god  has anointed thee with the oil          of gladness beyond thy companions              it is also of his son that god says   thou  o lord           in the beginning didst lay the foundations of the earth           and the heavens are the work of thy hands             the heavens will perish  but thou remainest  and they will          all grow old like a garment             and  as though they were a mantle thou wilt roll them up           yes  like a garment  and they will undergo change           but thou art the same  and thy years will never come to an end              to which of the angels has he ever said   sit at my right hand          till i make thy foes a footstool for thy feet              are not all angels spirits that serve him  whom he sends out          to render service for the benefit of those who  before long           will inherit salvation             for this reason we ought to pay the more earnest heed          to the things which we have heard  for fear we should drift          away from them             for if the message delivered through angels proved to be true           and every transgression and act of disobedience met          with just retribution             how shall  we  escape if we are indifferent to a salvation          as great as that now offered to us   this  after having first          of all been announced by the lord himself  had its truth made          sure to us by those who heard him             while god corroborated their testimony by signs and marvels          and various miracles  and by gifts of the holy spirit          distributed in accordance with his own will             it is not to angels that god has assigned the sovereignty          of that coming world  of which we speak             but  as we know  a writer has solemnly said   how poor a creature          is man  and yet thou dost remember him  and a son of man           and yet thou dost come to him             thou hast made him only a little inferior to the angels           with glory and honour thou hast crowned him  and hast set          him to govern the works of thy hands             thou hast put everything in subjection under his feet            for this subjecting of the universe to man implies the leaving          nothing not subject to him   but we do not as yet see          the universe subject to him             but jesus  who was made a little inferior to the angels in order          that through god s grace he might taste death for every          human being  we already see wearing a crown of glory and honour          because of his having suffered death             for it was fitting that he for whom  and through whom           all things exist  after he had brought many sons to glory           should perfect by suffering the prince leader who had saved them             for both he who sanctifies and those whom he is sanctifying          have all one father  and for this reason he is not ashamed          to speak of them as his brothers             as when he says    i will proclaim thy name to my brothers           in the midst of the congregation i will hymn thy praises              and again   as for me  i will be one whose trust reposes in god            and again   here am i  and here are the children god          has given me              since then the children referred to are all alike sharers          in perishable human nature  he himself also  in the same way           took on him a share of it  in order that through death he          might render powerless him who had authority over death           that is  the devil             and might set at liberty all those who through fear of death          had been subject to lifelong slavery             for assuredly it is not to angels that he is continually reaching          a helping hand  but it is to the descendants of abraham             and for this purpose it was necessary that in all respects he          should be made to resemble his brothers  so that he might become          a compassionate and faithful high priest in things relating          to god  in order to atone for the sins of the people             for inasmuch as he has himself felt the pain of temptation          and trial  he is also able instantly to help those who are          tempted and tried             therefore  holy brethren  sharers with others in a          heavenly invitation  fix your thoughts on jesus  the apostle          and high priest whose followers we profess to be             how faithful he was to him who appointed him  just as moses          also was faithful in all god s house             for jesus has been counted worthy of greater glory than moses           in so far as he who has built a house has higher honour          than the house itself             for every house has had a builder  and the builder of all          things is god             moreover  moses was faithful in all god s house as a servant          in delivering the message given him to speak             but christ was faithful as a son having authority over god s house           and we are that house  if we hold firm to the end the boldness          and the hope which we boast of as ours             for this reason  as the holy spirit warns us   to day  if you          hear his voice             do not harden your hearts as your forefathers did in the time          of the provocation on the day of the temptation in the desert             where your forefathers so sorely tried my patience and saw          all that i did during forty years             therefore i was greatly grieved with that generation  and i said            they are ever going astray in heart  and have not learnt          to know my paths              as i swore in my anger  they shall not be admitted to my rest               see to it  brethren  that there is never in any one of you            as perhaps there may be  a sinful and unbelieving heart           manifesting itself in revolt from the ever living god             on the contrary encourage one another  day after day  so long          as to day lasts  so that not one of you may be hardened          through the deceitful character of sin             for we have  all alike  become sharers with christ  if we          really hold our first confidence firm to the end             seeing that the warning still comes to us   to day  if you          hear his voice  do not harden your hearts as your forefathers          did in the time of the provocation              for who were they that heard  and yet provoked god   was it          not the whole of the people who had come out of egypt under          the leadership of moses             and with whom was god so greatly grieved for forty years           was it not with those who had sinned  and whose dead bodies          fell in the desert             and to whom did he swear that they should not be admitted          to his rest  if it was not to those who were disobedient             and so we see that it was owing to lack of faith that they          could not be admitted             therefore let us be on our guard lest perhaps  while he          still leaves us a promise of being admitted to his rest           some one of you should be found to have fallen short of it             for good news has been brought to us as truly as to them           but the message they heard failed to benefit them  because they          were not one in faith with those who gave heed to it             we who have believed are soon to be admitted to the true rest           as he has said   as i swore in my anger  they shall not be          admitted to my rest   although god s works had been going          on ever since the creation of the world             for  as we know  when speaking of the seventh day he has          used the words   and god rested on the seventh day from          all his works              and he has also declared   they shall not be admitted to my rest              since  then  it is still true that some will be admitted to          that rest  and that because of disobedience those who formerly          had good news proclaimed to them were not admitted             he again definitely mentions a certain day   to day            saying long afterwards  by david s lips  in the words          already quoted   to day  if you hear his voice  do not          harden your hearts              for if joshua had given them the true rest  we should not          afterwards hear god speaking of another still future day             it follows that there still remains a sabbath rest for the          people of god             for he who has been admitted to his rest  has rested from his          works as god did from his             let it then be our earnest endeavour to be admitted to that rest           so that no one may perish through following the same          example of unbelief             for god s message is full of life and power  and is keener          than the sharpest two edged sword   it pierces even to          the severance of soul from spirit  and penetrates between          the joints and the marrow  and it can discern the secret          thoughts and purposes of the heart             and no created thing is able to escape its scrutiny           but everything lies bare and completely exposed before the eyes          of him with whom we have to do             inasmuch  then  as we have in jesus  the son of god           a great high priest who has passed into heaven itself           let us hold firmly to our profession of faith             for we have not a high priest who is unable to feel for us          in our weaknesses  but one who was tempted in every respect          just as we are tempted  and yet did not sin             therefore let us come boldly to the throne of grace           that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our          times of need             for every high priest is chosen from among men  and is          appointed to act on behalf of men in matters relating to god           in order to offer both gifts and sin offerings             and must be one who is able to bear patiently with the ignorant          and erring  because he himself also is beset with infirmity             and for this reason he is required to offer sin offerings          not only for the people but also for himself             and no one takes this honourable office upon himself           but only accepts it when called to it by god  as aaron was             so christ also did not claim for himself the honour of being          made high priest  but was appointed to it by him who said          to him   my son art thou   i have to day become thy father              as also in another passage he says   thou art a priest for ever           belonging to the order of melchizedek              for jesus during his earthly life offered up prayers and entreaties           crying aloud and weeping as he pleaded with him who was able          to bring him in safety out of death  and he was delivered          from the terror from which he shrank             although he was god s son  yet he learned obedience from          the sufferings which he endured             and so  having been made perfect  he became to all who obey          him the source and giver of eternal salvation             for god himself addresses him as a high priest for ever           belonging to the order of melchizedek             concerning him we have much to say  and much that it would          be difficult to make clear to you  since you have become          so dull of apprehension             for although  considering the long time you have been believers           you ought now to be teachers of others  you really need some one          to teach you over again the very rudiments of the truths of god           and you have come to require milk instead of solid food             by people who live on milk i mean those who are imperfectly          acquainted with the teaching concerning righteousness             such persons are mere babes   but solid food is for adults            that is  for those who through constant practice have          their spiritual faculties carefully trained to distinguish          good from evil             therefore leaving elementary instruction about the christ           let us advance to mature manhood and not be continually          re laying a foundation of repentance from lifeless works          and of faith in god             or of teaching about ceremonial washings  the laying on of hands           the resurrection of the dead  and the last judgement             and advance we will  if god permits us to do so             for it is impossible  in the case of those who have once for all          been enlightened  and have tasted the sweetness of the heavenly gift           and have been made partakers of the holy spirit             and have realized how good the word of god is and how mighty          are the powers of the coming age  and then fell away              it is impossible  i say  to keep bringing them back to a          new repentance  for  to their own undoing  they are repeatedly          crucifying the son of god afresh and exposing him to open shame             for land which has drunk in the rain that often falls upon it           and brings forth vegetation useful to those for whose sakes           indeed  it is tilled  has a share in god s blessing             but if it only yields a mass of thorns and briers  it is          considered worthless  and is in danger of being cursed           and in the end will be destroyed by fire             but we  even while we speak in this tone  have a happier          conviction concerning you  my dearly loved friends            a conviction of things which point towards salvation             for god is not unjust so that he is unmindful of your labour and          of the love which you have manifested towards himself in having          rendered services to his people and in still rendering them             but we long for each of you to continue to manifest          the same earnestness  with a view to your enjoying fulness          of hope to the very end             so that you may not become half hearted  but be imitators          of those who through faith and patient endurance are now heirs          to the promises             for when god gave the promise to abraham  since he had no one          greater to swear by  he swore by himself             saying   assuredly i will bless you and bless you  i will          increase you and increase you              and so  as the result of patient waiting  our forefather          obtained what god had promised             for men swear by what is greater than themselves  and with them          an oath in confirmation of a statement always puts an end          to a dispute             in the same way  since it was god s desire to display more          convincingly to the heirs of the promise how unchangeable          his purpose was             he added an oath  in order that  through two unchangeable things           in which it is impossible for him to prove false           we may possess mighty encouragement  we who  for safety           have hastened to lay hold of the hope set before us             that hope we have as an anchor of the soul  an anchor that can          neither break nor drag   it passes in behind the veil             where jesus has entered as a forerunner on our behalf           having become  like melchizedek  a high priest for ever             for this man  melchizedek  king of salem and priest of          the most high god  he who when abraham was returning after          defeating the kings met him and pronounced a blessing on him              to whom also abraham presented a tenth part of all            being first  as his name signifies  king of righteousness           and secondly king of salem  that is  king of peace             with no father or mother  and no record of ancestry           having neither beginning of days nor end of life  but made          a type of the son of god  this man melchizedek remains          a priest for ever             now think how great this priest king must have been to whom abraham          the patriarch gave a tenth part of the best of the spoil             and those of the descendants of levi who receive the priesthood          are authorized by the law to take tithes from the people  that is           from their brethren  though these have sprung from abraham             but  in this instance  one who does not trace his origin from          them takes tithes from abraham  and pronounces a blessing          on him to whom the promises belong             and beyond all dispute it is always the inferior who is blessed          by the superior             moreover here frail mortal men receive tithes   there one          receives them about whom there is evidence that he is alive             and levi too  if i may so speak  pays tithes through abraham             for levi was yet in the loins of his forefather when          melchizedek met abraham             now if the crowning blessing was attainable by means of          the levitical priesthood  for as resting on this foundation          the people received the law  to which they are still subject            what further need was there for a priest of a different kind          to be raised up belonging to the order of melchizedek instead          of being said to belong to the order of aaron             for when the priesthood changes  a change of law also of          necessity takes place             he  however  to whom that prophecy refers is associated          with a different tribe  not one member of which has anything          to do with the altar             for it is undeniable that our lord sprang from judah  a tribe          of which moses said nothing in connection with priests             and this is still more abundantly clear when we read that it          is as belonging to the order of melchizedek that a priest          of a different kind is to arise             and hold his office not in obedience to any temporary law           but by virtue of an indestructible life             for the words are in evidence   thou art a priest for ever           belonging to the order of melchizedek              on the one hand we have here the abrogation of an earlier code          because it was weak and ineffective              for the law brought no perfect blessing  but on the other hand          we have the bringing in of a new and better hope by means          of which we draw near to god             and since it was not without an oath being taken              for these men hold office without any oath having been taken           but he holds it attested by an oath from him who said          to him   the lord has sworn and will not recall his words           thou art a priest for ever               so much the more also is the covenant of which jesus has become          the guarantor  a better covenant             and they have been appointed priests many in number           because death prevents their continuance in office             but he  because he continues for ever  has a priesthood          which does not pass to any successor             hence too he is able to save to the uttermost those who come          to god through him  seeing that he ever lives to plead for them             moreover we needed just such a high priest as this            holy  guileless  undefiled  far removed from sinful men          and exalted above the heavens             who  unlike other high priests  is not under the necessity          of offering up sacrifices day after day  first for his own sins           and afterwards for those of the people  for this latter thing          he did once for all when he offered up himself             for the law constitutes men high priests  men with all          their infirmity  but the utterance of the oath  which came          later than the law  constitutes high priest a son who has          been made for ever perfect             now in connexion with what we have been saying the chief point          is that we have a high priest who has taken his seat at          the right hand of the throne of god s majesty in the heavens             and ministers in the holy place and in the true tabernacle          which not man  but the lord pitched             every high priest  however  is appointed to offer both bloodless          gifts and sacrifices   therefore this high priest also must          have some offering to present             if then he were still on earth  he would not be a priest at all           since here there are already those who present the offerings          in obedience to the law             and serve a copy and type of the heavenly things  just as moses          was divinely instructed when about to build the tabernacle           for god said   see that you make everything in imitation          of the pattern shown you on the mountain              but  as a matter of fact  the ministry which christ has          obtained is all the nobler a ministry  in that he is at          the same time the negotiator of a sublimer covenant           based upon sublimer promises             for if that first covenant had been free from imperfection           there would have been no attempt to introduce another             for  being dissatisfied with his people  god says    there are          days coming   says the lord   when i will establish with the house          of israel and with the house of judah a new covenant              a covenant unlike the one which i made with their forefathers          on the day when i took them by the hand to lead them out from          the land of egypt  for they would not remain faithful to that             so i turned from them   says the lord              but this is the covenant that i will covenant with the house          of israel after those days   says the lord   i will put my          laws into their minds and will write them upon their hearts           and i will indeed be their god and they shall be my people             and there shall be no need for them to teach each one his fellow          citizen and each one his brother  saying  know the lord           for all will know me from the least of them to the greatest             because i will be merciful to their wrongdoings  and their sins          i will remember no longer               by using the words   a new covenant   he has made the first          one obsolete  but whatever is decaying and showing signs          of old age is not far from disappearing altogether             now even the first covenant had regulations for divine worship           and had also its sanctuary  a sanctuary belonging to this world             for a sacred tent was constructed  the outer one  in which          were the lamp and the table and the presented loaves           and this is called the holy place             and behind the second veil was a sacred tent called          the holy of holies             this had a censer of gold  and the ark of the covenant lined          with gold and completely covered with gold  and in it were          a gold vase which held the manna  and aaron s rod which budded          and the tables of the covenant             and above the ark were the cherubim denoting god s glorious          presence and overshadowing the mercy seat  but i cannot now          speak about all these in detail             these arrangements having long been completed  the priests           when conducting the divine services  continually enter          the outer tent             but into the second  the high priest goes only on one day          of the year  and goes alone  taking with him blood           which he offers on his own behalf and on account of the sins          which the people have ignorantly committed             and the lesson which the holy spirit teaches is this            that the way into the true holy place is not yet open so long          as the outer tent still remains in existence             and this is a figure  for the time now present  answering to          which both gifts and sacrifices are offered  unable though they          are to give complete freedom from sin to him who ministers             for their efficacy depends only on meats and drinks and          various washings  ceremonies pertaining to the body and imposed          until a time of reformation             but christ appeared as a high priest of the blessings that are          soon to come by means of the greater and more perfect tent          of worship  a tent which has not been built with hands            that is to say does not belong to this material creation              and once for all entered the holy place  taking with him          not the blood of goats and calves  but his own blood           and thus procuring eternal redemption for us             for if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer          sprinkling those who have contracted defilement make them          holy so as to bring about ceremonial purity             how much more certainly shall the blood of christ           who strengthened by the eternal spirit offered himself to god           free from blemish  purify your consciences from lifeless          works for you to serve the ever living god             and because of this he is the negotiator of a new covenant           in order that  since a life has been given in atonement          for the offences committed under the first covenant           those who have been called may receive the eternal inheritance          which has been promised to them             for where there is a legal  will   there must also be a death          brought forward in evidence  the death of him who made it             and a will is only of force in the case of a deceased person           being never of any avail so long as he who made it lives             accordingly we find that the first covenant was not          inaugurated without blood             for when moses had proclaimed to all the people every commandment          contained in the law  he took the blood of the calves and          of the goats and with them water  scarlet wool and hyssop           and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people             saying   this is the blood which confirms the covenant that god          has made binding upon you              and in the same way he also sprinkled blood upon the tent          of worship and upon all the vessels used in the ministry             indeed we may almost say that in obedience to the law everything          is sprinkled with blood  and that apart from the outpouring          of blood there is no remission of sins             it was needful therefore that the copies of the things in heaven          should be cleansed in this way  but that the heavenly things          themselves should be cleansed with more costly sacrifices             for not into a holy place built by men s hands  a mere copy          of the reality  did christ enter  but he entered heaven itself           now to appear in the presence of god on our behalf             nor did he enter for the purpose of many times offering himself          in sacrifice  just as the high priest enters the holy place           year after year  taking with him blood not his own             in that case christ would have needed to suffer many times           from the creation of the world onwards  but as a matter of fact          he has appeared once for all  at the close of the ages           in order to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself             and since it is reserved for all mankind once to die           and afterwards to be judged             so the christ also  having been once offered in sacrifice in order          that he might bear the sins of many  will appear a second time           separated from sin  to those who are eagerly expecting him           to make their salvation complete             for  since the law exhibits only an outline of the blessings          to come and not a perfect representation of the things themselves           the priests can never  by repeating the same sacrifices          which they continually offer year after year  give complete          freedom from sin to those who draw near             for then would not the sacrifices have ceased to be offered           because the consciences of the worshippers  who in that case          would now have been cleansed once for all  would no longer          be burdened with sins             but in those sacrifices sins are recalled to memory year after year             for it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to          take away sins             that is why  when he comes into the world  he says            sacrifice and offering thou has not desired  but a body thou          hast prepared for me             in whole burnt offerings and in sin offerings thou hast          taken no pleasure             then i said   i have come  in the roll of the book it is written          concerning me  to do thy will  o god               after saying the words i have just quoted   sacrifices and          offerings or whole burnt offerings and sin offerings thou hast          not desired or taken pleasure in   all such being offered          in obedience to the law              he then adds   i have come to do thy will    he does away          with the first in order to establish the second             it is through that divine will that we have been set free          from sin  through the offering of jesus christ as our sacrifice          once for all             and while every priest stands ministering  day after day           and constantly offering the same sacrifices  though such can          never rid us of our sins              this priest  on the contrary  after offering for sins          a single sacrifice of perpetual efficacy  took his seat          at god s right hand             waiting from that time onward until his enemies be put as a          footstool under his feet             for by a single offering he has for ever completed the blessing          for those whom he is setting free from sin             and the holy spirit also gives us his testimony  for when          he had said               this is the covenant that i will make with them after those days            says the lord    i will put my laws upon their hearts and will          write them on their minds               he adds   and their sins and offences i will remember no longer              but where these have been forgiven no further offering for          sin is required             since then  brethren  we have free access to the holy place          through the blood of jesus             by the new and ever living way which he opened up for us through          the rending of the veil  that is to say  of his earthly nature              and since we have a great priest who has authority over          the house of god             let us draw near with sincerity and unfaltering faith           having had our hearts sprinkled  once for all  from consciences          oppressed with sin  and our bodies bathed in pure water             let us hold firmly to an unflinching avowal of our hope           for he is faithful who gave us the promises             and let us bestow thought on one another with a view to arousing          one another to brotherly love and right conduct             not neglecting  as some habitually do  to meet together           but encouraging one another  and doing this all the more          since you can see the day of christ approaching             for if we wilfully persist in sin after having received the full          knowledge of the truth  there no longer remains in reserve          any other sacrifice for sins             there remains nothing but a certain awful expectation of judgement           and the fury of a fire which before long will devour the enemies          of the truth             any one who bids defiance to the law of moses is put to death          without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses             how much severer punishment  think you  will he be held to deserve          who has trampled under foot the son of god  has not regarded          as holy that covenant blood with which he was set free from sin           and has insulted the spirit from whom comes grace             for we know who it is that has said   vengeance belongs          to me   i will pay back   and again   the lord will be          his people s judge              it is an awful thing to fall into the hands of the ever living god             but continually recall to mind the days now past  when on          being first enlightened you went through a great conflict          and many sufferings             this was partly through allowing yourselves to be made          a public spectacle amid reproaches and persecutions           and partly through coming forward to share the sufferings          of those who were thus treated             for you not only showed sympathy with those who were imprisoned           but you even submitted with joy when your property was taken          from you  being well aware that you have in your own selves          a more valuable possession and one which will remain             therefore do not cast from you your confident hope  for it          will receive a vast reward             for you stand in need of patient endurance  so that           as the result of having done the will of god  you may receive          the promised blessing             for there is still but a short time and then  the coming one          will come and will not delay             but it is by faith that my righteous servant shall live           and if he shrinks back  my soul takes no pleasure in him              but we are not people who shrink back and perish  but are among          those who believe and gain possession of their souls             now faith is a well grounded assurance of that for which we hope           and a conviction of the reality of things which we do not see             for by it the saints of old won god s approval             through faith we understand that the worlds came into being           and still exist  at the command of god  so that what is seen          does not owe its existence to that which is visible             through faith abel offered to god a more acceptable sacrifice          than cain did  and through this faith he obtained testimony          that he was righteous  god giving the testimony by accepting          his gifts  and through it  though he is dead  he still speaks             through faith enoch was taken from the earth so that he did          not see death  and he could not be found  because god          had taken him  for before he was taken we have evidence          that he truly pleased god             but where there is no faith it is impossible truly to please him           for the man who draws near to god must believe that there          is a god and that he proves himself a rewarder of those who          earnestly try to find him             through faith noah  being divinely taught about things as yet unseen           reverently gave heed and built an ark for the safety of his family           and by this act he condemned the world  and became an heir          of the righteousness which depends on faith             through faith abraham  upon being called to leave home and go into          a land which he was soon to receive for an inheritance  obeyed           and he went out  not knowing where he was going to             through faith he came and made his home for a time in a land          which had been promised to him  as if in a foreign country           living in tents together with isaac and jacob  sharers with him          in the same promise             for he continually looked forward to the city which has          the foundations  whose architect and builder is god             through faith even sarah herself received strength to become          a mother  although she was past the time of life for this            because she judged him faithful who had given the promise             and thus there sprang from one man  and him practically dead           a nation like the stars of the sky in number  and like the sands          on the sea shore which cannot be counted             all these died in the possession of faith   they had not received          the promised blessings  but had seen them from a distance          and had greeted them  and had acknowledged themselves to be          foreigners and strangers here on earth             for men who acknowledge this make it manifest that they are          seeking elsewhere a country of their own             and if they had cherished the remembrance of the country they          had left  they would have found an opportunity to return             but  as it is  we see them eager for a better land  that is to say           a heavenly one   for this reason god is not ashamed to be          called their god  for he has now prepared a city for them             through faith abraham  as soon as god put him to the test           offered up isaac   yes  he who had joyfully welcomed the promises          was on the point of sacrificing his only son            with regard to whom he had been told   it is through isaac          that your posterity shall be traced              for he reckoned that god is even able to raise a man up from          among the dead  and  figuratively speaking  it was from among          the dead that he received isaac again             through faith isaac blessed jacob and esau  even in connexion          with things soon to come             through faith jacob  when dying  blessed each of joseph s sons           and  leaning on the top of his staff  worshipped god             through faith joseph  when he was near his end  made mention          of the departure of the descendants of israel  and gave orders          about his own body             through faith the child moses was hid for three months by          his parents  because they saw his rare beauty  and the king s          edict had no terror for them             through faith moses  when he grew to manhood  refused to be          known as pharaoh s daughter s son             having determined to endure ill treatment along with the people          of god rather than enjoy the short lived pleasures of sin             because he deemed the reproaches which he might meet          with in the service of the christ to be greater riches          than all the treasures of egypt  for he fixed his gaze on          the coming reward             through faith he left egypt  not being frightened by the king s anger           for he held on his course as seeing the unseen one             through faith he instituted the passover  and the sprinkling          with blood so that the destroyer of the firstborn might not          touch the israelites             through faith they passed through the red sea as though they          were passing over dry land  but the egyptians  when they          tried to do the same  were swallowed up             through faith the walls of jericho fell to the ground after          being surrounded for seven days             through faith the notorious sinner rahab did not perish          along with the disobedient  for she had welcomed the spies          and had sheltered them             and why need i say more   for time will fail me if i tell          the story of gideon  barak  samson  jephthah  and of david          and samuel and the prophets             men who  as the result of faith  conquered whole kingdoms           brought about true justice  obtained promises from god           stopped lions  mouths             deprived fire of its power  escaped being killed by the sword           out of weakness were made strong  became mighty in war           put to flight foreign armies             women received back their dear ones alive from the dead           and others were put to death with torture  refusing the deliverance          offered to them  that they might secure a better resurrection             others again were tested by cruel mockery and by scourging           yes  and by chains and imprisonment             they were stoned  they were sawn asunder  they were          tried by temptation  they were killed with the sword           they went from place to place in sheepskins or goatskins           enduring want  oppression and cruelty              they were men of whom the world was not worthy            they wandered across deserts and mountains  or hid themselves          in caves and in holes in the ground             and although by their faith all these people won god s approval           none of them received the fulfilment of his great promise             for god had provided for them and us something better  so that          apart from us they were not to attain to full blessedness             therefore  surrounded as we are by such a vast cloud of witnesses           let us fling aside every encumbrance and the sin that so readily          entangles our feet   and let us run with patient endurance          the race that lies before us             simply fixing our gaze upon jesus  our prince leader in the faith           who will also award us the prize   he  for the sake of the joy          which lay before him  patiently endured the cross  looking with          contempt upon its shame  and afterwards seated himself            where he still sits  at the right hand of the throne of god             therefore  if you would escape becoming weary and faint hearted           compare your own sufferings with those of him who endured          such hostility directed against him by sinners             in your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted so as          to endanger your lives             and you have quite forgotten the encouraging words which are          addressed to you as sons  and which say   my son  do not          think lightly of the lord s discipline  and do not faint          when he corrects you             for those whom the lord loves he disciplines   and he scourges          every son whom he acknowledges              the sufferings that you are enduring are for your discipline           god is dealing with you as sons  for what son is there whom          his father does not discipline             and if you are left without discipline  of which every true          son has had a share  that shows that you are bastards           and not true sons             besides this  our earthly fathers used to discipline us and we          treated them with respect  and shall we not be still more          submissive to the father of our spirits  and live             it is true that they disciplined us for a few years according          as they thought fit  but he does it for our certain good           in order that we may become sharers in his own holy character             now  at the time  discipline seems to be a matter not for joy           but for grief  yet it afterwards yields to those who have passed          through its training a result full of peace  namely  righteousness             therefore strengthen the drooping hands and paralysed knees             and make straight paths for your feet  so that what is lame          may not be put entirely out of joint            but may rather be restored   persistently strive for peace          with all men  and for that growth in holiness apart from          which no one will see the lord             be carefully on your guard lest there be any one who falls          back from the grace of god  lest any root bearing bitter          fruit spring up and cause trouble among you  and through it          the whole brotherhood be defiled             lest there be a fornicator  or an ungodly person like esau           who  in return for a single meal  parted with the birthright          which belonged to him             for you know that even afterwards  when he wished to secure          the blessing  he was rejected  for he found no opportunity          for undoing what he had done  though he sought the blessing          earnestly with tears             for you have not come to a material object all ablaze with fire           and to gloom and darkness and storm and trumpet blast and          the sound of words              a sound of such a kind that those who heard it entreated          that no more should be added             for they could not endure the order which had been given            even a wild beast  if it touches the mountain  shall be          stoned to death              and so terrible was the scene that moses said   i tremble with fear              on the contrary you have come to mount zion  and to the city          of the ever living god  the heavenly jerusalem  to countless          hosts of angels             to the great festal gathering and church of the first born           whose names are recorded in heaven  and to a judge who is god          of all  and to the spirits of righteous men made perfect             and to jesus the negotiator of a new covenant  and to the sprinkled          blood which speaks in more gracious tones than that of abel             be careful not to refuse to listen to him who is speaking to you           for if they of old did not escape unpunished when they refused          to listen to him who spoke on earth  much less shall we escape          who turn a deaf ear to him who now speaks from heaven             his voice then shook the earth  but now we have his promise            yet again i will  once for all  cause not only the earth          to tremble  but heaven also              here the words  yet again  once for all  denote the removal          of the things which can be shaken  created things  in order          that the things which cannot be shaken may remain             therefore  receiving  as we now do  a kingdom which cannot          be shaken  let us cherish thankfulness so that we may ever offer          to god an acceptable service  with godly reverence and awe             for our god is also a consuming fire             let brotherly love always continue             do not neglect to show kindness to strangers  for  in this way           some  without knowing it  have had angels as their guests             remember prisoners  as if you were in prison with them           and remember those suffering ill treatment  for you yourselves          also are still in the body             let marriage be held in honour among all  and let the marriage bed          be unpolluted  for fornicators and adulterers god will judge             your lives should be untainted by love for money   be content          with what you have  for god himself has said   i will never           never let go your hand   i will never never forsake you              so that we fearlessly say   the lord is my helper  i will not          be afraid   what can man do to me              remember your former leaders  it was they who brought you          god s message   bear in mind how they ended their lives           and imitate their faith             jesus christ is the same yesterday and to day  yes  and to          the ages to come             do not be drawn aside by all sorts of strange teaching  for it          is well to have the heart made stedfast through god s grace           and not by special kinds of food  from which those who          scrupulously attend to them have derived no benefit             we christians have an altar from which the ministers of          the jewish tent have no right to eat             for the bodies of those animals of which the blood is carried          by the high priest into the holy place as an offering for sin           are burned outside the camp             and for this reason jesus also  in order  by his own blood           to set the people free from sin  suffered outside the gate             therefore let us go to him outside the camp  sharing the insults          directed against him             for we have no permanent city here  but we are longing for          the city which is soon to be ours             through him  then  let us continually lay on the altar          a sacrifice of praise to god  namely  the utterance of lips          that give thanks to his name             and do not forget to be kind and liberal  for with sacrifices          of that sort god is greatly pleased             obey your leaders and be submissive to them   for they are keeping          watch over your souls as those who will have to give account           that they may do this with joy and not with lamentation           for that would be of no advantage to you             keep on praying for us  for we are sure that we have clear          consciences  and we desire to live nobly in every respect             i specially urge this upon you in order that i may be the more          speedily restored to you             now may god who gives peace  and brought jesus  our lord           up again from among the dead  even him who  by virtue          of the blood of the eternal covenant  is the great shepherd          of the sheep              fully equip you with every grace that you may need for the doing          of his will  producing in us that which will truly please          him through jesus christ   to him be the glory to the ages          of the ages   amen             bear with me  brethren  when i thus exhort you  for  in fact           it is but a short letter that i have written to you             you will rejoice to hear that our brother timothy has been set          at liberty   if he comes soon  i will see you with him             greet all your leaders and all god s people   the brethren          from italy send you greetings             grace be with you all   amen

speed  it  was not long before they were again passing lucy s beautiful house   and here george thought fit to put an appendix to his remark   you re a  funny girl  and you know a lot  but i don t believe you know much about  architecture      coming toward them  black against the snowy road  was a strange  silhouette  it approached moderately and without visible means of  progression  so the matter seemed from a distance  but as the cutter  shortened the distance  the silhouette was revealed to be mr  morgan s  horseless carriage  conveying four people atop  mr  morgan with george s  mother beside him  and  in the rear seat  miss fanny minafer and the  honorable george amberson  all four seemed to be in the liveliest  humour  like high spirited people upon a new adventure  and isabel waved  her handkerchief dashingly as the cutter flashed by them      for the lord s sake   george gasped      your mother s a dear   said lucy   and she does wear the most  bewitching things  she looked like a russian princess  though i doubt if  they re that handsome      george said nothing  he drove on till they had crossed amberson addition  and reached the stone pillars at the head of national avenue  there he  turned      let s go back and take another look at that old sewing machine   he  said   it certainly is the weirdest  craziest       he left the sentence unfinished  and presently they were again in sight  of the old sewing machine  george shouted mockingly     alas  three figures stood in the road  and a pair of legs  with the toes  turned up  indicated that a fourth figure lay upon its back in the snow   beneath a horseless carriage that had decided to need a horse     george became vociferous with laughter  and coming up at his trotter s  best gait  snow spraying from runners and every hoof  swerved to the  side of the road and shot by  shouting   git a hoss  git a hoss  git a  hoss      three hundred yards away he turned and came back  racing  leaning out  as he passed  to wave jeeringly at the group about the disabled machine    git a hoss  git a hoss  git a       the trotter had broken into a gallop  and lucy cried a warning   be  careful   she said   look where you re driving  there s a ditch on that  side  look       george turned too late  the cutter s right runner went into the ditch  and snapped off  the little sleigh upset  and  after dragging its  occupants some fifteen yards  left them lying together in a bank  of snow  then the vigorous young horse kicked himself free of all  annoyances  and disappeared down the road  galloping cheerfully           chapter viii        when george regained some measure of his presence of mind  miss lucy  morgan s cheek  snowy and cold  was pressing his nose slightly to one  side  his right arm was firmly about her neck  and a monstrous amount  of her fur boa seemed to mingle with an equally unplausible quantity of  snow in his mouth  he was confused  but conscious of no objection to any  of these juxtapositions  she was apparently uninjured  for she sat up   hatless  her hair down  and said mildly      good heavens      though her father had been under his machine when they passed  he  was the first to reach them  he threw himself on his knees beside his  daughter  but found her already laughing  and was reassured   they re  all right   he called to isabel  who was running toward them  ahead of  her brother and fanny minafer   this snowbank s a feather bed  nothing  the matter with them at all  don t look so pale       georgie   she gasped   georgie      georgie was on his feet  snow all over him      don t make a fuss  mother  nothing s the matter  that darned silly  horse       sudden tears stood in isabel s eyes   to see you down  underneath  dragging  oh    then with shaking hands she began to brush  the snow from him      let me alone   he protested   you ll ruin your gloves  you re getting  snow all over you  and        no  no   she cried   you ll catch cold  you mustn t catch cold   and  she continued to brush him     amberson had brought lucy s hat  miss fanny acted as lady s maid  and  both victims of the accident were presently restored to about their  usual appearance and condition of apparel  in fact  encouraged by the  two older gentlemen  the entire party  with one exception  decided that  the episode was after all a merry one  and began to laugh about it  but  george was glummer than the december twilight now swiftly closing in      that darned horse   he said      i wouldn t bother about pendennis  georgie   said his uncle   you can  send a man out for what s left of the cutter tomorrow  and pendennis  will gallop straight home to his stable  he ll be there a long while  before we will  because all we ve got to depend on to get us home is  gene morgan s broken down chafing dish yonder      they were approaching the machine as he spoke  and his friend  again  underneath it  heard him  he emerged  smiling   she ll go   he said      what       all aboard      he offered his hand to isabel  she was smiling but still pale  and her  eyes  in spite of the smile  kept upon george in a shocked anxiety  miss  fanny had already mounted to the rear seat  and george  after helping  lucy morgan to climb up beside his aunt  was following  isabel saw  that his shoes were light things of patent leather  and that snow was  clinging to them  she made a little rush toward him  and  as one of his  feet rested on the iron step of the machine  in mounting  she began to  clean the snow from his shoe with her almost aerial lace handkerchief    you mustn t catch cold   she cried      stop that   george shouted  and furiously withdrew his foot      then stamp the snow off   she begged   you mustn t ride with wet feet       they re not   george roared  thoroughly outraged   for heaven s sake  get in  you re standing in the snow yourself  get in      isabel consented  turning to morgan  whose habitual expression of  apprehensiveness was somewhat accentuated  he climbed up after her   george amberson having gone to the other side   you re the same isabel  i used to know   he said in a low voice   you re a divinely ridiculous  woman       am i  eugene   she said  not displeased    divinely  and  ridiculous   just counterbalance each other  don t they  plus one and minus one equal  nothing  so you mean i m nothing in particular       no   he answered  tugging at a lever   that doesn t seem to be  precisely what i meant  there   this exclamation referred to the  subterranean machinery  for dismaying sounds came from beneath the  floor  and the vehicle plunged  then rolled noisily forward      behold   george amberson exclaimed   she does move  it must be another  accident       accident   morgan shouted over the din   no  she breathes  she stirs   she seems to feel a thrill of life along her keel   and he began to sing   the star spangled banner      amberson joined him lustily  and sang on when morgan stopped  the  twilight sky cleared  discovering a round moon already risen  and the  musical congressman hailed this bright presence with the complete text  and melody of  the danube river      his nephew  behind  was gloomy  he had overheard his mother s  conversation with the inventor  it seemed curious to him that this  morgan  of whom he had never heard until last night  should be using the  name  isabel  so easily  and george felt that it was not just the thing  for his mother to call morgan  eugene   the resentment of the previous  night came upon george again  meanwhile  his mother and morgan continued  their talk  but he could no longer hear what they said  the noise of  the car and his uncle s songful mood prevented  he marked how animated  isabel seemed  it was not strange to see his mother so gay  but it was  strange that a man not of the family should be the cause of her gaiety   and george sat frowning     fanny minafer had begun to talk to lucy   your father wanted to prove  that his horseless carriage would run  even in the snow   she said   it  really does  too       of course       it s so interesting  he s been telling us how he s going to change it   he says he s going to have wheels all made of rubber and blown up with  air  i don t understand what he means at all  i should think they d  explode  but eugene seems to be very confident  he always was confident   though  it seems so like old times to hear him talk      she became thoughtful  and lucy turned to george   you tried to swing  underneath me and break the fall for me when we went over   she said   i  knew you were doing that  and  it was nice of you       wasn t any fall to speak of   he returned brusquely   couldn t have  hurt either of us       still it was friendly of you  and awfully quick  too  i ll not  i ll  not forget it      her voice had a sound of genuineness  very pleasant  and george began to  forget his annoyance with her father  this annoyance of his had not  been alleviated by the circumstance that neither of the seats of the  old sewing machine was designed for three people  but when his neighbour  spoke thus gratefully  he no longer minded the crowding  in fact  it  pleased him so much that he began to wish the old sewing machine would  go even slower  and she had spoken no word of blame for his letting that  darned horse get the cutter into the ditch  george presently addressed  her hurriedly  almost tremulously  speaking close to her ear      i forgot to tell you something  you re pretty nice  i thought so the  first second i saw you last night  i ll come for you tonight and take  you to the assembly at the amberson hotel  you re going  aren t you       yes  but i m going with papa and the sharons i ll see you there       looks to me as if you were awfully conventional   george grumbled  and  his disappointment was deeper than he was willing to let her see  though  she probably did see   well  we ll dance the cotillion together   anyhow       i m afraid not  i promised mr  kinney       what   george s tone was shocked  as at incredible news   well  you  could break that engagement  i guess  if you wanted to  girls always can  get out of things when they want to  won t you       i don t think so       why not       because i promised him  several days ago      george gulped  and lowered his pride   i don t  oh  look here  i only  want to go to that thing tonight to get to see something of you  and if  you don t dance the cotillion with me  how can i  i ll only be here two  weeks  and the others have got all the rest of your visit to see you   won t you do it  please       i couldn t       see here   said the stricken george   if you re going to decline to  dance that cotillion with me simply because you ve promised a  a  a  miserable red headed outsider like fred kinney  why we might as well  quit       quit what       you know perfectly well what i mean   he said huskily      i don t       well  you ought to       but i don t at all      george  thoroughly hurt  and not a little embittered  expressed himself  in a short outburst of laughter   well  i ought to have seen it       seen what       that you might turn out to be a girl who d like a fellow of the  red headed kinney sort  i ought to have seen it from the first      lucy bore her disgrace lightly   oh  dancing a cotillion with a person  doesn t mean that you like him  but i don t see anything in particular  the matter with mr  kinney  what is       if you don t see anything the matter with him for yourself   george  responded  icily   i don t think pointing it out would help you  you  probably wouldn t understand       you might try   she suggested   of course i m a stranger here  and if  people have done anything wrong or have something unpleasant about  them  i wouldn t have any way of knowing it  just at first  if poor mr   kinney        i prefer not to discuss it   said george curtly   he s an enemy of  mine       why       i prefer not to discuss it       well  but        i prefer not to discuss it       very well   she began to hum the air of the song which mr  george  amberson was now discoursing   o moon of my delight that knows no  wane   and there was no further conversation on the back seat     they had entered amberson addition  and the moon of mr  amberson s  delight was overlaid by a slender gothic filagree  the branches that  sprang from the shade trees lining the street  through the windows of  many of the houses rosy lights were flickering  and silver tinsel and  evergreen wreaths and brilliant little glass globes of silver and wine  colour could be seen  and glimpses were caught of christmas trees  with  people decking them by firelight  reminders that this was christmas eve   the ride stealers had disappeared from the highway  though now and then   over the gasping and howling of the horseless carriage  there came a  shrill jeer from some young passer by upon the sidewalk      mister  fer heaven s sake go an  git a hoss  git a hoss  git a hoss      the contrivance stopped with a heart shaking jerk before isabel s house   the gentlemen jumped down  helping isabel and fanny to descend  there  were friendly leavetakings  and one that was not precisely friendly      it s  au revoir   till to night  isn t it   lucy asked  laughing      good afternoon   said george  and he did not wait  as his relatives  did  to see the old sewing machine start briskly down the street  toward  the sharons   its lighter load consisting now of only mr  morgan and his  daughter  george went into the house at once     he found his father reading the evening paper in the library   where are  your mother and your aunt fanny   mr  minafer inquired  not looking up      they re coming   said his son  and  casting himself heavily into a  chair  stared at the fire     his prediction was verified a few moments later  the two ladies came  in cheerfully  unfastening their fur cloaks   it s all right  georgie    said isabel   your uncle george called to us that pendennis got home  safely  put your shoes close to the fire  dear  or else go and change  them   she went to her husband and patted him lightly on the shoulder   an action which george watched with sombre moodiness   you might dress  before long   she suggested   we re all going to the assembly  after  dinner  aren t we  brother george said he d go with us       look here   said george abruptly   how about this man morgan and his  old sewing machine  doesn t he want to get grandfather to put money into  it  isn t he trying to work uncle george for that  isn t that what he s  up to      it was miss fanny who responded   you little silly   she cried  with  surprising sharpness   what on earth are you talking about  eugene  morgan s perfectly able to finance his own inventions these days       i ll bet he borrows money of uncle george   the nephew insisted     isabel looked at him in grave perplexity   why do you say such a thing   george   she asked      he strikes me as that sort of man   he answered doggedly   isn t he   father      minafer set down his paper for the moment   he was a fairly wild young  fellow twenty years ago   he said  glancing at his wife absently   he  was like you in one thing  georgie  he spent too much money  only he  didn t have any mother to get money out of a grandfather for him  so he  was usually in debt  but i believe i ve heard he s done fairly well of  late years  no  i can t say i think he s a swindler  and i doubt if he  needs anybody else s money to back his horseless carriage       well  what s he brought the old thing here for  then  people that  own elephants don t take them elephants around with  em when they go  visiting  what s he got it here for       i m sure i don t know   said mr  minafer  resuming his paper   you  might ask him      isabel laughed  and patted her husband s shoulder again   aren t you  going to dress  aren t we all going to the dance      he groaned faintly   aren t your brother and georgie escorts enough for  you and fanny       wouldn t you enjoy it at all       you know i don t      isabel let her hand remain upon his shoulder a moment longer  she stood  behind him  looking into the fire  and george  watching her broodingly   thought there was more colour in her face than the reflection of the  flames accounted for   well  then   she said indulgently   stay at home  and be happy  we won t urge you if you d really rather not       i really wouldn t   he said contentedly     half an hour later  george was passing through the upper hall  in a  bath robe stage of preparation for the evening s  gaieties  when he  encountered his aunt fanny  he stopped her   look here   he said      what in the world is the matter with you   she demanded  regarding  him with little amiability   you look as if you were rehearsing for a  villain in a play  do change your expression      his expression gave no sign of yielding to the request  on the contrary   its somberness deepened   i suppose you don t know why father doesn t  want to go tonight   he said solemnly   you re his only sister  and yet  you don t know       he never wants to go anywhere that i ever heard of   said fanny   what  is the matter with you       he doesn t want to go because he doesn t like this man morgan       good gracious   fanny cried impatiently   eugene morgan isn t in your  father s thoughts at all  one way or the other  why should he be      george hesitated   well  it strikes me  look here  what makes you  and  and everybody  so excited over him       excited   she jeered   can t people be glad to see an old friend  without silly children like you having to make a to do about it  i ve  just been in your mother s room suggesting that she might give a little  dinner for them        for who       for whom  georgie  for mr  morgan and his daughter       look here   george said quickly   don t do that  mother mustn t do  that  it wouldn t look well       wouldn t look well   fanny mocked him  and her suppressed vehemence  betrayed a surprising acerbity   see here  georgie minafer  i suggest  that you just march straight on into your room and finish your dressing   sometimes you say things that show you have a pretty mean little mind      george was so astounded by this outburst that his indignation was  delayed by his curiosity   why  what upsets you this way   he inquired      i know what you mean   she said  her voice still lowered  but not  decreasing in sharpness   you re trying to insinuate that i d get  your mother to invite eugene morgan here on my account because he s a  widower       i am   george gasped  nonplussed   i m trying to insinuate that you re  setting your cap at him and getting mother to help you  is that what you  mean      beyond a doubt that was what miss fanny meant  she gave him a white hot  look   you attend to your own affairs   she whispered fiercely  and  swept away     george  dumfounded  returned to his room for meditation     he had lived for years in the same house with his aunt fanny  and it  now appeared that during all those years he had been thus intimately  associating with a total stranger  never before had he met the  passionate lady with whom he had just held a conversation in the hall   so she wanted to get married  and wanted george s mother to help her  with this horseless carriage widower      well  i will be shot   he muttered aloud   i will  i certainly will be  shot   and he began  to laugh   lord  lmighty      but presently  at the thought of the horseless carriage widower s  daughter  his grimness returned  and he resolved upon a line of conduct  for the evening  he would nod to her carelessly when he first saw her   and  after that  he would notice her no more  he would not dance with  her  he would not favour her in the cotillion  he would not go near her     he descended to dinner upon the third urgent summons of a coloured  butler  having spent two hours dressing  and rehearsing           chapter ix      the honourable george amberson was a congressman who led cotillions  the  sort of congressman an amberson would be  he did it negligently   tonight  yet with infallible dexterity  now and then glancing humorously  at the spectators  people of his own age  they were seated in a tropical  grove at one end of the room whither they had retired at the beginning  of the cotillion  which they surrendered entirely to the twenties and  the late  teens  and here  grouped with that stately pair  sydney and  amelia amberson  sat isabel with fanny  while eugene morgan appeared to  bestow an amiable devotion impartially upon the three sisters in law   fanny watched his face eagerly  laughing at everything he said  amelia  smiled blandly  but rather because of graciousness than because of  interest  while isabel  looking out at the dancers  rhythmically moved a  great fan of blue ostrich feathers  listened to eugene thoughtfully  yet  all the while kept her shining eyes on georgie     georgie had carried out his rehearsed projects with precision  he had  given miss morgan a nod studied into perfection during his lengthy  toilet before dinner   oh  yes  i do seem to remember that curious  little outsider   this nod seemed to say  thereafter  all cognizance  of her evaporated  the curious little outsider was permitted no further  existence worth the struggle  nevertheless  she flashed in the corner  of his eye too often  he was aware of her dancing demurely  and of her  viciously flirtatious habit of never looking up at her partner   but keeping her eyes concealed beneath downcast lashes  and he had  over sufficient consciousness of her between the dances  though it was  not possible to see her at these times  even if he had cared to look  frankly in her direction  she was invisible in a thicket of young  dresscoats  the black thicket moved as she moved and her location was  hatefully apparent  even if he had not heard her voice laughing from the  thicket  it was annoying how her voice  though never loud  pursued him   no matter how vociferous were other voices  all about  he seemed unable  to prevent himself from constantly recognizing hers  it had a quaver in  it  not pathetic  rather humorous than pathetic  a quality which annoyed  him to the point of rage  because it was so difficult to get away from   she seemed to be having a  wonderful time      an unbearable soreness accumulated in his chest  his dislike of the girl  and her conduct increased until he thought of leaving this sickening  assembly and going home to bed  that would show her  but just then  he heard her laughing  and decided that it wouldn t show her  so he  remained     when the young couples seated themselves in chairs against the walls   round three sides of the room  for the cotillion  george joined  a brazen faced group clustering about the doorway  youths with no  partners  yet eligible to be  called out  and favoured  he marked that  his uncle placed the infernal kinney and miss morgan  as the leading  couple  in the first chairs at the head of the line upon the leader s  right  and this disloyalty on the part of uncle george was inexcusable   for in the family circle the nephew had often expressed his opinion  of fred kinney  in his bitterness  george uttered a significant  monosyllable     the music flourished  whereupon mr  kinney  miss morgan  and six of  their neighbours rose and waltzed knowingly  mr  amberson s whistle  blew   then the eight young people went to the favour table and were  given toys and trinkets wherewith to delight the new partners it was now  their privilege to select  around the walls  the seated non participants  in this ceremony looked rather conscious  some chattered  endeavouring  not to appear expectant  some tried not to look wistful  and others were  frankly solemn  it was a trying moment  and whoever secured a favour   this very first shot  might consider the portents happy for a successful  evening     holding their twinkling gewgaws in their hands  those about to bestow  honour came toward the seated lines  where expressions became  feverish  two of the approaching girls seemed to wander  not finding a  predetermined object in sight  and these two were janie sharon  and her  cousin  lucy  at this  george amberson minafer  conceiving that he had  little to anticipate from either  turned a proud back upon the room and  affected to converse with his friend  mr  charlie johnson     the next moment a quick little figure intervened between the two  it was  lucy  gaily offering a silver sleighbell decked with white ribbon      i almost couldn t find you   she cried     george stared  took her hand  led her forth in silence  danced with her   she seemed content not to talk  but as the whistle blew  signalling that  this episode was concluded  and he conducted her to her seat  she lifted  the little bell toward him   you haven t taken your favour  you re  supposed to pin it on your coat   she said   don t you want it       if you insist   said george stiffly  and he bowed her into her chair   then turned and walked away  dropping the sleighbell haughtily into his  trousers  pocket     the figure proceeded to its conclusion  and george was given other  sleighbells  which he easily consented to wear upon his lapel  but  as  the next figure  began  he strolled with a bored air to the tropical  grove  where sat his elders  and seated himself beside his uncle sydney   his mother leaned across miss fanny  raising her voice over the music to  speak to him      georgie  nobody will be able to see you here  you ll not be favoured   you ought to be where you can dance       don t care to   he returned   bore       but you ought    she stopped and laughed  waving her fan to direct his  attention behind him   look  over your shoulder      he turned  and discovered miss lucy morgan in the act of offering him a  purple toy balloon      i found you   she laughed     george was startled   well    he said      would you rather  sit it out    lucy asked quickly  as he did not move    i don t care to dance if you        no   he said  rising   it would be better to dance   his tone was  solemn  and solemnly he departed with her from the grove  solemnly he  danced with her     four times  with not the slightest encouragement  she brought him a  favour   four times in succession  when the fourth came   look here    said george huskily   you going to keep this up all night  what do you  mean by it      for an instant she seemed confused   that s what cotillions are for   aren t they   she murmured      what do you mean  what they re for       so that a girl can dance with a person she wants to      george s huskiness increased   well  do you mean you  you want to dance  with me all the time  all evening       well  this much of it  evidently   she laughed      is it because you thought i tried to keep you from getting hurt this  afternoon when we upset      she shook her head      was it because you want to even things up for making me angry  i mean   for hurting my feelings on the way home      with her eyes averted  for girls of nineteen can be as shy as boys   sometimes  she said   well  you only got angry because i couldn t dance  the cotillion with you  i  i didn t feel terribly hurt with you for  getting angry about that       was there any other reason  did my telling you i liked you have  anything to do with it      she looked up gently  and  as george met her eyes  something exquisitely  touching  yet queerly delightful  gave him a catch in the throat  she  looked instantly away  and  turning  ran out from the palm grove  where  they stood  to the dancing floor      come on   she cried   let s dance      he followed her      see here  i  i    he stammered   you mean  do you        no  no   she laughed   let s dance      he put his arm about her almost tremulously  and they began to waltz  it  was a happy dance for both of them     christmas day is the children s  but the holidays are youth s  dancing time  the holidays belong to the early twenties and the  teens   home from school and college  these years possess the holidays for a  little while  then possess them only in smiling  wistful memories of  holly and twinkling lights and dance music  and charming faces  all aglow  it is the liveliest time in life  the happiest of the  irresponsible times in life  mothers echo its happiness  nothing is like  a mother who has a son home from college  except another mother with a  son home from college  bloom does actually come upon these mothers  it  is a visible thing  and they run like girls  walk like athletes  laugh  like sycophants  yet they give up their sons to the daughters of other  mothers  and find it proud rapture enough to be allowed to sit and  watch     thus isabel watched george and lucy dancing  as together they danced  away the holidays of that year into the past      they seem to get along better than they did at first  those two  children   fanny minafer said sitting beside her at the sharons  dance   a week after the assembly   they seemed to be always having little  quarrels of some sort  at first  at least george did  he seemed to be  continually pecking at that lovely  dainty  little lucy  and being cross  with her over nothing       pecking   isabel laughed   what a word to use about georgie  i think i  never knew a more angelically amiable disposition in my life      miss fanny echoed her sister in law s laugh  but it was a rueful echo   and not sweet   he s amiable to you   she said   that s all the side of  him you ever happen to see  and why wouldn t he be amiable to anybody  that simply fell down and worshipped him every minute of her life  most  of us would       isn t he worth worshipping  just look at him  isn t he charming with  lucy  see how hard he ran to get it when she dropped her handkerchief  back there       oh  i m not going to argue with you about george   said miss fanny    i m fond enough of him  for that matter  he can be charming  and he s  certainly stunning looking  if only        let the  if only  go  dear   isabel suggested good naturedly   let s  talk about that dinner you thought i should        i   miss fanny interrupted quickly   didn t you want to give it  yourself       indeed  i did  my dear   said isabel heartily   i only meant that  unless you had proposed it  perhaps i wouldn t       but here eugene came for her to dance  and she left the sentence  uncompleted  holiday dances can be happy for youth renewed as well as  for youth in bud  and yet it was not with the air of a rival that miss  fanny watched her brother s wife dancing with the widower  miss fanny s  eyes narrowed a little  but only as if her mind engaged in a hopeful  calculation  she looked pleased           chapter x        a few days after george s return to the university it became evident  that not quite everybody had gazed with complete benevolence upon the  various young collegians at their holiday sports  the sunday edition  of the principal morning paper even expressed some bitterness under the  heading   gilded youths of the fin de siecle   this was considered the  knowing phrase of the time  especially for sunday supplements  and there  is no doubt that from certain references in this bit of writing some  people drew the conclusion that mr  george amberson minafer had not yet  got his comeuppance  a postponement still irritating  undeniably  fanny  minafer was one of the people who drew this conclusion  for she cut the  article out and enclosed it in a letter to her nephew  having written on  the border of the clipping   i wonder whom it can mean      george read part of it     we debate sometimes what is to be the future of this nation when we  think that in a few years public affairs may be in the hands of the  fin de siecle gilded youths we see about us during the christmas  holidays  such foppery  such luxury  such insolence  was surely never  practised by the scented  overbearing patricians of the palatine  even  in rome s most decadent epoch  in all the wild orgy of wastefulness and  luxury with which the nineteenth century reaches its close  the gilded  youth has been surely the worst symptom  with his airs of young milord   his fast horses  his gold and silver cigarette cases  his clothes from  a new york tailor  his recklessness of money showered upon him by  indulgent mothers or doting grandfathers  he respects nothing and  nobody  he is blase if you please  watch him at a social function how  condescendingly he deigns to select a partner for the popular waltz or  two step how carelessly he shoulders older people out of his way  with  what a blank stare he returns the salutation of some old acquaintance  whom he may choose in his royal whim to forget  the unpleasant part  of all this is that the young women he so condescendingly selects as  partners for the dance greet him with seeming rapture  though in their  hearts they must feel humiliated by his languid hauteur  and many older  people beam upon him almost fawningly if he unbends so far as to throw  them a careless  disdainful word     one wonders what has come over the new generation  of such as these the  republic was not made  let us pray that the future of our country is  not in the hands of these fin de siecle gilded youths  but rather in the  calloused palms of young men yet unknown  labouring upon the farms of  the land  when we compare the young manhood of abraham lincoln with the  specimens we are now producing  we see too well that it bodes ill for  the twentieth century      george yawned  and tossed the clipping into his waste basket  wondering  why his aunt thought such dull nonsense worth the sending  as for her  insinuation  pencilled upon the border  he supposed she meant to joke  a  supposition which neither surprised him nor altered his lifelong opinion  of her wit     he read her letter with more interest     the dinner your mother gave for the morgans was a lovely affair  it was  last monday evening  just ten days after you left  it was peculiarly  appropriate that your mother should give this dinner  because her  brother george  your uncle  was mr  morgan s most intimate friend before  he left here a number of years ago  and it was a pleasant occasion for  the formal announcement of some news which you heard from lucy morgan  before you returned to college  at least she told me she had told you  the night before you left that her father had decided to return here to  live  it was appropriate that your mother  herself an old friend  should  assemble a representative selection of mr  morgan s old friends around  him at such a time  he was in great spirits and most entertaining   as your time was so charmingly taken up during your visit home with a  younger member of his family  you probably overlooked opportunities of  hearing him talk  and do not know what an interesting man he can be     he will soon begin to build his factory here for the manufacture  of automobiles  which he says is a term he prefers to  horseless  carriages   your uncle george told me he would like to invest in this  factory  as george thinks there is a future for automobiles  perhaps  not for general use  but as an interesting novelty  which people with  sufficient means would like to own for their amusement and the sake of  variety  however  he said mr  morgan laughingly declined his offer  as  mr  m  was fully able to finance this venture  though not starting in  a very large way  your uncle said other people are manufacturing  automobiles in different parts of the country with success  your father  is not very well  though he is not actually ill  and the doctor tells  him he ought not to be so much at his office  as the long years of  application indoors with no exercise are beginning to affect him  unfavourably  but i believe your father would die if he had to give  up his work  which is all that has ever interested him outside of his  family  i never could understand it  mr  morgan took your mother and me  with lucy to see modjeska in  twelfth night  yesterday evening  and  lucy said she thought the duke looked rather like you  only much more  democratic in his manner  i suppose you will think i have written a  great deal about the morgans in this letter  but thought you would be  interested because of your interest in a younger member of his family   hoping that you are finding college still as attractive as ever                  affectionately                           aunt fanny     george read one sentence in this letter several times  then he dropped  the missive in his wastebasket to join the clipping  and strolled down  the corridor of his dormitory to borrow a copy of  twelfth night    having secured one  he returned to his study and refreshed his memory of  the play  but received no enlightenment that enabled him to comprehend  lucy s strange remark  however  he found himself impelled in the  direction of correspondence  and presently wrote a letter  not a reply  to his aunt fanny     dear lucy  no doubt you will be surprised at hearing from me so soon  again  especially as this makes two in answer to the one received from  you since getting back to the old place  i hear you have been making  comments about me at the theatre  that some actor was more democratic in  his manners than i am  which i do not understand  you know my theory of  life because i explained it to you on our first drive together  when i  told you i would not talk to everybody about things i feel like the way  i spoke to you of my theory of life  i believe those who are able should  have a true theory of life  and i developed my theory of life long  long  ago     well  here i sit smoking my faithful briar pipe  indulging in the  fragrance of my tobacco as i look out on the campus from my many paned  window  and things are different with me from the way they were way back  in freshman year  i can see now how boyish in many ways i was then  i  believe what has changed me as much as anything was my visit home at the  time i met you  so i sit here with my faithful briar and dream the old  dreams over as it were  dreaming of the waltzes we waltzed together and  of that last night before we parted  and you told me the good news you  were going to live there  and i would find my friend waiting for me   when i get home next summer     i will be glad my friend will be waiting for me  i am not capable of  friendship except for the very few  and  looking back over my life   i remember there were times when i doubted if i could feel a great  friendship for anybody  especially girls  i do not take a great interest  in many people  as you know  for i find most of them shallow  here in  the old place i do not believe in being hail fellow well met with every  tom  dick  and harry just because he happens to be a classmate  any more  than i do at home  where i have always been careful who i was seen with   largely on account of the family  but also because my disposition ever  since my boyhood has been to encourage real intimacy from but the few     what are you reading now  i have finished both  henry esmond  and  the  virginians   i like thackeray because he is not trashy  and because he  writes principally of nice people  my theory of literature is an author  who does not indulge in trashiness  writes about people you could  introduce into your own home  i agree with my uncle sydney  as i once  heard him say he did not care to read a book or go to a play about  people he would not care to meet at his own dinner table  i believe we  should live by certain standards and ideals  as you know from my telling  you my theory of life     well  a letter is no place for deep discussions  so i will not go into  the subject  from several letters from my mother  and one from aunt  fanny  i hear you are seeing a good deal of the family since i left   i hope sometimes you think of the member who is absent  i got a silver  frame for your photograph in new york  and i keep it on my desk  it  is the only girl s photograph i ever took the trouble to have framed   though  as i told you frankly  i have had any number of other girls   photographs  yet all were only passing fancies  and oftentimes i have  questioned in years past if i was capable of much friendship toward the  feminine sex  which i usually found shallow until our own friendship  began  when i look at your photograph  i say to myself   at last  at  last here is one that will not prove shallow      my faithful briar has gone out  i will have to rise and fill it  then  once more in the fragrance of my lady nicotine  i will sit and dream the  old dreams over  and think  too  of the true friend at home awaiting my  return in june for the summer vacation                  friend  this is from your friend                                               g a m       george s anticipations were not disappointed  when he came home in june  his friend was awaiting him  at least  she was so pleased to see him  again that for a few minutes after their first encounter she was a  little breathless  and a great deal glowing  and quiet withal  their  sentimental friendship continued  though sometimes he was irritated by  her making it less sentimental than he did  and sometimes by what he  called her  air of superiority   her air was usually  in truth  that  of a fond but amused older sister  and george did not believe such an  attitude was warranted by her eight months of seniority     lucy and her father were living at the amberson hotel  while morgan got  his small machine shops built in a western outskirt of the town  and  george grumbled about the shabbiness and the old fashioned look of  the hotel  though it was  still the best in the place  of course   he  remonstrated with his grandfather  declaring that the whole amberson  estate would be getting  run down and out at heel  if things weren t  taken in hand pretty soon   he urged the general need of rebuilding   renovating  varnishing  and lawsuits  but the major  declining to hear  him out  interrupted querulously  saying that he had enough to bother  him without any advice from george  and retired to his library  going so  far as to lock the door audibly      second childhood   george muttered  shaking his head  and he thought  sadly that the major had not long to live  however  this surmise  depressed him for only a moment or so  of course  people couldn t be  expected to live forever  and it would be a good thing to have someone  in charge of the estate who wouldn t let it get to looking so rusty that  riffraff dared to make fun of it  for george had lately undergone the  annoyance of calling upon the morgans  in the rather stuffy red velours  and gilt parlour of their apartment at the hotel  one evening when mr   frederick kinney also was a caller  and mr  kinney had not been tactful   in fact  though he adopted a humorous tone of voice  in expressing his   sympathy for people who  through the city s poverty in hotels  were  obliged to stay at the amberson  mr  kinney s intention was interpreted  by the other visitor as not at all humorous  but  on the contrary   personal and offensive     george rose abruptly  his face the colour of wrath   good night  miss  morgan  good night  mr  morgan   he said   i shall take pleasure in  calling at some other time when a more courteous sort of people may be  present       look here   the hot headed fred burst out   don t you try to make me  out a boor  george minafer  i wasn t hinting anything at you  i simply  forgot all about your grandfather owning this old building  don t you  try to put me in the light of a boor  i won t       but george walked out in the very course of this vehement protest  and  it was necessarily left unfinished     mr  kinney remained only a few moments after george s departure  and as  the door closed upon him  the distressed lucy turned to her father   she was plaintively surprised to find him in a condition of immoderate  laughter      i didn t  i didn t think i could hold out   he gasped  and  after  choking until tears came to his eyes  felt blindly for the chair from  which he had risen to wish mr  kinney an indistinct good night  his  hand found the arm of the chair  he collapsed feebly  and sat uttering  incoherent sounds      papa       it brings things back so   he managed to explain   this very fred  kinney s father and young george s father  wilbur minafer  used to do  just such things when they were at that age  and  for that matter  so  did george amberson and i  and all the rest of us   and  in spite of his  exhaustion  he began to imitate   don t you try to put me in the light  of a boor    i shall take pleasure in calling at some time when a more  courteous sort of people    he was unable to go on     there is a mirth for every age  and lucy failed to comprehend her  father s  but tolerated it a little ruefully      papa  i think they were shocking  weren t they awful       just  just boys   he moaned  wiping his eyes  but lucy could not smile  at all  she was beginning to look indignant   i can forgive that poor  fred kinney   she said   he s just blundering  but george  oh  george  behaved outrageously       it s a difficult age   her father observed  his calmness somewhat  restored   girls don t seem to have to pass through it quite as boys do   or their savoir faire is instinctive  or something   and he gave away to  a return of his convulsion     she came and sat upon the arm of his chair   papa  why should george  behave like that       he s sensitive       rather  but why is he  he does anything he likes to  without any regard  for what people think  then why should he mind so furiously when  the least little thing reflects upon him  or on anything or anybody  connected with him      eugene patted her hand   that s one of the greatest puzzles of human  vanity  dear  and i don t pretend to know the answer  in all my life   the most arrogant people that i ve known have been the most sensitive   the people who have done the most in contempt of other people s opinion   and who consider themselves the highest above it  have been the most  furious if it went against them  arrogant and domineering people can t  stand the least  lightest  faintest breath of criticism  it just kills  them       papa  do you think george is arrogant and domineering       oh  he s still only a boy   said eugene consolingly   there s plenty  of fine stuff in him  can t help but be  because he s isabel amberson s  son      lucy stroked his hair  which was still almost as dark as her own   you  liked her pretty well once  i guess  papa       i do still   he said quietly      she s lovely  lovely  papa    she paused  then continued   i wonder  sometimes        what       i wonder just how she happened to marry mr  minafer       oh  minafer s all right   said eugene   he s a quiet sort of man  but  he s a good man and a kind man  he always was  and those things count       but in a way  well  i ve heard people say there wasn t anything to him  at all except business and saving money  miss fanny minafer herself told  me that everything george and his mother have of their own  that is   just to spend as they like  she says it has always come from major  amberson       thrift  horatio   said eugene lightly   thrift s an inheritance  and a  common enough one here  the people who settled the country had to save   so making and saving were taught as virtues  and the people  to the  third generation  haven t found out that making and saving are only  means to an end  minafer doesn t believe in money being spent  he  believes god made it to be invested and saved       but george isn t saving  he s reckless  and even if he is arrogant and  conceited and bad tempered  he s awfully generous       oh  he s an amberson   said her father   the ambersons aren t saving   they re too much the other way  most of them       i don t think i should have called george bad tempered   lucy said  thoughtfully   no  i don t think he is       only when he s cross about something   morgan suggested  with a  semblance of sympathetic gravity      yes   she said brightly  not perceiving that his intention was  humorous   all the rest of the time he s really very amiable  of course   he s much more a perfect child  the whole time  than he realizes  he  certainly behaved awfully to night   she jumped up  her indignation  returning   he did  indeed  and it won t do to encourage him in it  i  think he ll find me pretty cool  for a week or so      whereupon her father suffered a renewal of his attack of uproarious  laughter           chapter xi        in the matter of coolness  george met lucy upon her own predetermined  ground  in fact  he was there first  and  at their next encounter   proved loftier and more formal than she did  their estrangement lasted  three weeks  and then disappeared without any preliminary treaty  it had  worn itself out  and they forgot it     at times  however  george found other disturbances to the friendship   lucy was  too much the village belle   he complained  and took a satiric  attitude toward his competitors  referring to them as her  local swains  and bumpkins   sulking for an afternoon when she reminded him that he   too  was at least  local   she was a belle with older people as well   isabel and fanny were continually taking her driving  bringing her home  with them to lunch or dinner  and making a hundred little engagements  with her  and the major had taken a great fancy to her  insisting upon  her presence and her father s at the amberson family dinner at the  mansion every sunday evening  she knew how to flirt with old people  he  said  as she sat next him at the table on one of these sunday occasions   and he had always liked her father  even when eugene was a  terror  long  ago   oh  yes  he was   the major laughed  when she remonstrated   he  came up here with my son george and some others for a serenade one  night  and eugene stepped into a bass fiddle  and the poor musicians  just gave up  i had a pretty half hour getting my son george upstairs   i remember  it was the last time eugene ever touched a drop  but he d  touched plenty before that  young lady  and he daren t deny it  well   well  there s another thing that s changed  hardly anybody drinks  nowadays  perhaps it s just as well  but things used to be livelier   that serenade was just before isabel was married  and don t you fret   miss lucy  your father remembers it well enough   the old gentleman  burst into laughter  and shook his finger at eugene across the table    the fact is   the major went on hilariously   i believe if eugene  hadn t broken that bass fiddle and given himself away  isabel would  never have taken wilbur  i shouldn t be surprised if that was about all  the reason that wilbur got her  what do you think  wilbur       i shouldn t be surprised   said wilbur placidly   if your notion is  right  i m glad  gene broke the fiddle  he was giving me a hard run      the major always drank three glasses of champagne at his sunday dinner   and he was finishing the third   what do you say about it  isabel  by  jove   he cried  pounding the table   she s blushing      isabel did blush  but she laughed   who wouldn t blush   she cried  and  her sister in law came to her assistance      the important thing   said fanny jovially   is that wilbur did get her   and not only got her  but kept her      eugene was as pink as isabel  but he laughed without any sign of  embarrassment other than his heightened colour   there s another  important thing  that is  for me   he said   it s the only thing that  makes me forgive that bass viol for getting in my way       what is it   the major asked      lucy   said morgan gently     isabel gave him a quick glance  all warm approval  and there was a  murmur of friendliness round the table     george was not one of those who joined in this applause  he considered  his grandfather s nonsense indelicate  even for second childhood  and he  thought that the sooner the subject was dropped the better  however  he  had only a slight recurrence of the resentment which had assailed him  during the winter at every sign of his mother s interest in morgan   though he was still ashamed of his aunt sometimes  when it seemed to him  that fanny was almost publicly throwing herself at the widower s head   fanny and he had one or two arguments in which her fierceness again  astonished and amused him      you drop your criticisms of your relatives   she bade him  hotly  one  day   and begin thinking a little about your own behaviour  you say  people will  talk  about my  about my merely being pleasant to an old  friend  what do i care how they talk  i guess if people are talking  about anybody in this family they re talking about the impertinent  little snippet that hasn t any respect for anything  and doesn t even  know enough to attend to his own affairs       snippet   aunt fanny   george laughed   how elegant  and  little  snippet   when i m over five feet eleven       i said it   she snapped  departing   i don t see how lucy can stand  you       you d make an amiable stepmother in law   he called after her   i ll be  careful about proposing to lucy      these were but roughish spots in a summer that glided by evenly and  quickly enough  for the most part  and  at the end  seemed to fly  on  the last night before george went back to be a junior  his mother asked  him confidently if it had not been a happy summer     he hadn t thought about it  he answered   oh   i suppose so  why       i just thought it would be  nice to hear you say so   she said   smiling   i mean  it s pleasant for people of my age to know that people  of your age realize that they re happy       people of your age   he repeated   you know you don t look precisely  like an old woman  mother  not precisely       no   she said   and i suppose i feel about as young as you do  inside   but it won t be many years before i must begin to look old  it does  come   she sighed  still smiling   it s seemed to me that  it must have  been a happy summer for you  a real  summer of roses and wine   without  the wine  perhaps   gather ye roses while ye may   or was it primroses   time does really fly  or perhaps it s more like the sky  and smoke       george was puzzled   what do you mean  time being like the sky and  smoke       i mean the things that we have and that we think are so solid  they re  like smoke  and time is like the sky that the smoke disappears into  you  know how wreath of smoke goes up from a chimney  and seems all thick and  black and busy against the sky  as if it were going to do such important  things and last forever  and you see it getting thinner and thinner  and  then  in such a little while  it isn t there at all  nothing is left but  the sky  and the sky keeps on being just the same forever       it strikes me you re getting mixed up   said george cheerfully   i  don t see much resemblance between time and the sky  or between things  and smoke wreaths  but i do see one reason you like  lucy morgan so  much  she talks that same kind of wistful  moony way sometimes  i don t  mean to say i mind it in either of you  because i rather like to listen  to it  and you ve got a very good voice  mother  it s nice to listen to   no matter how much smoke and sky  and so on  you talk  so s lucy s for  that matter  and i see why you re congenial  she talks that way to her  father  too  and he s right there with the same kind of guff  well  it s  all right with me   he laughed  teasingly  and allowed her to retain his  hand  which she had fondly seized   i ve got plenty to think about when  people drool along      she pressed his hand to her cheek  and a tear made a tiny warm streak  across one of his knuckles      for heaven s sake   he said   what s the matter  isn t everything all  right       you re going away       well  i m coming back  don t you suppose  is that all that worries  you      she cheered up  and smiled again  but shook her head   i never can bear  to see you go  that s the most of it  i m a little bothered about your  father  too       why       it seems to me he looks so badly  everybody thinks so       what nonsense   george laughed   he s been looking that way all summer   he isn t much different from the way he s looked all his life  that i  can see  what s the matter with him       he never talks much about his business to me but i think he s been  worrying about some investments he made last year  i think his worry has  affected his health       what investments   george demanded   he hasn t gone into mr  morgan s  automobile concern  has he       no   isabel smiled   the  automobile concern  is all eugene s  and it s  so small i understand it s taken hardly anything  no  your father  has always prided himself on making only the most absolutely safe  investments  but two or three years ago he and your uncle george both  put a great deal  pretty much everything they could get together  i  think  into the stock of rolling mills some friends of theirs owned  and  i m afraid the mills haven t been doing well       what of that  father needn t worry  you and i could take care of him  the rest of his life on what grandfather        of course   she agreed   but your father s always lived so for his  business and taken such pride in his sound investments  it s a passion  with him  i        pshaw  he needn t worry  you tell him we ll look after him  we ll build  him a little stone bank in the backyard  if he busts up  and he can go  and put his pennies in it every morning  that ll keep him just as happy  as he ever was   he kissed her   good night  i m going to tell lucy  good bye  don t sit up for me      she walked to the front gate with him  still holding his hand  and he  told her again not to  sit up  for him      yes  i will   she laughed   you won t be very late       well  it s my last night       but i know lucy  and she knows i want to see you  too  your last night   you ll see  she ll send you home promptly at eleven      but she was mistaken  lucy sent him home promptly at ten           chapter xii        isabel s uneasiness about her husband s health  sometimes reflected in  her letters to george during the winter that followed  had not been  alleviated when the accredited senior returned for his next summer  vacation  and she confided to him in his room  soon after his arrival   that  something  the doctor had said to her lately had made her more  uneasy than ever      still worrying over his rolling mills investments   george asked  not  seriously impressed      i m afraid it s past that stage from what dr rainey says  his worries  only aggravate his condition now  dr  rainey says we ought to get him  away       well  let s do it  then       he won t go       he s a man awfully set in his ways  that s true   said george   i don t  think there s anything much the matter with him  though  and he looks  just the same to me  have you seen lucy lately  how is she       hasn t she written you       oh  about once a month   he answered carelessly   never says much about  herself  how s she look       she looks  pretty   said isabel   i suppose she wrote you they ve  moved       yes  i ve got her address  she said they were building       they did  it s all finished  and they ve been in it a month  lucy is so  capable  she keeps house exquisitely  it s small  but oh  such a pretty  little house       well  that s fortunate   george said   one thing i ve always felt they  didn t know a great deal about is architecture       don t they   asked isabel  surprised   anyhow  their house is charming   it s way out beyond the end of amberson boulevard  it s quite near that  big white house with a gray green roof somebody built out there a year  or so ago  there are any number of houses going up  out that way  and  the trolley line runs within a block of them now  on the next street   and the traction people are laying tracks more than three miles beyond   i suppose you ll be driving out to see lucy to morrow       i thought    george hesitated   i thought perhaps i d go after dinner  this evening      at this his mother laughed  not astonished   it was only my feeble joke  about  to morrow   georgie  i was pretty sure you couldn t wait that  long  did lucy write you about the factory       no  what factory       the automobile shops  they had rather a dubious time at first  i m  afraid  and some of eugene s experiments turned out badly  but this  spring they ve finished eight automobiles and sold them all  and they ve  got twelve more almost finished  and they re sold already  eugene s so  gay over it       what do his old sewing machines look like  like that first one he had  when they came here       no  indeed  these have rubber tires blown up with air  pneumatic  and  they aren t so high  they re very easy to get into  and the engine s  in front  eugene thinks that s a great improvement  they re very  interesting to look at  behind the driver s seat there s a sort of box  where four people can sit  with a step and a little door in the rear   and        i know all about it   said george   i ve seen any number like that   east  you can see all you want of  em  if you stand on fifth avenue half  an hour  any afternoon  i ve seen half a dozen go by almost at the same  time  within a few minutes  anyhow  and of course electric hansoms are  a common sight there any day  i hired one  myself  the last time i was  there  how fast do mr  morgan s machines go       much too fast  it s very exhilarating  but rather frightening  and they  do make a fearful uproar  he says  though  he thinks he sees a way to  get around the noisiness in time       i don t mind the noise   said george   give me a horse  for mine   though  any day  i must get up a race with one of these things   pendennis ll leave it one mile behind in a two mile run  how s  grandfather       he looks well  but he complains sometimes of his heart  i suppose  that s natural at his age  and it s an amberson trouble   having  mentioned this  she looked anxious instantly   did you ever feel any  weakness there  georgie       no   he laughed      are you sure  dear       no   and he laughed again   did you       oh  i think not  at least  the doctor told me he thought my heart was  about all right  he said i needn t be alarmed       i should think not  women do seem to be always talking about health  i  suppose they haven t got enough else to think of       that must be it   she said gayly   we re an idle lot      george had taken off his coat   i don t like to hint to a lady   he  said   but i do want to dress before dinner       don t be long  i ve got to do a lot of looking at you  dear   she  kissed him and ran away singing     but his aunt fanny was not so fond  and at the dinner table there came  a spark of liveliness into her eye when george patronizingly asked her  what was the news in her own  particular line of sport       what do you mean  georgie   she asked quietly      oh i mean  what s the news in the fast set generally  you been causing  any divorces lately       no   said fanny  the spark in her eye getting brighter   i haven t been  causing anything       well  what s the gossip  you usually hear pretty much everything that  goes on around the nooks and crannies in this town  i hear  what s the  last from the gossips  corner  auntie      fanny dropped her eyes  and the spark was concealed  but a movement  of her lower lip betokened a tendency to laugh  as she replied   there  hasn t been much gossip lately  except the report that lucy morgan and  fred kinney are engaged  and that s quite old  by this time      undeniably  this bit of mischief was entirely successful  for there was  a clatter upon george s plate   what  what do you think you re talking  about   he gasped     miss fanny looked up innocently   about the report of lucy morgan s  engagement to fred kinney      george turned dumbly to his mother  and isabel shook her head  reassuringly   people are always starting rumours   she said   i haven t  paid any attention to this one       but you  you ve heard it   he stammered      oh  one hears all sorts of nonsense  dear  i haven t the slightest idea  that it s true       then you have heard it       i wouldn t let it take my appetite   his father suggested drily   there  are plenty of girls in the world      george turned pale      eat your dinner  georgie   his aunt said sweetly   food will do you  good  i didn t say i knew this rumour was true  i only said i d heard  it       when  when did you hear it       oh  months ago   and fanny found any further postponement of laughter  impossible      fanny  you re a hard hearted creature   isabel said gently   you really  are  don t pay any attention to her  george  fred kinney s only a clerk  in his uncle s hardware place  he couldn t marry for ages  even if  anybody would accept him      george breathed tumultuously   i don t care anything about  ages    what s that got to do with it   he said  his thoughts appearing to  be somewhat disconnected   ages   don t mean anything  i only want to  know  i want to know  i want    he stopped      what do you want   his father asked crossly      why don t you say it  don t make such a fuss       i m not  not at all   george declared  pushing his chair back from the  table      you must finish your dinner  dear   his mother urged   don t        i have finished  i ve eaten all i want  i don t want any more than  i wanted  i don t want  i    he rose  still incoherent   i prefer  i  want  please excuse me      he left the room  and a moment later the screens outside the open front  door were heard to slam      fanny  you shouldn t        isabel  don t reproach me  he did have plenty of dinner  and i only  told the truth  everybody has been saying        but there isn t any truth in it       we don t actually know there isn t   miss fanny insisted  giggling    we ve never asked lucy       i wouldn t ask her anything so absurd       george would   george s father remarked   that s what he s gone to do      mr  minafer was not mistaken  that was what his son had gone to do  lucy  and her father were just rising from their dinner table when the stirred  youth arrived at the front door of the new house  it was a cottage   however  rather than a house  and lucy had taken a free hand with the  architect  achieving results in white and green  outside  and white and  blue  inside  to such effect of youth and daintiness that her father  complained of  too much spring time   the whole place  including his own  bedroom  was a young damsel s boudoir  he said  so that nowhere could  he smoke a cigar without feeling like a ruffian  however  he was  smoking when george arrived  and he encouraged george to join him in  the pastime  but the caller  whose air was both tense and preoccupied   declined with something like agitation      i never smoke  that is  i m seldom  i mean  no thanks   he said   i  mean not at all  i d rather not       aren t you well  george   eugene asked  looking at him in perplexity    have you been overworking at college  you do look rather pa        i don t work   said george   i mean i don t work  i think  but i don t  work  i only work at the end of the term  there isn t much to do      eugene s perplexity was little decreased  and a tinkle of the door bell  afforded him obvious relief   it s my foreman   he said  looking at his  watch   i ll take him out in the yard to talk  this is no place for a  foreman   and he departed  leaving the  living room  to lucy and george   it was a pretty room  white panelled and blue curtained  and no place  for a foreman  as eugene said  there was a grand piano  and lucy stood  leaning back against it  looking intently at george  while her fingers   behind her  absently struck a chord or two  and her dress was the dress  for that room  being of blue and white  too  and the high colour in  her cheeks was far from interfering with the general harmony of  things  george saw with dismay that she was prettier than ever  and  naturally he missed the reassurance he might have felt had he been able  to guess that lucy  on her part  was finding him better looking than  ever  for  however unusual the scope of george s pride  vanity of beauty  was not included  he did not think about his looks      what s wrong  george   she asked softly      what do you mean   what s wrong       you re awfully upset about something  didn t you get though your  examination all right       certainly i did  what makes you think anything s  wrong  with me       you do look pale  as papa said  and it seemed to me that the way you  talked sounded  well  a little confused       confused   i said i didn t care to smoke  what in the world is confused  about that       nothing  but        see here   george stepped close to her   are you glad to see me       you needn t be so fierce about it   lucy protested  laughing at his  dramatic intensity   of course i am  how long have i been looking  forward to it       i don t know   he said sharply  abating nothing of his fierceness   how  long have you       why  ever since you went away       is that true  lucy  is that true       you are funny   she said   of course it s true  do tell me what s the  matter with you  george       i will   he exclaimed   i was a boy when i saw you last  i see that  now  though i didn t then  well  i m not a boy any longer  i m a man   and a man has a right to demand a totally different treatment       why has he       what       i don t seem to be able to understand you at all  george  why shouldn t  a boy be treated just as well as a man      george seemed to find himself at a loss   why shouldn t  well  he  shouldn t  because a man has a right to certain explanations       what explanations       whether he s been made a toy of   george almost shouted   that s what i  want to know      lucy shook her head despairingly   you are the queerest person  you say  you re a man now  but you talk more like a boy than ever  what does make  you so excited        excited    he stormed   do you dare to stand there and call me   excited   i tell you  i never have been more calm or calmer in my  life  i don t know that a person needs to be called  excited  because he  demands explanations that are his simple due       what in the world do you want me to explain       your conduct with fred kinney   george shouted     lucy uttered a sudden cry of laughter  she was delighted   it s been  awful   she said   i don t know that i ever heard of worse misbehaviour   papa and i have been twice to dinner with his family  and i ve been  three times to church with fred  and once to the circus  i don t know  when they ll be here to arrest me       stop that   george commanded fiercely   i want to know just one thing   and i mean to know it  too       whether i enjoyed the circus       i want to know if you re engaged to him       no   she cried and lifting her face close to his for the shortest  instant possible  she gave him a look half merry  half defiant  but all  fond  it was an adorable look      lucy   he said huskily     but she turned quickly from him  and ran to the other end of the room   he followed awkwardly  stammering      lucy  i want  i want to ask you  will you  will you  will you be  engaged to me      she stood at a window  seeming to look out into the summer darkness  her  back to him      will you  lucy       no   she murmured  just audibly      why not       i m older than you       eight months       you re too young       is that    he said  gulping   is that the only reason you won t      she did not answer     as she stood  persistently staring out of the window  with her back to  him  she did not see how humble his attitude had become  but his voice  was low  and it shook so that she could have no doubt of his emotion    lucy  please forgive me for making such a row   he said  thus gently    i ve been  i ve been terribly upset  terribly  you know how i feel  about you  and always have felt about you  i ve shown it in every single  thing i ve done since the first time i met you  and i know you know it   don t you      still she did not move or speak      is the only reason you won t be engaged to me you think i m too young   lucy       it s  it s reason enough   she said faintly     at that he caught one of her hands  and she turned to him  there were  tears in her eyes  tears which he did not understand at all      lucy  you little dear   he cried   i knew you        no  no   she said  and she pushed him away  withdrawing her hand    george  let s not talk of solemn things       solemn things   like what       like  being engaged      but george had become altogether jubilant  and he laughed triumphantly    good gracious  that isn t solemn       it is  too   she said  wiping her eyes   it s too solemn for us       no  it isn t  i        let s sit down and be sensible  dear   she said   you sit over there        i will if you ll call me   dear  again       no   she said   i ll only call you that once again this summer  the  night before you go away       that will have to do  then   he laughed   so long as i know we re  engaged       but we re not   she protested   and we never will be  if you don t  promise not to speak of it again until  until i tell you to       i won t promise that   said the happy george   i ll only promise not to  speak of it till the next time you call me  dear   and you ve promised  to call me that the night before i leave for my senior year       oh  but i didn t   she said earnestly  then hesitated   did i       didn t you       i don t think i meant it   she murmured  her wet lashes flickering  above troubled eyes      i know one thing about you   he said gayly  his triumph increasing    you never went back on anything you said  yet  and i m not afraid of  this being the first time       but we mustn t let    she faltered  then went on tremulously   george   we ve got on so well together  we won t let this make a difference  between us  will we   and she joined in his laughter      it will all depend on what you tell me the night before i go away  you  agree we re going to settle things then  don t you  lucy       i don t promise       yes  you do  don t you       well             chapter xiii        tonight george began a jubilant warfare upon his aunt fanny  opening  the campaign upon his return home at about eleven o clock  fanny had  retired  and was presumably asleep  but george  on the way to his own  room  paused before her door  and serenaded her in a full baritone          as i walk along the boy de balong       with my independent air        the people all declare         he must be a millionaire         oh  you hear them sigh  and wish to die        and see them wink the other eye        at the man that broke the bank at monte carlo      isabel came from george s room  where she had been reading  waiting for  him   i m afraid you ll disturb your father  dear  i wish you d sing  more  though  in the daytime  you have a splendid voice       good night  old lady       i thought perhaps i  didn t you want me to come in with you and talk a  little       not to night  you go to bed  good night  old lady      he kissed her hilariously  entered his room with a skip  closed his door  noisily  and then he could be heard tossing things about  loudly humming   the man that broke the bank at monte carlo      smiling  his mother knelt outside his door to pray  then  with her   amen   pressed her lips to the bronze door knob  and went silently to  her own apartment     after breakfasting in bed  george spent the next morning at his  grandfather s and did not encounter his aunt fanny until lunch  when she  seemed to be ready for him      thank you so much for the serenade  george   she said   your poor  father tells me he d just got to sleep for the first time in two nights   but after your kind attentions he lay awake the rest of last night       perfectly true   mr  minafer said grimly      of course  i didn t know  sir   george hastened to assure him   i m  awfully sorry  but aunt fanny was so gloomy and excited before i went  out  last evening  i thought she needed cheering up       i   fanny jeered   i was gloomy  i was excited  you mean about that  engagement       yes  weren t you  i thought i heard you worrying over somebody s being  engaged  didn t i hear you say you d heard mr  eugene morgan was engaged  to marry some pretty little seventeen year old girl      fanny was stung  but she made a brave effort   did you ask lucy   she  said  her voice almost refusing the teasing laugh she tried to make it  utter   did you ask her when fred kinney and she        yes  that story wasn t true  but the other one    here he stared at  fanny  and then affected dismay   why  what s the matter with your face   aunt fanny  it seems agitated       agitated   fanny said disdainfully  but her voice undeniably lacked  steadiness   agitated       oh  come   mr  minafer interposed   let s have a little peace       i m willing   said george   i don t want to see poor aunt fanny all  stirred up over a rumour i just this minute invented myself  she s so  excitable  about certain subjects  it s hard to control her   he turned  to his mother   what s the matter with grandfather       didn t you see him this morning   isabel asked      yes  he was glad to see me  and all that  but he seemed pretty fidgety   has he been having trouble with his heart again       not lately  no       well  he s not himself  i tried to talk to him about the estate  it s  disgraceful  it really is  the way things are looking  he wouldn t  listen  and he seemed upset  what s he upset over      isabel looked serious  however  it was her husband who suggested  gloomily   i suppose the major s bothered about this sydney and amelia  business  most likely       what sydney and amelia business   george asked      your mother can tell you  if she wants to   minafer said   it s not my  side of the family  so i keep off       it s rather disagreeable for all of us  georgie   isabel began   you  see  your uncle sydney wanted a diplomatic position  and he thought  brother george  being in congress  could arrange it  george did get him  the offer of a south american ministry  but sydney wanted a european  ambassadorship  and he got quite indignant with poor george for thinking  he d take anything smaller  and he believes george didn t work hard  enough for him  george had done his best  of course  and now he s out  of congress  and won t run again  so there s sydney s idea of a big  diplomatic position gone for good  well  sydney and your aunt amelia are  terribly disappointed  and they say they ve been thinking for years  that this town isn t really fit to live in   for a gentleman   sydney  says  and it is getting rather big and dirty  so they ve sold their  house and decided to go abroad to live permanently  there s a villa near  florence they ve often talked of buying  and they want father to let  them have their share of the estate now  instead of waiting for him to  leave it to them in his will       well  i suppose that s fair enough   george said   that is  in case he  intended to leave them a certain amount in his will       of course that s understood  georgie  father explained his will to us  long ago  a third to them  and a third to brother george  and a third to  us      her son made a simple calculation in his mind  uncle george was a  bachelor  and probably would never marry  sydney and amelia were  childless  the major s only grandchild appeared to remain the eventual  heir of the entire property  no matter if the major did turn over  to sydney a third of it now  and george had a fragmentary vision  of himself  in mourning  arriving to take possession of a historic  florentine villa  he saw himself walking up a cypress bordered path   with ancient carven stone balustrades in the distance  and servants  in mourning livery greeting the new signore   well  i suppose it s  grandfather s own affair  he can do it or not  just as he likes  i don t  see why he d mind much       he seemed rather confused and pained about it   isabel said   i think  they oughtn t to urge it  george says that the estate won t stand taking  out the third that sydney wants  and that sydney and amelia are behaving  like a couple of pigs   she laughed  continuing   of course i don t know  whether they are or not  i never have understood any more about business  myself than a little pig would  but i m on george s side  whether he s  right or wrong  i always was from the time we were children  and sydney  and amelia are hurt with me about it  i m afraid  they ve stopped  speaking to george entirely  poor father family rows at his time of  life      george became thoughtful  if sydney and amelia were behaving like pigs   things might not be so simple as at first they seemed to be  uncle  sydney and aunt amelia might live an awful long while  he thought  and  besides  people didn t always leave their fortunes to relatives  sydney  might die first  leaving everything to his widow  and some curly haired  italian adventurer might get round her  over there in florence  she  might be fool enough to marry again  or even adopt somebody     he became more and more thoughtful  forgetting entirely a plan he had  formed for the continued teasing of his aunt fanny  and  an hour after  lunch  he strolled over to his grandfather s  intending to apply for  further information  as a party rightfully interested     he did not carry out this intention  however  going into the big house  by a side entrance  he was informed that the major was upstairs in his  bedroom  that his sons sydney and george were both with him  and that a  serious argument was in progress   you kin stan  right in de middle dat  big  sta y way   said old sam  the ancient negro  who was his informant    an  you kin heah all you a mind to wivout goin  on up no fudda  mist   sydney an  mist  jawge talkin  louduh n i evuh heah nobody ca y on in  nish heah house  quollin   honey  big quollin        all right   said george shortly   you go on back to your own part of  the house  and don t make any talk  hear me       yessuh  yessuh   sam chuckled  as he shuffled away   plenty talkin   wivout sam  yessuh      george went to the foot of the great stairway  he could hear angry  voices overhead  those of his two uncles  and a plaintive murmur  as if  the major tried to keep the peace  such sounds were far from encouraging  to callers  and george decided not to go upstairs until this interview  was over  his decision was the result of no timidity  nor of a too  sensitive delicacy  what he felt was  that if he interrupted the scene  in his grandfather s room  just at this time  one of the three gentlemen  engaging in it might speak to him in a peremptory manner  in the heat  of the moment  and george saw no reason for exposing his dignity to such  mischances  therefore he turned from the stairway  and going quietly  into the library  picked up a magazine  but he did not open it  for his  attention was instantly arrested by his aunt amelia s voice  speaking in  the next room  the door was open and george heard her distinctly      isabel does  isabel   she exclaimed  her tone high and shrewish   you  needn t tell me anything about isabel minafer  i guess  my dear old  frank bronson  i know her a little better than you do  don t you think      george heard the voice of mr  bronson replying  a voice familiar to him  as that of his grandfather s attorney in chief and chief intimate as  well  he was a contemporary of the major s  being over seventy  and they  had been through three years of the war in the same regiment  amelia  addressed him now  with an effect of angry mockery  as  my dear old  frank bronson   but that  without the mockery  was how the amberson  family almost always spoke of him   dear old frank bronson   he was a  hale  thin old man  six feet three inches tall  and without a stoop      i doubt your knowing isabel   he said stiffly   you speak of her as you  do because she sides with her brother george  instead of with you and  sydney       pooh   aunt amelia was evidently in a passion   you know what s been  going on over there  well enough  frank bronson       i don t even know what you re talking about       oh  you don t  you don t know that isabel takes george s side simply  because he s eugene morgan s best friend       it seems to me you re talking pure nonsense   said bronson sharply    not impure nonsense  i hope      amelia became shrill   i thought you were a man of the world  don t  tell me you re blind  for nearly two years isabel s been pretending  to chaperone fanny minafer with eugene  and all the time she s been  dragging that poor fool fanny around to chaperone her and eugene  under  the circumstances  she knows people will get to thinking fanny s a  pretty slim kind of chaperone  and isabel wants to please george because  she thinks there ll be less talk if she can keep her own brother around   seeming to approve   talk   she d better look out  the whole town will  be talking  the first thing she knows  she       amelia stopped  and stared at the doorway in a panic  for her nephew  stood there     she kept her eyes upon his white face for a few strained moments  then   regaining her nerve  looked away and shrugged her shoulders      you weren t intended to hear what i ve been saying  george   she  said quietly   but since you seem to        yes  i did       so   she shrugged her shoulders again   after all  i don t know but  it s just as well  in the long run      he walked up to where she sat   you  you    he said thickly   it  seems  it seems to me you re  you re pretty common      amelia tried to give the impression of an unconcerned person laughing  with complete indifference  but the sounds she produced were disjointed  and uneasy  she fanned herself  looking out of the open window near her    of course  if you want to make more trouble in the family than we ve  already got  george  with your eavesdropping  you can go and repeat       old bronson had risen from his chair in great distress   your aunt was  talking nonsense because she s piqued over a business matter  george    he said   she doesn t mean what she said  and neither she nor any one  else gives the slightest credit to such foolishness  no one in the  world      george gulped  and wet lines shone suddenly along his lower eyelids    they  they d better not   he said  then stalked out of the room  and  out of the house  he stamped fiercely across the stone slabs of the  front porch  descended the steps  and halted abruptly  blinking in the  strong sunshine     in front of his own gate  beyond the major s broad lawn  his mother was  just getting into her victoria  where sat already his aunt fanny  and lucy morgan  it was a summer fashion picture  the three ladies  charmingly dressed  delicate parasols aloft  the lines of the victoria  graceful as those of a violin  the trim pair of bays in glistening  harness picked out with silver  and the serious black driver whom  isabel  being an amberson  dared even in that town to put into a black  livery coat  boots  white breeches  and cockaded hat  they jingled  smartly away  and  seeing george standing on the major s lawn  lucy  waved  and isabel threw him a kiss     but george shuddered  pretending not to see them  and stooped as if  searching for something lost in the grass  protracting that posture  until the victoria was out of hearing  and ten minutes later  george  amberson  somewhat in the semblance of an angry person plunging out of  the mansion  found a pale nephew waiting to accost him      i haven t time to talk  georgie       yes  you have  you d better       what s the matter  then      his namesake drew him away from the vicinity of the house   i want to  tell you something i just heard aunt amelia say  in there       i don t want to hear it   said amberson   i ve been hearing entirely  too much of what  aunt amelia  says  lately       she says my mother s on your side about this division of the property  because you re eugene morgan s best friend       what in the name of heaven has that got to do with your mother s being  on my side       she said    george paused to swallow   she said    he faltered      you look sick   said his uncle  and laughed shortly   if it s because  of anything amelia s been saying  i don t blame you  what else did she  say      george swallowed again  as with nausea  but under his uncle s  encouragement he was able to be explicit   she said my mother wanted you  to be friendly to her about eugene morgan  she said my mother had been  using aunt fanny as a chaperone      amberson emitted a laugh of disgust   it s wonderful what tommy rot a  woman in a state of spite can think of  i suppose you don t doubt that  amelia amberson created this specimen of tommy rot herself       i know she did       then what s the matter       she said    george faltered again   she said  she implied people  were  were talking about it       of all the damn nonsense   his uncle exclaimed  george looked at him  haggardly   you re sure they re not       rubbish  your mother s on my side about this division because she knows  sydney s a pig and always has been a pig  and so has his spiteful wife   i m trying to keep them from getting the better of your mother as well  as from getting the better of me  don t you suppose  well  they re in  a rage because sydney always could do what he liked with father unless  your mother interfered  and they know i got isabel to ask him not to  do what they wanted  they re keeping up the fight and they re sore  and  amelia s a woman who always says any damn thing that comes into her  head  that s all there is to it       but she said   george persisted wretchedly   she said there was talk   she said        look here  young fellow   amberson laughed good naturedly   there  probably is some harmless talk about the way your aunt fanny goes after  poor eugene  and i ve no doubt i ve abetted it myself  people can t help  being amused by a thing like that  fanny was always languishing at him   twenty odd years ago  before he left here  well  we can t blame the poor  thing if she s got her hopes up again  and i don t know that i blame  her  myself  for using your mother the way she does       how do you mean      amberson put his hand on george s shoulder   you like to tease fanny    he said   but i wouldn t tease her about this  if i were you  fanny  hasn t got much in her life  you know  georgie  just being an aunt isn t  really the great career it may sometimes appear to you  in fact  i  don t know of anything much that fanny has got  except her feeling  about eugene  she s always had it  and what s funny to us is pretty much  life and death to her  i suspect  now  i ll not deny that eugene morgan  is attracted to your mother  he is  and that s another case of  always  was   but i know him  and he s a knight  george  a crazy one  perhaps   if you ve read  don quixote   and i think your mother likes him better  than she likes any man outside her own family  and that he interests her  more than anybody else  and  always has   and that s all there is to it   except        except what   george asked quickly  as he paused      except that i suspect    amberson chuckled  and began over   i ll tell  you in confidence  i think fanny s a fairly tricky customer  for such an  innocent old girl  there isn t any real harm in her  but she s a great  diplomatist  lots of cards up her lace sleeves  georgie  by the way   did you ever notice how proud she is of her arms  always flashing  em at  poor eugene   and he stopped to laugh again      i don t see anything confidential about that   george complained   i  thought        wait a minute  my idea is  don t forget it s a confidential one  but  i m devilish right about it  young georgie   it s this  fanny uses your  mother for a decoy duck  she does everything in the world she can to  keep your mother s friendship with eugene going  because she thinks  that s what keeps eugene about the place  so to speak  fanny s always  with your mother  you see  and whenever he sees isabel he sees fanny   fanny thinks he ll get used to the idea of her being around  and some  day her chance may come  you see  she s probably afraid  perhaps she  even knows  poor thing   that she wouldn t get to see much of eugene if  it weren t for isabel s being such a friend of his  there  d you see       well  i suppose so   george s brow was still dark  however   if you re  sure whatever talk there is  is about aunt fanny  if that s so        don t be an ass   his uncle advised him lightly  moving away   i m off  for a week s fishing to forget that woman in there  and her pig of a  husband    his gesture toward the mansion indicated mr  and mrs  sydney  amberson    i recommend a like course to you  if you re silly enough to  pay any attention to such rubbishings  good bye      george was partially reassured  but still troubled  a word haunted him  like the recollection of a nightmare   talk      he stood looking at the houses across the street from the mansion   and though the sunshine was bright upon them  they seemed mysteriously  threatening  he had always despised them  except the largest of them   which was the home of his henchman  charlie johnson  the johnsons had  originally owned a lot three hundred feet wide  but they had sold all of  it except the meager frontage before the house itself  and five  houses were now crowded into the space where one used to squire it so  spaciously  up and down the street  the same transformation had taken  place  every big  comfortable old brick house now had two or three  smaller frame neighbours crowding up to it on each side  cheap looking  neighbours  most of them needing paint and not clean  and yet  though  they were cheap looking  they had cost as much to build as the big brick  houses  whose former ample yards they occupied  only where george stood  was there left a sward as of yore  the great  level  green lawn that  served for both the major s house and his daughter s  this serene  domain  unbroken  except for the two gravelled carriage drives  alone  remained as it had been during the early glories of the amberson  addition     george stared at the ugly houses opposite  and hated them more than  ever  but he shivered  perhaps the riffraff living in those houses sat  at the windows to watch their betters  perhaps they dared to gossip      he uttered an exclamation  and walked rapidly toward his own front gate   the victoria had returned with miss fanny alone  she jumped out briskly  and the victoria waited      where s mother   george asked sharply  as he met her      at lucy s  i only came back to get some embroidery  because we found  the sun too hot for driving  i m in a hurry      but  going into the house with her  he detained her when she would have  hastened upstairs      i haven t time to talk now  georgie  i m going right back  i promised  your mother        you listen   said george      what on earth       he repeated what amelia had said  this time  however  he spoke coldly   and without the emotion he had exhibited during the recital to his  uncle  fanny was the one who showed agitation during this interview  for  she grew fiery red  and her eyes dilated   what on earth do you want to  bring such trash to me for   she demanded  breathing fast      i merely wished to know two things  whether it is your duty or mine to  speak to father of what aunt amelia       fanny stamped her foot   you little fool   she cried   you awful little  fool       i decline        decline  my hat  your father s a sick man  and you        he doesn t seem so to me       well  he does to me  and you want to go troubling him with an amberson  family row  it s just what that cat would love you to do       well  i        tell your father if you like  it will only make him a little sicker to  think he s got a son silly enough to listen to such craziness       then you re sure there isn t any talk   fanny disdained a reply in  words  she made a hissing sound of utter contempt and snapped her  fingers  then she asked scornfully   what s the other thing you wanted  to know      george s pallor increased   whether it mightn t be better  under the  circumstances   he said   if this family were not so intimate with the  morgan family  at least for a time  it might be better       fanny stared at him incredulously   you mean you d quit seeing lucy       i hadn t thought of that side of it  but if such a thing were necessary  on account of talk about my mother  i  i    he hesitated unhappily   i  suggested that if all of us  for a time  perhaps only for a time  it  might be better if        see here   she interrupted   we ll settle this nonsense right now  if  eugene morgan comes to this house  for instance  to see me  your mother  can t get up and leave the place the minute he gets here  can she  what  do you want her to do  insult him  or perhaps you d prefer she d insult  lucy  that would do just as well  what is it you re up to  anyhow  do  you really love your aunt amelia so much that you want to please her   or do you really hate your aunt fanny so much that you want to  that you  want to       she choked and sought for her handkerchief  suddenly she began to cry      oh  see here   george said   i don t hate you   aunt fanny   that s  silly  i don t        you do  you do  you want to  you want to destroy the only thing  that  i  that i ever    and  unable to continue  she became inaudible in her  handkerchief     george felt remorseful  and his own troubles were lightened  all at  once it became clear to him that he had been worrying about nothing  he  perceived that his aunt amelia was indeed an old cat  and that to give  her scandalous meanderings another thought would be the height of folly   by no means unsusceptible to such pathos as that now exposed before  him  he did not lack pity for fanny  whose almost spoken confession was  lamentable  and he was granted the vision to understand that his mother  also pitied fanny infinitely more than he did  this seemed to explain  everything     he patted the unhappy lady awkwardly upon her shoulder   there  there    he said   i didn t mean anything  of course the only thing to do about  aunt amelia is to pay no attention to her  it s all right  aunt fanny   don t cry  i feel a lot better now  myself  come on  i ll drive back  there with you  it s all over  and nothing s the matter  can t you cheer  up      fanny cheered up  and presently the customarily hostile aunt and  nephew were driving out amberson boulevard amiably together in the hot  sunshine           chapter xiv         almost  was lucy s last word on the last night of george s  vacation  that vital evening which she had half consented to agree upon  for  settling things  between them   almost engaged   she meant  and  george  discontented with the  almost   but contented that she seemed  glad to wear a sapphire locket with a tiny photograph of george amberson  minafer inside it  found himself wonderful in a new world at the final  instant of their parting  for  after declining to let him kiss  her  good bye   as if his desire for such a ceremony were the most  preposterous absurdity in the world  she had leaned suddenly close to  him and left upon his cheek the veriest feather from a fairy s wing     she wrote him a month later     no  it must keep on being almost     isn t almost pretty pleasant  you know well enough that i care for you   i did from the first minute i saw you  and i m pretty sure you  knew it  i m afraid you did  i m afraid you always knew it  i m not  conventional and cautious about being engaged  as you say i am  dear   i  always read over the  dears  in your letters a time or two  as you say  you do in mine  only i read all of your letters a time or two   but  it s such a solemn thing it scares me  it means a good deal to a lot  of people besides you and me  and that scares me  too  you write that i  take your feeling for me  too lightly  and that i  take the whole affair  too lightly   isn t that odd  because to myself i seem to take it  as something so much more solemn than you do  i shouldn t be a bit  surprised to find myself an old lady  some day  still thinking of  you  while you d be away and away with somebody else perhaps  and me  forgotten ages ago   lucy morgan   you d say  when you saw my obituary    lucy morgan  let me see  i seem to remember the name  didn t i know  some lucy morgan or other  once upon a time   then you d shake your  big white head and stroke your long white beard  you d have such a  distinguished long white beard  and you d say   no  i don t seem to  remember any lucy morgan  i wonder what made me think i did   and poor  me  i d be deep in the ground  wondering if you d heard about it and  what you were saying  good bye for to day  don t work too hard  dear     george immediately seized pen and paper  plaintively but vigorously  requesting lucy not to imagine him with a beard  distinguished or  otherwise  even in the extremities of age  then  after inscribing his  protest in the matter of this visioned beard  he concluded his missive  in a tone mollified to tenderness  and proceeded to read a letter from  his mother which had reached him simultaneously with lucy s  isabel  wrote from asheville  where she had just arrived with her husband     i think your father looks better already  darling  though we ve been  here only a few hours it may be we ve found just the place to build him  up  the doctors said they hoped it would prove to be  and if it is  it  would be worth the long struggle we had with him to get him to give up  and come  poor dear man  he was so blue  not about his health but about  giving up the worries down at his office and forgetting them for a  time  if he only will forget them  it took the pressure of the family  and all his best friends  to get him to come  but father and brother  george and fanny and eugene morgan all kept at him so constantly that he  just had to give in  i m afraid that in my anxiety to get him to do what  the doctors wanted him to  i wasn t able to back up brother george as i  should in his difficulty with sydney and amelia  i m so sorry  george  is more upset than i ve ever seen him  they ve got what they wanted  and  they re sailing before long  i hear  to live in florence  father said he  couldn t stand the constant persuading  i m afraid the word he used was   nagging   i can t understand people behaving like that  george says  they may be ambersons  but they re vulgar  i m afraid i almost agree  with him  at least  i think they were inconsiderate  but i don t see  why i m unburdening myself of all this to you  poor darling  we ll have  forgotten all about it long before you come home for the holidays  and  it should mean little or nothing to you  anyway  forget that i ve been  so foolish     your father is waiting for me to take a walk with him  that s a splendid  sign  because he hasn t felt he could walk much  at home  lately  i  mustn t keep him waiting  be careful to wear your mackintosh and rubbers  in rainy weather  and  as soon as it begins to get colder  your ulster   wish you could see your father now  looks so much better  we plan to  stay six weeks if the place agrees with him  it does really seem to  already  he s just called in the door to say he s waiting  don t smoke  too much  darling boy     devotedly  your mother isabel     but she did not keep her husband there for the six weeks she  anticipated  she did not keep him anywhere that long  three weeks after  writing this letter  she telegraphed suddenly to george that they were  leaving for home at once  and four days later  when he and a friend  came whistling into his study  from lunch at the club  he found another  telegram upon his desk     he read it twice before he comprehended its import     papa left us at ten this morning  dearest  mother     the friend saw the change in his face   not bad news      george lifted utterly dumfounded eyes from the yellow paper      my father   he said weakly   she says  she says he s dead  i ve got to  go home      his uncle george and the major met him at the station when he  arrived  the first time the major had ever come to meet his grandson   the old gentleman sat in his closed carriage  which still needed paint   at the entrance to the station  but he got out and advanced to grasp  george s hand tremulously  when the latter appeared   poor fellow   he  said  and patted him repeatedly upon the shoulder   poor fellow  poor  georgie      george had not yet come to a full realization of his loss  so far   his condition was merely dazed  and as the major continued to pat him   murmuring  poor fellow   over and over  george was seized by an almost  irresistible impulse to tell his grandfather that he was not a poodle   but he said  thanks   in a low voice  and got into the carriage  his  two relatives following with deferential sympathy  he noticed that the  major s tremulousness did not disappear  as they drove up the street   and that he seemed much feebler than during the summer  principally   however  george was concerned with his own emotion  or rather  with his  lack of emotion  and the anxious sympathy of his grandfather and his  uncle made him feel hypocritical  he was not grief stricken  but he felt  that he ought to be  and  with a secret shame  concealed his callousness  beneath an affectation of solemnity     but when he was taken into the room where lay what was left of wilbur  minafer  george had no longer to pretend  his grief was sufficient  it  needed only the sight of that forever inert semblance of the quiet man  who had been always so quiet a part of his son s life  so quiet a part  that george had seldom been consciously aware that his father was indeed  a part of his life  as the figure lay there  its very quietness was  what was most lifelike  and suddenly it struck george hard  and in that  unexpected  racking grief of his son  wilbur minafer became more vividly  george s father than he had ever been in life     when george left the room  his arm was about his black robed mother  his  shoulders were still shaken with sobs  he leaned upon his mother  she  gently comforted him  and presently he recovered his composure and  became self conscious enough to wonder if he had not been making an  unmanly display of himself   i m all right again  mother   he said  awkwardly   don t worry about me  you d better go lie down  or  something  you look pretty pale      isabel did look pretty pale  but not ghastly pale  as fanny did  fanny s  grief was overwhelming  she stayed in her room  and george did not  see her until the next day  a few minutes before the funeral  when her  haggard face appalled him  but by this time he was quite himself again   and during the short service in the cemetery his thoughts even wandered  so far as to permit him a feeling of regret not directly connected with  his father  beyond the open flower walled grave was a mound where new  grass grew  and here lay his great uncle  old john minafer  who had  died the previous autumn  and beyond this were the graves of george s  grandfather and grandmother minafer  and of his grandfather minafer s  second wife  and her three sons  george s half uncles  who had been  drowned together in a canoe accident when george was a child  fanny was  the last of the family  next beyond was the amberson family lot  where  lay the major s wife and their sons henry and milton  uncles whom george  dimly remembered  and beside them lay isabel s older sister  his aunt  estelle  who had died  in her girlhood  long before george was born  the  minafer monument was a granite block  with the name chiseled upon its  one polished side  and the amberson monument was a white marble shaft  taller than any other in that neighbourhood  but farther on there was a  newer section of the cemetery  an addition which had been thrown open to  occupancy only a few years before  after dexterous modern treatment by  a landscape specialist  there were some large new mausoleums here  and  shafts taller than the ambersons   as well as a number of monuments of  some sculptural pretentiousness  and altogether the new section appeared  to be a more fashionable and important quarter than that older one which  contained the amberson and minafer lots  this was what caused george s  regret  during the moment or two when his mind strayed from his father  and the reading of the service     on the train  going back to college  ten days later  this regret  though  it was as much an annoyance as a regret  recurred to his mind  and a  feeling developed within him that the new quarter of the cemetery was  in bad taste  not architecturally or sculpturally perhaps  but in  presumption  it seemed to flaunt a kind of parvenu ignorance  as if it  were actually pleased to be unaware that all the aristocratic and really  important families were buried in the old section     the annoyance gave way before a recollection of the sweet mournfulness  of his mother s face  as she had said good bye to him at the station   and of how lovely she looked in her mourning  he thought of lucy  whom  he had seen only twice  and he could not help feeling that in these  quiet interviews he had appeared to her as tinged with heroism  she had  shown  rather than said  how brave she thought him in his sorrow  but  what came most vividly to george s mind  during these retrospections   was the despairing face of his aunt fanny  again and again he thought of  it  he could not avoid its haunting  and for days  after he got back  to college  the stricken likeness of fanny would appear before him  unexpectedly  and without a cause that he could trace in his immediately  previous thoughts  her grief had been so silent  yet it had so amazed  him     george felt more and more compassion for this ancient antagonist of his   and he wrote to his mother about her     i m afraid poor aunt fanny might think now father s gone we won t want  her to live with us any longer and because i always teased her so much  she might think i d be for turning her out  i don t know where on earth  she d go or what she could live on if we did do something like this  and  of course we never would do such a thing  but i m pretty sure she had  something of the kind on her mind  she didn t say anything  but the way  she looked is what makes me think so  honestly  to me she looked just  scared sick  you tell her there isn t any danger in the world of my  treating her like that  tell her everything is to go on just as it  always has  tell her to cheer up           chapter xv        isabel did more for fanny than telling her to cheer up  everything that  fanny inherited from her father  old aleck minafer  had been invested  in wilbur s business  and wilbur s business  after a period of illness  corresponding in dates to the illness of wilbur s body  had died just  before wilbur did  george amberson and fanny were both  wiped out to  a miracle of precision   as amberson said  they  owned not a penny and  owed not a penny   he continued  explaining his phrase   it s like the  moment just before drowning  you re not under water and you re not out  of it  all you know is that you re not dead yet      he spoke philosophically  having his  prospects  from his father to fall  back upon  but fanny had neither  prospects  nor philosophy  however   a legal survey of wilbur s estate revealed the fact that his life  insurance was left clear of the wreck  and isabel  with the cheerful  consent of her son  promptly turned this salvage over to her  sister in law  invested  it would yield something better than nine  hundred dollars a year  and thus she was assured of becoming neither a  pauper nor a dependent  but proved to be  as amberson said  adding his  efforts to the cheering up of fanny   an heiress  after all  in spite of  rolling mills and the devil   she was unable to smile  and he continued  his humane gayeties   see what a wonderfully desirable income nine  hundred dollars is  fanny  a bachelor  to be in your class  must have  exactly forty nine thousand one hundred a year  then  you see  all you  need to do  in order to have fifty thousand a year  is to be a little  encouraging when some bachelor in your class begins to show by his  haberdashery what he wants you to think about him      she looked at him wanly  murmured a desolate response  she had  sewing  to do   and left the room  while amberson shook his head ruefully at  his sister   i ve often thought that humor was not my forte   he sighed    lord  she doesn t  cheer up  much      the collegian did not return to his home for the holidays  instead   isabel joined him  and they went south for the two weeks  she was proud  of her stalwart  good looking son at the hotel where they stayed  and it  was meat and drink to her when she saw how people stared at him in the  lobby and on the big verandas  indeed  her vanity in him was so dominant  that she was unaware of their staring at her with more interest and an  admiration friendlier than george evoked  happy to have him to herself  for this fortnight  she loved to walk with him  leaning upon his arm  to  read with him  to watch the sea with him  perhaps most of all she liked  to enter the big dining room with him     yet both of them felt constantly the difference between this  christmastime and other christmas times of theirs  in all  it was a  sorrowful holiday  but when isabel came east for george s commencement   in june  she brought lucy with her  and things began to seem different   especially when george amberson arrived with lucy s father on class day   eugene had been in new york  on business  amberson easily persuaded  him to this outing  and they made a cheerful party of it  with the new  graduate of course the hero and center of it all     his uncle was a fellow alumnus   yonder was where i roomed when i was  here   he said  pointing out one of the university buildings to eugene    i don t know whether george would let my admirers place a tablet to  mark the spot  or not  he owns all these buildings now  you know       didn t you  when you were here  like uncle  like nephew       don t tell george you think he s like me  just at this time we should  be careful of the young gentleman s feelings       yes   said eugene   if we weren t he mightn t let us exist at all       i m sure i didn t have it so badly at his age   amberson said  reflectively  as they strolled on through the commencement crowd   for  one thing  i had brothers and sisters  and my mother didn t just sit  at my feet as george s does  and i wasn t an only grandchild  either   father s always spoiled georgie a lot more than he did any of his own   children      eugene laughed   you need only three things to explain all that s good  and bad about georgie       three       he s isabel s only child  he s an amberson  he s a boy       well  mister bones  of these three things which are the good ones and  which are the bad ones       all of them   said eugene     it happened that just then they came in sight of the subject of their  discourse  george was walking under the elms with lucy  swinging a  stick and pointing out to her various objects and localities which had  attained historical value during the last four years  the two older men  marked his gestures  careless and graceful  they observed his attitude   unconsciously noble  his easy proprietorship of the ground beneath his  feet and round about  of the branches overhead  of the old buildings  beyond  and of lucy      i don t know   eugene said  smiling whimsically   i don t know  when i  spoke of his being a human being  i don t know  perhaps it s more like  deity       i wonder if i was like that    amberson groaned    you don t suppose  every amberson has had to go through it  do you       don t worry  at least half of it is a combination of youth  good looks   and college  and even the noblest ambersons get over their nobility and  come to be people in time  it takes more than time  though       i should say it did take more than time   his friend agreed  shaking a  rueful head     then they walked over to join the loveliest amberson  whom neither time  nor trouble seemed to have touched  she stood alone  thoughtful under  the great trees  chaperoning george and lucy at a distance  but  seeing  the two friends approaching  she came to meet them      it s charming  isn t it   she said  moving her black gloved hand to  indicate the summery dressed crowd strolling about them  or clustering  in groups  each with its own hero   they seem so eager and so confident   all these boys  it s touching  but of course youth doesn t know it s  touching      amberson coughed   no  it doesn t seem to take itself as pathetic   precisely  eugene and i were just speaking of something like that   do you know what i think whenever i see these smooth  triumphal young  faces  i always think   oh  how you re going to catch it        george       oh  yes   he said   life s most ingenious  it s got a special walloping  for every mother s son of  em       maybe   said isabel  troubled   maybe some of the mothers can take the  walloping for them       not one   her brother assured her  with emphasis   not any more than  she can take on her own face the lines that are bound to come on her  son s  i suppose you know that all these young faces have got to get  lines on  em       maybe they won t   she said  smiling wistfully   maybe times will  change  and nobody will have to wear lines       times have changed like that for only one person that i know   eugene  said  and as isabel looked inquiring  he laughed  and she saw that she  was the  only one person   his implication was justified  moreover  and  she knew it  she blushed charmingly      which is it puts the lines on the faces   amberson asked   is it age  or trouble  of course we can t decide that wisdom does it  we must be  polite to isabel       i ll tell you what puts the lines there   eugene said   age puts some   and trouble puts some  and work puts some  but the deepest are carved by  lack of faith  the serenest brow is the one that believes the most       in what   isabel asked gently      in everything      she looked at him inquiringly  and he laughed as he had a moment before   when she looked at him that way   oh  yes  you do   he said     she continued to look at him inquiringly a moment or two longer  and  there was an unconscious earnestness in her glance  something trustful  as well as inquiring  as if she knew that whatever he meant it was all  right  then her eyes drooped thoughtfully  and she seemed to address  some inquiries to herself  she looked up suddenly   why  i believe   she  said  in a tone of surprise   i believe i do      and at that both men laughed   isabel   her brother exclaimed   you re  a foolish person  there are times when you look exactly fourteen years  old      but this reminded her of her real affair in that part of the world    good gracious   she said   where have the children got to  we must take  lucy pretty soon  so that george can go and sit with the class  we must  catch up with them      she took her brother s arm  and the three moved on  looking about them  in the crowd      curious   amberson remarked  as they did not immediately discover the  young people they sought   even in such a concourse one would think we  couldn t fail to see the proprietor       several hundred proprietors today   eugene suggested      no  they re only proprietors of the university   said george s uncle    we re looking for the proprietor of the universe       there he is   cried isabel fondly  not minding this satire at all   and  doesn t he look it      her escorts were still laughing at her when they joined the proprietor  of the universe and his pretty friend  and though both amberson and  eugene declined to explain the cause of their mirth  even upon lucy s  urgent request  the portents of the day were amiable  and the five made  a happy party  that is to say  four of them made a happy audience for  the fifth  and the mood of this fifth was gracious and cheerful     george took no conspicuous part in either the academic or the social  celebrations of his class  he seemed to regard both sets of exercises  with a tolerant amusement  his own  crowd   not going in much for either  of those sorts of things   as he explained to lucy  what his crowd had  gone in for remained ambiguous  some negligent testimony indicating  that  except for an astonishing reliability which they all seemed to  have attained in matters relating to musical comedy  they had not gone  in for anything  certainly the question one of them put to lucy  in  response to investigations of hers  seemed to point that way   don t you  think   he said   really  don t you think that being things is rather  better than doing things      he said  rahthuh bettuh  for  rather better   and seemed to do it  deliberately  with perfect knowledge of what he was doing  later  lucy  mocked him to george  and george refused to smile  he somewhat inclined  to such pronunciations  himself  this inclination was one of the things  that he had acquired in the four years     what else he had acquired  it might have puzzled him to state  had  anybody asked him and required a direct reply within a reasonable space  of time  he had learned how to pass examinations by  cramming   that is   in three or four days and nights he could get into his head enough of  a selected fragment of some scientific or philosophical or literary or  linguistic subject to reply plausibly to six questions out of ten  he  could retain the information necessary for such a feat just long enough  to give a successful performance  then it would evaporate utterly from  his brain  and leave him undisturbed  george  like his  crowd   not only  preferred  being things  to  doing things   but had contented himself  with four years of  being things  as a preparation for going on  being  things   and when lucy rather shyly pressed him for his friend s  probable definition of the  things  it seemed so superior and beautiful  to be  george raised his eyebrows slightly  meaning that she should have  understood without explanation  but he did explain   oh  family and all  that  being a gentleman  i suppose      lucy gave the horizon a long look  but offered no comment           chapter xvi       aunt fanny doesn t look much better   george said to his mother  a few  minutes after their arrival  on the night they got home  he stood with  a towel in her doorway  concluding some sketchy ablutions before going  downstairs to a supper which fanny was hastily preparing for them   isabel had not telegraphed  fanny was taken by surprise when they drove  up in a station cab at eleven o clock  and george instantly demanded  a  little decent food    some criticisms of his had publicly disturbed the  composure of the dining car steward four hours previously    i never  saw anybody take things so hard as she seems to   he observed  his voice  muffled by the towel   doesn t she get over it at all  i thought she d  feel better when we turned over the insurance to her  gave it to her  absolutely  without any strings to it  she looks about a thousand years  old       she looks quite girlish  sometimes  though   his mother said      has she looked that way much since father        not so much   isabel said thoughtfully   but she will  as times goes  on       time ll have to hurry  then  it seems to me   george observed   returning to his own room     when they went down to the dining room  he pronounced acceptable the  salmon salad  cold beef  cheese  and cake which fanny made ready for  them without disturbing the servants  the journey had fatigued  isabel  she ate nothing  but sat to observe with tired pleasure the  manifestations of her son s appetite  meanwhile giving her sister in law  a brief summary of the events of commencement  but presently she kissed  them both good night  taking care to kiss george lightly upon the side  of his head  so as not to disturb his eating  and left aunt and nephew  alone together      it never was becoming to her to look pale   fanny said absently  a few  moments after isabel s departure      wha d you say  aunt fanny       nothing  i suppose your mother s been being pretty gay  going a lot       how could she   george asked cheerfully   in mourning  of course all  she could do was just sit around and look on  that s all lucy could do  either  for the matter of that       i suppose so   his aunt assented   how did lucy get home      george regarded her with astonishment   why  on the train with the rest  of us  of course       i didn t mean that   fanny explained   i meant from the station  did  you drive out to their house with her before you came here       no  she drove home with her father  of course       oh  i see  so eugene came to the station to meet you       to meet us   george echoed  renewing his attack upon the salmon salad    how could he       i don t know what you mean   fanny said drearily  in the desolate voice  that had become her habit   i haven t seen him while your mother s been  away       naturally   said george   he s been east himself      at this fanny s drooping eyelids opened wide      did you see him       well  naturally  since he made the trip home with us       he did   she said sharply   he s been with you all the time       no  only on the train and the last three days before we left  uncle  george got him to come      fanny s eyelids drooped again  and she sat silent until george pushed  back his chair and lit a cigarette  declaring his satisfaction with what  she had provided   you re a fine housekeeper   he said benevolently    you know how to make things look dainty as well as taste the right way   i don t believe you d stay single very long if some of the bachelors and  widowers around town could just once see       she did not hear him   it s a little odd   she said      what s odd       your mother s not mentioning that mr  morgan had been with you       didn t think of it  i suppose   said george carelessly  and  his  benevolent mood increasing  he conceived the idea that a little harmless  rallying might serve to elevate his aunt s drooping spirits   i ll tell  you something  in confidence   he said solemnly     she looked up  startled   what       well  it struck me that mr  morgan was looking pretty absent minded   most of the time  and he certainly is dressing better than he used to   uncle george told me he heard that the automobile factory had been doing  quite well  won a race  too  i shouldn t be a bit surprised if all the  young fellow had been waiting for was to know he had an assured income  before he proposed       what  young fellow        this young fellow morgan   laughed george   honestly  aunt fanny  i  shouldn t be a bit surprised to have him request an interview with me  any day  and declare that his intentions are honourable  and ask my  permission to pay his addresses to you  what had i better tell him      fanny burst into tears      good heavens   george cried   i was only teasing  i didn t mean        let me alone   she said lifelessly  and  continuing to weep  rose and  began to clear away the dishes      please  aunt fanny        just let me alone      george was distressed   i didn t mean anything  aunt fanny  i didn t  know you d got so sensitive as all that       you d better go up to bed   she said desolately  going on with her work  and her weeping      anyhow   he insisted   do let these things wait  let the servants  tend  to the table in the morning       no       but  why not       just let me alone       oh  lord   george groaned  going to the door  there he turned   see  here  aunt fanny  there s not a bit of use your bothering about those  dishes tonight  what s the use of a butler and three maids if        just let me alone      he obeyed  and could still hear a pathetic sniffing from the dining room  as he went up the stairs      by george   he grunted  as he reached his own room  and his thought was  that living with a person so sensitive to kindly raillery might prove  lugubrious  he whistled  long and low  then went to the window and  looked through the darkness to the great silhouette of his grandfather s  house  lights were burning over there  upstairs  probably his newly  arrived uncle was engaged in talk with the major     george s glance lowered  resting casually upon the indistinct ground   and he beheld some vague shapes  unfamiliar to him  formless heaps  they  seemed  but  without much curiosity  he supposed that sewer connections  or water pipes might be out of order  making necessary some excavations   he hoped the work would not take long  he hated to see that sweep of  lawn made unsightly by trenches and lines of dirt  even temporarily  not  greatly disturbed  however  he pulled down the shade  yawned  and began  to  undress  leaving further investigation for the morning     but in the morning he had forgotten all about it  and raised his shade   to let in the light  without even glancing toward the ground  not until  he had finished dressing did he look forth from his window  and then his  glance was casual  the next instant his attitude became electric  and he  gave utterance to a bellow of dismay  he ran from his room  plunged  down the stairs  out of the front door  and  upon a nearer view of the  destroyed lawn  began to release profanity upon the breezeless summer  air  which remained unaffected  between his mother s house and his  grandfather s  excavations for the cellars of five new houses were in  process  each within a few feet of its neighbour  foundations of brick  were being laid  everywhere were piles of brick and stacked lumber  and  sand heaps and mortar  beds     it was sunday  and so the workmen implicated in these defacings were  denied what unquestionably  they would have considered a treat  but  as the fanatic orator continued the monologue  a gentleman in  flannels emerged upward from one of the excavations  and regarded him  contemplatively      obtaining any relief  nephew   he inquired with some interest   you  must have learned quite a number of those expressions in childhood  it s  so long since i d heard them i fancied they were obsolete       who wouldn t swear   george demanded hotly   in the name of god  what  does grandfather mean  doing such things       my private opinion is   said amberson gravely   he desires to increase  his income by building these houses to rent       well  in the name of god  can t he increase his income any other way  but this       in the name of god  it would appear he couldn t       it s beastly  it s a damn degradation  it s a crime       i don t know about its being a crime   said his uncle  stepping over  some planks to join him   it might be a mistake  though  your mother  said not to tell you until we got home  so as not to spoil commencement  for you  she rather feared you d be upset       upset  oh  my lord  i should think i would be upset  he s in his second  childhood  what did you let him do it for  in the name of        make it in the name of heaven this time  george  it s sunday  well  i  thought  myself  it was a mistake       i should say so       yes   said amberson   i wanted him to put up an apartment building  instead of these houses       an apartment building  here       yes  that was my idea      george struck his hands together despairingly   an apartment house  oh   my lord       don t worry  your grandfather wouldn t listen to me  but he ll wish  he had  some day  he says that people aren t going to live in miserable  little flats when they can get a whole house with some grass in front  and plenty of backyard behind  he sticks it out that apartment houses  will never do in a town of this type  and when i pointed out to him  that a dozen or so of  em already are doing  he claimed it was just the  novelty  and that they d all be empty as soon as people got used to  em   so he s putting up these houses       is he getting miserly in his old age       hardly  look what he gave sydney and amelia       i don t mean he s a miser  of course   said george   heaven knows  he s liberal enough with mother and me  but why on earth didn t he sell  something or other rather than do a thing like this       as a matter of fact   amberson returned coolly   i believe he has sold  something or other  from time to time       well  in heaven s name   george cried   what did he do it for       to get money   his uncle mildly replied   that s my deduction       i suppose you re joking  or trying to       that s the best way to look at it   amberson said amiably   take the  whole thing as a joke  and in the meantime  if you haven t had your  breakfast        i haven t       then if i were you i d go in and gets some  and   he paused  becoming  serious   and if i were you i wouldn t say anything to your grandfather  about this       i don t think i could trust myself to speak to him about it   said  george   i want to treat him respectfully  because he is my grandfather   but i don t believe i could if i talked to him about such a thing as  this      and with a gesture of despair  plainly signifying that all too soon  after leaving bright college years behind him he had entered into the  full tragedy of life  george turned bitterly upon his heel and went into  the house for his breakfast     his uncle  with his head whimsically upon one side  gazed after him not  altogether unsympathetically  then descended again into the excavation  whence he had lately emerged  being a philosopher he was not surprised   that afternoon  in the course of a drive he took in the old carriage  with the major  when  george was encountered upon the highway  flashing  along in his runabout with lucy beside him and pendennis doing better  than three minutes      he seems to have recovered   amberson remarked   looks in the highest  good spirits       i beg your pardon       your grandson   amberson explained   he was inclined to melancholy this  morning  but seemed jolly enough just now when they passed us       what was he melancholy about  not getting remorseful about all the  money he s spent at college  was he   the major chuckled feebly  but  with sufficient grimness   i wonder what he thinks i m made of   he  concluded querulously      gold   his son suggested  adding gently   and he s right about part of  you  father       what part       your heart      the major laughed ruefully   i suppose that may account for how heavy  it feels  sometimes  nowadays  this town seems to be rolling right over  that old heart you mentioned  george  rolling over it and burying  it under  when i think of those devilish workmen digging up my lawn   yelling around my house        never mind  father  don t think of it  when things are a nuisance it s  a good idea not to keep remembering  em       i try not to   the old gentleman murmured   i try to keep remembering  that i won t be remembering anything very long   and  somehow convinced  that this thought was a mirthful one  he laughed loudly  and slapped his  knee   not so very long now  my boy   he chuckled  continuing to echo  his own amusement   not so very long  not so very long            chapter xvii        young george paid his respects to his grandfather the following morning   having been occupied with various affairs and engagements on sunday  until after the major s bedtime  and topics concerned with building  or excavations were not introduced into the conversation  which was a  cheerful one until george lightly mentioned some new plans of his  he  was a skillful driver  as the major knew  and he spoke of his desire to  extend his proficiency in this art  in fact  be entertained the ambition  to drive a four in hand  however  as the major said nothing  and merely  sat still  looking surprised  george went on to say that he did not  propose to  go in for coaching just at the start   he thought it would  be better to begin with a tandem  he was sure pendennis could be trained  to work as a leader  and all that one needed to buy at present  he said   would be  comparatively inexpensive  a new trap  and the harness   of course  and a good bay to match pendennis   he did not care for a  special groom  one of the stablemen would do     at this point the major decided to speak   you say one of the stablemen  would do   he inquired  his widened eyes remaining fixed upon his  grandson   that s lucky  because one s all there is  just at present   george  old fat tom does it all  didn t you notice  when you took  pendennis out  yesterday       oh  that will be all right  sir  my mother can lend me her man       can she   the old gentleman smiled faintly   i wonder    he paused      what  sir       whether you mightn t care to go to law school somewhere perhaps  i d be  glad to set aside a sum that would see you through      this senile divergence from the topic in hand surprised george  painfully   i have no interest whatever in the law   he said   i don t  care for it  and the idea of being a professional man has never appealed  to me  none of the family has ever gone in for that sort of thing  to my  knowledge  and i don t care to be the first  i was speaking of driving a  tandem        i know you were   the major said quietly     george looked hurt   i beg your pardon  of course if the idea doesn t  appeal to you    and he rose to go     the major ran a tremulous hand through his hair  sighing deeply   i  i  don t like to refuse you anything  georgie   he said   i don t know that  i often have refused you whatever you wanted  in reason        you ve always been more than generous  sir   george interrupted  quickly   and if the idea of a tandem doesn t appeal to you  why  of  course    and he waved his hand  heroically dismissing the tandem     the major s distress became obvious   georgie  i d like to  but  but  i ve an idea tandems are dangerous to drive  and your mother might be  anxious  she        no  sir  i think not  she felt it would be rather a good thing  help to  keep me out in the open air  but if perhaps your finances        oh  it isn t that so much   the old gentleman said hurriedly   i wasn t  thinking of that altogether   he laughed uncomfortably   i guess we  could still afford a new horse or two  if need be        i thought you said       the major waved his hand airily   oh  a few retrenchments where  things were useless  nothing gained by a raft of idle darkies in the  stable  nor by a lot of extra land that might as well be put to work for  us in rentals  and if you want this thing so very much        it s not important enough to bother about  really  of course       well  let s wait till autumn then   said the major in a tone of relief    we ll see about it in the autumn  if you re still in the mind for it  then  that will be a great deal better  you remind me of it  along in  september  or october  we ll see what can be done   he rubbed his hands  cheerfully   we ll see what can be done about it then  georgie  we ll  see      and george  in reporting this conversation to his mother  was ruefully  humorous   in fact  the old boy cheered up so much   he told her   you d  have thought he d got a real load off his mind  he seemed to think he d  fixed me up perfectly  and that i was just as good as driving a tandem  around his library right that minute  of course i know he s anything but  miserly  still i can t help thinking he must be salting a lot of money  away  i know prices are higher than they used to be  but he doesn t  spend within thousands of what he used to  and we certainly can t be  spending more than we always have spent  where does it all go to  uncle  george told me grandfather had sold some pieces of property  and it  looks a little queer  if he s really  property poor   of course we ought  to be more saving than we are  and help him out  i don t mind giving  up a tandem if it seems a little too expensive just now  i m perfectly  willing to live quietly till he gets his bank balance where he wants it   but i have a faint suspicion  not that he s getting miserly  not that at  all  but that old age has begun to make him timid about money  there s  no doubt about it  he s getting a little queer  he can t keep his mind  on a subject long  right in the middle of talking about one thing he ll  wander off to something else  and i shouldn t be surprised if he turned  out to be a lot better off than any of us guess  it s entirely possible  that whatever he s sold just went into government bonds  or even his  safety deposit box  there was a friend of mine in college had an old  uncle like that  made the whole family think he was poor as dirt  and  then left seven millions  people get terribly queer as they get old   sometimes  and grandfather certainly doesn t act the way he used to  he  seems to be a totally different man  for instance  he said he thought  tandem driving might be dangerous        did he   isabel asked quickly   then i m glad he doesn t want you to  have one  i didn t dream        but it s not  there isn t the slightest       isabel had a bright idea   georgie  instead of a tandem wouldn t it  interest you to get one of eugene s automobiles       i don t think so  they re fast enough  of course  in fact  running  one of those things is getting to be quite on the cards for sport  and  people go all over the country in  em  but they re dirty things  and  they keep getting out of order  so that you re always lying down on your  back in the mud  and        oh  no   she interrupted eagerly   haven t you noticed  you don t see  nearly so many people doing that nowadays as you did two or three years  ago  and  when you do  eugene says it s apt to be one of the older  patterns  the way they make them now  you can get at most of the  machinery from the top  i do think you d be interested  dear      george remained indifferent   possibly  but i hardly think so  i know a  lot of good people are really taking them up  but still        but still  what   she said as he paused      but still  well  i suppose i m a little old fashioned and fastidious   but i m afraid being a sort of engine driver never will appeal to  me  mother  it s exciting  and i d like that part of it  but still it  doesn t seem to me precisely the thing a gentleman ought to do  too much  overalls and monkey wrenches and grease       but eugene says people are hiring mechanics to do all that sort of  thing for them  they re beginning to have them just the way they have  coachmen  and he says it s developing into quite a profession       i know that  mother  of course  but i ve seen some of these mechanics   and they re not very satisfactory  for one thing  most of them only  pretend to understand the machinery and they let people break down a  hundred miles from nowhere  so that about all these fellows are good  for is to hunt up a farmer and hire a horse to pull the automobile  and  friends of mine at college that ve had a good deal of experience tell me  the mechanics who do understand the engines have no training at all as  servants  they re awful  they say anything they like  and usually speak  to members of the family as  say   no  i believe i d rather wait for  september and a tandem  mother      nevertheless  george sometimes consented to sit in an automobile  while  waiting for september  and he frequently went driving in one of eugene s  cars with lucy and her father  he even allowed himself to be escorted  with his mother and fanny through the growing factory  which was now  as  the foreman of the paint shop informed the visitors   turning out a car  and a quarter a day   george had seldom been more excessively bored  but  his mother showed a lively interest in everything  wishing to have  all the machinery explained to her  it was lucy who did most of the  explaining  while her father looked on and laughed at the mistakes she  made  and fanny remained in the background with george  exhibiting a  bleakness that overmatched his boredom     from the factory eugene took them to lunch at a new restaurant  just  opened in the town  a place which surprised isabel with its metropolitan  air  and  though george made fun of it to her  in a whisper  she offered  everything the tribute of pleased exclamations  and her gayety helped  eugene s to make the little occasion almost a festive one     george s ennui disappeared in spite of himself  and he laughed to see  his mother in such spirits   i didn t know mineral waters could go to  a person s head   he said   or perhaps it s this place  it might pay to  have a new restaurant opened somewhere in town every time you get the  blues      fanny turned to him with a wan smile   oh  she doesn t  get the blues    george   then she added  as if fearing her remark might be thought  unpleasantly significant   i never knew a person of a more even  disposition  i wish i could be like that   and though the tone of  this afterthought was not so enthusiastic as she tried to make it  she  succeeded in producing a fairly amiable effect      no   isabel said  reverting to george s remark  and overlooking  fanny s   what makes me laugh so much at nothing is eugene s factory   wouldn t anybody be delighted to see an old friend take an idea out of  the air like that  an idea that most people laughed at him for  wouldn t  any old friend of his be happy to see how he d made his idea into such  a splendid  humming thing as that factory  all shiny steel  clicking and  buzzing away  and with all those workmen  such muscled looking men and  yet so intelligent looking       hear  hear   george applauded   we seem to have a lady orator among us   i hope the waiters won t mind      isabel laughed  not discouraged   it s beautiful to see such a thing    she said   it makes us all happy  dear old eugene      and with a brave gesture she stretched out her hand to him across the  small table  he took it quickly  giving her a look in which his laughter  tried to remain  but vanished before a gratitude threatening to become  emotional in spite of him  isabel  however  turned instantly to fanny    give him your hand  fanny   she said gayly  and  as fanny mechanically  obeyed   there   isabel cried   if brother george were here  eugene  would have his three oldest and best friends congratulating him all at  once  we know what brother george thinks about it  though  it s just  beautiful  eugene      probably if her brother george had been with them at the little table   he would have made known what he thought about herself  for it must  inevitably have struck him that she was in the midst of one of those   times  when she looked  exactly fourteen years old   lucy served as  a proxy for amberson  perhaps  when she leaned toward george and  whispered   did you ever see anything so lovely       as what   george inquired  not because he misunderstood  but because he  wished to prolong the pleasant neighbourliness of whispering      as your mother  think of her doing that  she s a darling  and  papa   here she imperfectly repressed a tendency to laugh   papa looks  as if he were either going to explode or utter loud sobs      eugene commanded his features  however  and they resumed their customary  apprehensiveness   i used to write verse   he said   if you remember        yes   isabel interrupted gently   i remember       i don t recall that i ve written any for twenty years or so   he  continued   but i m almost thinking i could do it again  to thank you  for making a factory visit into such a kind celebration       gracious   lucy whispered  giggling   aren t they sentimental      people that age always are   george returned   they get sentimental  over anything at all  factories or restaurants  it doesn t matter what      and both of them were seized with fits of laughter which they managed  to cover under the general movement of departure  as isabel had risen to  go     outside  upon the crowded street  george helped lucy into his runabout   and drove off  waving triumphantly  and laughing at eugene who was  struggling with the engine of his car  in the tonneau of which isabel  and fanny had established themselves   looks like a hand organ man  grinding away for pennies   said george  as the runabout turned the  corner and into national avenue   i ll still take a horse  any day      he was not so cocksure  half an hour later  on an open road  when a  siren whistle wailed behind him  and before the sound had died away   eugene s car  coming from behind with what seemed fairly like one  long leap  went by the runabout and dwindled almost instantaneously in  perspective  with a lace handkerchief in a black gloved hand fluttering  sweet derision as it was swept onward into minuteness  a mere white  speck  and then out of sight     george was undoubtedly impressed   your father does know how to drive  some   the dashing exhibition forced him to admit   of course pendennis  isn t as young as he was  and i don t care to push him too hard  i  wouldn t mind handling one of those machines on the road like that   myself  if that was all there was to it  no cranking to do  or fooling  with the engine  well  i enjoyed part of that lunch quite a lot  lucy       the salad       no  your whispering to me       blarney      george made no response  but checked pendennis to a walk  whereupon lucy  protested quickly   oh  don t       why  do you want him to trot his legs off       no  but        no  but   what      she spoke with apparent gravity   i know when you make him walk it s so  you can give all your attention to  to proposing to me again      and as she turned a face of exaggerated color to him   by the lord  but  you re a little witch   george cried      george  do let pendennis trot again       i won t      she clucked to the horse   get up  pendennis  trot  go on  commence      pendennis paid no attention  she meant nothing to him  and george  laughed at her fondly   you are the prettiest thing in this world   lucy   he exclaimed   when i see you in winter  in furs  with your  cheeks red  i think you re prettiest then  but when i see you in summer   in a straw hat and a shirtwaist and a duck skirt and white gloves and  those little silver buckled slippers  and your rose coloured parasol   and your cheeks not red but with a kind of pinky glow about them  then i  see i must have been wrong about the winter  when are you going to drop  the  almost  and say we re really engaged       oh  not for years  so there s the answer  and let s trot again      but george was persistent  moreover  he had become serious during the  last minute or two   i want to know   he said   i really mean it       let s don t be serious  george   she begged him hopefully   let s talk  of something pleasant      he was a little offended   then it isn t pleasant for you to know that i  want to marry you      at this she became as serious as he could have asked  she looked down   and her lip quivered like that of a child about to cry  suddenly she put  her hand upon one of his for just an instant  and then withdrew it      lucy   he said huskily   dear  what s the matter  you look as if  you were going to cry  you always do that   he went on plaintively    whenever i can get you to talk about marrying me       i know it   she murmured      well  why do you      her eyelids flickered  and then she looked up at him with a sad gravity   tears seeming just at the poise   one reason s because i have a feeling  that it s never going to be       why       it s just a feeling       you haven t any reason or        it s just a feeling       well  if that s all   george said  reassured  and laughing confidently    i guess i won t be very much troubled   but at once he became serious  again  adopting the tone of argument   lucy  how is anything ever going  to get a chance to come of it  so long as you keep sticking to  almost    doesn t it strike you as unreasonable to have a  feeling  that we ll  never be married  when what principally stands between us is the fact  that you won t be really engaged to me  that does seem pretty absurd   don t you care enough about me to marry me      she looked down again  pathetically troubled   yes       won t you always care that much about me       i m  yes  i m afraid so  george  i never do change much about  anything       well  then  why in the world won t you drop the  almost       her distress increased   everything is  everything        what about  everything        everything is so  so unsettled      and at that he uttered an exclamation of impatience   if you aren t the  queerest girl  what is  unsettled        well  for one thing   she said  able to smile at his vehemence   you  haven t settled on anything to do  at least  if you have you ve never  spoken of it      as she spoke  she gave him the quickest possible side glance of hopeful  scrutiny  then looked away  not happily  surprise and displeasure were  intentionally visible upon the countenance of her companion  and he  permitted a significant period of silence to elapse before making any  response   lucy   he said  finally  with cold dignity   i should like to  ask you a few questions       yes       the first is  haven t you perfectly well understood that i don t mean  to go into business or adopt a profession       i wasn t quite sure   she said gently   i really didn t know  quite       then of course it s time i did tell you  i never have been able to see  any occasion for a man s going into trade  or being a lawyer  or any of  those things if his position and family were such that he didn t need  to  you know  yourself  there are a lot of people in the east  in the  south  too  for that matter  that don t think we ve got any particular  family or position or culture in this part of the country  i ve met  plenty of that kind of provincial snobs myself  and they re pretty  galling  there were one or two men in my crowd at college  their  families had lived on their income for three generations  and they never  dreamed there was anybody in their class out here  i had to show them  a thing or two  right at the start  and i guess they won t forget it   well  i think it s time all their sort found out that three generations  can mean just as much out here as anywhere else  that s the way i feel  about it  and let me tell you i feel it pretty deeply       but what are you going to do  george   she cried     george s earnestness surpassed hers  he had become flushed and his  breathing was emotional  as he confessed  with simple genuineness  he  did feel what he was saying  pretty deeply   and in truth his state  approached the tremulous   i expect to live an honourable life   he  said   i expect to contribute my share to charities  and to take part  in  in movements       what kind       whatever appeals to me   he said     lucy looked at him with grieved wonder   but you really don t mean to  have any regular business or profession at all       i certainly do not   george returned promptly and emphatically      i was afraid so   she said in a low voice     george continued to breathe deeply throughout another protracted  interval of silence  then he said   i should like to revert to the  questions i was asking you  if you don t mind       no  george  i think we d better        your father is a business man        he s a mechanical genius   lucy interrupted quickly   of course he s  both  and he was a lawyer once  he s done all sorts of things       very well  i merely wished to ask if it s his influence that makes you  think i ought to  do  something      lucy frowned slightly   why  i suppose almost everything i think or say  must be owing to his influence in one way or another  we haven t had  anybody but each other for so many years  and we always think about  alike  so of course        i see   and george s brow darkened with resentment   so that s it  is  it  it s your father s idea that i ought to go into business and that  you oughtn t to be engaged to me until i do      lucy gave a start  her denial was so quick   no  i ve never once spoken  to him about it  never      george looked at her keenly  and he jumped to a conclusion not far from  the truth   but you know without talking to him that it s the way he  does feel about it  i see      she nodded gravely   yes      george s brow grew darker still   do you think i d be much of a man   he  said  slowly   if i let any other man dictate to me my own way of life       george  who s  dictating  your        it seems to me it amounts to that   he returned      oh  no  i only know how papa thinks about things  he s never  never  spoken unkindly  or  dictatingly  of you   she lifted her hand in  protest  and her face was so touching in its distress that for the  moment george forgot his anger  he seized that small  troubled hand      lucy   he said huskily   don t you know that i love you       yes  i do       don t you love me       yes  i do       then what does it matter what your father thinks about my doing  something or not doing anything  he has his way  and i have mine  i  don t believe in the whole world scrubbing dishes and selling potatoes  and trying law cases  why  look at your father s best friend  my uncle  george amberson  he s never done anything in his life  and        oh  yes  he has   she interrupted   he was in politics       well  i m glad he s out   george said   politics is a dirty business  for a gentleman  and uncle george would tell you that himself  lucy   let s not talk any more about it  let me tell mother when i get home  that we re engaged  won t you  dear      she shook her head      is it because       for a fleeting instant she touched to her cheek the hand that held hers    no   she said  and gave him a sudden little look of renewed gayety    let s let it stay  almost        because your father        oh  because it s better      george s voice shook   isn t it your father       it s his ideals i m thinking of  yes      george dropped her hand abruptly and anger narrowed his eyes   i know  what you mean   he said   i dare say i don t care for your father s  ideals any more than he does for mine      he tightened the reins  pendennis quickening eagerly to the trot  and  when george jumped out of the runabout before lucy s gate  and assisted  her to descend  the silence in which they parted was the same that had  begun when pendennis began to trot           chapter xviii        that evening  after dinner  george sat with his mother and his aunt  fanny upon the veranda  in former summers  when they sat outdoors in the  evening  they had customarily used an open terrace at the side of the  house  looking toward the major s  but that more private retreat now  afforded too blank and abrupt a view of the nearest of the new houses   so  without consultation  they had abandoned it for the romanesque stone  structure in front  an oppressive place     its oppression seemed congenial to george  he sat upon the copestone of  the stone parapet  his back against a stone pilaster  his attitude not  comfortable  but rigid  and his silence not comfortable  either  but  heavy  however  to the eyes of his mother and his aunt  who occupied  wicker chairs at a little distance  he was almost indistinguishable  except for the stiff white shield of his evening frontage      it s so nice of you always to dress in the evening  georgie   his  mother said  her glance resting upon this surface   your uncle george  always used to  and so did father  for years  but they both stopped  quite a long time ago  unless there s some special occasion  it seems  to me we don t see it done any more  except on the stage and in the  magazines      he made no response  and isabel  after waiting a little while  as if she  expected one  appeared to acquiesce in his mood for silence  and turned  her head to gaze thoughtfully out at the street     there  in the highway  the evening life of the midland city had begun   a rising moon was bright upon the tops of the shade trees  where their  branches met overhead  arching across the street  but only filtered  splashings of moonlight reached the block pavement below  and through  this darkness flashed the firefly lights of silent bicycles gliding by  in pairs and trios  or sometimes a dozen at a time might come  and not  so silent  striking their little bells  the riders  voices calling and  laughing  while now and then a pair of invisible experts would pass   playing mandolin and guitar as if handle bars were of no account in the  world  their music would come swiftly  and then too swiftly die away   surreys rumbled lightly by  with the plod plod of honest old horses  and  frequently there was the glitter of whizzing spokes from a runabout or  a sporting buggy  and the sharp  decisive hoof beats of a trotter  then   like a cowboy shooting up a peaceful camp  a frantic devil would hurtle  out of the distance  bellowing  exhaust racketing like a machine gun  gone amuck  and at these horrid sounds the surreys and buggies would  hug the curbstone  and the bicycles scatter to cover  cursing  while  children rushed from the sidewalks to drag pet dogs from the street   the thing would roar by  leaving a long wake of turbulence  then the  indignant street would quiet down for a few minutes  till another came      there are a great many more than there used to be   miss fanny  observed  in her lifeless voice  as the lull fell after one of these  visitations   eugene is right about that  there seem to be at least  three or four times as many as there were last summer  and you never  hear the ragamuffins shouting  get a horse   nowadays  but i think he  may be mistaken about their going on increasing after this  i don t  believe we ll see so many next summer as we do now       why   asked isabel      because i ve begun to agree with george about their being more a fad  than anything else  and i think it must be the height of the fad just  now  you know how roller skating came in  everybody in the world seemed  to be crowding to the rinks  and now only a few children use rollers for  getting to school  besides  people won t permit the automobiles to be  used  really  i think they ll make laws against them  you see how they  spoil the bicycling and the driving  people just seem to hate them   they ll never stand it  never in the world  of course i d be sorry to  see such a thing happen to eugene  but i shouldn t be really surprised  to see a law passed forbidding the sale of automobiles  just the way  there is with concealed weapons       fanny   exclaimed her sister in law   you re not in earnest       i am  though      isabel s sweet toned laugh came out of the dusk where she sat   then  you didn t mean it when you told eugene you d enjoyed the drive this  afternoon       i didn t say it so very enthusiastically  did i       perhaps not  but he certainly thought he d pleased you       i don t think i gave him any right to think he d pleased me  fanny said  slowly      why not  why shouldn t you  fanny      fanny did not reply at once  and when she did  her voice was almost  inaudible  but much more reproachful than plaintive   i hardly think i d  want any one to get the notion he d pleased me just now  it hardly seems  time  yet  to me      isabel made no response  and for a time the only sound upon the dark  veranda was the creaking of the wicker rocking chair in which fanny  sat  a creaking which seemed to denote content and placidity on the  part of the chair s occupant  though at this juncture a series of human  shrieks could have been little more eloquent of emotional disturbance   however  the creaking gave its hearer one great advantage  it could be  ignored      have you given up smoking  george   isabel asked presently      no       i hoped perhaps you had  because you ve not smoked since dinner  we  shan t mind if you care to       no  thanks      there was silence again  except for the creaking of the rocking chair   then a low  clear whistle  singularly musical  was heard softly  rendering an old air from  fra diavolo   the creaking stopped      is that you  george   fanny asked abruptly      is that me what       whistling  on yonder rock reclining        it s i   said isabel      oh   fanny said dryly      does it disturb you       not at all  i had an idea george was depressed about something  and  merely wondered if he could be making such a cheerful sound   and fanny  resumed her creaking      is she right  george   his mother asked quickly  leaning forward in  her chair to peer at him through the dusk   you didn t eat a very hearty  dinner  but i thought it was probably because of the warm weather  are  you troubled about anything       no   he said angrily      that s good  i thought we had such a nice day  didn t you       i suppose so   he muttered  and  satisfied  she leaned back in her  chair  but  fra diavolo  was not revived  after a time she rose  went to  the steps  and stood for several minutes looking across the street  then  her laughter was faintly heard      are you laughing about something   fanny inquired      pardon   isabel did not turn  but continued her observation of what had  interested her upon the opposite side of the street      i asked  were you laughing at something       yes  i was   and she laughed again   it s that funny  fat old mrs   johnson  she has a habit of sitting at her bedroom window with a pair of  opera glasses       really       really  you can see the window through the place that was left when we  had the dead walnut tree cut down  she looks up and down the street  but  mostly at father s and over here  sometimes she forgets to put out the  light in her room  and there she is  spying away for all the world to  see      however  fanny made no effort to observe this spectacle  but continued  her creaking   i ve always thought her a very good woman   she said  primly      so she is   isabel agreed   she s a good  friendly old thing  a little  too intimate in her manner  sometimes  and if her poor old opera glasses  afford her the quiet happiness of knowing what sort of young man our new  cook is walking out with  i m the last to begrudge it to her  don t you  want to come and look at her  george       what  i beg your pardon  i hadn t noticed what you were talking about       it s nothing   she laughed   only a funny old lady  and she s gone now   i m going  too  at least  i m going indoors to read  it s cooler in the  house  but the heat s really not bad anywhere  since nightfall  summer s  dying  how quickly it goes  once it begins to die      when she had gone into the house  fanny stopped rocking  and  leaning  forward  drew her black gauze wrap about her shoulders and shivered    isn t it queer   she said drearily   how your mother can use such  words       what words are you talking about   george asked      words like  die  and  dying   i don t see how she can bear to use them  so soon after your poor father    she shivered again      it s almost a year   george said absently  and he added   it seems to  me you re using them yourself       i  never       yes  you did       when       just this minute       oh   said fanny   you mean when i repeated what she said  that s hardly  the same thing  george      he was not enough interested to argue the point   i don t think you ll  convince anybody that mother s unfeeling   he said indifferently      i m not trying to convince anybody  i mean merely that in my  opinion  well  perhaps it may be just as wise for me to keep my opinions  to myself      she paused expectantly  but her possible anticipation that george would  urge her to discard wisdom and reveal her opinion was not fulfilled  his  back was toward her  and he occupied himself with opinions of his own  about other matters  fanny may have felt some disappointment as she rose  to withdraw     however  at the last moment she halted with her hand upon the latch of  the screen door      there s one thing i hope   she said   i hope at least she won t leave  off her full mourning on the very anniversary of wilbur s death      the light door clanged behind her  and the sound annoyed her nephew  he  had no idea why she thus used inoffensive wood and wire to dramatize her  departure from the veranda  the impression remaining with him being that  she was critical of his mother upon some point of funeral millinery   throughout the desultory conversation he had been profoundly concerned  with his own disturbing affairs  and now was preoccupied with a dialogue  taking place  in his mind  between himself and miss lucy morgan  as he  beheld the vision  lucy had just thrown herself at his feet   george   you must forgive me   she cried   papa was utterly wrong  i have told  him so  and the truth is that i have come to rather dislike him as  you do  and as you always have  in your heart of hearts  george  i  understand you  thy people shall be my people and thy gods my gods   george  won t you take me back       lucy  are you sure you understand me   and in the darkness george s  bodily lips moved in unison with those which uttered the words in his  imaginary rendering of this scene  an eavesdropper  concealed behind  the column  could have heard the whispered word  sure   the emphasis put  upon it in the vision was so poignant   you say you understand me  but  are you sure      weeping  her head bowed almost to her waist  the ethereal lucy made  reply   oh  so sure  i will never listen to father s opinions again  i  do not even care if i never see him again       then i pardon you   he said gently     this softened mood lasted for several moments  until he realized that  it had been brought about by processes strikingly lacking in substance   abruptly he swung his feet down from the copestone to the floor of the  veranda   pardon nothing   no meek lucy had thrown herself in remorse  at his feet  and now he pictured her as she probably really was at  this moment  sitting on the white steps of her own front porch in the  moonlight  with red headed fred kinney and silly charlie johnson and  four or five others  all of them laughing  most likely  and some idiot  playing the guitar     george spoke aloud   riffraff      and because of an impish but all too natural reaction of the mind  he  could see lucy with much greater distinctness in this vision than in his  former pleasing one  for a moment she was miraculously real before him   every line and colour of her  he saw the moonlight shimmering in the  chiffon of her skirts brightest on her crossed knee and the tip of her  slipper  saw the blue curve of the characteristic shadow behind her   as she leaned back against the white step  saw the watery twinkling of  sequins in the gauze wrap over her white shoulders as she moved  and  the faint  symmetrical lights in her black hair  and not one alluring   exasperating twentieth of an inch of her laughing profile was spared him  as she seemed to turn to the infernal kinney       riffraff   and george began furiously to pace the stone floor    riffraff   by this hard term  a favourite with him since childhood s  scornful hour  he meant to indicate  not lucy  but the young gentlemen  who  in his vision  surrounded her   riffraff   he said again  aloud   and again      riffraff      at that moment  as it happened  lucy was playing chess with her father   and her heart  though not remorseful  was as heavy as george could have  wished  but she did not let eugene see that she was troubled  and he was  pleased when he won three games of her  usually she beat him           chapter xix      george went driving the next afternoon alone  and  encountering lucy  and her father on the road  in one of morgan s cars  lifted his hat   but nowise relaxed his formal countenance as they passed  eugene waved  a cordial hand quickly returned to the steering wheel  but lucy only  nodded gravely and smiled no more than george did  nor did she accompany  eugene to the major s for dinner  the following sunday evening  though  both were bidden to attend that feast  which was already reduced in  numbers and gayety by the absence of george amberson  eugene explained  to his host that lucy had gone away to visit a school friend     the information  delivered in the library  just before old sam s  appearance to announce dinner  set miss minafer in quite a flutter    why  george   she said  turning to her nephew   how does it happen  you didn t tell us   and with both hands opening  as if to express her  innocence of some conspiracy  she exclaimed to the others   he s never  said one word to us about lucy s planning to go away       probably afraid to   the major suggested   didn t know but he might  break down and cry if he tried to speak of it   he clapped his grandson  on the shoulder  inquiring jocularly   that it  georgie      georgie made no reply  but he was red enough to justify the major s  developing a chuckle into laughter  though miss fanny  observing her  nephew keenly  got an impression that this fiery blush was in truth more  fiery than tender  she caught a glint in his eye less like confusion  than resentment  and saw a dilation of his nostrils which might have  indicated not so much a sweet agitation as an inaudible snort  fanny had  never been lacking in curiosity  and  since her brother s death  this  quality was more than ever alert  the fact that george had spent all the  evenings of the past week at home had not been lost upon her  nor had  she failed to ascertain  by diplomatic inquiries  that since the day of  the visit to eugene s shops george had gone driving alone     at the dinner table she continued to observe him  sidelong  and toward  the conclusion of the meal she was not startled by an episode which  brought discomfort to the others  after the arrival of coffee the major  was rallying eugene upon some rival automobile shops lately built in a  suburb  and already promising to flourish      i suppose they ll either drive you out of the business   said the old  gentleman   or else the two of you ll drive all the rest of us off the  streets       if we do  we ll even things up by making the streets five or ten times  as long as they are now   eugene returned      how do you propose to do that       it isn t the distance from the center of a town that counts   said  eugene   it s the time it takes to get there  this town s already  spreading  bicycles and trolleys have been doing their share  but the  automobile is going to carry city streets clear out to the county line      the major was skeptical   dream on  fair son   he said   it s lucky for  us that you re only dreaming  because if people go to moving that far   real estate values in the old residence part of town are going to be  stretched pretty thin       i m afraid so   eugene assented   unless you keep things so bright and  clean that the old section will stay more attractive than the new ones       not very likely  how are things going to be kept  bright and clean   with soft coal  and our kind of city government       they aren t   eugene replied quickly   there s no hope of it  and  already the boarding house is marching up national avenue  there are  two in the next block below here  and there are a dozen in the half mile  below that  my relatives  the sharons  have sold their house and are  building in the country  at least  they call it  the country   it will  be city in two or three years       good gracious   the major exclaimed  affecting  dismay   so your little  shops are going to ruin all your old friends  eugene       unless my old friends take warning in time  or abolish smoke and get  a new kind of city government  i should say the best chance is to take  warning       well  well   the major laughed   you have enough faith in miracles   eugene  granting that trolleys and bicycles and automobiles are  miracles  so you think they re to change the face of the land  do you       they re already doing it  major  and it can t be stopped   automobiles       at this point he was interrupted  george was the interrupter  he had  said nothing since entering the dining room  but now he spoke in a loud  and peremptory voice  using the tone of one in authority who checks idle  prattle and settles a matter forever      automobiles are a useless nuisance   he said     there fell a moment s silence     isabel gazed incredulously at george  colour slowly heightening upon her  cheeks and temples  while fanny watched him with a quick eagerness  her  eyes alert and bright  but eugene seemed merely quizzical  as if not  taking this brusquerie to himself  the major was seriously disturbed      what did you say  george   he asked  though george had spoken but too  distinctly      i said all automobiles were a nuisance   george answered  repeating not  only the words but the tone in which he had uttered them  and he added    they ll never amount to anything but a nuisance  they had no business  to be invented      the major frowned   of course you forget that mr  morgan makes them  and  also did his share in inventing them  if you weren t so thoughtless he  might think you rather offensive       that would be too bad   said george coolly   i don t think i could  survive it      again there was a silence  while the major stared at his grandson   aghast  but eugene began to laugh cheerfully      i m not sure he s wrong about automobiles   he said   with all their  speed forward they may be a step backward in civilization  that is  in  spiritual civilization  it may be that they will not add to the beauty  of the world  nor to the life of men s souls  i am not sure  but  automobiles have come  and they bring a greater change in our life than  most of us suspect  they are here  and almost all outward things are  going to be different because of what they bring  they are going to  alter war  and they are going to alter peace  i think men s minds are  going to be changed in subtle ways because of automobiles  just how   though  i could hardly guess  but you can t have the immense outward  changes that they will cause without some inward ones  and it may be  that george is right  and that the spiritual alteration will be bad  for us  perhaps  ten or twenty years from now  if we can see the inward  change in men by that time  i shouldn t be able to defend the gasoline  engine  but would have to agree with him that automobiles  had no  business to be invented    he laughed good naturedly  and looking at  his watch  apologized for having an engagement which made his departure  necessary when he would so much prefer to linger  then he shook  hands with the major  and bade isabel  george  and fanny a cheerful  good night  a collective farewell cordially addressed to all three of  them together  and left them at the table     isabel turned wondering  hurt eyes upon her son   george  dear   she  said   what did you mean       just what i said   he returned  lighting one of the major s cigars  and  his manner was imperturbable enough to warrant the definition  sometimes  merited by imperturbability  of stubbornness     isabel s hand  pale and slender  upon the tablecloth  touched one of the  fine silver candlesticks aimlessly  the fingers were seen to tremble    oh  he was hurt   she murmured      i don t see why he should be   george said   i didn t say anything  about him  he didn t seem to me to be hurt  seemed perfectly cheerful   what made you think he was hurt       i know him   was all of her reply  half whispered     the major stared hard at george from under his white eyebrows   you  didn t mean  him   you say  george  i suppose if we had a clergyman as  a guest here you d expect him not to be offended  and to understand that  your remarks were neither personal nor untactful  if you said the church  was a nuisance and ought never to have been invented  by jove  but  you re a puzzle       in what way  may i ask  sir       we seem to have a new kind of young people these days   the old  gentleman returned  shaking his head   it s a new style of courting a  pretty girl  certainly  for a young fellow to go deliberately out of his  way to try and make an enemy of her father by attacking his business  by  jove  that s a new way to win a woman      george flushed angrily and seemed about to offer a retort  but held  his breath for a moment  and then held his peace  it was isabel who  responded to the major   oh  no   she said   eugene would never be  anybody s enemy  he couldn t   and last of all georgie s  i m afraid he  was hurt  but i don t fear his not having understood that george spoke  without thinking of what he was saying  i mean  with out realizing its  bearing on eugene      again george seemed upon the point of speech  and again controlled the  impulse  he thrust his hands in his pockets  leaned back in his chair   and smoked  staring inflexibly at the ceiling      well  well   said his grandfather  rising   it wasn t a very successful  little dinner      thereupon he offered his arm to his daughter  who took it fondly  and  they left the room  isabel assuring him that all his little dinners were  pleasant  and that this one was no exception     george did not move  and fanny  following the other two  came round the  table  and paused close beside his chair  but george remained posed in  his great imperturbability  cigar between teeth  eyes upon ceiling  and  paid no attention to her  fanny waited until the sound of isabel s and  the major s voices became inaudible in the hall  then she said quickly   and in a low voice so eager that it was unsteady      george  you ve struck just the treatment to adopt  you re doing the  right thing      she hurried out  scurrying after the others with a faint rustling of  her black skirts  leaving george mystified but incurious  he did not  understand why she should bestow her approbation upon him in the matter   and cared so little whether she did or not that he spared himself even  the trouble of being puzzled about it     in truth  however  he was neither so comfortable nor so imperturbable as  he appeared  he felt some gratification  he had done a little to put  the man in his place  that man whose influence upon his daughter was  precisely the same thing as a contemptuous criticism of george amberson  minafer  and of george amberson minafer s  ideals of life   lucy s going  away without a word was intended  he supposed  as a bit of punishment   well  he wasn t the sort of man that people were allowed to punish  he  could demonstrate that to them  since they started it     it appeared to him as almost a kind of insolence  this abrupt  departure  not even telephoning  probably she wondered how he would take  it  she even might have supposed he would show some betraying chagrin  when he heard of it     he had no idea that this was just what he had shown  and he was  satisfied with his evening s performance  nevertheless  he was not  comfortable in his mind  though he could not have explained his inward  perturbations  for he was convinced  without any confirmation from his  aunt fanny  that he had done  just the right thing            chapter xx        isabel came to george s door that night  and when she had kissed him  good night she remained in the open doorway with her hand upon his  shoulder and her eyes thoughtfully lowered  so that her wish to say  something more than good night was evident  not less obvious was her  perplexity about the manner of saying it  and george  divining her  thought  amiably made an opening for her      well  old lady   he said indulgently   you needn t look so worried  i  won t be tactless with morgan again  after this i ll just keep out of  his way      isabel looked up  searching his face with the fond puzzlement which her  eyes sometimes showed when they rested upon him  then she glanced down  the hall toward fanny s room  and  after another moment of hesitation   came quickly in  and closed the door      dear   she said   i wish you d tell me something  why don t you like  eugene       oh  i like him well enough   george returned  with a short laugh  as he  sat down and began to unlace his shoes   i like him well enough  in his  place       no  dear   she said hurriedly   i ve had a feeling from the very  first that you didn t really like him  that you really never liked him   sometimes you ve seemed to be friendly with him  and you d laugh with  him over something in a jolly  companionable way  and i d think i was  wrong  and that you really did like him  after all  but to night i m  sure my other feeling was the right one  you don t like him  i can t  understand it  dear  i don t see what can be the matter       nothing s the matter      this easy declaration naturally failed to carry great weight  and isabel  went on  in her troubled voice   it seems so queer  especially when you  feel as you do about his daughter      at this  george stopped unlacing his shoes abruptly  and sat up   how do  i feel about his daughter   he demanded      well  it s seemed  as if  as if    isabel began timidly   it did  seem  at least  you haven t looked at any other girl  ever since they  came here and  and certainly you ve seemed very much interested in her   certainly you ve been very great friends       well  what of that       it s only that i m like your grandfather  i can t see how you could be  so much interested in a girl and  and not feel very pleasantly toward  her father       well  i ll tell you something   george said slowly  and a frown of  concentration could be seen upon his brow  as from a profound effort at  self examination   i haven t ever thought much on that particular point   but i admit there may be a little something in what you say  the truth  is  i don t believe i ve ever thought of the two together  exactly  at  least  not until lately  i ve always thought of lucy just as lucy   and of morgan just as morgan  i ve always thought of her as a  person herself  not as anybody s daughter  i don t see what s very  extraordinary about that  you ve probably got plenty of friends  for  instance  that don t care much about your son        no  indeed   she protested quickly   and if i knew anybody who felt  like that  i wouldn t        never mind   he interrupted   i ll try to explain a little more  if  i have a friend  i don t see that it s incumbent upon me to like that  friend s relatives  if i didn t like them  and pretended to  i d be a  hypocrite  if that friend likes me and wants to stay my friend  he ll  have to stand my not liking his relatives  or else he can quit  i  decline to be a hypocrite about it  that s all  now  suppose i have  certain ideas or ideals which i have chosen for the regulation of my own  conduct in life  suppose some friend of mine has a relative with ideals  directly the opposite of mine  and my friend believes more in the  relative s ideals than in mine  do you think i ought to give up my own  just to please a person who s taken up ideals that i really despise       no  dear  of course people can t give up their ideals  but i don t see  what this has to do with dear little lucy and        i didn t say it had anything to do with them   he interrupted   i was  merely putting a case to show how a person would be justified in being  a friend of one member of a family  and feeling anything but friendly  toward another  i don t say  though  that i feel unfriendly to mr   morgan  i don t say that i feel friendly to him  and i don t say that  i feel unfriendly  but if you really think that i was rude to him  to night        just thoughtless  dear  you didn t see that what you said to night        well  i ll not say anything of that sort again where he can hear it   there  isn t that enough      this question  delivered with large indulgence  met with no response   for isabel  still searching his face with her troubled and perplexed  gaze  seemed not to have heard it  on that account  george repeated it   and rising  went to her and patted her reassuringly upon the shoulder    there  old lady  you needn t fear my tactlessness will worry you again   i can t quite promise to like people i don t care about one way or  another  but you can be sure i ll be careful  after this  not to let  them see it  it s all right  and you d better toddle along to bed   because i want to undress       but  george   she said earnestly   you would like him  if you d just  let yourself  you say you don t dislike him  why don t you like him  i  can t understand at all  what is it that you don t        there  there   he said   it s all right  and you toddle along       but  george  dear        now  now  i really do want to get into bed  good night  old lady       good night  dear  but        let s not talk of it any more   he said   it s all right  and nothing  in the world to worry about  so good night  old lady  i ll be polite  enough to him  never fear  if we happen to be thrown together  so  good night       but  george  dear        i m going to bed  old lady  so good night       thus the interview closed perforce  she kissed him again before going  slowly to her own room  her perplexity evidently not dispersed  but the  subject was not renewed between them the next day or subsequently  nor  did fanny make any allusion to the cryptic approbation she had bestowed  upon her nephew after the major s  not very successful little dinner    though she annoyed george by looking at him oftener and longer than  he cared to be looked at by an aunt  he could not glance her way  it  seemed  without finding her red rimmed eyes fixed upon him eagerly  with  an alert and hopeful calculation in them which he declared would send a  nervous man  into fits  for thus  one day  he broke out  in protest      it would   he repeated vehemently   given time it would  straight into  fits  what do you find the matter with me  is my tie always slipping up  behind  can t you look at something else  my lord  we d better buy a cat  for you to stare at  aunt fanny  a cat could stand it  maybe  what in  the name of goodness do you expect to see      but fanny laughed good naturedly  and was not offended   it s more as  if i expected you to see something  isn t it   she said quietly  still  laughing      now  what do you mean by that       never mind       all right  i don t  but for heaven s sake stare at somebody else  awhile  try it on the house maid       well  well   fanny said indulgently  and then chose to be more obscure  in her meaning than ever  for she adopted a tone of deep sympathy for  her final remark  as she left him   i don t wonder you re nervous these  days  poor boy      and george indignantly supposed that she referred to the ordeal of  lucy s continued absence  during this period he successfully avoided  contact with lucy s father  though eugene came frequently to the  house  and spent several evenings with isabel and fanny  and sometimes  persuaded them and the major to go for an afternoon s motoring  he did  not  however  come again to the major s sunday evening dinner  even when  george amberson returned  sunday evening was the time  he explained  for  going over the week s work with his factory managers     when lucy came home the autumn was far enough advanced to smell of  burning leaves  and for the annual editorials  in the papers  on the  purple haze  the golden branches  the ruddy fruit  and the pleasure of  long tramps in the brown forest  george had not heard of her arrival   and he met her  on the afternoon following that event  at the sharons    where he had gone in the secret hope that he might hear something about  her  janie sharon had just begun to tell him that she heard lucy  was expected home soon  after having  a perfectly gorgeous  time   information which george received with no responsive  enthusiasm  when lucy came demurely in  a proper little autumn figure in  green and brown     her cheeks were flushed  and her dark eyes were bright indeed   evidences  as george supposed  of the excitement incidental to the  perfectly gorgeous time just concluded  though janie and mary sharon  both thought they were the effect of lucy s having seen george s  runabout in front of the house as she came in  george took on colour   himself  as  he rose and nodded indifferently  and the hot suffusion to  which he became subject extended its area to include his neck and ears   nothing could have made him much more indignant than his consciousness  of these symptoms of the icy indifference which it was his purpose not  only to show but to feel     she kissed her cousins  gave george her hand  said  how d you do   and  took a chair beside janie with a composure which augmented george s  indignation      how d you do   he said   i trust that ah  i trust  i do trust       he stopped  for it seemed to him that the word  trust  sounded idiotic   then  to cover his awkwardness  he coughed  and even to his own rosy  ears his cough was ostentatiously a false one  whereupon  seeking to be  plausible  he coughed again  and instantly hated himself  the sound he  made was an atrocity  meanwhile  lucy sat silent  and the two sharon  girls leaned forward  staring at him with strained eyes  their lips  tightly compressed  and both were but too easily diagnosed as subject to  an agitation which threatened their self control  he began again      i er  i hope you have had a  a pleasant time  i er  i hope you are  well  i hope you are extremely  i hope extremely  extremely    and again  he stopped in the midst of his floundering  not knowing how to progress  beyond  extremely   and unable to understand why the infernal word kept  getting into his mouth      i beg your pardon   lucy said     george was never more furious  he felt that he was  making a spectacle  of himself   and no young gentleman in the world was more loath than  george amberson minafer to look a figure of fun  and while he stood  there  undeniably such a figure  with janie and mary sharon threatening  to burst at any moment  if laughter were longer denied them  lucy sat  looking at him with her eyebrows delicately lifted in casual  polite  inquiry  her own complete composure was what most galled him      nothing of the slightest importance   he managed to say   i was just  leaving  good afternoon   and with long strides he reached the door and  hastened through the hall  but before he closed the front door he heard  from janie and mary sharon the outburst of wild  irrepressible emotion  which his performance had inspired     he drove home in a tumultuous mood  and almost ran down two ladies who  were engaged in absorbing conversation at a crossing  they were his  aunt fanny and the stout mrs  johnson  a jerk of the reins at the  last instant saved them by a few inches  but their conversation was so  interesting that they were unaware of their danger  and did not notice  the runabout  nor how close it came to them  george was so furious with  himself and with the girl whose unexpected coming into a room could make  him look such a fool  that it might have soothed him a little if he had  actually run over the two absorbed ladies without injuring them beyond  repair  at least  he said to himself that he wished he had  it might  have taken his mind off of himself for a few minutes  for  in truth  to  be ridiculous  and know it  was one of several things that george was  unable to endure  he was savage     he drove into the major s stable too fast  the sagacious pendennis  saving himself from going through a partition by a swerve which  splintered a shaft of the runabout and almost threw the driver to the  floor  george swore  and then swore again at the fat old darkey  tom   for giggling at his swearing      hoopee   said old tom   mus  been some white lady use mist  jawge  mighty bad  white lady say   no  suh  i ain  go n out ridin   ith mist   jawge no mo    mist  jawge drive in   dam de dam worl   dam de dam hoss   dam de dam nigga   dam de dam dam   hoopee       that ll do   george said sternly      yessuh      george strode from the stable  crossed the major s back yard  then  passed behind the new houses  on his way home  these structures were  now approaching completion  but still in a state of rawness hideous to  george  though  for that matter  they were never to be anything except  hideous to him  behind them  stray planks  bricks  refuse of plaster and  lath  shingles  straw  empty barrels  strips of twisted tin and broken  tiles were strewn everywhere over the dried and pitted gray mud where  once the suave lawn had lain like a green lake around those stately  islands  the two amberson houses  and george s state of mind was  not improved by his present view of this repulsive area  nor by his  sensations when he kicked an uptilted shingle only to discover that  what uptilted it was a brickbat on the other side of it  after that  the  whole world seemed to be one solid conspiracy of malevolence     in this temper he emerged from behind the house nearest to his own  and   glancing toward the street  saw his mother standing with eugene morgan  upon the cement path that led to the front gate  she was bareheaded  and  eugene held his hat and stick in his hand  evidently he had been calling  upon her  and she had come from the house with him  continuing their  conversation and delaying their parting     they had paused in their slow walk from the front door to the gate  yet  still stood side by side  their shoulders almost touching  as though  neither isabel nor eugene quite realized that their feet had ceased to  bear them forward  and they were not looking at each other  but at  some indefinite point before them  as people do who consider together  thoughtfully and in harmony  the conversation was evidently serious  his  head was bent  and isabel s lifted left hand rested against her  cheek  but all the significances of their thoughtful attitude denoted  companionableness and a shared understanding  yet  a stranger  passing   would not have thought them married  somewhere about eugene  not quite  to be located  there was a romantic gravity  and isabel  tall and  graceful  with high colour and absorbed eyes  was visibly no wife  walking down to the gate with her husband     george stared at them  a hot dislike struck him at the sight of eugene   and a vague revulsion  like a strange  unpleasant taste in his mouth   came over him as he looked at his mother  her manner was eloquent of so  much thought about her companion and of such reliance upon him  and the  picture the two thus made was a vivid one indeed  to george  whose angry  eyes  for some reason  fixed themselves most intently upon isabel s  lifted hand  upon the white ruffle at her wrist  bordering the graceful  black sleeve  and upon the little indentations in her cheek where the  tips of her fingers rested  she should not have worn white at her  wrist  or at the throat either  george felt  and then  strangely  his  resentment concentrated upon those tiny indentations at the tips of her  fingers  actual changes  however slight and fleeting  in his mother s  face  made because of mr  eugene morgan  for the moment  it seemed  to george that morgan might have claimed the ownership of a face that  changed for him   it was as if he owned isabel     the two began to walk on toward the gate  where they stopped again   turning to face each other  and isabel s glance  passing eugene  fell  upon george  instantly she smiled and waved her hand to him  while  eugene turned and nodded  but george  standing as in some rigid trance   and staring straight at them  gave these signals of greeting no sign of  recognition whatever  upon this  isabel called to him  waving her hand  again      georgie   she called  laughing   wake up  dear  georgie  hello      george turned away as if he had neither seen nor heard  and stalked into  the house by the side door           chapter xxi      he went to his room  threw off his coat  waistcoat  collar  and tie   letting them lie where they chanced to fall  and then  having violently  enveloped himself in a black velvet dressing gown  continued this action  by lying down with a vehemence that brought a wheeze of protest from his  bed  his repose was only a momentary semblance  however  for it lasted  no longer than the time it took him to groan  riffraff   between his  teeth  then he sat up  swung his feet to the floor  rose  and began to  pace up and down the large room     he had just been consciously rude to his mother for the first time in  his life  for  with all his riding down of populace and riffraff  he  had never before been either deliberately or impulsively disregardful  of her  when he had hurt her it had been accidental  and his remorse for  such an accident was always adequate compensation  and more  to isabel   but now he had done a rough thing to her  and he did not repent  rather  he was the more irritated with her  and when he heard her presently go  by his door with a light step  singing cheerfully to herself as she  went to her room  he perceived that she had mistaken his intention  altogether  or  indeed  had failed to perceive that he had any intention  at all  evidently she had concluded that he refused to speak to her and  morgan out of sheer absent mindedness  supposing him so immersed in some  preoccupation that he had not seen them or heard her calling to him   therefore there was nothing of which to repent  even if he had been so  minded  and probably eugene himself was unaware that any disapproval had  recently been expressed  george snorted  what sort of a dreamy loon did  they take him to be     there came a delicate  eager tapping at his door  not done with a  knuckle but with the tip of a fingernail  which was instantly clarified  to george s mind s eye as plainly as if he saw it  the long and  polished white mooned pink shield on the end of his aunt fanny s right  forefinger  but george was in no mood for human communications  and  even when things went well he had little pleasure in fanny s society   therefore it is not surprising that at the sound of her tapping  instead  of bidding her enter  he immediately crossed the room with the intention  of locking the door to keep her out     fanny was too eager  and  opening the door before he reached it  came  quickly in  and closed it behind her  she was in a street dress and a  black hat  with a black umbrella in her black gloved hand  for fanny s  heavy mourning  at least  was nowhere tempered with a glimpse of white   though the anniversary of wilbur s death had passed  an infinitesimal  perspiration gleamed upon her pale skin  she breathed fast  as if she  had run up the stairs  and excitement was sharp in her widened eyes  her  look was that of a person who had just seen something extraordinary or  heard thrilling news      now  what on earth do you want   her chilling nephew demanded      george   she said hurriedly   i saw what you did when you wouldn t  speak to them  i was sitting with mrs  johnson at her front window   across the street  and i saw it all       well  what of it       you did right   fanny said with a vehemence not the less spirited  because she suppressed her voice almost to a whisper   you did exactly  right  you re behaving splendidly about the whole thing  and i want to  tell you i know your father would thank you if he could see what you re  doing       my lord   george broke out at her   you make me dizzy  for heaven s  sake quit the mysterious detective business  at least do quit it around  me  go and try it on somebody else  if you like  but i don t want to  hear it      she began to tremble  regarding him with a fixed gaze   you don t care  to hear then   she said huskily   that i approve of what you re doing       certainly not  since i haven t the faintest idea what you think i m   doing   naturally i don t care whether you approve of it or not  all  i d like  if you please  is to be alone  i m not giving a tea here  this  afternoon  if you ll permit me to mention it      fanny s gaze wavered  she began to blink  then suddenly she sank into a  chair and wept silently  but with a terrible desolation      oh  for the lord s sake   he moaned   what in the world is wrong with  you       you re always picking on me   she quavered wretchedly  her voice  indistinct with the wetness that bubbled into it from her tears   you  do  you always pick on me  you ve always done it  always  ever since you  were a little boy  whenever anything goes wrong with you  you take it  out on me  you do  you always       george flung to heaven a gesture of despair  it seemed to him the last  straw that fanny should have chosen this particular time to come and sob  in his room over his mistreatment of her      oh  my lord   he whispered  then  with a great effort  addressed her  in a reasonable tone   look here  aunt fanny  i don t see what you re  making all this fuss about  of course i know i ve teased you sometimes   but        teased  me   she wailed   teased  me  oh  it does seem too hard   sometimes  this mean old life of mine does seem too hard  i don t think  i can stand it  honestly  i don t think i can  i came in here just to  show you i sympathized with you  just to say something pleasant to you   and you treat me as if i were  oh  no  you wouldn t treat a servant  the way you treat me  you wouldn t treat anybody in the world like this  except old fanny   old fanny  you say   it s nobody but old fanny   so i ll kick her  nobody will resent it  i ll kick her all i  want to   you do  that s how you think of me i know it  and you re  right  i haven t got anything in the world  since my brother  died  nobody  nothing  nothing       oh my lord   george groaned     fanny spread out her small  soaked handkerchief  and shook it in the  air to dry it a little  crying as damply and as wretchedly during this  operation  as before  a sight which gave george a curious shock to add  to his other agitations  it seemed so strange   i ought not to have  come   she went on   because i might have known it would only give you  an excuse to pick on me again  i m sorry enough i came  i can tell you   i didn t mean to speak of it again to you  at all  and i wouldn t have   but i saw how you treated them  and i guess i got excited about it  and  couldn t help following the impulse  but i ll know better next time   i can tell you  i ll keep my mouth shut as i meant to  and as i would  have  if i hadn t got excited and if i hadn t felt sorry for you  but  what does it matter to anybody if i m sorry for them  i m only old  fanny       oh  good gracious  how can it matter to me who s sorry for me when i  don t know what they re sorry about       you re so proud   she quavered   and so hard  i tell you i didn t mean  to speak of it to you  and i never  never in the world would have told  you about it  nor have made the faintest reference to it  if i hadn t  seen that somebody else had told you  or you d found out for yourself  some way  i       in despair of her intelligence  and in some doubt of his own  george  struck the palms of his hands together   somebody else had told me what   i d found what out for myself       how people are talking about your mother      except for the incidental teariness of her voice  her tone was casual   as though she mentioned a subject previously discussed and understood   for fanny had no doubt that george had only pretended to be mystified  because  in his pride  he would not in words admit that he knew what he  knew      what did you say   he asked incredulously      of course i understood what you were doing   fanny went on  drying her  handkerchief again   it puzzled other people when you began to be rude  to eugene  because they couldn t see how you could treat him as you did  when you were so interested in lucy  but i remembered how you came to  me  that other time when there was so much talk about isabel  and i  knew you d give lucy up in a minute  if it came to a question of your  mother s reputation  because you said then that        look here   george interrupted in a shaking voice   look here  i d  like    he stopped  unable to go on  his agitation was so great  his  chest heaved as from hard running  and his complexion  pallid at first   had become mottled  fiery splotches appearing at his temples and cheeks    what do you mean by telling me  telling me there s talk about  about     he gulped  and began again   what do you mean by using such words as   reputation   what do you mean  speaking of a  question  of my  my  mother s reputation      fanny looked up at him woefully over the handkerchief which she now  applied to her reddened nose   god knows i m sorry for you  george   she  murmured   i wanted to say so  but it s only old fanny  so whatever  she says  even when it s sympathy  pick on her for it  hammer her   she  sobbed   hammer her  it s only poor old lonely fanny       you look here   george said harshly   when i spoke to my uncle george  after that rotten thing i heard aunt amelia say about my mother  he  said if there was any gossip it was about you  he said people might be  laughing about the way you ran after morgan  but that was all      fanny lifted her hands  clenched them  and struck them upon her knees    yes  it s always fanny   she sobbed   ridiculous old fanny  always   always       you listen   george said   after i d talked to uncle george i saw you   and you said i had a mean little mind for thinking there might be truth  in what aunt amelia said about people talking  you denied it  and that  wasn t the only time  you d attacked me before then  because i intimated  that morgan might be coming here too often  you made me believe that  mother let him come entirely on your account  and now you say        i think he did   fanny interrupted desolately   i think he did come as  much to see me as anything  for a while it looked like it  anyhow  he  liked to dance with me  he danced with me as much as he danced with her   and he acted as if he came on my account at least as much as he did on  hers  he did act a good deal that way  and if wilbur hadn t died        you told me there wasn t any talk       i didn t think there was much  then   fanny protested   i didn t know  how much there was       what       people don t come and tell such things to a person s family  you know   you don t suppose anybody was going to say to george amberson that his  sister was getting herself talked about  do you  or that they were going  to say much to me       you told me   said george  fiercely   that mother never saw him except  when she was chaperoning you       they weren t much alone together  then   fanny returned   hardly  ever  before wilbur died  but you don t suppose that stops people from  talking  do you  your father never went anywhere  and people saw eugene  with her everywhere she went  and though i was with them people just  thought   she choked   they just thought i didn t count   only old fanny  minafer   i suppose they d say  besides  everybody knew that he d been  engaged to her        what s that   george cried      everybody knows it  don t you remember your grandfather speaking of it  at the sunday dinner one night       he didn t say they were engaged or        well  they were  everybody knows it  and she broke it off on account of  that serenade when eugene didn t know what he was doing  he drank when  he was a young man  and she wouldn t stand it  but everybody in this  town knows that isabel has never really cared for any other man in her  life  poor wilbur  he was the only soul alive that didn t know it      nightmare had descended upon the unfortunate george  he leaned back  against the foot board of his bed  gazing wildly at his aunt   i believe  i m going crazy   he said   you mean when you told me there wasn t any  talk  you told me a falsehood       no   fanny gasped      you did       i tell you i didn t know how much talk there was  and it wouldn t have  amounted to much if wilbur had lived   and fanny completed this with a  fatal admission   i didn t want you to interfere      george overlooked the admission  his mind was not now occupied with  analysis   what do you mean   he asked   when you say that if father had  lived  the talk wouldn t have amounted to anything       things might have been  they might have been different       you mean morgan might have married you      fanny gulped   no  because i don t know that i d have accepted him   she  had ceased to weep  and now she sat up stiffly   i certainly didn t care  enough about him to marry him  i wouldn t have let myself care that  much until he showed that he wished to marry me  i m not that sort of  person   the poor lady paid her vanity this piteous little tribute    what i mean is  if wilbur hadn t died  people wouldn t have had it  proved before their very eyes that what they d been talking about was  true       you say  you say that people believe    george shuddered  then forced  himself to continue  in a sick voice   they believe my mother is  is in  love with that man       of course       and because he comes here  and they see her with him driving  and all  that  they think they were right when they said she was in  in love with  him before  before my father died      she looked at him gravely with her eyes now dry between their reddened  lids   why  george   she said  gently   don t you know that s what they  say  you must know that everybody in town thinks they re going to be  married very soon      george uttered an incoherent cry  and sections of him appeared to  writhe  he was upon the verge of actual nausea      you know it   fanny cried  getting up   you don t think i d have  spoken of it to you unless i was sure you knew it   her voice was wholly  genuine  as it had been throughout the wretched interview  fanny s  sincerity was unquestionable   george  i wouldn t have told you  if you  didn t know  what other reason could you have for treating eugene as you  did  or for refusing to speak to them like that a while ago in the yard   somebody must have told you       who told you   he said      what       who told you there was talk  where is this talk  where does it come  from  who does it       why  i suppose pretty much everybody   she said   i know it must be  pretty general       who said so       what      george stepped close to her   you say people don t speak to a person of  gossip about that person s family  well  how did you hear it  then  how  did you get hold of it  answer me      fanny looked thoughtful   well  of course nobody not one s most intimate  friends would speak to them about such things  and then only in the  kindest  most considerate way       who s spoken of it to you in any way at all   george demanded      why    fanny hesitated      you answer me       i hardly think it would be fair to give names       look here   said george   one of your most intimate friends is that  mother of charlie johnson s  for instance  has she ever mentioned this  to you  you say everybody is talking  is she one       oh  she may have intimated        i m asking you  has she ever spoken of it to you       she s a very kind  discreet woman  george  but she may have  intimated       george had a sudden intuition  as there flickered into his mind the  picture of a street crossing and two absorbed ladies almost run down by  a fast horse   you and she have been talking about it to day   he cried    you were talking about it with her not two hours ago  do you deny it       i        do you deny it       no       all right   said george   that s enough      she caught at his arm as he turned away   what are you going to do   george       i ll not talk about it  now   he said heavily   i think you ve done a  good deal for one day  aunt fanny      and fanny  seeing the passion in his face  began to be alarmed  she  tried to retain possession of the black velvet sleeve which her fingers  had clutched  and he suffered her to do so  but used this leverage to  urge her to the door   george  you know i m sorry for you  whether you  care or not   she whimpered   i never in the world would have spoken of  it  if i hadn t thought you knew all about it  i wouldn t have       but he had opened the door with his free hand   never mind   he said   and she was obliged to pass out into the hall  the door closing quickly  behind her           chapter xxii      george took off his dressing gown and put on a collar and a tie  his  fingers shaking so that the tie was not his usual success  then he  picked up his coat and waistcoat  and left the room while still in  process of donning them  fastening the buttons  as he ran down the front  stairs to the door  it was not until he reached the middle of the street  that he realized that he had forgotten his hat  and he paused for an  irresolute moment  during which his eye wandered  for no reason  to the  fountain of neptune  this castiron replica of too elaborate sculpture  stood at the next corner  where the major had placed it when the  addition was laid out so long ago  the street corners had been shaped to  conform with the great octagonal basin  which was no great inconvenience  for horse drawn vehicles  but a nuisance to speeding automobiles  and   even as george looked  one of the latter  coming too fast  saved itself  only by a dangerous skid as it rounded the fountain  this skid was to  george s liking  though he would have been more pleased to see the car  go over  for he was wishing grief and destruction  just then  upon all  the automobiles in the world     his eyes rested a second or two longer upon the fountain of neptune  not  an enlivening sight even in the shielding haze of autumn twilight  for  more than a year no water had run in the fountain  the connections had  been broken  and the major was evasive about restorations  even when  reminded by his grandson that a dry fountain is as gay as a dry fish   soot streaks and a thousand pits gave neptune the distinction  at least   of leprosy  which the mermaids associated with him had been consistent  in catching  and his trident had been so deeply affected as to drop its  prongs  altogether  this heavy work of heavy art  smoked dry  hugely  scabbed  cracked  and crumbling  was a dismal sight to the distracted  eye of george amberson minafer  and its present condition of craziness  may have added a mite to his own  his own was sufficient  with no  additions  however  as he stood looking at the johnsons  house and  those houses on both sides of it  that row of riffraff dwellings he had  thought so damnable  the day when he stood in his grandfather s yard   staring at them  after hearing what his aunt amelia said of the  talk   about his mother     he decided that he needed no hat for the sort of call he intended to  make  and went forward hurriedly  mrs  johnson was at home  the irish  girl who came to the door informed him  and he was left to await the  lady  in a room like an elegant well  the johnsons   reception room    floor space  nothing to mention  walls  blue calcimined  ceiling  twelve  feet from the floor  inside shutters and gray lace curtains  five gilt  chairs  a brocaded sofa  soiled  and an inlaid walnut table  supporting  two tall alabaster vases  a palm  with two leaves  dying in a corner     mrs  johnson came in  breathing noticeably  and her round head  smoothly  but economically decorated with the hair of an honest woman  seemed  to be lingering far in the background of the alpine bosom which took  precedence of the rest of her everywhere  but when she was all in the  room  it was to be seen that her breathing was the result of hospitable  haste to greet the visitor  and her hand  not so dry as neptune s  fountain  suggested that she had paused for only the briefest ablutions   george accepted this cold  damp lump mechanically      mr  amberson  i mean mr  minafer   she exclaimed   i m really  delighted  i understood you asked for me  mr  johnson s out of the city   but charlie s downtown and i m looking for him at any minute  now  and  he ll be so pleased that you        i didn t want to see charlie   george said   i want      do sit down   the hospitable lady urged him  seating herself upon the  sofa   do sit down       no  i thank you  i wish        surely you re not going to run away again  when you ve just come  do  sit down  mr  minafer  i hope you re all well at your house and at the  dear old major s  too  he s looking        mrs  johnson  george said  in a strained loud voice which arrested  her attention immediately  so that she was abruptly silent  leaving her  surprised mouth open  she had already been concealing some astonishment  at this unexampled visit  however  and the condition of george s  ordinarily smooth hair  for he had overlooked more than his hat  had not  alleviated her perplexity   mrs  johnson   he said   i have come to ask  you a few questions which i would like you to answer  if you please      she became grave at once   certainly  mr  minafer  anything i can       he interrupted sternly  yet his voice shook in spite of its sternness    you were talking with my aunt fanny about my mother this afternoon      at this mrs  johnson uttered an involuntary gasp  but she recovered  herself   then i m sure our conversation was a very pleasant one  if we  were talking of your mother  because       again he interrupted   my aunt has told me what the conversation  virtually was  and i don t mean to waste any time  mrs  johnson   you were talking about a    george s shoulders suddenly heaved  uncontrollably  but he went fiercely on   you were discussing a scandal  that involved my mother s name       mr  minafer       isn t that the truth       i don t feel called upon to answer  mr  minafer   she said with visible  agitation   i do not consider that you have any right        my aunt told me you repeated this scandal to her       i don t think your aunt can have said that   mrs  johnson returned  sharply   i did not repeat a scandal of any kind to your aunt and  i think you are mistaken in saying she told you i did  we may  have  discussed some matters that have been a topic of comment about town        yes   george cried   i think you may have  that s what i m here about   and what i intend to        don t tell me what you intend  please   mrs  johnson interrupted  crisply   and i should prefer that you would not make your voice quite  so loud in this house  which i happen to own  your aunt may have told  you  though i think it would have been very unwise in her if she did   and not very considerate of me  she may have told you that we discussed  some such topic as i have mentioned  and possibly that would have been  true  if i talked it over with her  you may be sure i spoke in the most  charitable spirit  and without sharing in other people s disposition to  put an evil interpretation on what may  be nothing more than unfortunate  appearances and        my god   said george   i can t stand this       you have the option of dropping the subject   mrs  johnson suggested  tartly  and she added   or of leaving the house       i ll do that soon enough  but first i mean to know        i am perfectly willing to tell you anything you wish if you will  remember to ask it quietly  i ll also take the liberty of reminding you  that i had a perfect right to discuss the subject with your aunt  other  people may be less considerate in not confining their discussion of it   as i have  to charitable views expressed only to a member of the family   other people        other people   the unhappy george repeated viciously   that s what i  want to know about  these other people       i beg your pardon       i want to ask you about them  you say you know of other people who talk  about this       i presume they do       how many       what       i want to know how many other people talk about it       dear  dear   she protested   how should i know that       haven t you heard anybody mention it       i presume so       well  how many have you heard      mrs  johnson was becoming more annoyed than apprehensive  and she  showed it   really  this isn t a court room   she said   and i m not a  defendant in a libel suit  either      the unfortunate young man lost what remained of his balance   you may  be   he cried   i intend to know just who s dared to say these things   if i have to force my way into every house in town  and i m going to  make them take every word of it back  i mean to know the name of every  slanderer that s spoken of this matter to you and of every tattler  you ve passed it on to yourself  i mean to know        you ll know something pretty quick   she said  rising with difficulty   and her voice was thick with the sense of insult   you ll know that  you re out in the street  please to leave my house      george stiffened sharply  then he bowed  and strode out of the door     three minutes later  disheveled and perspiring  but cold all over  he  burst into his uncle george s room at the major s without knocking   amberson was dressing      good gracious  georgie   he exclaimed   what s up       i ve just come from mrs  johnson s  across the street   george panted      you have your own tastes   was amberson s comment   but curious as they  are  you ought to do something better with your hair  and button your  waistcoat to the right buttons  even for mrs  johnson  what were you  doing over there       she told me to leave the house   george said desperately   i went there  because aunt fanny told me the whole town was talking about my mother  and that man morgan  that they say my mother is going to marry him and  that proves she was too fond of him before my father died  she said this  mrs  johnson was one that talked about it  and i went to her to ask who  were the others      amberson s jaw fell in dismay   don t tell me you did that   he said  in  a low voice  and then  seeing that it was true   oh  now you have done  it            chapter xxiii         i ve  done it    george cried   what do you mean  i ve done it  and  what have i done      amberson had collapsed into an easy chair beside his dressing table  the  white evening tie he had been about to put on dangling from his hand   which had fallen limply on the arm of the chair  the tie dropped to the  floor before he replied  and the hand that had held it was lifted to  stroke his graying hair reflectively   by jove   he muttered   that is  too bad      george folded his arms bitterly   will you kindly answer my question   what have i done that wasn t honourable and right  do you think these  riffraff can go about bandying my mother s name        they can now   said amberson   i don t know if they could before  but  they certainly can now       what do you mean by that      his uncle sighed profoundly  picked up his tie and  preoccupied with  despondency  twisted the strip of white lawn till it became unwearable   meanwhile  he tried to enlighten his nephew   gossip is never fatal   georgie   he said   until it is denied  gossip goes on about every  human being alive and about all the dead that are alive enough to be  remembered  and yet almost never does any harm until some defender makes  a controversy  gossip s a nasty thing  but it s sickly  and if people  of good intentions will let it entirely alone  it will die  ninety nine  times out of a hundred       see here   george said   i didn t come to listen to any generalizing  dose of philosophy  i ask you        you asked me what you ve done  and i m telling you   amberson gave him  a melancholy smile  continuing   suffer me to do it in my own way  fanny  says there s been talk about your mother  and that mrs  johnson does  some of it  i don t know  because naturally nobody would come to me with  such stuff or mention it before me  but it s presumably true  i suppose  it is  i ve seen fanny with mrs  johnson quite a lot  and that old lady  is a notorious gossip  and that s why she ordered you out of her house  when you pinned her down that she d been gossiping  i have a suspicion  mrs  johnson has been quite a comfort to fanny in their long talks  but  she ll probably quit speaking to her over this  because fanny told you   i suppose it s true that the  whole town   a lot of others  that is   do share in the gossip  in this town  naturally  anything about any  amberson has always been a stone dropped into the centre of a pond  and  a lie would send the ripples as far as a truth would  i ve been on a  steamer when the story went all over the boat  the second day out   that  the prettiest girl on board didn t have any ears  and you can take it  as a rule that when a woman s past thirty five the prettier her hair is   the more certain you are to meet somebody with reliable information that  it s a wig  you can be sure that for many years there s been more gossip  in this place about the ambersons than about any other family  i dare  say it isn t so much so now as it used to be  because the town got too  big long ago  but it s the truth that the more prominent you are the  more gossip there is about you  and the more people would like to pull  you down  well  they can t do it as long as you refuse to know what  gossip there is about you  but the minute you notice it  it s got you   i m not speaking of certain kinds of slander that sometimes people have  got to take to the courts  i m talking of the wretched buzzing the  mrs  john sons do  the thing you seem to have such a horror of  people   talking   the kind of thing that has assailed your mother  people who  have repeated a slander either get ashamed or forget it  if they re  let alone  challenge them  and in self defense they believe everything  they ve said  they d rather believe you a sinner than believe themselves  liars  naturally  submit to gossip and you kill it  fight it and you  make it strong  people will forget almost any slander except one that s  been fought       is that all   george asked      i suppose so   his uncle murmured sadly      well  then  may i ask what you d have done  in my place       i m not sure  georgie  when i was your age i was like you in many ways   especially in not being very cool headed  so i can t say  youth can t be  trusted for much  except asserting itself and fighting and making love       indeed   george snorted   may i ask what you think i ought to have  done       nothing        nothing   george echoed  mocking bitterly  i suppose you think i mean  to let my mother s good name        your mother s good name   amberson cut him off impatiently   nobody  has a good name in a bad mouth  nobody has a good name in a silly mouth   either  well  your mother s name was in some silly mouths  and all  you ve done was to go and have a scene with the worst old woman gossip  in the town  a scene that s going to make her into a partisan against  your mother  whereas she was a mere prattler before  don t you suppose  she ll be all over town with this to morrow  to morrow  why  she ll  have her telephone going to night as long as any of her friends are up   people that never heard anything about this are going to hear it all  now  with embellishments  and she ll see to it that everybody who s  hinted anything about poor isabel will know that you re on the warpath   and that will put them on the defensive and make them vicious  the story  will grow as it spreads and       george unfolded his arms to strike his right fist into his left palm    but do you suppose i m going to tolerate such things   he shouted    what do you suppose i ll be doing       nothing helpful       oh  you think so  do you       you can do absolutely nothing   said amberson   nothing of any use  the  more you do the more harm you ll do       you ll see  i m going to stop this thing if i have to force my way into  every house on national avenue and amberson boulevard      his uncle laughed rather sourly  but made no other comment      well  what do you propose to do   george demanded   do you propose to  sit there        yes         and let this riffraff bandy my mother s good name back and forth  among them  is that what you propose to do       it s all i can do   amberson returned   it s all any of us can do now   just sit still and hope that the thing may die down in time  in spite of  your stirring up that awful old woman      george drew a long breath  then advanced and stood close before his  uncle   didn t you understand me when i told you that people are saying  my mother means to marry this man       yes  i understood you       you say that my going over there has made matters worse   george went  on   how about it if such a  such an unspeakable marriage did take  place  do you think that would make people believe they d been wrong in  saying  you know what they say       no   said amberson deliberately   i don t believe it would  there d be  more badness in the bad mouths and more silliness in the silly mouths  i  dare say  but it wouldn t hurt isabel and eugene  if they never heard  of it  and if they did hear of it  then they could take their choice  between placating gossip or living for their own happiness  if they have  decided to marry       george almost staggered   good god   he gasped   you speak of it  calmly      amberson looked up at him inquiringly   why shouldn t they marry if they  want to   he asked   it s their own affair       why shouldn t they   george echoed   why shouldn t they       yes  why shouldn t they  i don t see anything precisely monstrous about  two people getting married when they re both free and care about each  other  what s the matter with their marrying       it would be monstrous   george shouted   monstrous even if this  horrible thing hadn t happened  but now in the face of this  oh  that  you can sit there and even speak of it  your own sister  o god  oh    he  became incoherent  swinging away from amberson and making for the door   wildly gesturing      for heaven s sake  don t be so theatrical   said his uncle  and then   seeing that george was leaving the room   come back here  you mustn t  speak to your mother of this       don t  tend to   george said indistinctly  and he plunged out into the  big dimly lit hall  he passed his grandfather s room on the way to  the stairs  and the major was visible within  his white head brightly  illumined by a lamp  as he bent low over a ledger upon his roll top  desk  he did not look up  and his grandson strode by the door  not  really conscious of the old figure stooping at its tremulous work with  long additions and subtractions that refused to balance as they used to   george went home and got a hat and overcoat without seeing either his  mother or fanny  then he left word that he would be out for dinner  and  hurried away from the house     he walked the dark streets of amberson addition for an hour  then went  downtown and got coffee at a restaurant  after that he walked through  the lighted parts of the town until ten o clock  when he turned north  and came back to the purlieus of the addition  he strode through the  length and breadth of it again  his hat pulled down over his forehead   his overcoat collar turned up behind  he walked fiercely  though his  feet ached  but by and by he turned homeward  and  when he reached the  major s  went in and sat upon the steps of the huge stone veranda in  front  an obscure figure in that lonely and repellent place  all lights  were out at the major s  and finally  after twelve  he saw his mother s  window darken at home     he waited half an hour longer  then crossed the front yards of the new  houses and let himself noiselessly in the front door  the light in  the hall had been left burning  and another in his own room  as he  discovered when he got there  he locked the door quickly and without  noise  but his fingers were still upon the key when there was a quick  footfall in the hall outside      georgie  dear      he went to the other end of the room before replying      yes       i d been wondering where you were  dear       had you      there was a pause  then she said timidly   wherever it was  i hope you  had a pleasant evening      after a silence   thank you   he said  without expression     another silence followed before she spoke again      you wouldn t care to be kissed good night  i suppose   and with  a little flurry of placative laughter  she added   at your age  of  course       i m going to bed  now   he said   goodnight      another silence seemed blanker than those which had preceded it  and  finally her voice came  it was blank  too      good night      after he was in bed his thoughts became more tumultuous than ever  while  among all the inchoate and fragmentary sketches of this dreadful day   now rising before him  the clearest was of his uncle collapsed in a  big chair with a white tie dangling from his hand  and one conviction   following upon that picture  became definite in george s mind  that his  uncle george amberson was a hopeless dreamer from whom no help need be  expected  an amiable imbecile lacking in normal impulses  and wholly  useless in a struggle which required honour to be defended by a man of  action     then would return a vision of mrs  johnson s furious round head   set behind her great bosom like the sun far sunk on the horizon of a  mountain plateau  and her crackling  asthmatic voice     without sharing  in other people s disposition to put an evil interpretation on what may  be nothing more than unfortunate appearances       other people may be  less considerate in not confining their discussion of it  as i have  to  charitable views       you ll know something pretty quick  you ll know  you re out in the street      and then george would get up again  and  again  and pace the floor in his bare feet     that was what the tormented young man was doing when daylight came  gauntly in at his window  pacing the floor  rubbing his head in his  hands  and muttering      it can t be true  this can t be happening to me            chapter xxiv        breakfast was brought to him in his room  as usual  but he did not  make his normal healthy raid upon the dainty tray  the food remained  untouched  and he sustained himself upon coffee  four cups of it  which  left nothing of value inside the glistening little percolator  during  this process he heard his mother being summoned to the telephone in the  hall  not far from his door  and then her voice responding   yes  oh   it s you  indeed i should     of course      then i ll expect you about  three    yes  good bye till then   a few minutes later he heard her  speaking to someone beneath his window and  looking out  saw her  directing the removal of plants from a small garden bed to the major s  conservatory for the winter  there was an air of briskness about her  as  she turned away to go into the house  she laughed gaily with the major s  gardener over something he said  and this unconcerned cheerfulness of  her was terrible to her son     he went to his desk  and  searching the jumbled contents of a drawer   brought forth a large  unframed photograph of his father  upon which he  gazed long and piteously  till at last hot tears stood in his eyes  it  was strange how the inconsequent face of wilbur seemed to increase in  high significance during this belated interview between father and son   and how it seemed to take on a reproachful nobility  and yet  under the  circumstances  nothing could have been more natural than that george   having paid but the slightest attention to his father in life  should  begin to deify him  now that he was dead   poor  poor father   the son  whispered brokenly   poor man  i m glad you didn t know      he wrapped the picture in a sheet of newspaper  put it under his arm   and  leaving the house hurriedly and stealthily  went downtown to the  shop of a silversmith  where he spent sixty dollars on a resplendently  festooned silver frame for the picture  having lunched upon more coffee   he returned to the house at two o clock  carrying the framed photograph  with him  and placed it upon the centre table in the library  the room  most used by isabel and fanny and himself  then he went to a front  window of the long  reception room   and sat looking out through the  lace curtains     the house was quiet  though once or twice he heard his mother and fanny  moving about upstairs  and a ripple of song in the voice of isabel  a  fragment from the romantic ballad of lord bateman      lord bateman was a noble lord  a noble lord of high degree  and he  sailed west and he sailed east  far countries for to see         the words became indistinct  the air was hummed absently  the humming  shifted to a whistle  then drifted out of hearing  and the place was  still again     george looked often at his watch  but his vigil did not last an hour  at  ten minutes of three  peering through the curtain  he saw an automobile  stop in front of the house and eugene morgan jump lightly down from it   the car was of a new pattern  low and long  with an ample seat in the  tonneau  facing forward  and a professional driver sat at the wheel  a  strange figure in leather  goggled out of all personality and seemingly  part of the mechanism     eugene himself  as he came up the cement path to the house  was a figure  of the new era which was in time to be so disastrous to stiff hats and  skirted coats  and his appearance afforded a debonair contrast to that  of the queer looking duck capering  at the amberson ball in an old dress  coat  and chugging up national avenue through the snow in his nightmare  of a sewing machine  eugene  this afternoon  was richly in the new  outdoor mode  motoring coat was soft gray fur  his cap and gloves were  of gray suede  and though lucy s hand may have shown itself in the  selection of these garnitures  he wore them easily  even with becoming  hint of jauntiness  some change might be his face  too  for a successful  man is seldom to be mistaken  especially if his temper be genial  eugene  had begun to look like a millionaire     but above everything else  what was most evident about him  as he came  up the path  was confidence in the happiness promised by his errand  the  anticipation in his eyes could have been read by a stranger  his look  at the door of isabel s house was the look of a man who is quite  certain that the next moment will reveal something ineffably charming   inexpressibly dear     when the bell rang  george waited at the entrance of the  reception  room  until a housemaid came through the hall on her way to answer the  summons      you needn t mind  mary   he told her   i ll see who it is and what they  want  probably it s only a pedlar       thank you  sir  mister george   said mary  and returned to the rear of  the house     george went slowly to the front door  and halted  regarding the misty  silhouette of the caller upon the ornamental frosted glass  after a  minute of waiting  this silhouette changed outline so that an arm  could be distinguished  an arm outstretched toward the bell  as if the  gentleman outside doubted whether or not it had sounded  and were minded  to try again  but before the gesture was completed george abruptly threw  open the door  and stepped squarely upon the middle of the threshold     a slight change shadowed the face of eugene  his look of happy  anticipation gave way to something formal and polite   how do you  do  george   he said   mrs  minafer expects to go driving with me  i  believe  if you ll be so kind as to send her word that i m here      george made not the slightest movement      no   he said     eugene was incredulous  even when his second glance revealed how hot of  eye was the haggard young man before him   i beg your pardon  i said        i heard you   said george   you said you had an engagement with my  mother  and i told you  no      eugene gave him a steady look  and then he quietly   what is the  the  difficulty      george kept his own voice quiet enough  but that  did not mitigate the  vibrant fury of it   my  mother will have no interest in knowing that  you came here to day   he said   or any other day      eugene continued to look at him with a scrutiny in which began to gleam  a profound anger  none less powerful because it was so quiet   i am  afraid i do not understand you       i doubt if i could make it much plainer   george said  raising his  voice slightly   but i ll try  you re not wanted in this house  mr   morgan  now or at any other time  perhaps you ll understand  this      and with the last word he closed the door in eugene s face     then  not moving away  he stood just inside door  and noted that the  misty silhouette remained upon the frosted glass for several moments   as if the forbidden gentleman debated in his mind what course to pursue    let him ring again   george thought grimly   or try the side door  or  the kitchen      but eugene made no further attempt  the silhouette disappeared   footsteps could be heard withdrawing across the floor of the veranda   and george  returning to the window in the  reception room   was  rewarded by the sight of an automobile manufacturer in baffled retreat   with all his wooing furs and fineries mocking him  eugene got into his  car slowly  not looking back at the house which had just taught him such  a lesson  and it was easily visible  even from a window seventy feet  distant  that he was not the same light suitor who had jumped so  gallantly from the car only a few minutes earlier  observing the  heaviness of his movements as he climbed into the tonneau  george  indulged in a sickish throat rumble which bore a distant cousinship to  mirth     the car was quicker than its owner  it shot away as soon as he had sunk  into his seat  and george  having watched its impetuous disappearance  from his field of vision  ceased to haunt the window  he went to the  library  and  seating himself beside the table whereon he had placed  the photograph of his father  picked up a book  and pretended to be  engaged in reading it     presently isabel s buoyant step was heard descending the stairs  and her  low  sweet whistling  renewing the air of  lord bateman   she came into  the library  still whistling thoughtfully  a fur coat over her arm   ready to put on  and two veils round her small black hat  her right hand  engaged in buttoning the glove upon her left  and  as the large room  contained too many pieces of heavy furniture  and the inside shutters  excluded most of the light of day  she did not at once perceive george s  presence  instead  she went to the bay window at the end of the room   which afforded a view of the street  and glanced out expectantly  then  bent her attention upon her glove  after that  looked out toward the  street again  ceased to whistle  and turned toward the interior of the  room      why  georgie      she came  leaned over from behind him  and there was a faint  exquisite  odour as from distant apple blossoms as she kissed his cheek   dear  i  waited lunch almost an hour for you  but you didn t come  did you lunch  out somewhere       yes   he did not look up from the book      did you have plenty to eat       yes       are you sure  wouldn t you like to have maggie get you something now  in the dining room  or they could bring it to you here  if you think it  would be cozier  shan t i       a tinkling bell was audible  and she moved to the doorway into the hall    i m going out driving  dear  i    she interrupted herself to address  the housemaid  who was passing through the hall   i think it s mr   morgan  mary  tell him i ll be there at once       yes  ma am      mary returned   twas a pedlar  ma am       another one   isabel said  surprised   i thought you said it was a  pedlar when the bell rang a little while ago       mister george said it was  ma am  he went to the door   mary informed  her  disappearing      there seem to be a great many of them   isabel mused   what did yours  want to sell  george       he didn t say       you must have cut him off short   she laughed  and then  still standing  in the doorway  she noticed the big silver frame upon the table beside  him   gracious  georgie   she exclaimed   you have been investing   and  as she came across the room for a closer view   is it  is it lucy    she asked half timidly  half archly  but the next instant she saw whose  likeness was thus set forth in elegiac splendour  and she was silent   except for a long  just audible  oh      he neither looked up nor moved      that was nice of you  georgie   she said  in a low voice presently   i  ought to have had it framed  myself  when i gave it to you      he said nothing  and  standing beside him  she put her hand gently upon  his shoulder  then as gently withdrew it  and went out of the room  but  she did not go upstairs  he heard the faint rustle of her dress in the  hall  and then the sound of her footsteps in the  reception room   after  a time  silence succeeded even these slight tokens of her presence   whereupon george rose and went warily into the hall  taking care to make  no noise  and he obtained an oblique view of her through the open double  doors of the  reception room   she was sitting in the chair which he had  occupied so long  and she was looking out of the window expectantly  a  little troubled     he went back to the library  waited an interminable half hour  then  returned noiselessly to the same position in the hall  where he could  see her  she was still sitting patiently by the window     waiting for that man  was she  well  it might be quite a long wait  and  the grim george silently ascended the stairs to his own room  and began  to pace his suffering floor           chapter xxv        he left his door open  however  and when he heard the front door bell  ring  by and by  he went half way down the stairs and stood to listen   he was not much afraid that morgan would return  but he wished to make  sure     mary appeared in the hall below him  but  after a glance toward the  front of the house  turned back  and withdrew  evidently isabel had gone  to the door  then a murmur was heard  and george amberson s voice  quick  and serious   i want to talk to you  isabel     and another murmur  then  isabel and her brother passed the foot of the broad  dark stairway  but  did not look up  and remained unconscious of the watchful presence above  them  isabel still carried her cloak upon her arm  but amberson had  taken her hand  and retained it  and as he led her silently into the  library there was something about her attitude  and the pose of her  slightly bent head  that was both startled and meek  thus they quickly  disappeared from george s sight  hand in hand  and amberson at once  closed the massive double doors of the library     for a time all that george could hear was the indistinct sound of his  uncle s voice  what he was saying could not be surmised  though  the troubled brotherliness of his tone was evident  he seemed to be  explaining something at considerable length  and there were moments  when he paused  and george guessed that his mother was speaking  but her  voice must have been very low  for it was entirely inaudible to him     suddenly he did hear her  through the heavy doors her outcry came  clear  and loud      oh  no      it was a cry of protest  as if something her brother told her must be  untrue  or  if it were true  the fact he stated must be undone  and it  was a sound of sheer pain     another sound of pain  close to george  followed it  this was a vehement  sniffling which broke out just above him  and  looking up  he saw fanny  minafer on the landing  leaning over the banisters and applying her  handkerchief to her eyes and nose      i can guess what that was about   she whispered huskily   he s just  told her what you did to eugene      george gave her a dark look over his shoulder   you go on back to your  room   he said  and he began to descend the stairs  but fanny  guessing  his purpose  rushed down and caught his arm  detaining him      you re not going in there    she whispered huskily   you don t        let go of me      but she clung to him savagely   no  you don t  georgie minafer  you ll  keep away from there  you will       you let go of        i won t  you come back here  you ll come upstairs and let them alone   that s what you ll do   and with such passionate determination did she  clutch and tug  never losing a grip of him somewhere  though george  tried as much as he could  without hurting her  to wrench away  with  such utter forgetfulness of her maiden dignity did she assault him  that  she forced him  stumbling upward  to the landing      of all the ridiculous    he began furiously  but she spared one hand  from its grasp of his sleeve and clapped it over his mouth      hush up   never for an instant in this grotesque struggle did fanny  raise her voice above a husky whisper   hush up  it s indecent  like  squabbling outside the door of an operating room  go on to the top of  the stairs  go on      and when george had most unwillingly obeyed  she planted herself in  his way  on the top step   there   she said   the idea of your going in  there now  i never heard of such a thing   and with the sudden departure  of the nervous vigour she had shown so amazingly  she began to cry  again   i was an awful fool  i thought you knew what was going on or  i never  never would have done it  do you suppose i dreamed you d go  making everything into such a tragedy  do you       i don t care what you dreamed   george muttered     but fanny went on  always taking care to keep her voice from getting too  loud  in spite of her most grievous agitation   do you dream i thought  you d go making such a fool of yourself at mrs  johnson s  oh  i saw her  this morning  she wouldn t talk to me  but i met george amberson on my  way back  and he told me what you d done over there  and do you dream i  thought you d do what you ve done here this afternoon to eugene  oh  i  knew that  too  i was looking out of the front bedroom window  and i saw  him drive up  and then go away again  and i knew you d been to the door   of course he went to george amberson about it  and that s why george is  here  he s got to tell isabel the whole thing now  and you wanted to go  in there interfering  god knows what  you stay here and let her brother  tell her  he s got some consideration for her       i suppose you think i haven t   george said  challenging her  and at  that fanny laughed witheringly      you  considerate of anybody       i m considerate of her good name   he said hotly   it seems to me  that s about the first thing to be considerate of  in being considerate  of a person  and look here  it strikes me you re taking a pretty  different tack from what you did yesterday afternoon      fanny wrung her hands   i did a terrible thing   she lamented   now that  it s done and too late i know what it was  i didn t have sense enough  just to let things go on  i didn t have any business to interfere  and i  didn t mean to interfere  i only wanted to talk  and let out a little  i  did think you already knew everything i told you  i did  and i d rather  have cut my hand off than stir you up to doing what you have done  i was  just suffering so that i wanted to let out a little  i didn t mean any  real harm  but now i see what s happened  oh  i was a fool  i hadn t any  business interfering  eugene never would have looked at me  anyhow  and   oh  why couldn t i have seen that before  he never came here a single  time in his life except on her account  never  and i might have let them  alone  because he wouldn t have looked at me even if he d never seen  isabel  and they haven t done any harm  she made wilbur happy  and she  was a true wife to him as long as he lived  it wasn t a crime for her to  care for eugene all the time  she certainly never told him she did  and  she gave me every chance in the world  she left us alone together every  time she could  even since wilbur died  but what was the use  and here  i go  not doing myself a bit of good by it  and just   fanny wrung her  hands again   just ruining them       i suppose you mean i m doing that   george said bitterly      yes  i do   she sobbed  and drooped upon the stairway railing   exhausted      on the contrary  i mean to save my mother from a calamity      fanny looked at him wanly  in a tired despair  then she stepped by him  and went slowly to her own door  where she paused and beckoned to him      what do you want       just come here a minute       what for   he asked impatiently      i just wanted to say something to you       well  for heaven s sake  say it  there s nobody to hear   nevertheless   after a moment  as she beckoned him again  he went to her  profoundly  annoyed   well  what is it       george   she said in a low voice   i think you ought to be told  something  if i were you  i d let my mother alone       oh  my lord   he groaned   i m doing these things for her  not against  her      a mildness had come upon fanny  and she had controlled her weeping  she  shook her head gently   no  i d let her alone if i were you  i don t  think she s very well  george       she  i never saw a healthier person in my life       no  she doesn t let anybody know  but she goes to the doctor  regularly       women are always going to doctors regularly       no  he told her to      george was not impressed   it s nothing at all  she spoke of it to me  years ago  some kind of family failing  she said grandfather had it   too  and look at him  hasn t proved very serious with him  you act as if  i d done something wrong in sending that man about his business  and as  if i were going to persecute my mother  instead of protecting her  by  jove  it s sickening  you told me how all the riffraff in town were busy  with her name  and then the minute i lift my hand to protect her  you  begin to attack me and        sh   fanny checked him  laying her hand on his arm   your uncle is  going      the library doors were heard opening  and a moment later there came the  sound of the front door closing     george moved toward the head of the stairs  then stood listening  but  the house was silent     fanny made a slight noise with her lips to attract his attention  and   when he glanced toward her  shook her head at him urgently   let her  alone   she whispered   she s down there by herself  don t go down  let  her alone      she moved a few steps toward him and halted  her face pallid and  awestruck  and then both stood listening for anything that might break  the silence downstairs  no sound came to them  that poignant silence was  continued throughout long  long minutes  while the two listeners  stood there under its mysterious spell  and in its plaintive  eloquence  speaking  as it did  of the figure alone in the big   dark library  where dead wilbur s new silver frame gleamed in the  dimness  there was something that checked even george     above the aunt and nephew  as they kept this strange vigil  there was  a triple window of stained glass  to illumine the landing and upper  reaches of the stairway  figures in blue and amber garments posed  gracefully in panels  conceived by some craftsman of the eighties to  represent love and purity and beauty  and these figures  leaded to  unalterable attitudes  were little more motionless than the two human  beings upon whom fell the mottled faint light of the window  the colours  were growing dull  evening was coming on     fanny minafer broke the long silence with a sound from her throat  a  stilled gasp  and with that great companion of hers  her handkerchief   retired softly to the loneliness of her own chamber  after she had gone  george looked about him bleakly  then on tiptoe crossed the hall and  went into his own room  which was filled with twilight  still tiptoeing   though he could not have said why  he went across the room and sat down  heavily in a chair facing the window  outside there was nothing but the  darkening air and the wall of the nearest of the new houses  he had  not slept at all  the night before  and he had eaten nothing since the  preceding day at lunch  but he felt neither drowsiness nor hunger  his  set determination filled him  kept him but too wide awake  and his gaze  at the grayness beyond the window was wide eyed and bitter     darkness had closed in when there was a step in the room behind him   then someone knelt beside the chair  two arms went round him with  infinite compassion  a gentle head rested against his shoulder  and  there came the faint scent as of apple blossoms far away      you mustn t be troubled  darling   his mother whispered           chapter xxvi      george choked  for an instant he was on the point of breaking down  but  he commanded himself  bravely dismissing the self pity roused by her  compassion   how can i help but be   he said      no  no   she soothed him   you mustn t  you mustn t be troubled  no  matter what happens       that s easy enough to say   he protested  and he moved as if to rise      just let s stay like this a little while  dear  just a minute or two   i want to tell you  brother george has been here  and he told me  everything about  about how unhappy you d been  and how you went so  gallantly to that old woman with the operaglasses   isabel gave a sad  little laugh   what a terrible old woman she is  what a really terrible  thing a vulgar old woman can be       mother  i    and again he moved to rise      must you  it seemed to me such a comfortable way to talk  well    she  yielded  he rose  helped her to her feet  and pressed the light into  being     as the room took life from the sudden lines of fire within the bulbs  isabel made a deprecatory gesture  and  with a faint laugh of apologetic  protest  turned quickly away from george  what she meant was   you  mustn t see my face until i ve made it nicer for you   then she turned  again to him  her eyes downcast  but no sign of tears in them  and she  contrived to show him that there was the semblance of a smile upon her  lips  she still wore her hat  and in her unsteady fingers she held a  white envelope  somewhat crumpled      now  mother        wait  dearest   she said  and though he stood stone cold  she lifted  her arms  put them round him again  and pressed her cheek lightly to  his   oh  you do look so troubled  poor dear  one thing you couldn t  doubt  beloved boy  you know i could never care for anything in the  world as i care for you  never  never       now  mother       she released him  and stepped back   just a moment more  dearest  i want  you to read this first  we can get at things better   she pressed into  his hand the envelope she had brought with her  and as he opened it  and  began to read the long enclosure  she walked slowly to the other end of  the room  then stood there  with her back to him  and her head drooping  a little  until he had finished     the sheets of paper were covered with eugene s handwriting     george amberson will bring you this  dear isabel  he is waiting while i  write  he and i have talked things over  and before he gives this to you  he will tell you what has happened  of course i m rather confused  and  haven t had time to think matters out very definitely  and yet i believe  i should have been better prepared for what took place to day  i ought  to have known it was coming  because i have understood for quite a long  time that young george was getting to dislike me more and more  somehow   i ve never been able to get his friendship  he s always had a latent  distrust of me  or something like distrust  and perhaps that s made me  sometimes a little awkward and diffident with him  i think it may be  he felt from the first that i cared a great deal about you  and he  naturally resented it  i think perhaps he felt this even during all the  time when i was so careful  at least i thought i was  not to show  even  to you  how immensely i did care  and he may have feared that you were  thinking too much about me  even when you weren t and only liked me as  an old friend  it s perfectly comprehensible to me  also  that at his  age one gets excited about gossip  dear isabel  what i m trying to  get at  in my confused way  is that you and i don t care about this  nonsensical gossip  ourselves  at all  yesterday i thought the time had  come when i could ask you to marry me  and you were dear enough to tell  me  sometime it might come to that   well  you and i  left to ourselves   and knowing what we have been and what we are  we d pay as much  attention to  talk  as we would to any other kind of old cats  mewing   we d not be very apt to let such things keep us from the plenty of life  we have left to us for making up to ourselves for old unhappinesses and  mistakes  but now we re faced with  not the slander and not our own  fear of it  because we haven t any  but someone else s fear of it  your  son s  and  oh  dearest woman in the world  i know what your son is to  you  and it frightens me  let me explain a little  i don t think he ll  change  at twenty one or twenty two so many things appear solid and  permanent and terrible which forty sees are nothing but disappearing  miasma  forty can t tell twenty about this  that s the pity of it   twenty can find out only by getting to be forty  and so we come to this   dear  will you live your own life your way  or george s way  i m going  a little further  because it would be fatal not to be wholly frank  now  george will act toward you only as your long worship of him  your  sacrifices  all the unseen little ones every day since he was born  will  make him act  dear  it breaks my heart for you  but what you have to  oppose now is the history of your own selfless and perfect motherhood  i  remember saying once that what you worshipped in your son was the angel  you saw in him  and i still believe that is true of every mother  but in  a mother s worship she may not see that the will in her son should not  always be offered incense along with the angel  i grow sick with fear  for you  for both you and me  when i think how the will against us two  has grown strong through the love you have given the angel  and how  long your own sweet will has served that other  are you strong enough   isabel  can you make the fight  i promise you that if you will take  heart for it  you will find so quickly that it has all amounted  to nothing  you shall have happiness  and  in a little while  only  happiness  you need only to write me a line  i can t come to your  house  and tell me where you will meet me  we will come back in a month   and the angel in your son will bring him to you  i promise it  what  is good in him will grow so fine  once you have beaten the turbulent  will  but it must be beaten     your brother  that good friend  is waiting with such patience  i should  not keep him longer  and i am saying too much for wisdom  i fear  but   oh  my dear  won t you be strong  such a little short strength it would  need  don t strike my life down twice  dear  this time i ve not deserved  it                                   eugene     concluding this missive  george tossed it abruptly from him so that one  sheet fell upon his bed and the others upon the floor  and at the faint  noise of their falling isabel came  and  kneeling  began to gather them  up      did you read it  dear      george s face was pale no longer  but pink with fury   yes  i did       all of it   she asked gently  as she rose      certainly      she did not look at him  but kept her eyes downcast upon the letter in  her hands  tremulously rearranging the sheets in order as she spoke  and  though she smiled  her smile was as tremulous as her hands  nervousness  and an irresistible timidity possessed her   i  i wanted to say   george   she faltered   i felt that if  if some day it should happen  i  mean  if you came to feel differently about it  and eugene and i  that  is if we found that it seemed the most sensible thing to do  i was  afraid you might think it would be a little queer about  lucy  i mean  if  if she were your step sister  of course  she d not be even legally  related to you  and if you  if you cared for her       thus far she got stumblingly with what she wanted to say  while george  watched her with a gaze that grew harder and hotter  but here he cut her  off   i have already given up all idea of lucy   he said   naturally   i couldn t have treated her father as i deliberately did treat him  i  could hardly have done that and expected his daughter ever to speak to  me again      isabel gave a quick cry of compassion  but he allowed her no opportunity  to speak   you needn t think i m making any particular sacrifice   he  said sharply   though i would  quickly enough  if i thought it necessary  in a matter of honour like this  i was interested in her  and i could  even say i did care for her  but she proved pretty satisfactorily that  she cared little enough about me  she went away right in the midst of  a  of a difference of opinion we were having  she didn t even let me  know she was going  and never wrote a line to me  and then came back  telling everybody she d had  a perfectly gorgeous time   that s quite  enough for me  i m not precisely the sort to arrange for that kind of  thing to be done to me more than once  the truth is  we re not congenial  and we d found that much out  at least  before she left  we should  never have been happy  she was  superior  all the time  and critical of  me  not very pleasant  that  i was disappointed in her  and i might as  well say it  i don t think she has the very deepest nature in the world   and       but isabel put her hand timidly on his arm   georgie  dear  this is only  a quarrel  all young people have them before they get adjusted  and you  mustn t let        if you please   he said emphatically  moving back from her   this isn t  that kind  it s all over  and i don t care to speak of it again  it s  settled  don t you understand       but  dear        no  i want to talk to you about this letter of her father s       yes  dear  that s why        it s simply the most offensive piece of writing that i ve ever held in  my hands      she stepped back from him  startled   but  dear  i thought        i can t understand your even showing me such a thing   he cried   how  did you happen to bring it to me       your uncle thought i d better  he thought it was the simplest thing to  do  and he said that he d suggested it to eugene  and eugene had agreed   they thought        yes   george said bitterly   i should like to hear what they thought       they thought it would be the most straightforward thing      george drew a long breath   well  what do you think  mother       i thought it would be the simplest and most straightforward thing  i  thought they were right       very well  we ll agree it was simple and straightforward  now  what do  you think of that letter itself      she hesitated  looking away   i  of course i don t agree with him in the  way he speaks of you  dear  except about the angel  i don t agree with  some of the things he implies  you ve always been unselfish  nobody  knows that better than your mother  when fanny was left with nothing   you were so quick and generous to give up what really should have come  to you  and        and yet   george broke in   you see what he implies about me  don t you  think  really  that this was a pretty insulting letter for that man to  be asking you to hand your son       oh  no   she cried   you can see how fair he means to be  and he didn t  ask for me to give it to you  it was brother george who        never mind that  now  you say he tries to be fair  and yet do you  suppose it ever occurs to him that i m doing my simple duty  that i m  doing what my father would do if he were alive  that i m doing what my  father would ask me to do if he could speak from his grave out yonder   do you suppose it ever occurs to that man for one minute that i m  protecting my mother   george raised his voice  advancing upon the  helpless lady fiercely  and she could only bend her head before him   he  talks about my  will   how it must be beaten down  yes  and he asks my  mother to do that little thing to please him  what for  why does he want  me  beaten  by my mother  because i m trying to protect her name  he s  got my mother s name bandied up and down the streets of this town till i  can t step in those streets without wondering what every soul i meet is  thinking of me and of my family  and now he wants you to marry him so  that every gossip in town will say  there  what did i tell you  i guess  that proves it s true   you can t get away from it  that s exactly what  they d say  and this man pretends he cares for you  and yet asks you to  marry him and give them the right to say it  he says he and you don t  care what they say  but i know better  he may not care  probably he s  that kind  but you do  there never was an amberson yet that would let  the amberson name go trailing in the dust like that  it s the proudest  name in this town and it s going to stay the proudest  and i tell you  that s the deepest thing in my nature  not that i d expect eugene morgan  to understand  the very deepest thing in my nature is to protect that  name  and to fight for it to the last breath when danger threatens it   as it does now  through my mother   he turned from her  striding up  and down and tossing his arms about  in a tumult of gesture   i can t  believe it of you  that you d think of such a sacrilege  that s what it  would be  sacrilege  when he talks about your unselfishness toward me   he s right  you have been unselfish and you have been a perfect mother   but what about him  is it unselfish of him to want you to throw away  your good name just to please him  that s all he asks of you  and to  quit being my mother  do you think i can believe you really care for  him  i don t  you are my mother and you re an amberson  and i believe  you re too proud  you re too proud to care for a man who could write  such a letter as that   he stopped  faced her  and spoke with more  self control   well  what are you going to do about it  mother      george was right about his mother s being proud  and even when she  laughed with a negro gardener  or even those few times in her life  when people saw her weep  isabel had a proud look  something that was  independent and graceful and strong  but she did not have it now  she  leaned against the wall  beside his dressing table  and seemed beset  with humility and with weakness  her head drooped      what answer are you going to make to such a letter   george demanded   like a judge on the bench      i  i don t quite know  dear   she murmured      wait   she begged him   i m so  confused       i want to know what you re going to write him  do you think if you  did what he wants you to i could bear to stay another day in this town   mother  do you think i could ever bear even to see you again if you  married him  i d want to  but you surely know i just  couldn t      she made a futile gesture  and seemed to breathe with difficulty   i  i  wasn t  quite sure   she faltered   about  about it s being wise for us  to be married  even before knowing how you feel about it  i wasn t even  sure it was quite fair to  to eugene  i have  i seem to have that family  trouble  like father s  that i spoke to you about once   she managed a  deprecatory little dry laugh   not that it amounts to much  but i wasn t  at all sure that it would be fair to him  marrying doesn t mean so much   after all  not at my age  it s enough to know that  that people think  of you  and to see them  i thought we were all  oh  pretty happy the way  things were  and i don t think it would mean giving up a great deal  for him or me  either  if we just went on as we have been  i  i see him  almost every day  and        mother   george s voice was loud and stern   do you think you could go  on seeing him after this      she had been talking helplessly enough before  her tone was little more  broken now   not  not even  see him       how could you   george cried   mother  it seems to me that if he ever  set foot in this house again  oh  i can t speak of it  could you see  him  knowing what talk it makes every time he turns into this street   and knowing what that means to me  oh  i don t understand all this  i  don t  if you d told me  a year ago  that such things were going to  happen  i d have thought you were insane  and now i believe i am      then  after a preliminary gesture of despair  as though he meant harm to  the ceiling  he flung himself heavily  face downward  upon the bed  his  anguish was none the less real for its vehemence  and the stricken lady  came to him instantly and bent over him  once more enfolding him in her  arms  she said nothing  but suddenly her tears fell upon his head  she  saw them  and seemed to be startled      oh  this won t do   she said   i ve never let you see me cry before   except when your father died  i mustn t      and she ran from the room        a little while after she had gone  george rose and began solemnly to  dress for dinner  at one stage of these conscientious proceedings he put  on  temporarily  his long black velvet dressing gown  and  happening  to catch sight in his pier glass of the picturesque and medieval  figure thus presented  he paused to regard it  and something profoundly  theatrical in his nature came to the surface     his lips moved  he whispered  half aloud  some famous fragments      tis not alone my inky cloak  good mother  nor customary suits of solemn  black        for  in truth  the mirrored princely image  with hair dishevelled on the  white brow  and the long tragic fall of black velvet from the shoulders   had brought about  in his thought at least  some comparisons of his own  times  so out of joint  with those of that other gentle prince and heir  whose widowed mother was minded to marry again      but i have that within which passeth show  these but the trappings and  the suits of woe      not less like hamlet did he feel and look as he sat gauntly at the  dinner table with fanny to partake of a meal throughout which neither  spoke  isabel had sent word  not to wait  for her  an injunction it was  as well they obeyed  for she did not come at all  but with the renewal  of sustenance furnished to his system  some relaxation must have  occurred within the high strung george  dinner was not quite finished  when  without warning  sleep hit him hard  his burning eyes could no  longer restrain the lids above them  his head sagged beyond control  and  he got to his feet  and went lurching upstairs  yawning with exhaustion   from the door of his room  which he closed mechanically  with his eyes  shut  he went blindly to his bed  fell upon it soddenly  and slept  with  his face full upturned to the light     it was after midnight when he woke  and the room was dark  he had not  dreamed  but he woke with the sense that somebody or something had been  with him while he slept  somebody or something infinitely compassionate   somebody or something infinitely protective  that would let him come to  no harm and to no grief     he got up  and pressed the light on  pinned to the cover of his  dressing table was a square envelope  with the words   for you  dear    written in pencil upon it  but the message inside was in ink  a little  smudged here and there     i have been out to the mail box  darling  with a letter i ve written to  eugene  and he ll have it in the morning  it would be unfair not to let  him know at once  and my decision could not change if i waited  it would  always be the same  i think it  is a little better for me to write to  you  like this  instead of waiting till you wake up and then telling  you  because i m foolish and might cry again  and i took a vow once   long ago  that you should never see me cry  not that i ll feel like  crying when we talk things over tomorrow  i ll be  all right and fine    as you say so often  by that time  don t fear  i think what makes me  most ready to cry now is the thought of the terrible suffering in your  poor face  and the unhappy knowledge that it is i  your mother who put  it there  it shall never come again  i love you better than anything  and everything else on earth  god gave you to me  and oh  how thankful  i have been every day of my life for that sacred gift  and nothing can  ever come between me and god s gift  i cannot hurt you  and i cannot let  you stay hurt as you have been  not another instant after you wake up   my darling boy  it is beyond my power  and eugene was right  i know you  couldn t change about this  your suffering shows how deep seated the  feeling is within you  so i ve written him just about what i think you  would like me to  though i told him i would always be fond of him and  always his best friend  and i hoped his dearest friend  he ll understand  about not seeing him  he ll understand that  though i didn t say it  in so many words  you mustn t trouble about that  he ll understand   good night  my darling  my beloved  my beloved  you mustn t be troubled   i think i shouldn t mind anything very much so long as i have you  all  to myself   as people say  to make up for your long years away from me  at college  we ll talk of what s best to do in the morning  shan t we   and for all this pain you ll forgive your loving and devoted mother     isabel           chapter xxvii      having finished some errands downtown  the next afternoon  george  amberson minafer was walking up national avenue on his homeward way when  he saw in the distance  coming toward him  upon the same side of the  street  the figure of a young lady  a figure just under the middle  height  comely indeed  and to be mistaken for none other in the  world  even at two hundred yards  to his sharp discomfiture his heart  immediately forced upon him the consciousness of its acceleration  a  sudden warmth about his neck made him aware that he had turned red   and then  departing  left him pale  for a panicky moment he thought of  facing about in actual flight  he had little doubt that lucy would  meet him with no token of recognition  and all at once this probability  struck him as unendurable  and if she did not speak  was it the proper  part of chivalry to lift his hat and take the cut bareheaded  or should  the finer gentleman acquiesce in the lady s desire for no further  acquaintance  and pass her with stony mien and eyes constrained forward   george was a young man badly flustered     but the girl approaching him was unaware of his trepidation  being  perhaps somewhat preoccupied with her own  she saw only that he was  pale  and that his eyes were darkly circled  but here he was advantaged  with her  for the finest touch to his good looks was given by this  toning down  neither pallor nor dark circles detracting from them  but  rather adding to them a melancholy favour of distinction  george had  retained his mourning  a tribute completed down to the final details of  black gloves and a polished ebony cane  which he would have been pained  to name otherwise than as a  walking stick   and in the aura of this  sombre elegance his straight figure and drawn face were not without a  tristful and appealing dignity     in everything outward he was cause enough for a girl s cheek to flush   her heart to beat faster  and her eyes to warm with the soft light that  came into lucy s now  whether she would or no  if his spirit had been  what his looks proclaimed it  she would have rejoiced to let the light  glow forth which now shone in spite of her  for a long time  thinking of  that spirit of his  and what she felt it should be  she had a persistent  sense   it must be there   but she had determined to believe this folly  no longer  nevertheless  when she met him at the sharons   she had been  far less calm than she seemed     people speaking casually of lucy were apt to define her as  a little  beauty   a definition short of the mark  she was  a little beauty   but  an independent  masterful  sell reliant little american  of whom her  father s earlier gipsyings and her own sturdiness had made a woman ever  since she was fifteen  but though she was the mistress of her own ways  and no slave to any lamp save that of her own conscience  she had a  weakness  she had fallen in love with george amberson minafer at first  sight  and no matter how she disciplined herself  she had never been  able to climb out  the thing had happened to her  that was all  george  had looked just the way she had always wanted someone to look  the  riskiest of all the moonshine ambushes wherein tricky romance snares  credulous young love  but what was fatal to lucy was that this thing  having happened to her  she could not change it  no matter what she  discovered in george s nature she was unable to take away what she had  given him  and though she could think differently about him  she could  not feel differently about him  for she was one of those too faithful  victims of glamour  when she managed to keep the picture of george away  from her mind s eye  she did well enough  but when she let him become  visible  she could not choose but love what she disdained  she was a  little angel who had fallen in love with high handed lucifer  quite an  experience  and not apt to be soon succeeded by any falling in love with  a tamer party  and the unhappy truth was that george did make better men  seem tame  but though she was a victim  she was a heroic one  anything  but helpless     as they drew nearer  george tried to prepare himself to meet her with  some remnants of aplomb  he decided that he would keep on looking  straight ahead  and lift his hand toward his hat at the very last moment  when it would be possible for her to see him out of the corner of her  eye  then when she thought it over later  she would not be sure whether  he had saluted her or merely rubbed his forehead  and there was the  added benefit that any third person who might chance to look from  a window  or from a passing carriage  would not think that he was  receiving a snub  because he did not intend to lift his hat  but  timing  the gesture properly  would in fact actually rub his forehead  these  were the hasty plans which occupied his thoughts until he was within  about fifty feet of her  when he ceased to have either plans or  thoughts  he had kept his eyes from looking full at her until then  and  as he saw her  thus close at hand  and coming nearer  a regret that was  dumfounding took possession of him  for the first time he had the sense  of having lost something of overwhelming importance     lucy did not keep to the right  but came straight to meet him  smiling   and with her hand offered to him      why  you    he stammered  as he took it   haven t you    what he meant  to say was   haven t you heard       haven t i what   she asked  and he saw that eugene had not yet told  her      nothing   he gasped   may i  may i turn and walk with you a little  way       yes  indeed   she said cordially     he would not have altered what had been done  he was satisfied with all  that  satisfied that it was right  and that his own course was right   but he began to perceive a striking inaccuracy in some remarks he had  made to his mother  now when he had put matters in such shape that even  by the relinquishment of his  ideals of life  he could not have lucy   knew that he could never have her  and knew that when eugene told  her the history of yesterday he could not have a glance or word even  friendly from her  now when he must in good truth  give up all idea  of lucy   he was amazed that he could have used such words as  no  particular sacrifice   and believed them when he said them  she had  looked never in his life so bewitchingly pretty as she did today  and as  he walked beside her he was sure that she was the most exquisite thing  in the world      lucy   he said huskily   i want to tell you something  something that  matters       i hope it s a lively something then   she said  and laughed   papa s  been so glum to day he s scarcely spoken to me  your uncle george  amberson came to see him an hour ago and they shut themselves up in the  library  and your uncle looked as glum as papa  i d be glad if you ll  tell me a funny story  george       well  it may seem one to you   he said bitterly   just to begin with   when you went away you didn t let me know  not even a word  not a  line       her manner persisted in being inconsequent   why  no   she said   i just  trotted off for some visits       well  at least you might have        why  no   she said again briskly   don t you remember  george  we d had  a grand quarrel  and didn t speak to each other all the way home from a  long  long drive  so  as we couldn t play together like good children   of course it was plain that we oughtn t to play at all       play   he cried      yes  what i mean is that we d come to the point where it was time to  quit playing  well  what we were playing       at being lovers  you mean  don t you       something like that   she said lightly   for us two  playing at being  lovers was just the same as playing at cross purposes  i had all the  purposes  and that gave you all the crossness  things weren t getting  along at all  it was absurd       well  have it your own way   he said   it needn t have been absurd       no  it couldn t help but be   she informed him cheerfully   the way i  am and the way you are  it couldn t ever be anything else  so what was  the use       i don t know   he sighed  and his sigh was abysmal   but what i wanted  to tell you is this  when you went away  you didn t let me know and  didn t care how or when i heard it  but i m not like that with you  this  time  i m going away  that s what i wanted to tell you  i m going away  tomorrow night  indefinitely      she nodded sunnily   that s nice for you  i hope you ll have ever so  jolly a time  george       i don t expect to have a particularly jolly time       well  then   she laughed   if i were you i don t think i d go      it seemed impossible to impress this distracting creature  to make her  serious   lucy   he said desperately   this is our last walk together       evidently   she said   if you re going away tomorrow night       lucy  this may be the last time i ll see you  ever  ever in my life      at that she looked at him quickly  across her shoulder  but she smiled  as brightly as before  and with the same cordial inconsequence   oh  i  can hardly think that   she said   and of course i d be awfully sorry to  think it  you re not moving away  are you  to live       no       and even if you were  of course you d be coming back to visit your  relatives every now and then       i don t know when i m coming back  mother and i are starting to morrow  night for a trip around the world      at this she did look thoughtful   your mother is going with you       good heavens   he groaned   lucy  doesn t it make any difference to you  that i am going      at this her cordial smile instantly appeared again   yes  of course    she said   i m sure i ll miss you ever so much  are you to be gone  long      he stared at her wanly   i told you indefinitely   he said   we ve made  no plans  at all  for coming back       that does sound like a long trip   she exclaimed admiringly   do you  plan to be travelling all the time  or will you stay in some one place  the greater part of it  i think it would be lovely to        lucy      he halted  and she stopped with him  they had come to a corner at the  edge of the  business section  of the city  and people were everywhere  about them  brushing against them  sometimes  in passing      i can t stand this   george said  in a low voice   i m just about ready  to go in this drug store here  and ask the clerk for something to keep  me from dying in my tracks  it s quite a shock  you see  lucy       what is       to find out certainly  at last  how deeply you ve cared for me  to see  how much difference this makes to you  by jove  i have mattered to you      her cordial smile was tempered now with good nature   george   she  laughed indulgently   surely you don t want me to do pathos on a  downtown corner       you wouldn t  do pathos  anywhere       well  don t you think pathos is generally rather fooling       i can t stand this any longer   he said   i can t  good bye  lucy   he  took her hand   it s good bye  i think it s good bye for good  lucy       good bye  i do hope you ll have the most splendid trip   she gave his  hand a cordial little grip  then released it lightly   give my love to  your mother  good bye      he turned heavily away  and a moment later glanced back over his  shoulder  she had not gone on  but stood watching him  that same casual   cordial smile on her face to the very last  and now  as he looked back   she emphasized her friendly unconcern by waving her small hand to him  cheerily  though perhaps with the slightest hint of preoccupation  as if  she had begun to think of the errand that brought her downtown     in his mind  george had already explained her to his own poignant  dissatisfaction  some blond pup  probably  whom she had met during that   perfectly gorgeous time   and he strode savagely onward  not looking  back again     but lucy remained where she was until he was out of sight  then she went  slowly into the drugstore which had struck george as a possible source  of stimulant for himself      please let me have a few drops of aromatic spirits of ammonia in a  glass of water   she said  with the utmost composure      yes  ma am   said the impressionable clerk  who had been looking at her  through the display window as she stood on the corner     but a moment later  as he turned from the shelves of glass jars against  the wall  with the potion she had asked for in his hand  he uttered an  exclamation   for goshes  sake  miss   and  describing this adventure to  his fellow boarders  that evening   sagged pretty near to the counter   she was   he said   if i hadn t been a bright  quick  ready for anything  young fella she d  a  flummixed plum  i was watchin  her out the  window  talkin  to some young s iety fella  and she was all right  then  she was all right when she come in the store  too  yes  sir  the  prettiest girl that ever walked in our place and took one good look at  me  i reckon it must be the truth what some you town wags say about my  face            chapter xxviii      at that hour the heroine of the susceptible clerk s romance was engaged  in brightening the rosy little coal fire under the white mantelpiece  in her pretty white and blue boudoir  four photographs all framed  in decorous plain silver went to the anthracite s fierce  destruction  frames and all  and three packets of letters and notes in  a charming florentine treasure box of painted wood  nor was the box  any  more than the silver frames  spared this rousing finish  thrown heartily  upon live coal  the fine wood sparkled forth in stars  then burst into  an alarming blaze which scorched the white mantelpiece  but lucy stood  and looked on without moving     it was not eugene who told her what had happened at isabel s door   when she got home  she found fanny minafer waiting for her  a secret  excursion of fanny s for the purpose  presumably  of  letting out   again  because that was what she did  she told lucy everything  except  her own lamentable part in the production of the recent miseries  and  concluded with a tribute to george   the worst of it is  he thinks he s  been such a hero  and isabel does  too  and that makes him more than  twice as awful  it s been the same all his life  everything he did was  noble and perfect  he had a domineering nature to begin with  and she  let it go on  and fostered it till it absolutely ruled her  i never saw  a plainer case of a person s fault making them pay for having it  she  goes about  overseeing the packing and praising george and pretending  to be perfectly cheerful about what he s making her do and about the  dreadful things he s done  she pretends he did such a fine thing  so  manly and protective  going to mrs  johnson  and so heroic  doing what  his  principles  made him  even though he knew what it would cost him  with you  and all the while it s almost killing her  what he said to  your father  she s always been lofty enough  so to speak  and had the  greatest idea of the ambersons being superior to the rest of the world   and all that  but rudeness  or anything like a  scene   or any bad  manners  they always just made her sick  but she could never see what  george s manners were  oh  it s been a terrible adulation     it s going  to be a task for me  living in that big house  all alone  you must come  and see me  i mean after they ve gone  of course  i ll go crazy if i  don t see something of people  i m sure you ll come as often as you can   i know you too well to think you ll be sensitive about coming there  or  being reminded of george  thank heaven you re too well balanced   miss  fanny concluded  with a profound fervour   you re too well balanced to  let anything affect you deeply about that  that monkey      the four photographs and the painted florentine box went to their  cremation within the same hour that miss fanny spoke  and a little later  lucy called her father in  as he passed her door  and pointed to the  blackened area on the underside of the mantelpiece  and to the burnt  heap upon the coal  where some metallic shapes still retained outline   she flung her arms about his neck in passionate sympathy  telling  him that she knew what had happened to him  and presently he began to  comfort her and managed an embarrassed laugh      well  well    he said   i was too old for such foolishness to be  getting into my head  anyhow       no  no   she sobbed   and if you knew how i despise myself for  for  ever having thought one instant about  oh  miss fanny called him the  right name  that monkey  he is       there  i think i agree with you   eugene said grimly  and in his eyes  there was a steady light of anger that was to last   yes  i think i  agree with you about that       there s only one thing to do with such a person   she said vehemently    that s to put him out of our thoughts forever  forever      and yet  the next day  at six o clock  which was the hour  fanny had  told her  when george and his mother were to leave upon their long  journey  lucy touched that scorched place on her mantel with her  hand just as the little clock above it struck  then  after this  odd  unconscious gesture  she went to a window and stood between the  curtains  looking out into the cold november dusk  and in spite of every  reasoning and reasonable power within her  a pain of loneliness struck  through her heart  the dim street below her window  the dark houses  across the way  the vague air itself  all looked empty  and cold and   most of all  uninteresting  something more sombre than november dusk  took the colour from them and gave them that air of desertion     the light of her fire  flickering up behind her showed suddenly a flying  group of tiny snowflakes nearing the window pane  and for an instant she  felt the sensation of being dragged through a snows drift under a  broken cutter  with a boy s arms about her  an arrogant  handsome   too conquering boy  who nevertheless did his best to get hurt himself   keeping her from any possible harm     she shook the picture out of her eyes indignantly  then came and sat  before her fire  and looked long and long at the blackened mantelpiece   she did not have the mantelpiece repainted  and  since she did not   might as well have kept his photographs  one forgets what made the scar  upon his hand but not what made the scar upon his wall     she played no marche funebre upon her piano  even though chopin s  romantic lamentation was then at the top of nine tenths of the  music racks in the country  american youth having recently discovered  the distinguished congeniality between itself and this deathless bit of  deathly gloom  she did not even play  robin adair   she played  bedelia   and all the new cake walks  for she was her father s housekeeper   and rightly looked upon the office as being the same as that of his  heart keeper  therefore it was her affair to keep both house and heart  in what state of cheerfulness might be contrived  she made him  go out   more than ever  made him take her to all the gayeties of that winter   declining to go herself unless he took her  and  though eugene danced  no more  and quoted shakespeare to prove all lightfoot caperings beneath  the dignity of his age  she broke his resolution for him at the new  year s eve  assembly  and half coaxed  half dragged him forth upon the  floor  and made him dance the new year in with her     new faces appeared at the dances of the winter  new faces had  been appearing everywhere  for that matter  and familiar ones were  disappearing  merged in the increasing crowd  or gone forever and missed  a little and not long  for the town was growing and changing as it never  had grown and changed before     it was heaving up in the middle incredibly  it was spreading incredibly   and as it heaved and spread  it befouled itself and darkened its sky   its boundary was mere shapelessness on the run  a raw  new house would  appear on a country road  four or five others would presently be built  at intervals between it and the outskirts of the town  the country road  would turn into an asphalt street with a brick faced drugstore and a  frame grocery at a corner  then bungalows and six room cottages would  swiftly speckle the open green spaces  and a farm had become a suburb  which would immediately shoot out other suburbs into the country  on  one side  and  on the other  join itself solidly to the city  you drove  between pleasant fields and woodland groves one spring day  and in the  autumn  passing over the same ground  you were warned off the tracks by  an interurban trolley car s gonging  and beheld  beyond cement sidewalks  just dry  new house owners busy  moving in   gasoline and electricity  were performing the miracles eugene had predicted     but the great change was in the citizenry itself  what was left of  the patriotic old stock generation that had fought the civil war  and  subsequently controlled politics  had become venerable and was little  heeded  the descendants of the pioneers and early settlers were merging  into the new crowd  becoming part of it  little to be distinguished from  it  what happened to boston and to broadway happened in degree to the  midland city  the old stock became less and less typical  and of the  grown people who called the place home  less than a third had been born  in it  there was a german quarter  there was a jewish quarter  there was  a negro quarter  square miles of it  called  bucktown   there were many  irish neighbourhoods  and there were large settlements of italians   and of hungarians  and of rumanians  and of serbians and other balkan  peoples  but not the emigrants  themselves  were the almost dominant  type on the streets downtown  that type was the emigrant s prosperous  offspring  descendant of the emigrations of the seventies and eighties  and nineties  those great folk journeyings in search not so directly  of freedom and democracy as of more money for the same labour  a new  midlander  in fact  a new american  was beginning dimly to emerge     a new spirit of citizenship had already sharply defined itself  it was  idealistic  and its ideals were expressed in the new kind of young men  in business downtown  they were optimists  optimists to the point of  belligerence  their motto being  boost  don t knock   and they were  hustlers  believing in hustling and in honesty because both paid  they  loved their city and worked for it with a plutonic energy which was  always ardently vocal  they were viciously governed  but they sometimes  went so far to struggle for better government on account of the helpful  effect of good government on the price of real estate and  betterment   generally  the politicians could not go too far with them  and knew  it  the idealists planned and strove and shouted that their city should  become a better  better  and better city  and what they meant  when they  used the word  better   was  more prosperous   and the core of their  idealism was this   the more prosperous my beloved city  the more  prosperous beloved i   they had one supreme theory  that the perfect  beauty and happiness of cities and of human life was to be brought about  by more factories  they had a mania for factories  there was nothing  they would not do to cajole a factory away from another city  and they  were never more piteously embittered than when another city cajoled one  away from them     what they meant by prosperity was credit at the bank  but in exchange  for this credit they got nothing that was not dirty  and  therefore   to a sane mind  valueless  since whatever was cleaned was dirty again  before the cleaning was half done  for  as the town grew  it grew  dirty with an incredible completeness  the idealists put up magnificent  business buildings and boasted of them  but the buildings were begrimed  before they were finished  they boasted of their libraries  of their  monuments and statues  and poured soot on them  they boasted of their  schools  but the schools were dirty  like the children within them  this  was not the fault of the children or their mothers  it was the fault of  the idealists  who said   the more dirt  the more prosperity   they  drew patriotic  optimistic breaths of the flying powdered filth of  the streets  and took the foul and heavy smoke with gusto into the  profundities of their lungs   boost  don t knock   they said  and  every year or so they boomed a great clean up week  when everybody was  supposed to get rid of the tin cans in his backyard     they were happiest when the tearing down and building up were most  riotous  and when new factory districts were thundering into life  in  truth  the city came to be like the body of a great dirty man  skinned   to show his busy works  yet wearing a few barbaric ornaments  and such  a figure carved  coloured  and discoloured  and set up in the  market place  would have done well enough as the god of the new people   such a god they had indeed made in their own image  as all peoples make  the god they truly serve  though of course certain of the idealists  went to church on sunday  and there knelt to another  considered to  be impractical in business  but while the growing went on  this god  of their market place was their true god  their familiar and  spirit control  they did not know that they were his helplessly obedient  slaves  nor could they ever hope to realize their serfdom  as the first  step toward becoming free men  until they should make the strange and  hard discovery that matter should serve man s spirit      prosperity  meant good credit at the bank  black lungs  and housewives   purgatory  the women fought the dirt all they could  but if they let the  air into their houses they let in the dirt  it shortened their lives   and kept them from the happiness of ever seeing anything white  and  thus  as the city grew  the time came when lucy  after a hard struggle   had to give up her blue and white curtains and her white walls  indoors   she put everything into dull gray and brown  and outside had the little  house painted the dark green nearest to black  then she knew  of course   that everything was as dirty as ever  but was a little less distressed  because it no longer looked so dirty as it was     these were bad times for amberson addition  this quarter  already old   lay within a mile of the centre of the town  but business moved in other  directions  and the addition s share of prosperity was only the smoke  and dirt  with the bank credit left out  the owners of the original  big houses sold them  or rented them to boarding house keepers  and the  tenants of the multitude of small houses moved  farther out   where the  smoke was thinner  or into apartment houses  which were built by dozens  now  cheaper tenants took their places  and the rents were lower and  lower  and the houses shabbier and shabbier  for all these shabby  houses  burning soft coal  did their best to help in the destruction of  their own value  they helped to make the quarter so dingy and the air so  foul to breathe that no one would live there who had money enough to get   farther out  where there were glimpses of ungrayed sky and breaths of  cleaner winds  and with the coming of the new speed   farther out  was  now as close to business as the addition had been in the days of its  prosperity  distances had ceased to matter     the five new houses  built so closely where had been the fine lawn of  the amberson mansion  did not look new  when they were a year old they  looked as old as they would ever look  and two of them were vacant   having never been rented  for the major s mistake about apartment houses  had been a disastrous one   he guessed wrong   george amberson said     he guessed wrong at just the wrong time  housekeeping in a house is  harder than in an apartment  and where the smoke and dirt are as thick  as they are in the addition  women can t stand it  people were crazy for  apartments  too bad he couldn t have seen it in time  poor man  he  digs away at his ledgers by his old gas drop light lamp almost every  night  he still refuses to let the mansion be torn up for wiring  you  know  but he had one painful satisfaction this spring  he got his taxes  lowered      amberson laughed ruefully  and fanny minafer asked how the major could  have managed such an economy  they were sitting upon the veranda at  isabel s one evening during the third summer of the absence of their  nephew and his mother  and the conversation had turned toward amberson  finances      i said it was a  painful satisfaction   fanny   he explained   the  property has gone down in value  and they assessed it lower than they  did fifteen years ago       but farther out        oh  yes   farther out   prices are magnificent  farther out   and  farther in  too  we just happen to be the wrong spot  that s all  not  that i don t think something could be done if father would let me have  a hand  but he won t  he can t  i suppose i ought to say  he s  always  done his own figuring   he says  and it s his lifelong habit to keep his  affairs  and even his books  to himself  and just hand us out the money   heaven knows he s done enough of that      he sighed  and both were silent  looking out at the long flares of the  constantly passing automobile headlights  shifting in vast geometric  demonstrations against the darkness  now and then a bicycle wound its  nervous way among these portents  or  at long intervals  a surrey or  buggy plodded forlornly by      there seem to be so many ways of making money nowadays   fanny said  thoughtfully   every day i hear of a new fortune some person has got  hold of  one way or another  nearly always it s somebody you never heard  of  it doesn t seem all to be in just making motor cars  i hear there s  a great deal in manufacturing these things that motor cars use  new  inventions particularly  i met dear old frank bronson the other day  and  he told me        oh  yes  even dear old frank s got the fever   amberson laughed   he s  as wild as any of them  he told me about this invention he s gone into   too   millions in it   some new electric headlight better than anything  yet   every car in america can t help but have  em   and all that  he s  putting half he s laid by into it  and the fact is  he almost talked me  into getting father to  finance me  enough for me to go into it  poor  father  he s financed me before  i suppose he would again if i had the  heart to ask him  and this seems to be a good thing  though probably  old frank is a little too sanguine  at any rate  i ve been thinking it  over       so have i   fanny admitted   he seemed to be certain it would pay  twenty five per cent  the first year  and enormously more after that   and i m only getting four on my little principal  people are making such  enormous fortunes out of everything to do with motor cars  it does seem  as if    she paused   well  i told him i d think it over seriously       we may turn out to be partners and millionaires then   amberson  laughed   i thought i d ask eugene s advice       i wish you would   said fanny   he probably knows exactly how much  profit there would be in this      eugene s advice was to  go slow   he thought electric lights for  automobiles were  coming  someday but probably not until certain  difficulties could be overcome   altogether  he was discouraging  but  by this time his two friends  had the fever  as thoroughly as old frank  bronson himself had it  for they had been with bronson to see the light  working beautifully in a machine shop  they were already enthusiastic   and after asking eugene s opinion they argued with him  telling him how  they had seen with their own eyes that the difficulties he mentioned had  been overcome   perfectly   fanny cried   and if it worked in the shop  it s bound to work any place else  isn t it      he would not agree that it was  bound to   yet  being pressed  was  driven to admit that  it might   and  retiring from what was developing  into an oratorical contest  repeated a warning about not  putting too  much into it      george amberson also laid stress on this caution later  though the major  had  financed him  again  and he was  going in    you must be careful  to leave yourself a  margin of safety   fanny   he said   i m confident  that is a pretty conservative investment of its kind  and all the  chances are with us  but you must be careful to leave yourself enough to  fall back on  in case anything should go wrong      fanny deceived him  in the impossible event of  anything going wrong   she would have enough left to  live on   she declared  and laughed  excitedly  for she was having the best time that had come to her since  wilbur s death  like so many women for whom money has always been  provided without their understanding how  she was prepared to be a  thorough and irresponsible plunger     amberson  in his wearier way  shared her excitement  and in the winter   when the exploiting company had been formed  and he brought fanny  her  importantly engraved shares of stock  he reverted to his prediction of  possibilities  made when they first spoke of the new light      we seem to be partners  all right   he laughed   now let s go ahead and  be millionaires before isabel and young george come home       when they come home   she echoed sorrowfully  and it was a phrase which  found an evasive echo in isabel s letters  in these letters isabel was  always planning pleasant things that she and fanny and the major and  george and  brother george  would do  when she and her son came home    they ll find things pretty changed  i m afraid   fanny said   if they  ever do come home      amberson went over  the next summer  and joined his sister and nephew in  paris  where they were living   isabel does want to come home   he told  fanny gravely  on the day of his return  in october   she s wanted  to for a long while  and she ought to come while she can stand the  journey    and he amplified this statement  leaving fanny looking  startled and solemn when lucy came by to drive him out to dinner at the  new house eugene had just completed     this was no white and blue cottage  but a great georgian picture in  brick  five miles north of amberson addition  with four acres of its  own hedged land between it and its next neighbour  and amberson laughed  wistfully as they turned in between the stone and brick gate pillars   and rolled up the crushed stone driveway   i wonder  lucy  if history s  going on forever repeating itself   he said   i wonder if this town s  going on building up things and rolling over them  as poor father once  said it was rolling over his poor old heart  it looks like it  here s  the amberson mansion again  only it s georgian instead of nondescript  romanesque  but it s just the same amberson mansion that my father built  long before you were born  the only difference is that it s your father  who s built this one now  it s all the same  in the long run      lucy did not quite understand  but she laughed as a friend should  and   taking his arm  showed him through vast rooms where ivory panelled walls  and trim window hangings were reflected dimly in dark  rugless floors   and the sparse furniture showed that lucy had been  collecting  with a  long purse   by jove   he said   you have been going it  fanny tells me  you had a great  house warming  dance  and you keep right on being the  belle of the ball  not any softer hearted than you used to be  fred  kinney s father says you ve refused fred so often that he got engaged to  janie sharon just to prove that someone would have him in spite of his  hair  well  the material world do move  and you ve got the new kind  of house it moves into nowadays  if it has the new price  and even the  grand old expanses of plate glass we used to be so proud of at the other  amberson mansion  they ve gone  too  with the crowded heavy gold and red  stuff  curious  we ve still got the plate glass windows  though all we  can see out of  em is the smoke and the old johnson house  which is a  counter jumper s boardinghouse now  while you ve got a view  and you cut  it all up into little panes  well  you re pretty refreshingly out of the  smoke up here       yes  for a while   lucy laughed   until it comes and we have to move  out farther       no  you ll stay here   he assured her   it will be somebody else who ll  move out farther      he continued to talk of the house after eugene arrived  and gave them no  account of his journey until they had retired from the dinner table  to eugene s library  a gray and shadowy room  where their coffee  was brought  then  equipped with a cigar  which seemed to occupy his  attention  amberson spoke in a casual tone of his sister and her son      i found isabel as well as usual   he said   only i m afraid  as usual   isn t particularly well  sydney and amelia had been up to paris in the  spring  but she hadn t seen them  somebody told her they were there  it  seems  they d left florence and were living in rome  amelia s become a  catholic and is said to give great sums to charity and to go about  with the gentry in consequence  but sydney s ailing and lives in a  wheel chair most of the time  it struck me isabel ought to be doing the  same thing      he paused  bestowing minute care upon the removal of the little band  from his cigar  and as he seemed to have concluded his narrative  eugene  spoke out of the shadow beyond a heavily shaded lamp   what do you mean  by that   he asked quietly      oh  she s cheerful enough   said amberson  still not looking at either  his young hostess or her father   at least   he added   she manages to  seem so  i m afraid she hasn t been really well for several years  she  isn t stout you know  she hasn t changed in looks much  and she seems  rather alarmingly short of breath for a slender person  father s been  that way for years  of course  but never nearly so much as isabel is  now  of course she makes nothing of it  but it seemed rather serious to  me when i noticed she had to stop and rest twice to get up the one short  flight of stairs in their two floor apartment  i told her i thought she  ought to make george let her come home       let her   eugene repeated  in a low voice   does she want to       she doesn t urge it  george seems to like the life there in his grand   gloomy  and peculiar way  and of course she ll never change about being  proud of him and all that  he s quite a swell  but in spite of anything  she said  rather than because  i know she does indeed want to come   she d like to be with father  of course  and i think she s  well  she  intimated one day that she feared it might even happen that she wouldn t  get to see him again  at the time i thought she referred to his age and  feebleness  but on the boat  coming home  i remembered the little look  of wistfulness  yet of resignation  with which she said it  and it  struck me all at once that i d been mistaken  i saw she was really  thinking of her own state of health       i see   eugene said  his voice even lower than it had been before   and  you say he won t  let  her come home      amberson laughed  but still continued to be interested in his cigar    oh  i don t think he uses force  he s very gentle with her  i doubt  if the subject is mentioned between them  and yet  and yet  knowing my  interesting nephew as you do  wouldn t you think that was about the way  to put it       knowing him as i do  yes   said eugene slowly   yes  i should think that  was about the way to put it      a murmur out of the shadows beyond him  a faint sound  musical and  feminine  yet expressive of a notable intensity  seemed to indicate that  lucy was of the same opinion           chapter xxix         let her  was correct  but the time came  and it came in the spring of  the next year when it was no longer a question of george s letting his  mother come home  he had to bring her  and to bring her quickly if she  was to see her father again  and amberson had been right  her danger of  never seeing him again lay not in the major s feebleness of heart but in  her own  as it was  george telegraphed his uncle to have a wheeled chair  at the station  for the journey had been disastrous  and to this hybrid  vehicle  placed close to the platform  her son carried her in his arms  when she arrived  she was unable to speak  but patted her brother s and  fanny s hands and looked  very sweet   fanny found the desperate courage  to tell her  she was lifted from the chair into a carriage  and seemed  a little stronger as they drove home  for once she took her hand from  george s  and waved it feebly toward the carriage window      changed   she whispered   so changed       you mean the town   amberson said   you mean the old place is changed   don t you  dear      she smiled and moved her lips   yes       it ll change to a happier place  old dear   he said   now that you re  back in it  and going to get well again      but she only looked at him wistfully  her eyes a little frightened     when the carriage stopped  her son carried her into the house  and up  the stairs to her own room  where a nurse was waiting  and he came out  a moment later  as the doctor went in  at the end of the hall a stricken  group was clustered  amberson  and fanny  and the major  george  deathly  pale and speechless  took his grandfather s hand  but the old gentleman  did not seem to notice his action      when are they going to let me see my daughter   he asked querulously    they told me to keep out of the way while they carried her in  because  it might upset her  i wish they d let me go in and speak to my daughter   i think she wants to see me      he was right  presently the doctor came out and beckoned to him  and the  major shuffled forward  leaning on a shaking cane  his figure  after all  its years of proud soldierliness  had grown stooping at last  and his  untrimmed white hair straggled over the back of his collar  he looked  old  old and divested of the world  as he crept toward his daughter s  room  her voice was stronger  for the waiting group heard a low cry of  tenderness and welcome as the old man reached the open doorway  then the  door was closed     fanny touched her nephew s arm   george  you must need something to  eat  i know she d want you to  i ve had things ready  i knew she d want  me to  you d better go down to the dining room  there s plenty on the  table  waiting for you  she d want you to eat something      he turned a ghastly face to her  it was so panic stricken   i don t  want anything to eat   he said savagely  and he began to pace the floor   taking care not to go near isabel s door  and that his footsteps were  muffled by the long  thick hall rug  after a while he went to where  amberson  with folded arms and bowed head  had seated himself near the  front window   uncle george   he said hoarsely   i didn t        well       oh  my god  i didn t think this thing the matter with her could ever be  serious  i    he gasped   when that doctor i had meet us at the boat     he could not go on     amberson only nodded his head  and did not otherwise change his  attitude     isabel lived through the night  at eleven o clock fanny came timidly to  george in his room   eugene is here   she whispered   he s downstairs   he wants    she gulped   he wants to know if he can t see her  i didn t  know what to say  i said i d see  i didn t know  the doctor said        the doctor said we  must keep her peaceful    george said sharply   do  you think that man s coming would be very soothing  my god  if it hadn t  been for him this mightn t have happened  we could have gone on living  here quietly  and  why  it would be like taking a stranger into her  room  she hasn t even spoken of him more than twice in all the time  we ve been away  doesn t he know how sick she is  you tell him the  doctor said she had to be quiet and peaceful  that s what he did say   isn t it      fanny acquiesced tearfully   i ll tell him  i ll tell him the doctor  said she was to be kept very quiet  i  i didn t know    and she pottered  out     an hour later the nurse appeared in george s doorway  she came  noiselessly  and his back was toward her  but he jumped as if he had  been shot  and his jaw fell  he so feared what she was going to say      she wants to see you      the terrified mouth shut with a click  and he nodded and followed her   but she remained outside his mother s room while he went in     isabel s eyes were closed  and she did not open them or move her head   but she smiled and edged her hand toward him as he sat on a stool beside  the bed  he took that slender  cold hand  and put it to his cheek      darling  did you  get something to eat   she could only whisper  slowly  and with difficulty  it was as if isabel herself were far away  and only  able to signal what she wanted to say      yes  mother       all you  needed       yes  mother      she did not speak again for a time  then   are you sure you  didn t  didn t catch cold coming home       i m all right  mother       that s good  it s sweet  it s sweet        what is  mother darling       to feel  my hand on your cheek  i  i can feel it      but this frightened him horribly  that she seemed so glad she could feel  it  like a child proud of some miraculous seeming thing accomplished  it  frightened him so that he could not speak  and he feared that she would  know how he trembled  but she was unaware  and again was silent  finally  she spoke again      i wonder if  if eugene and lucy know that we ve come  home       i m sure they do       has he  asked about me       yes  he was here       has he  gone       yes  mother      she sighed faintly   i d like        what  mother       i d like to have  seen him   it was just audible  this little regretful  murmur  several minutes passed before there was another   just  just  once   she whispered  and then was still     she seemed to have fallen asleep  and george moved to go  but a faint  pressure upon his fingers detained him  and he remained  with her hand  still pressed against his cheek  after a while he made sure she was  asleep  and moved again  to let the nurse come in  and this time there  was no pressure of the fingers to keep him  she was not asleep  but  thinking that if he went he might get some rest  and be better prepared  for what she knew was coming  she commanded those longing fingers of  hers  and let him go     he found the doctor standing with the nurse in the hall  and  telling  them that his mother was drowsing now  george went back to his own room   where he was startled to find his grandfather lying on the bed  and his  uncle leaning against the wall  they had gone home two hours before  and  he did not know they had returned      the doctor thought we d better come over   amberson said  then was  silent  and george  shaking violently  sat down on the edge of the bed   his shaking continued  and from time to time he wiped heavy sweat from  his forehead     the hours passed  and sometimes the old man upon the bed would snore a  little  stop suddenly  and move as if to rise  but george amberson would  set a hand upon his shoulder  and murmur a reassuring word or two  now  and then  either uncle or nephew would tiptoe into the hall and look  toward isabel s room  then come tiptoeing back  the other watching him  haggardly     once george gasped defiantly   that doctor in new york said she might  get better  don t you know he did  don t you know he said she might      amberson made no answer     dawn had been murking through the smoky windows  growing stronger for  half an hour  when both men started violently at a sound in the hall   and the major sat up on the bed  unchecked  it was the voice of the  nurse speaking to fanny minafer  and the next moment  fanny appeared in  the doorway  making contorted efforts to speak     amberson said weakly   does she want us  to come in      but fanny found her voice  and uttered a long  loud cry  she threw her  arms about george  and sobbed in an agony of loss and compassion      she loved you   she wailed   she loved you  she loved you  oh  how she  did love you      isabel had just left them           chapter xxx      major amberson remained dry eyed through the time that followed  he  knew that this separation from his daughter would be short  that the  separation which had preceded it was the long one  he worked at his  ledgers no more under his old gas drop light  but would sit all evening  staring into the fire  in his bedroom  and not speaking unless someone  asked him a question  he seemed almost unaware of what went on around  him  and those who were with him thought him dazed by isabel s death   guessing that he was lost in reminiscences and vague dreams   probably  his mind is full of pictures of his youth  or the civil war  and the  days when he and mother were young married people and all of us children  were jolly little things  and the city was a small town with one cobbled  street and the others just dirt roads with board sidewalks   this was  george amberson s conjecture  and the others agreed  but they were  mistaken  the major was engaged in the profoundest thinking of his  life  no business plans which had ever absorbed him could compare in  momentousness with the plans that absorbed him now  for he had to plan  how to enter the unknown country where he was not even sure of being  recognized as an amberson  not sure of anything  except that isabel  would help him if she could  his absorption produced the outward effect  of reverie  but of course it was not  the major was occupied with the  first really important matter that had taken his attention since he came  home invalided  after the gettysburg campaign  and went into business   and he realized that everything which had worried him or delighted  him during this lifetime between then and to day  all his buying and  building and trading and banking  that it all was trifling and waste  beside what concerned him now     he seldom went out of his room  and often left untouched the meals they  brought to him there  and this neglect caused them to shake their heads  mournfully  again mistaking for dazedness the profound concentration of  his mind  meanwhile  the life of the little bereft group still forlornly  centering upon him began to pick up again  as life will  and to emerge  from its own period of dazedness  it was not isabel s father but her son  who was really dazed     a month after her death he walked abruptly into fanny s room  one night   and found her at her desk  eagerly adding columns of figures with which  she had covered several sheets of paper  this mathematical computation  was concerned with her future income to be produced by the electric  headlight  now just placed on the general market  but fanny was ashamed  to be discovered doing anything except mourning  and hastily pushed  the sheets aside  even as she looked over her shoulder to greet her  hollow eyed visitor      george  you startled me       i beg your pardon for not knocking   he said huskily   i didn t think      she turned in her chair and looked at him solicitously   sit down   george  won t you       no  i just wanted        i could hear you walking up and down in your room   said fanny   you  were doing it ever since dinner  and it seems to me you re at it almost  every evening  i don t believe it s good for you  and i know it would  worry your mother terribly if she    fanny hesitated      see here   george said  breathing fast   i want to tell you once more  that what i did was right  how could i have done anything else but what  i did do       about what  george       about everything   he exclaimed  and he became vehement   i did the  right thing  i tell you  in heaven s name  i d like to know what  else there was for anybody in my position to do  it would have been a  dreadful thing for me to just let matters go on and not interfere  it  would have been terrible  what else on earth was there for me to do  i  had to stop that talk  didn t i  could a son do less than i did  didn t  it cost me something to do it  lucy and i d had a quarrel  but that  would have come round in time  and it meant the end forever when i  turned her father back from our door  i knew what it meant  yet i went  ahead and did it because knew it had to be done if the talk was to be  stopped  i took mother away for the same reason  i knew that would help  to stop it  and she was happy over there  she was perfectly happy  i  tell you  i think she had a happy life  and that s my only consolation   she didn t live to be old  she was still beautiful and young looking   and i feel she d rather have gone before she got old  she d had a good  husband  and all the comfort and luxury that anybody could have  and how  could it be called anything but a happy life  she was always cheerful   and when i think of her i can always see her laughing  i can always hear  that pretty laugh of hers  when i can keep my mind off of the trip home   and that last night  i always think of her gay and laughing  so how on  earth could she have had anything but a happy life  people that aren t  happy don t look cheerful all the time  do they  they look unhappy  if they are unhappy  that s how they look  see here   he faced her  challengingly   do you deny that i did the right thing       oh  i don t pretend to judge   fanny said soothingly  for his voice and  gesture both partook of wildness   i know you think you did  george       think i did   he echoed violently   my god in heaven   and he began to  walk up and down the floor   what else was there to do  what  choice did  i have  was there any other way of stopping the talk   he stopped  close  in front of her  gesticulating  his voice harsh and loud   don t you  hear me  i m asking you  was there any other way on earth of protecting  her from the talk      miss fanny looked away   it died down before long  i think   she said  nervously      that shows i was right  doesn t it   he cried   if i hadn t acted as  i did  that slanderous old johnson woman would have kept on with her  slanders  she d still be        no   fanny interrupted   she s dead  she dropped dead with apoplexy one  day about six weeks after you left  i didn t mention it in my letters  because i didn t want  i thought        well  the other people would have kept on  then  they d have        i don t know   said fanny  still averting her troubled eyes   things  are so changed here  george  the other people you speak of  one hardly  knows what s become of them  of course not a great many were doing the  talking  and they  well  some of them are dead  and some might as well  be  you never see them any more  and the rest  whoever they were  are  probably so mixed in with the crowds of new people that seem never even  to have heard of us  and i m sure we certainly never heard of them  and  people seem to forget things so soon  they seem to forget anything  you  can t imagine how things have changed here      george gulped painfully before he could speak   you  you mean to sit  there and tell me that if i d just let things go on  oh   he swung away   walking the floor again   i tell you i did the only right thing  if  you don t think so  why in the name of heaven can t you say what else  i should have done  it s easy enough to criticize  but the person who  criticizes a man ought at least to tell him what else he should have  done  you think i was wrong       i m not saying so   she said      you did at the time   he cried   you said enough then  i think  well   what have you to say now  if you re so sure i was wrong       nothing  george       it s only because you re afraid to   he said  and he went on with a  sudden bitter divination   you re reproaching yourself with what you had  to do with all that  and you re trying to make up for it by doing and  saying what you think mother would want you to  and you think i couldn t  stand it if i got to thinking i might have done differently  oh  i know   that s exactly what s in your mind  you do think i was wrong  so does  uncle george  i challenged him about it the other day  and he answered  just as you re answering  evaded  and tried to be gentler  i don t care  to be handled with gloves  i tell you i was right  and i don t need any  coddling by people that think i wasn t  and i suppose you believe i was  wrong not to let morgan see her that last night when he came here  and  she  she was dying  if you do  why in the name of god did you come and  ask me  you could have taken him in  she did want to see him  she       miss fanny looked startled   you think        she told me so   and the tortured young man choked   she said   just  once   she said  i d like to have seen him  just once   she meant  to  tell him good bye  that s what she meant  and you put this on me  too   you put this responsibility on me  but i tell you  and i told uncle  george  that the responsibility isn t all mine  if you were so sure i  was wrong all the time  when i took her away  and when i turned morgan  out  if you were so sure  what did you let me do it for  you and uncle  george were grown people  both of you  weren t you  you were older than  i  and if you were so sure you were wiser than i  why did you just stand  around with your hands hanging down  and let me go ahead  you could have  stopped it if it was wrong  couldn t you      fanny shook her head   no  george   she said slowly   nobody could have  stopped you  you were too strong  and        and what   he demanded loudly      and she loved you  too well      george stared at her hard  then his lower lip began to move  convulsively  and he set his teeth upon it but could not check its  frantic twitching     he ran out of the room     she sat still  listening  he had plunged into his mother s room  but  no sound came to fanny s ears after the sharp closing of the door   and presently she rose and stepped out into the hall  but could hear  nothing  the heavy black walnut door of isabel s room  as fanny s  troubled eyes remained fixed upon it  seemed to become darker and  vaguer  the polished wood took the distant ceiling light  at the end  of the hall  in dim reflections which became mysterious  and to fanny s  disturbed mind the single sharp point of light on the bronze door knob  was like a continuous sharp cry in the stillness of night  what  interview was sealed away from human eye and ear within the lonely  darkness on the other side of that door  in that darkness where isabel s  own special chairs were  and her own special books  and the two great  walnut wardrobes filled with her dresses and wraps  what tragic argument  might be there vainly striving to confute the gentle dead   in god s  name  what else could i have done   for his mother s immutable silence  was surely answering him as isabel in life would never have answered  him  and he was beginning to understand how eloquent the dead can be   they cannot stop their eloquence  no matter how they have loved the  living  they cannot choose  and so  no matter in what agony george  should cry out   what else could i have done   and to the end of his  life no matter how often he made that wild appeal  isabel was doomed to  answer him with the wistful  faint murmur      i d like to have seen him  just  just once      a cheerful darkey went by the house  loudly and tunelessly whistling  some broken thoughts upon women  fried food and gin  then a group of  high school boys  returning homeward after important initiations  were  heard skylarking along the sidewalk  rattling sticks on the fences   squawking hoarsely  and even attempting to sing in the shocking new  voices of uncompleted adolescence  for no reason  and just as a poultry  yard falls into causeless agitation  they stopped in front of the house   and for half an hour produced the effect of a noisy multitude in full  riot     to the woman standing upstairs in the hall  this was almost unbearable   and she felt that she would have to go down and call to them to stop   but she was too timid  and after a time went back to her room  and sat  at her desk again  she left the door open  and frequently glanced out  into the hall  but gradually became once more absorbed in the figures  which represented her prospective income from her great plunge in  electric lights for automobiles  she did not hear george return to his  own room     a superstitious person might have thought it unfortunate that her  partner in this speculative industry  as in wilbur s disastrous  rolling mills  was that charming but too haphazardous man of the world   george amberson  he was one of those optimists who believe that if you  put money into a great many enterprises one of them is sure to turn out  a fortune  and therefore  in order to find the lucky one  it is only  necessary to go into a large enough number of them  altogether gallant  in spirit  and beautifully game under catastrophe  he had gone into a  great many  and the unanimity of their  bad luck   as he called it   gave him one claim to be a distinguished person  if he had no other   in business he was ill fated with a consistency which made him  in that  alone  a remarkable man  and he declared  with some earnestness  that  there was no accounting for it except by the fact that there had been  so much good luck in his family before he was born that something had to  balance it      you ought to have thought of my record and stayed out   he told fanny   one day the next spring  when the affairs of the headlight company had  begun to look discouraging   i feel the old familiar sinking that s  attended all my previous efforts to prove myself a business genius  i  think it must be something like the feeling an aeronaut has when his  balloon bursts  and  looking down  he sees below him the old home farm  where he used to live  i mean the feeling he d have just before he  flattened out in that same old clay barnyard  things do look bleak  and  i m only glad you didn t go into this confounded thing to the extent i  did      miss fanny grew pink   but it must go right   she protested   we saw  with our own eyes how perfectly it worked in the shop  the light was so  bright no one could face it  and so there can t be any reason for it not  to work  it simply        oh  you re right about that   amberson said   it certainly was a  perfect thing  in the shop  the only thing we didn t know was how fast  an automobile had to go to keep the light going  it appears that this  was a matter of some importance       well  how fast does one have to        to keep the light from going entirely out   he informed her with  elaborate deliberation   it is computed by those enthusiasts who have  bought our product  and subsequently returned it to us and got their  money back  they compute that a motor car must maintain a speed of  twenty five miles an hour  or else there won t be any light at all   to make the illumination bright enough to be noticed by an approaching  automobile  they state the speed must be more than thirty miles an  hour  at thirty five  objects in the path of the light begin to become  visible  at forty they are revealed distinctly  and at fifty and above  we have a real headlight  unfortunately many people don t care to drive  that fast at all times after dusk  especially in the traffic  or where  policemen are likely to become objectionable       but think of that test on the road when we        that test was lovely   he admitted   the inventor made us happy with  his oratory  and you and frank bronson and i went whirling through the  night at a speed that thrilled us  it was an intoxicating sensation  we  were intoxicated by the lights  the lights and the music  we must never  forget that drive  with the cool wind kissing our cheeks and the road  lit up for miles ahead  we must never forget it and we never shall  it  cost        but something s got to be done       it has  indeed  my something would seem to be leaving my watch at my  uncle s  luckily  you       the pink of fanny s cheeks became deeper   but isn t that man going to  do anything to remedy it  can t he try to        he can try   said amberson   he is trying  in fact  i ve sat in the  shop watching him try for several beautiful afternoons  while outside  the windows all nature was fragrant with spring and smoke  he hums  ragtime to himself as he tries  and i think his mind is wandering to  something else less tedious  to some new invention in which he d take  more interest       but you mustn t let him   she cried   you must make him keep on  trying       oh  yes  he understands that s what i sit there for  i ll keep  sitting      however  in spite of the time he spent sitting in the shop  worrying  the inventor of the fractious light  amberson found opportunity to worry  himself about another matter of business  this was the settlement of  isabel s estate      it s curious about the deed to her house   he said to his nephew    you re absolutely sure it wasn t among her papers       mother didn t have any papers   george told him   none at all  all she  ever had to do with business was to deposit the cheques grandfather gave  her and then write her own cheques against them       the deed to the house was never recorded   amberson said thoughtfully    i ve been over to the courthouse to see  i asked father if he never  gave her one  and he didn t seem able to understand me at first  then he  finally said he thought he must have given her a deed long ago  but he  wasn t sure  i rather think he never did  i think it would be just as  well to get him to execute one now in your favour  i ll speak to him  about it      george sighed   i don t think i d bother him about it  the house is  mine  and you and i understand that it is  that s enough for me  and  there isn t likely to be much trouble between you and me when we come to  settling poor grandfather s estate  i ve just been with him  and i think  it would only confuse him for you to speak to him about it again  i  notice he seems distressed if anybody tries to get his attention  he s a  long way off  somewhere  and he likes to stay that way  i think  i think  mother wouldn t want us to bother him about it  i m sure she d tell us  to let him alone  he looks so white and queer      amberson shook his head   not much whiter and queerer than you do  young  fellow  you d better begin to get some air and exercise and quit hanging  about in the house all day  i won t bother him any more than i can help   but i ll have the deed made out ready for his signature       i wouldn t bother him at all  i don t see        you might see   said his uncle uneasily   the estate is just about  as involved and mixed up as an estate can well get  to the best of my  knowledge  and i haven t helped it any by what he let me have for this  infernal headlight scheme which has finally gone trolloping forever to  where the woodbine twineth  leaves me flat  and poor old frank bronson  just half flat  and fanny  well  thank heaven  i kept her from going  in so deep that it would leave her flat  it s rough on her as it is  i  suspect  you ought to have that deed       no  don t bother him       i ll bother him as little as possible  i ll wait till some day when he  seems to brighten up a little      but amberson waited too long  the major had already taken eleven months  since his daughter s death to think important things out  he had got as  far with them as he could  and there was nothing to detain him longer  in the world  one evening his grandson sat with him  the major seemed  to like best to have young george with him  so far as they were able to  guess his preferences  and the old gentleman made a queer gesture   he slapped his knee as if he had made a sudden discovery  or else  remembered that he had forgotten something     george looked at him with an air of inquiry  but said nothing  he had  grown to be almost as silent as his grandfather  however  the major  spoke without being questioned      it must be in the sun   he said   there wasn t anything here but the  sun in the first place  and the earth came out of the sun  and we came  out of the earth  so  whatever we are  we must have been in the sun  we  go back to the earth we came out of  so the earth will go back to the  sun that it came out of  and time means nothing  nothing at all  so in a  little while we ll all be back in the sun together  i wish       he moved his hand uncertainly as if reaching for something  and george  jumped up   did you want anything  grandfather       what       would you like a glass of water       no  no  no  i don t want anything   the reaching hand dropped back upon  the arm of his chair  and he relapsed into silence  but a few minutes  later he finished the sentence he had begun      i wish  somebody could tell me      the next day he had a slight cold  but he seemed annoyed when his son  suggested calling the doctor  and amberson let him have his own way  so far  in fact  that after he had got up and dressed  the following  morning  he was all alone when he went away to find out what he hadn t  been able to think out  all those things he had wished  somebody  would  tell him     old sam  shuffling in with the breakfast tray  found the major in his  accustomed easy chair by the fireplace  and yet even the old darkey  could see instantly that the major was not there           chapter xxxi        when the great amberson estate went into court for settlement   there  wasn t any   george amberson said  that is  when the settlement was  concluded there was no estate   i guessed it   amberson went on   as  an expert on prosperity  my career is disreputable  but as a prophet  of calamity i deserve a testimonial banquet   he reproached himself  bitterly for not having long ago discovered that his father had never  given isabel a deed to her house   and those pigs  sydney and amelia    he added  for this was another thing he was bitter about   they won t  do anything  i m sorry i gave them the opportunity of making a polished  refusal  amelia s letter was about half in italian  she couldn t  remember enough ways of saying no in english  one has to live quite a  long while to realize there are people like that  the estate was badly  crippled  even before they took out their  third   and the  third  they  took was the only good part of the rotten apple  well  i didn t ask them  for restitution on my own account  and at least it will save you some  trouble  young george  never waste any time writing to them  you mustn t  count on them       i don t   george said quietly   i don t count on anything       oh  we ll not feel that things are quite desperate   amberson laughed   but not with great cheerfulness   we ll survive  georgie  you will   especially  for my part i m a little too old and too accustomed to fall  back on somebody else for supplies to start a big fight with life   i ll be content with just surviving  and i can do it on an  eighteen hundred dollar  a year consulship  an ex congressman can always  be pretty sure of getting some such job  and i hear from washington the  matter s about settled  i ll live pleasantly enough with a pitcher of  ice under a palm tree  and black folks to wait on me  that part of it  will be like home  and i ll manage to send you fifty dollars every now  and then  after i once get settled  so much for me  but you  of course  you ve had a poor training for making your own way  but you re only a  boy after all  and the stuff of the old stock is in you  it ll come out  and do something  i ll never forgive myself about that deed  it would  have given you something substantial to start with  still  you have  a little tiny bit  and you ll have a little tiny salary  too  and of  course your aunt fanny s here  and she s got something you can fall back  on if you get too pinched  until i can begin to send you a dribble now  and then      george s  little tiny bit  was six hundred dollars which had come to him  from the sale of his mother s furniture  and the  little tiny salary   was eight dollars a week which old frank bronson was to pay him for  services as a clerk and student at law  old frank would have offered  more to the major s grandson  but since the death of that best of  clients and his own experience with automobile headlights  he was not  certain of being able to pay more and at the same time settle his own  small bills for board and lodging  george had accepted haughtily  and  thereby removed a burden from his uncle s mind     amberson himself  however  had not even a  tiny bit   though he got his  consular appointment  and to take him to his post he found it necessary  to borrow two hundred of his nephew s six hundred dollars   it makes me  sick  george   he said   but i d better get there and get that salary  started  of course eugene would do anything in the world  and the fact  is he wanted to  but i felt that  ah  under the circumstances        never   george exclaimed  growing red   i can t imagine one of the  family    he paused  not finding it necessary to explain that  the  family  shouldn t turn a man from the door and then accept favours from  him   i wish you d take more      amberson declined   one thing i ll say for you  young george  you  haven t a stingy bone in your body  that s the amberson stock in  you  and i like it      he added something to this praise of his nephew on the day he left for  washington  he was not to return  but to set forth from the capital on  the long journey to his post  george went with him to the station  and  their farewell was lengthened by the train s being several minutes late      i may not see you again  georgie   amberson said  and his voice was a  little husky as he set a kind hand on the young man s shoulder   it s  quite probable that from this time on we ll only know each other by  letter  until you re notified as my next of kin that there s an old  valise to be forwarded to you  and perhaps some dusty curios from  the consulate mantelpiece  well  it s an odd way for us to be saying  good bye  one wouldn t have thought it  even a few years ago  but here  we are  two gentlemen of elegant appearance in a state of bustitude   we can t ever tell what will happen at all  can we  once i stood where  we re standing now  to say good bye to a pretty girl  only it was in the  old station before this was built  and we called it the  depot   she d  been visiting your mother  before isabel was married  and i was wild  about her  and she admitted she didn t mind that  in fact  we decided we  couldn t live without each other  and we were to be married  but she had  to go abroad first with her father  and when we came to say good bye  we knew we wouldn t see each other again for almost a year  i thought i  couldn t live through it  and she stood here crying  well  i don t even  know where she lives now  or if she is living  and i only happen to  think of her sometimes when i m here at the station waiting for a train   if she ever thinks of me she probably imagines i m still dancing in the  ballroom at the amberson mansion  and she probably thinks of the mansion  as still beautiful  still the finest house in town  life and money both  behave like loose quicksilver in a nest of cracks  and when they re gone  we can t tell where  or what the devil we did with  em  but i believe  i ll say now  while there isn t much time left for either of us to get  embarrassed about it  i believe i ll say that i ve always been fond of  you  georgie  but i can t say that i always liked you  sometimes i ve  felt you were distinctly not an acquired taste  until lately  one had to  be fond of you just naturally  this isn t very  tactful   of course  for  if he didn t  well  he wouldn t  we all spoiled you terribly when you  were a little boy and let you grow up en prince  and i must say you took  to it  but you ve received a pretty heavy jolt  and i had enough of  your disposition  myself  at your age  to understand a little of what  cocksure youth has to go through inside when it finds that it can  make terrible mistakes  poor old fellow  you get both kinds of jolts  together  spiritual and material  and you ve taken them pretty quietly  and  well  with my train coming into the shed  you ll forgive me  for saying that there have been times when i thought you ought to be  hanged  but i ve always been fond of you  and now i like you  and just  for a last word  there may be somebody else in this town who s always  felt about you like that  fond of you  i mean  no matter how much it  seemed you ought to be hanged  you might try  hello  i must run  i ll  send back the money as fast as they pay me  so  good bye and god bless  you  georgie      he passed through the gates  waved his hat cheerily from the other side  of the iron screen  and was lost from sight in the hurrying crowd   and as he disappeared  an unexpected poignant loneliness fell upon his  nephew so heavily and so suddenly that he had no energy to recoil from  the shock  it seemed to him that the last fragment of his familiar world  had disappeared  leaving him all alone forever     he walked homeward slowly through what appeared to be the strange  streets of a strange city  and  as a matter of fact  the city was  strange to him  he had seen little of it during his years in college   and then had followed the long absence and his tragic return  since that  he had been  scarcely outdoors at all   as fanny complained  warning him  that his health would suffer  and he had been downtown only in a closed  carriage  he had not realized the great change     the streets were thunderous  a vast energy heaved under the universal  coating of dinginess  george walked through the begrimed crowds of  hurrying strangers and saw no face that he remembered  great numbers  of the faces were even of a kind he did not remember ever to have seen   they were partly like the old type that his boyhood knew  and partly  like types he knew abroad  he saw german eyes with american wrinkles at  their corners  he saw irish eyes and neapolitan eyes  roman eyes   tuscan eyes  eyes of lombardy  of savoy  hungarian eyes  balkan eyes   scandinavian eyes  all with a queer american look in them  he saw jews  who had been german jews  jews who had been russian jews  jews who had  been polish jews but were no longer german or russian or polish jews   all the people were soiled by the smoke mist through which they hurried   under the heavy sky that hung close upon the new skyscrapers  and nearly  all seemed harried by something impending  though here and there a women  with bundles would be laughing to a companion about some adventure of  the department stores  or perhaps an escape from the charging traffic  of the streets  and not infrequently a girl  or a free and easy young  matron  found time to throw an encouraging look to george     he took no note of these  and  leaving the crowded sidewalks  turned  north into national avenue  and presently reached the quieter but no  less begrimed region of smaller shops and old fashioned houses  those  latter had been the homes of his boyhood playmates  old friends of his  grandfather had lived here   in this alley he had fought with two boys  at the same time  and whipped them  in that front yard he had been  successfully teased into temporary insanity by a  sunday school class of  pinky little girls  on that sagging porch a laughing woman had fed  him and other boys with doughnuts and gingerbread  yonder he saw the  staggered relics of the iron picket fence he had made his white pony  jump  on a dare  and in the shabby  stone faced house behind the fence  he had gone to children s parties  and  when he was a little older he  had danced there often  and fallen in love with mary sharon  and kissed  her  apparently by force  under the stairs in the hall  the double front  doors  of meaninglessly carved walnut  once so glossily varnished  had  been painted smoke gray  but the smoke grime showed repulsively  even on  the smoke gray  and over the doors a smoked sign proclaimed the place to  be a  stag hotel      other houses had become boarding houses too genteel for signs  but many  were franker  some offering  board by the day  week or meal   and some   more laconic  contenting themselves with the label   rooms   one   having torn out part of an old stone trimmed bay window for purposes of  commercial display  showed forth two suspended petticoats and a pair  of oyster coloured flannel trousers to prove the claims of its  black and gilt sign   french cleaning and dye house   its next neighbour  also sported a remodelled front and permitted no doubt that its mission  in life was to attend cosily upon death   j  m  rolsener  caskets   the funeral home   and beyond that  a plain old honest four square  gray painted brick house was flamboyantly decorated with a great gilt  scroll on the railing of the old fashioned veranda   mutual benev t  order cavaliers and dames of purity   this was the old minafer house     george passed it without perceptibly wincing  in fact  he held his head  up  and except for his gravity of countenance and the prison pallor he  had acquired by too constantly remaining indoors  there was little to  warn an acquaintance that he was not precisely the same george amberson  minafer known aforetime  he was still so magnificent  indeed  that there  came to his ears a waft of comment from a passing automobile  this was a  fearsome red car  glittering in brass  with half a dozen young people  in it whose motorism had reached an extreme manifestation in dress  the  ladies of this party were favourably affected at sight of the pedestrian  upon the sidewalk  and  as the machine was moving slowly  and close to  the curb  they had time to observe him in detail  which they did with a  frankness not pleasing to the object of their attentions   one sees so  many nice looking people one doesn t know nowadays   said the youngest  of the young ladies   this old town of ours is really getting enormous   i shouldn t mind knowing who he is       i don t know   the youth beside her said  loudly enough to be heard at  a considerable distance   i don t know who he is  but from his looks i  know who he thinks he is  he thinks he s the grand duke cuthbert   there  was a burst of tittering as the car gathered speed and rolled away  with  the girl continuing to look back until her scandalized companions forced  her to turn by pulling her hood over her face  she made an impression  upon george  so deep a one  in fact  that he unconsciously put his  emotion into a muttered word     riffraff     this was the last  walk home  he was ever to take by the route he was  now following  up national avenue to amberson addition and the two big  old houses at the foot of amberson boulevard  for tonight would be the  last night that he and fanny were to spend in the house which the major  had forgotten to deed to isabel  to morrow they were to  move out   and  george was to begin his work in bronson s office  he had not come to  this collapse without a fierce struggle  but the struggle was inward   and the rolling world was not agitated by it  and rolled calmly on   for of all the  ideals of life  which the world  in its rolling   inconsiderately flattens out to nothingness  the least likely to retain  a profile is that ideal which depends upon inheriting money  george  amberson  in spite of his record of failures in business  had spoken  shrewdly when he realized at last that money  like life  was  like  quicksilver in a nest of cracks   and his nephew had the awakening  experience of seeing the great amberson estate vanishing into such  a nest  in a twinkling  it seemed  now that it was indeed so utterly  vanished     his uncle had suggested that he might write to college friends  perhaps  they could help him to something better than the prospect offered  by bronson s office  but george flushed and shook his head  without  explaining  in that small and quietly superior  crowd  of his he had too  emphatically supported the ideal of being rather than doing  he could  not appeal to one of its members now to help him to a job  besides  they  were not precisely the warmest hearted crew in the world  and he had  long ago dropped the last affectation of a correspondence with any of  them  he was as aloof from any survival of intimacy with his boyhood  friends in the city  and  in truth  had lost track of most of them   the  friends of the ace   once bound by oath to succour one another in peril  or poverty  were long ago dispersed  one or two had died  one or two  had gone to live elsewhere  the others were disappeared into the smoky  bigness of the heavy city  of the brethren  there remained within  his present cognizance only his old enemy  the red haired kinney  now  married to janie sharon  and charlie johnson  who  out of deference  to his mother s memory  had passed the amberson mansion one day  when  george stood upon the front steps  and  looking in fiercely  had looked  away with continued fierceness  his only token of recognition     on this last homeward walk of his  when george reached the entrance  to amberson addition  that is  when he came to where the entrance had  formerly been  he gave a little start  and halted for a moment to stare   this was the first time he had noticed that the stone pillars  marking  the entrance  had been removed  then he realized that for a long time he  had been conscious of a queerness about this corner without being aware  of what made the difference  national avenue met amberson boulevard here  at an obtuse angle  and the removal of the pillars made the boulevard  seem a cross street of no overpowering importance  certainly it did not  seem to be a boulevard     at the next corner neptune s fountain remained  and one could still  determine with accuracy what its designer s intentions had been  it  stood in sore need of just one last kindness  and if the thing had  possessed any friends they would have done that doleful shovelling after  dark     george did not let his eyes linger upon the relic  nor did he look  steadfastly at the amberson mansion  massive as the old house was  it  managed to look gaunt  its windows stared with the skull emptiness of  all windows in empty houses that are to be lived in no more  of course  the rowdy boys of the neighbourhood had been at work  many of these  haggard windows were broken  the front door stood ajar  forced open  and  idiot salacity  in white chalk  was smeared everywhere upon the pillars  and stonework of the verandas     george walked by the mansion hurriedly  and came home to his mother s  house for the last time     emptiness was there  too  and the closing of the door resounded through  bare rooms  for downstairs there was no furniture in the house except a  kitchen table in the dining room  which fanny had kept  for dinner   she  said  though as she was to cook and serve that meal herself george had  his doubts about her name for it  upstairs  she had retained her own  furniture  and george had been living in his mother s room  having sent  everything from his own to the auction  isabel s room was still as it  had been  but the furniture would be moved with fanny s to new quarters  in the morning  fanny had made plans for her nephew as well as herself   she had found a three room  kitchenette apartment  in an apartment house  where several old friends of hers had established themselves  elderly  widows of citizens once  prominent  and other retired gentry  people  used their own  kitchenettes  for breakfast and lunch  but there was  a table d hote arrangement for dinner on the ground floor  and after  dinner bridge was played all evening  an attraction powerful with  fanny  she had  made all the arrangements   she reported  and nervously  appealed for approval  asking if she hadn t shown herself  pretty  practical  in such matters  george acquiesced absent mindedly  not  thinking of what she said and not realizing to what it committed him     he began to realize it now  as he wandered about the dismantled house   he was far from sure that he was willing to go and live in a  three room  apartment  with fanny and eat breakfast and lunch with her  prepared by  herself in the  kitchenette   and dinner at the table d hote in  such a  pretty colonial dining room   so fanny described it  at a little round  table they would have all to themselves in the midst of a dozen little  round tables which other relics of disrupted families would have all to  themselves  for the first time  now that the change was imminent  george  began to develop before his mind s eye pictures of what he was in for   and they appalled him  he decided that such a life verged upon the  sheerly unbearable  and that after all there were some things left that  he just couldn t stand  so he made up his mind to speak to his aunt  about it at  dinner   and tell her that he preferred to ask bronson to  let him put a sofa bed  a trunk  and a folding rubber bathtub behind a  screen in the dark rear room of the office  george felt that this  would be infinitely more tolerable  and he could eat at restaurants   especially as about all he ever wanted nowadays was coffee     but at  dinner  he decided to put off telling fanny of his plan until  later  she was so nervous  and so distressed about the failure of her  efforts with sweetbreads and macaroni  and she was so eager in her talk  of how comfortable they would be  by this time to morrow night   she  fluttered on  her nervousness increasing  saying how  nice  it would  be for him  when he came from work in the evenings  to be among  nice  people  people who know who we are   and to have a pleasant game of  bridge with  people who are really old friends of the family      when they stopped probing among the scorched fragments she had set  forth  george lingered downstairs  waiting for a better opportunity to  introduce his own subject  but when he heard dismaying sounds from the  kitchen he gave up  there was a crash  then a shower of crashes  falling  tin clamoured to be heard above the shattering of porcelain  and over  all rose fanny s wail of lamentation for the treasures saved from the  sale  but now lost forever to the  kitchenette   fanny was nervous  indeed  so nervous that she could not trust her hands     for a moment george thought she might have been injured  but  before he  reached the kitchen  he heard her sweeping at the fragments  and turned  back  he put off speaking to fanny until morning     things more insistent than his vague plans for a sofa bed in bronson s  office had possession of his mind as he went upstairs  moving his hand  slowly along the smooth walnut railing of the balustrade  half way to  the landing he stopped  turned  and stood looking down at the heavy  doors masking the black emptiness that had been the library  here he  had stood on what he now knew was the worst day of his life  here he had  stood when his mother passed through that doorway  hand in hand with her  brother  to learn what her son had done     he went on more heavily  more slowly  and  more heavily and slowly  still  entered isabel s room and shut the door  he did not come forth  again  and bade fanny good night through the closed door when she  stopped outside it later      i ve put all the lights out  george   she said   everything s all  right       very well   he called   good night      she did not go   i m sure we re going to enjoy the new little home   george   she said timidly   i ll try hard to make things nice for you   and the people really are lovely  you mustn t feel as if things are  altogether gloomy  george  i know everything s going to turn out all  right  you re young and strong and you have a good mind and i m sure     she hesitated   i m sure your mother s watching over you  georgie   good night  dear       good night  aunt fanny      his voice had a strangled sound in spite of him  but she seemed not to  notice it  and he heard her go to her own room and lock herself in with  bolt and key against burglars  she had said the one thing she should  not have said just then   i m sure your mother s watching over you   georgie   she had meant to be kind  but it destroyed his last chance for  sleep that night  he would have slept little if she had not said it  but  since she had said it  he could not sleep at all  for he knew that it  was true  if it could be true  and that his mother  if she still lived  in spirit  would be weeping on the other side of the wall of silence   weeping and seeking for some gate to let her through so that she could  come and  watch over him      he felt that if there were such gates they were surely barred  they  were like those awful library doors downstairs  which had shut her in to  begin the suffering to which he had consigned her     the room was still isabel s  nothing had been changed  even the  photographs of george  of the major  and of  brother george  still stood  on her dressing table  and in a drawer of her desk was an old picture of  eugene and lucy  taken together  which george had found  but had slowly  closed away again from sight  not touching it  to morrow everything  would be gone  and he had heard there was not long to wait before the  house itself would be demolished  the very space which tonight was still  isabel s room would be cut into new shapes by new walls and floors and  ceilings  yet the room would always live  for it could not die out of  george s memory  it would live as long as he did  and it would always be  murmurous with a tragic  wistful whispering     and if space itself can be haunted  as memory is haunted  then some  time  when the space that was isabel s room came to be made into the  small bedrooms and  kitchenettes  already designed as its destiny  that  space might well be haunted and the new occupants come to feel that some  seemingly causeless depression hung about it  a wraith of the passion  that filled it throughout the last night that george minafer spent  there     whatever remnants of the old high handed arrogance were still within  him  he did penance for his deepest sin that night  and it may be that  to this day some impressionable  overworked woman in a  kitchenette    after turning out the light will seem to see a young man kneeling in the  darkness  shaking convulsively  and  with arms outstretched through the  wall  clutching at the covers of a shadowy bed  it may seem to her that  she hears the faint cry  over and over      mother  forgive me  god  forgive me            chapter xxxii        at least  it may be claimed for george that his last night in the house  where he had been born was not occupied with his own disheartening  future  but with sorrow for what sacrifices his pride and youth had  demanded of others  and early in the morning he came downstairs and  tried to help fanny make coffee on the kitchen range      there was something i wanted to say to you last night  aunt fanny   he  said  as she finally discovered that an amber fluid  more like tea than  coffee  was as near ready to be taken into the human system as it would  ever be   i think i d better do it now      she set the coffee pot back upon the stove with a little crash  and   looking at him in a desperate anxiety  began to twist her dainty apron  between her fingers without any consciousness of what she was doing      why  why    she stammered  but she knew what he was going to  say  and that was why she had been more and more nervous    hadn t  perhaps  perhaps we d better get the  the things moved to the  little new home first  george  let s       he interrupted quietly  though at her phrase   the little new home   his  pungent impulse was to utter one loud shout and run   it was about this  new place that i wanted to speak  i ve been thinking it over  and i ve  decided  i want you to take all the things from mother s room and use  them and keep them for me  and i m sure the little apartment will be  just what you like  and with the extra bedroom probably you could find  some woman friend to come and live there  and share the expense with  you  but i ve decided on another arrangement for myself  and so i m not  going with you  i don t suppose you ll mind much  and i don t see why  you should mind  particularly  that is  i m not very lively company  these days  or any days  for that matter  i can t imagine you  or any  one else  being much attached to me  so       he stopped in amazement  no chair had been left in the kitchen  but  fanny gave a despairing glance around her  in search of one  then sank  abruptly  and sat flat upon the floor      you re going to leave me in the lurch   she gasped      what on earth    george sprang to her   get up  aunt fanny       i can t  i m too weak  let me alone  george   and as he released the  wrist he had seized to help her  she repeated the dismal prophecy which  for days she had been matching against her hopes   you re going to leave  me  in the lurch       why no  aunt fanny   he protested   at first i d have been something  of a burden on you  i m to get eight dollars a week  about thirty two  a month  the rent s thirty six dollars a month  and the table d hote  dinner runs up to over twenty two dollars apiece  so with my half of the  rent  eighteen dollars  i d have less than nothing left out of my salary  to pay my share of the groceries for all the breakfasts and luncheons   you see you d not only be doing all the housework and cooking  but you d  be paying more of the expenses than i would      she stared at him with such a forlorn blankness as he had never seen    i d be paying    she said feebly   i d be paying        certainly you would  you d be using more of your money than        my money   fanny s chin drooped upon her thin chest  and she laughed  miserably   i ve got twenty eight dollars  that s all       you mean until the interest is due again       i mean that s all   fanny said   i mean that s all there is  there  won t be any more interest because there isn t any principal       why  you told       she shook her head   no  i haven t told you anything       then it was uncle george  he told me you had enough to fall back on   that s just what he said   to fall back on   he said you d lost more  than you should  in the headlight company  but he d insisted that you  should hold out enough to live on  and you d very wisely followed his  advice       i know   she said weakly   i told him so  he didn t know  or else he d  forgotten  how much wilbur s insurance amounted to  and i  oh  it seemed  such a sure way to make a real fortune out of a little  and i thought i  could do something for you  george  if you ever came to need it  and it  all looked so bright i just thought i d put it all in  i did  every cent  except my last interest payment  and it s gone       good lord   george began to pace up and down on the worn planks of the  bare floor   why on earth did you wait till now to tell such a thing as  this       i couldn t tell till i had to   she said piteously   i couldn t till  george amberson went away  he couldn t do anything to help  anyhow  and  i just didn t want him to talk to me about it  he s been at me so much  about not putting more in than i could afford to lose  and said he  considered he had my  my word i wasn t putting more than that in it  so  i thought  what was the use  what was the use of going over it all  with him and having him reproach me  and probably reproach himself   it wouldn t do any good  not any good on earth   she got out her lace  handkerchief and began to cry   nothing does any good  i guess  in this  old world  oh  how tired of this old world i am  i didn t know what to  do  i just tried to go ahead and be as practical as i could  and arrange  some way for us to live  oh  i knew you didn t want me  george  you  always teased me and berated me whenever you had a chance from the time  you were a little boy  you did so  later  you ve tried to be kinder to  me  but you don t want me around  oh  i can see that much  you don t  suppose i want to thrust myself on you  do you  it isn t very pleasant  to be thrusting yourself on a person you know doesn t want you  but i  knew you oughtn t to be left all alone in the world  it isn t good  i  knew your mother d want me to watch over you and try to have something  like a home for you  i know she d want me to do what i tried to do    fanny s tears were bitter now  and her voice  hoarse and wet  was  tragically sincere   i tried  i tried to be practical  to look after  your interests  to make things as nice for you as i could  i walked my  heels down looking for a place for us to live  i walked and walked over  this town  i didn t ride one block on a street car  i wouldn t use five  cents no matter how tired i  oh   she sobbed uncontrollably   oh  and  now  you don t want  you want  you want to leave me in the lurch  you       george stopped walking   in god s name  aunt fanny   he said   quit  spreading out your handkerchief and drying it and then getting it all  wet again  i mean stop crying  do  and for heaven s sake  get up  don t  sit there with your back against the boiler and        it s not hot   fanny sniffled   it s cold  the plumbers disconnected  it  i wouldn t mind if they hadn t  i wouldn t mind if it burned me   george       oh  my lord   he went to her  and lifted her   for god s sake  get up   come  let s take the coffee into the other room  and see what s to be  done      he got her to her feet  she leaned upon him  already somewhat comforted   and  with his arm about her  he conducted her to the dining room and  seated her in one of the two kitchen chairs which had been placed at  the rough table   there   he said   get over it   then he brought the  coffee pot  some lumps of sugar in a tin pan  and  finding that all the  coffee cups were broken  set water glasses upon the table  and poured  some of the pale coffee into them  by this time fanny s spirits had  revived appreciably  she looked up with a plaintive eagerness   i had  bought all my fall clothes  george   she said   and i paid every bill i  owed  i don t owe a cent for clothes  george       that s good   he said wanly  and he had a moment of physical dizziness  that decided him to sit down quickly  for an instant it seemed to him  that he was not fanny s nephew  but married to her  he passed his pale  hand over his paler forehead   well  let s see where we stand   he said  feebly   let s see if we can afford this place you ve selected      fanny continued to brighten   i m sure it s the most practical plan we  could possibly have worked out  george  and it is a comfort to be among  nice people  i think we ll both enjoy it  because the truth is we ve  been keeping too much to ourselves for a long while  it isn t good for  people       i was thinking about the money  aunt fanny  you see        i m sure we can manage it   she interrupted quickly   there really  isn t a cheaper place in town that we could actually live in and be     here she interrupted herself   oh  there s one great economy i forgot to  tell you  and it s especially an economy for you  because you re always  too generous about such things  they don t allow any tipping  they have  signs that prohibit it       that s good   he said grimly   but the rent is thirty six dollars a  month  the dinner is twenty two and a half for each of us  and we ve got  to have some provision for other food  we won t need any clothes for a  year  perhaps        oh  longer   she exclaimed   so you see        i see that forty five and thirty six make eighty one   he said   at  the lowest  we need a hundred dollars a month  and i m going to make  thirty two       i thought of that  george   she said confidently   and i m sure it will  be all right  you ll be earning a great deal more than that very soon       i don t see any prospect of it  not till i m admitted to the bar  and  that will be two years at the earliest      fanny s confidence was not shaken   i know you ll be getting on faster  than        faster   george echoed gravely   we ve got to have more than that to  start with       well  there s the six hundred dollars from the sale  six hundred and  twelve dollars it was       it isn t six hundred and twelve now   said george   it s about one  hundred and sixty      fanny showed a momentary dismay   why  how        i lent uncle george two hundred  i gave fifty apiece to old sam and  those two other old darkies that worked for grandfather so long  and ten  to each of the servants here        and you gave me thirty six   she said thoughtfully   for the first  month s rent  in advance       did i  i d forgotten  well  with about a hundred and sixty in bank and  our expenses a hundred a month  it doesn t seem as if this new place        still   she interrupted   we have paid the first month s rent in  advance  and it does seem to be the most practical       george rose   see here  aunt fanny   he said decisively   you stay here  and look after the moving  old frank doesn t expect me until afternoon   this first day  but i ll go and see him now      it was early  and old frank  just established at his big  flat topped  desk  was surprised when his prospective assistant and pupil walked  in  he was pleased  as well as surprised  however  and rose  offering  a cordial old hand   the real flare   he said   the real flare for the  law  that s right  couldn t wait till afternoon to begin  i m delighted  that you        i wanted to say    george began  but his patron cut him off      wait just a minute  my boy  i ve prepared a little speech of welcome   and even though you re five hours ahead of time  i mean to deliver  it  first of all  your grandfather was my old war comrade and my best  client  for years i prospered through my connection with his business   and his grandson is welcome in my office and to my best efforts in his  behalf  but i want to confess  georgie  that during your earlier youth i  may have had some slight feeling of  well  prejudice  not altogether in  your favour  but whatever slight feeling it was  it began to vanish on  that afternoon  a good while ago  when you stood up to your aunt amelia  amberson as you did in the major s library  and talked to her as a man  and a gentleman should  i saw then what good stuff was in you  and i  always wanted to mention it  if my prejudice hadn t altogether vanished  after that  the last vestiges disappeared during these trying times that  have come upon you this past year  when i have been a witness to the  depth of feeling you ve shown and your quiet consideration for your  grandfather and for everyone else around you  i just want to add that i  think you ll find an honest pleasure now in industry and frugality  that wouldn t have come to you in a more frivolous career  the law is a  jealous mistress and a stern mistress  but a       george had stood before him in great and increasing embarrassment  and  he was unable to allow the address to proceed to its conclusion      i can t do it   he burst out   i can t take her for my mistress       what       i ve come to tell you  i ve got to find something that s quicker  i  can t       old frank got a little red   let s sit down   he said   what s the  trouble      george told him     the old gentleman listened sympathetically  only murmuring   well   well   from time to time  and nodding acquiescence      you see she s set her mind on this apartment   george explained   she s  got some old cronies there  and i guess she s been looking forward to  the games of bridge and the kind of harmless gossip that goes on in such  places  really  it s a life she d like better than anything else  better  than that she s lived at home  i really believe  it struck me she s  just about got to have it  and after all she could hardly have anything  less       this comes pretty heavily upon me  you know   said old frank   i got  her into that headlight company  and she fooled me about her resources  as much as she did your uncle george  i was never your father s adviser   if you remember  and when the insurance was turned over to her some  other lawyer arranged it  probably your father s  but it comes pretty  heavily on me  and i feel a certain responsibility       not at all  i m taking the responsibility      and george smiled with one corner of his mouth   she s not your aunt   you know  sir       well  i m unable to see  even if she s yours  that a young man is  morally called upon to give up a career at the law to provide his aunt  with a favourable opportunity to play bridge whist       no   george agreed   but i haven t begun my  career at the law  so it  can t be said i m making any considerable sacrifice  i ll tell you how  it is  sir   he flushed  and  looking out of the streaked and smoky  window beside which he was sitting  spoke with difficulty   i feel as  if  as if perhaps i had one or two pretty important things in my life  to make up for  well  i can t  i can t make them up to  to whom i  would  it s struck me that  as i couldn t  i might be a little decent  to somebody else  perhaps  if i could manage it  i never have been  particularly decent to poor old aunt fanny       oh  i don t know  i shouldn t say that  a little youthful teasing  i  doubt if she s minded so much  she felt your father s death  terrifically  of course  but it seems to me she s had a fairly  comfortable life up to now  if she was disposed to take it that way       but  up to now  is the important thing   george said   now is now  and  you see i can t wait two years to be admitted to the bar and begin to  practice  i ve got to start in at something else that pays from the  start  and that s what i ve come to you about  i have an idea  you see       well  i m glad of that   said old frank  smiling   i can t think of  anything just at this minute that pays from the start       i only know of one thing  myself       what is it      george flushed again  but managed to laugh at his own embarrassment   i  suppose i m about as ignorant of business as anybody in the world   he  said   but i ve heard they pay very high wages to people in dangerous  trades  i ve always heard they did  and i m sure it must be true  i mean  people that handle touchy chemicals or high explosives  men in dynamite  factories  or who take things of that sort about the country in wagons   and shoot oil wells  i thought i d see if you couldn t tell me something  more about it  or else introduce me to someone who could  and then i  thought i d see if i couldn t get something of the kind to do as soon as  possible  my nerves are good  i m muscular  and i ve got a steady hand   it seemed to me that this was about the only line of work in the world  that i m fitted for  i wanted to get started to day if i could      old frank gave him a long stare  at first this scrutiny was sharply  incredulous  then it was grave  finally it developed into a threat of  overwhelming laughter  a forked vein in his forehead became more visible  and his eyes seemed about to protrude     but he controlled his impulse  and  rising  took up his hat and  overcoat   all right   he said   if you ll promise not to get blown up   i ll go with you to see if we can find the job   then  meaning what he  said  but amazed that he did mean it  he added   you certainly are the  most practical young man i ever met            chapter xxxiii      they found the job  it needed an apprenticeship of only six weeks   during which period george was to receive fifteen dollars a week  after  that he would get twenty eight  this settled the apartment question  and  fanny was presently established in a greater contentment than she had  known for a long time  early every morning she made something she called   and believed to be  coffee for george  and he was gallant enough not  to undeceive her  she lunched alone in her  kitchenette   for george s  place of employment was ten miles out of town on an interurban  trolley line  and he seldom returned before seven  fanny found partners  for bridge by two o clock almost every afternoon  and she played until  about six  then she got george s  dinner clothes  out for him  he  maintained this habit  and she changed her own dress  when he arrived  he usually denied that he was tired  though he sometimes looked tired   particularly during the first few months  and he explained to her  frequently  looking bored enough with her insistence  that his work was   fairly light  and fairly congenial  too   fanny had the foggiest idea  of what it was  though she noticed that it roughened his hands and  stained them   something in those new chemical works   she explained to  casual inquirers  it was not more definite in her own mind     respect for george undoubtedly increased within her  however  and  she told him she d always had a feeling he might  turn out to be a  mechanical genius  or something   george assented with a nod  as the  easiest course open to him  he did not take a hand at bridge after  dinner  his provisions  for fanny s happiness refused to extend that  far  and at the table d hote he was a rather discouraging boarder  he  was considered  affected  and absurdly  up stage  by the one or two  young men  and the three or four young women  who enlivened the elderly  retreat  and was possibly less popular there than he had been elsewhere  during his life  though he was now nothing worse than a coldly polite  young man who kept to himself  after dinner he would escort his aunt  from the table in some state  not wholly unaccompanied by a leerish wink  or two from the wags of the place  and he would leave her at the door  of the communal parlours and card rooms  with a formality in his bow of  farewell which afforded an amusing contrast to fanny s always voluble  protests   she never failed to urge loudly that he really must come and  play  just this once  and not go hiding from everybody in his room every  evening like this   at least some of the other inhabitants found the  contrast amusing  for sometimes  as he departed stiffly toward the  elevator  leaving her still entreating in the doorway  though with one  eye already on her table  to see that it was not seized  a titter would  follow him which he was no doubt meant to hear  he did not care whether  they laughed or not     and once  as he passed the one or two young men of the place  entertaining the three or four young women  who were elbowing and  jerking on a settee in the lobby  he heard a voice inquiring quickly  as  he passed      what makes people tired       work       no       well  what s the answer      then  with an intentional outbreak of mirth  the answer was given by two  loudly whispering voices together      a stuck up boarder      george didn t care     on sunday mornings fanny went to church and george took long walks  he  explored the new city  and found it hideous  especially in the early  spring  before the leaves of the shade trees were out  then the town was  fagged with the long winter and blacked with the heavier smoke that had  been held close to the earth by the smoke fog it bred  every thing was  damply streaked with the soot  the walls of the houses  inside and out   the gray curtains at the windows  the windows themselves  the dirty  cement and unswept asphalt underfoot  the very sky overhead  throughout  this murky season he continued his explorations  never seeing a face he  knew  for  on sunday  those whom he remembered  or who might remember  him  were not apt to be found within the limits of the town  but were  congenially occupied with the new outdoor life which had come to be the  mode since his boyhood  he and fanny were pretty thoroughly buried away  within the bigness of the city     one of his sunday walks  that spring  he made into a sour pilgrimage   it was a misty morning of belated snow slush  and suited him to a  perfection of miserableness  as he stood before the great dripping  department store which now occupied the big plot of ground where once  had stood both the amberson hotel and the amberson opera house  from  there he drifted to the old  amberson block   but this was fallen into a  back water  business had stagnated here  the old structure had not  been replaced  but a cavernous entryway for trucks had been torn in its  front  and upon the cornice  where the old separate metal letters  had spelt  amberson block   there was a long billboard sign   doogan  storage      to spare himself nothing  he went out national avenue and saw the piles  of slush covered wreckage where the mansion and his mother s house had  been  and where the major s ill fated five  new  houses had stood  for  these were down  too  to make room for the great tenement already shaped  in unending lines of foundation  but the fountain of neptune was gone at  last  and george was glad that it was     he turned away from the devastated site  thinking bitterly that the  only amberson mark still left upon the town was the name of the  boulevard  amberson boulevard  but he had reckoned without the city  council of the new order  and by an unpleasant coincidence  while the  thought was still in his mind  his eye fell upon a metal oblong sign  upon the lamppost at the corner  there were two of these little signs  upon the lamp post  at an obtuse angle to each other  one to give  passers by the name of national avenue  the other to acquaint them with  amberson boulevard  but the one upon which should have been stenciled   amberson boulevard  exhibited the words  tenth street      george stared at it hard  then he walked quickly along the boulevard to  the next corner and looked at the little sign there   tenth street      it had begun to rain  but george stood unheeding  staring at the little  sign   damn them   he said finally  and  turning up his coat collar   plodded back through the soggy streets toward  home      the utilitarian impudence of the city authorities put a thought into his  mind  a week earlier he had happened to stroll into the large parlour  of the apartment house  finding it empty  and on the center table he  noticed a large  red bound  gilt edged book  newly printed  bearing  the title   a civic history   and beneath the title  the rubric    biographies of the     most prominent citizens and families in the  history of the city   he had glanced at it absently  merely noticing  the title and sub title  and wandered out of the room  thinking of other  things and feeling no curiosity about the book  but he had thought of  it several times since with a faint  vague uneasiness  and now when he  entered the lobby he walked directly into the parlour where he had seen  the book  the room was empty  as it always was on sunday mornings  and  the flamboyant volume was still upon the table  evidently a fixture as  a sort of local almanach de gotha  or burke  for the enlightenment of  tenants and boarders     he opened it  finding a few painful steel engravings of placid   chin bearded faces  some of which he remembered dimly  but much more  numerous  and also more unfamiliar to him  were the pictures of  neat  aggressive men  with clipped short hair and clipped short  moustaches  almost all of them strangers to him  he delayed not long  with these  but turned to the index where the names of the five hundred  most prominent citizens and families in the history of the city were  arranged in alphabetical order  and ran his finger down the column of  a s     abbett abbott abrams adam adams adler akers albertsmeyer alexander  allen ambrose ambuhl anderson andrews appenbasch archer arszman ashcraft  austin avey    george s eyes remained for some time fixed on the thin space between the  names  allen  and  ambrose   then he closed the book quietly  and went  up to his own room  agreeing with the elevator boy  on the way  that it  was getting to be a mighty nasty wet and windy day outside     the elevator boy noticed nothing unusual about him and neither did  fanny  when she came in from church with her hat ruined  an hour later   and yet something had happened  a thing which  years ago  had been the  eagerest hope of many  many good citizens of the town  they had thought  of it  longed for it  hoping acutely that they might live to see the  day when it would come to pass  and now it had happened at last  georgie  minafer had got his come upance     he had got it three times filled and running over  the city had rolled  over his heart  burying it under  as it rolled over the major s and  buried it under  the city had rolled over the ambersons and buried them  under to the last vestige  and it mattered little that george guessed  easily enough that most of the five hundred most prominent had paid  something substantial  to defray the cost of steel engraving  etc    the  five hundred had heaved the final shovelful of soot upon that heap  of obscurity wherein the ambersons were lost forever from sight and  history   quicksilver in a nest of cracks      georgie minafer had got his come upance  but the people who had so  longed for it were not there to see it  and they never knew it  those  who were still living had forgotten all about it and all about him           chapter xxxiv        there was one border section of the city which george never explored in  his sunday morning excursions  this was far out to the north where lay  the new elysian fields of the millionaires  though he once went as far  in that direction as the white house which lucy had so admired long  ago  her  beautiful house   george looked at it briefly and turned back   rumbling with an interior laugh of some grimness  the house was white no  longer  nothing could be white which the town had reached  and the town  reached far beyond the beautiful white house now  the owners had given  up and painted it a despairing chocolate  suitable to the freight yard  life it was called upon to endure     george did not again risk going even so far as that  in the direction  of the millionaires  although their settlement began at least two miles  farther out  his thought of lucy and her father was more a sensation  than a thought  and may be compared to that of a convicted cashier beset  by recollections of the bank he had pillaged  there are some thoughts to  which one closes the mind  george had seen eugene only once since their  calamitous encounter  they had passed on opposite sides of the street   downtown  each had been aware of the other  and each had been aware that  the other was aware of him  and yet each kept his eyes straight forward   and neither had shown a perceptible alteration of countenance  it seemed  to george that he felt emanating from the outwardly imperturbable person  of his mother s old friend a hate that was like a hot wind     at his mother s funeral and at the major s he had been conscious that  eugene was there  though he had afterward no recollection of seeing him   and  while certain of his presence  was uncertain how he knew of it   fanny had not told him  for she understood george well enough not to  speak to him of eugene or lucy  nowadays fanny almost never saw either  of them and seldom thought of them  so sly is the way of time with life   she was passing middle age  when old intensities and longings grow thin  and flatten out  as fanny herself was thinning and flattening out  and  she was settling down contentedly to her apartment house intimacies   she was precisely suited by the table d hote life  with its bridge   its variable alliances and shifting feuds  and the long whisperings  of elderly ladies at corridor corners  those eager but suppressed  conversations  all sibilance  of which the elevator boy declared he  heard the words  she said  a million times and the word  she   five  million  the apartment house suited fanny and swallowed her     the city was so big  now  that people disappeared into it unnoticed  and  the disappearance of fanny and her nephew was not exceptional  people no  longer knew their neighbours as a matter of course  one lived for years  next door to strangers  that sharpest of all the changes since the old  days  and a friend would lose sight of a friend for a year  and not know  it     one may day george thought he had a glimpse of lucy  he was not certain   but he was sufficiently disturbed  in spite of his uncertainty  a  promotion in his work now frequently took him out of town for a week   or longer  and it was upon his return from one of these absences that he  had the strange experience  he had walked home from the station  and as  he turned the corner which brought him in sight of the apartment house  entrance  though two blocks distant from it  he saw a charming little  figure come out  get into a shiny landaulet automobile  and drive away   even at that distance no one could have any doubt that the little figure  was charming  and the height  the quickness and decision of motion   even the swift gesture of a white glove toward the chauffeur  all were  characteristic of lucy  george was instantly subjected to a shock of  indefinable nature  yet definitely a shock  he did not know what he  felt  but he knew that he felt  heat surged over him  probably he  would not have come face to face with her if the restoration of all the  ancient amberson magnificence could have been his reward  he went on  slowly  his knees shaky     but he found fanny not at home  she had been out all afternoon  and  there was no record of any caller  and he began to wonder  then to doubt  if the small lady he had seen in the distance was lucy  it might as well  have been  he said to himself  since any one who looked like her could  give him  a jolt like that      lucy had not left a card  she never left one when she called on fanny   though she did not give her reasons a quite definite form in her own  mind  she came seldom  this was but the third time that year  and   when she did come  george was not mentioned either by her hostess or by  herself  an oddity contrived between the two ladies without either of  them realizing how odd it was  for  naturally  while fanny was with  lucy  fanny thought of george  and what time lucy had george s  aunt before her eyes she could not well avoid the thought of him   consequently  both looked absent minded as they talked  and each often  gave a wrong answer which the other consistently failed to notice     at other times lucy s thoughts of george were anything but continuous   and weeks went by when he was not consciously in her mind at all  her  life was a busy one  she had the big house  to keep up   she had a  garden to keep up  too  a large and beautiful garden  she represented  her father as a director for half a dozen public charity organizations   and did private charity work of her own  being a proxy mother of several  large families  and she had  danced down   as she said  groups from  eight or nine classes of new graduates returned from the universities   without marrying any of them  but she still danced  and still did not  marry     her father  observing this circumstance happily  yet with some  hypocritical concern  spoke of it to her one day as they stood in her  garden   i suppose i d want to shoot him   he said  with attempted  lightness   but i mustn t be an old pig  i d build you a beautiful house  close by  just over yonder       no  no  that would be like    she began impulsively  then checked  herself  george amberson s comparison of the georgian house to the  amberson mansion had come into her mind  and she thought that another  new house  built close by for her  would be like the house the major  built for isabel      like what       nothing   she looked serious  and when he reverted to his idea of  some  day  grudgingly surrendering her up to a suitor  she invented a legend    did you ever hear the indian name for that little grove of beech trees  on the other side of the house   she asked him      no  and you never did either   he laughed      don t be so sure  i read a great deal more than i used to  getting  ready for my bookish days when i ll have to do something solid in the  evenings and won t be asked to dance any more  even by the very youngest  boys who think it s a sporting event to dance with the oldest of the   older girls   the name of the grove was  loma nashah  and it means   they couldn t help it        doesn t sound like it       indian names don t  there was a bad indian chief lived in the grove  before the white settlers came  he was the worst indian that  ever lived  and his name was  it was  vendonah   that means   rides down everything        what       his name was vendonah  the same thing as rides down everything       i see   said eugene thoughtfully  he gave her a quick look and then  fixed his eyes upon the end of the garden path   go on       vendonah was an unspeakable case   lucy continued   he was so proud  that he wore iron shoes and he walked over people s faces with them   he was always killing people that way  and so at last the tribe decided  that it wasn t a good enough excuse for him that he was young and  inexperienced  he d have to go  they took him down to the river  and put  him in a canoe  and pushed him out from shore  and then they ran along  the bank and wouldn t let him land  until at last the current carried  the canoe out into the middle  and then on down to the ocean  and he  never got back  they didn t want him back  of course  and if he d been  able to manage it  they d have put him in another canoe and shoved him  out into the river again  but still  they didn t elect another chief in  his place  other tribes thought that was curious  and wondered about  it a lot  but finally they came to the conclusion that the beech grove  people were afraid a new chief might turn out to be a bad indian  too   and wear iron shoes like vendonah  but they were wrong  because the real  reason was that the tribe had led such an exciting life under vendonah  that they couldn t settle down to anything tamer  he was awful  but he  always kept things happening  terrible things  of course  they hated  him  but they weren t able to discover any other warrior that they  wanted to make chief in his place  i suppose it was a little like  drinking a glass of too strong wine and then trying to take the taste  out of your mouth with barley water  they couldn t help feeling that  way       i see   said eugene   so that s why they named the place   they couldn t help it        it must have been       and so you re going to stay here in your garden   he said musingly    you think it s better to keep on walking these sunshiny gravel paths  between your flower beds  and growing to look like a pensive garden lady  in a victorian engraving       i suppose i m like the tribe that lived here  papa  i had too much  unpleasant excitement  it was unpleasant  but it was excitement  i don t  want any more  in fact  i don t want anything but you       you don t   he looked at her keenly  and she laughed and shook her  head  but he seemed perplexed  rather doubtful   what was the name of  the grove   he asked   the indian name  i mean       mola haha       no  it wasn t  that wasn t the name you said       i ve forgotten       i see you have   he said  his look of perplexity remaining   perhaps  you remember the chief s name better      she shook her head again   i don t      at this he laughed  but not very heartily  and walked slowly to the  house  leaving her bending over a rose bush  and a shade more pensive  than the most pensive garden lady in any victorian engraving         next day  it happened that this same  vendonah  or   rides down everything  became the subject of a chance conversation  between eugene and his old friend kinney  father of the fire topped  fred  the two gentlemen found themselves smoking in neighbouring leather  chairs beside a broad window at the club  after lunch     mr  kinney had remarked that he expected to get his family established  at the seashore by the fourth of july  and  following a train of  thought  he paused and chuckled   fourth of july reminds me   he said    have you heard what that georgie minafer is doing       no  i haven t   said eugene  and his friend failed to notice the  crispness of the utterance      well  sir   kinney chuckled again   it beats the devil  my boy fred  told me about it yesterday  he s a friend of this young henry akers  son  of f  p  akers of the akers chemical company  it seems this young akers  asked fred if he knew a fellow named minafer  because he knew fred had  always lived here  and young akers had heard some way that minafer used  to be an old family name here  and was sort of curious about it  well   sir  you remember this young georgie sort of disappeared  after his  grandfather s death  and nobody seemed to know much what had become  of him  though i did hear  once or twice  that he was still around  somewhere  well  sir  he s working for the akers chemical company  out  at their plant on the thomasvile road      he paused  seeming to reserve something to be delivered only upon  inquiry  and eugene offered him the expected question  but only after a  cold glance through the nose glasses he had lately found it necessary to  adopt   what does he do      kinney laughed and slapped the arm of his chair      he s a nitroglycerin expert      he was gratified to see that eugene was surprised  if not  indeed  a  little startled      he s what       he s an expert on nitroglycerin  doesn t that beat the devil  yes   sir  young akers told fred that this george minafer had worked like  a houn  dog ever since he got started out at the works  they have  a special plant for nitroglycerin  way off from the main plant  o   course  in the woods somewhere  and george minafer s been working there   and lately they put him in charge of it  he oversees shooting oil wells   too  and shoots  em himself  sometimes  they aren t allowed to carry  it on the railroads  you know  have to team it  young akers says george  rides around over the bumpy roads  sitting on as much as three hundred  quarts of nitroglycerin  my lord  talk about romantic tumbles  if he  gets blown sky high some day he won t have a bigger drop  when he comes  down  than he s already had  don t it beat the devil  young akers said  he s got all the nerve there is in the world  well  he always did have  plenty of that  from the time he used to ride around here on his white  pony and fight all the irish boys in can town  with his long curls all  handy to be pulled out  akers says he gets a fair salary  and i should  think he ought to  seems to me i ve heard the average life in that  sort of work is somewhere around four years  and agents don t write any  insurance at all for nitroglycerin experts  hardly       no   said eugene   i suppose not      kinney rose to go   well  it s a pretty funny thing  pretty odd  i  mean  and i suppose it would be pass around the hat for old fanny  minafer if he blew up  fred told me that they re living in some  apartment house  and said georgie supports her  he was going to study  law  but couldn t earn enough that way to take care of fanny  so he gave  it up  fred s wife told him all this  says fanny doesn t do anything but  play bridge these days  got to playing too high for awhile and lost more  than she wanted to tell georgie about  and borrowed a little from old  frank bronson  paid him back  though  don t know how fred s wife heard  it  women do  hear the darndest things       they do   eugene agreed      i thought you d probably heard about it  thought most likely fred s  wife might have said something to your daughter  especially as they re  cousins       i think not       well  i m off to the store   said mr  kinney briskly  yet he lingered    i suppose we ll all have to club in and keep old fanny out of the  poorhouse if he does blow up  from all i hear it s usually only a  question of time  they say she hasn t got anything else to depend on       i suppose not       well  i wondered    kinney hesitated   i was wondering why you hadn t  thought of finding something around your works for him  they say he s  an all fired worker and he certainly does seem to have hid some decent  stuff in him under all his damfoolishness  and you used to be such a  tremendous friend of the family  i thought perhaps you  of course i know  he s a queer lot  i know        yes  i think he is   said eugene   no  i haven t anything to offer  him       i suppose not   kinney returned thoughtfully  as he went out   i don t  know that i would myself  well  we ll probably see his name in the  papers some day if he stays with that job      however  the nitroglycerin expert of whom they spoke did not get into  the papers as a consequence of being blown up  although his daily life  was certainly a continuous exposure to that risk  destiny has a constant  passion for the incongruous  and it was george s lot to manipulate  wholesale quantities of terrific and volatile explosives in safety  and  to be laid low by an accident so commonplace and inconsequent that it  was a comedy  fate had reserved for him the final insult of riding him  down under the wheels of one of those juggernauts at which he had once  shouted  git a hoss   nevertheless  fate s ironic choice for georgie s  undoing was not a big and swift and momentous car  such as eugene  manufactured  it was a specimen of the hustling little type that was  flooding the country  the cheapest  commonest  hardiest little car ever  made     the accident took place upon a sunday morning  on a downtown crossing   with the streets almost empty  and no reason in the world for such a  thing to happen  he had gone out for his sunday morning walk  and he was  thinking of an automobile at the very moment when the little car struck  him  he was thinking of a shiny landaulet and a charming figure stepping  into it  and of the quick gesture of a white glove toward the chauffeur   motioning him to go on  george heard a shout but did not look up  for he  could not imagine anybody s shouting at him  and he was too engrossed  in the question  was it lucy   he could not decide  and his lack of  decision in this matter probably superinduced a lack of decision in  another  more pressingly vital  at the second and louder shout he did  look up  and the car was almost on him  but he could not make up his  mind if the charming little figure he had seen was lucy s and he could  not make up his mind whether to go backward or forward  these questions  became entangled in his mind  then  still not being able to decide which  of two ways to go  he tried to go both  and the little car ran him down   it was not moving very rapidly  but it went all the way over george     he was conscious of gigantic violence  of roaring and jolting and  concussion  of choking clouds of dust  shot with lightning  about his  head  he heard snapping sounds as loud as shots from a small pistol  and  was stabbed by excruciating pains in his legs  then he became aware  that the machine was being lifted off of him  people were gathering in a  circle round him  gabbling     his forehead was bedewed with the sweat of anguish  and he tried to wipe  off this dampness  but failed  he could not get his arm that far      nev  mind   a policeman said  and george could see above his eyes the  skirts of the blue coat  covered with dust and sunshine   amb lance be  here in a minute  nev  mind tryin  to move any  you want  em to send for  some special doctor       no   george s lips formed the word      or to take you to some private hospital       tell them to take me   he said faintly   to the city hospital       a  right      a smallish young man in a duster fidgeted among the crowd  explaining  and protesting  and a strident voiced girl  his companion  supported his  argument  declaring to everyone her willingness to offer testimony in  any court of law that every blessed word he said was the god s truth      it s the fella that hit you   the policeman said  looking down on  george   i guess he s right  you must of been thinkin  about somep m   or other  it s wunnerful the damage them little machines can do  you d  never think it  but i guess they ain t much case ag in this fella that  was drivin  it       you bet your life they ain t no case on me   the young man in the  duster agreed  with great bitterness  he came and stood at george s  feet  addressing him heatedly   i m sorry fer you all right  and i don t  say i ain t  i hold nothin  against you  but it wasn t any more my fault  than the statehouse  you run into me  much as i run into you  and if you  get well you ain t goin  to get not one single cent out o  me  this lady  here was settin  with me and we both yelled at you  wasn t goin  a step  over eight mile an hour  i m perfectly willing to say i m sorry for you  though  and so s the lady with me  we re both willing to say that much   but that s all  understand      george s drawn eyelids twitched  his misted glance rested fleetingly  upon the two protesting motorists  and the old imperious spirit within  him flickered up in a single word  lying on his back in the middle of  the street  where he was regarded as an increasing public as an unpleasant  curiosity  he spoke this word clearly from a mouth filled with dust  and  from lips smeared with blood     it was a word which interested the policeman  when the ambulance clanged  away  he turned to a fellow patrolman who had joined him   funny what  he says to the little cuss that done the damage  that s all he did call  him   nothin  else at all  and the cuss had broke both his legs fer him  and god knows what all       i wasn t here then  what was it       riffraff            chapter xxxv        eugene s feeling about george had not been altered by his talk with  kinney in the club window  though he was somewhat disturbed  he was not  disturbed by kinney s hint that fanny minafer might be left on the hands  of her friends through her nephew s present dealings with nitroglycerin   but he was surprised that kinney had  led up  with intentional tact to  the suggestion that a position might be made for george in the morgan  factory  eugene did not care to have any suggestions about georgie  minafer made to him  kinney had represented georgie as a new georgie  at  least in spots  a georgie who was proving that decent stuff had been  hid in him  in fact  a georgie who was doing rather a handsome thing  in taking a risky job for the sake of his aunt  poor old silly fanny  minafer  eugene didn t care what risks georgie took  or how much decent  stuff he had in him  nothing that georgie would ever do in this world or  the next could change eugene morgan s feeling toward him     if eugene could possibly have brought himself to offer georgie a  position in the automobile business  he knew full well the proud devil  wouldn t have taken it from him  though georgie s proud reason would not  have been the one attributed to him by eugene  george would never  reach the point where he could accept anything material from eugene and  preserve the self respect he had begun to regain     but if eugene had wished  he could easily have taken george out of  the nitroglycerin branch of the chemical works  always interested  in apparent impossibilities of invention  eugene had encouraged many  experiments in such gropings as those for the discovery of substitutes  for gasoline and rubber  and  though his mood had withheld the  information from kinney  he had recently bought from the elder akers a  substantial quantity of stock on the condition that the chemical company  should establish an experimental laboratory  he intended to buy more   akers was anxious to please him  and a word from eugene would have  placed george almost anywhere in the chemical works  george need never  have known it  for eugene s purchases of stock were always quiet ones   the transaction remained  so far  between him and akers  and could be  kept between them     the possibility just edged itself into eugene s mind  that is  he let it  become part of his perceptions long enough for it to prove to him that  it was actually a possibility  then he half started with disgust that he  should be even idly considering such a thing over his last cigar for  the night  in his library   no   and he threw the cigar into the empty  fireplace and went to bed     his bitterness for himself might have worn away  but never his  bitterness for isabel  he took that thought to bed with him  and it was  true that nothing george could do would ever change this bitterness of  eugene  only george s mother could have changed it     and as eugene fell asleep that night  thinking thus bitterly of georgie   georgie in the hospital was thinking of eugene  he had come  out of  ether  with no great nausea  and had fallen into a reverie  though now  and then a white sailboat staggered foolishly into the small ward where  he lay  after a time he discovered that this happened only when he tried  to open his eyes and look about him  so he kept his eyes shut  and his  thoughts were clearer     he thought of eugene morgan and of the major  they seemed to be the  same person for awhile  but he managed to disentangle them and even to  understand why he had confused them  long ago his grandfather had been  the most striking figure of success in the town   as rich as major  amberson   they used to say  now it was eugene   if i had eugene  morgan s money   he would hear the workmen day dreaming at the chemical  works  or   if eugene morgan had hold of this place you d see things  hum   and the boarders at the table d hote spoke of  the morgan place   as an eighteenth century frenchman spoke of versailles  like his uncle   george had perceived that the  morgan place  was the new amberson  mansion  his reverie went back to the palatial days of the mansion  in  his boyhood  when he would gallop his pony up the driveway and order  the darkey stable men about  while they whooped and obeyed  and his  grandfather  observing from a window  would laugh and call out to him    that s right  georgie  make those lazy rascals jump   he remembered his  gay young uncles  and how the town was eager concerning everything about  them  and about himself  what a clean  pretty town it had been  and in  his reverie be saw like a pageant before him the magnificence of the  ambersons  its passing  and the passing of the ambersons themselves   they had been slowly engulfed without knowing how to prevent it  and  almost without knowing what was happening to them  the family lot  in  the shabby older quarter  out at the cemetery  held most of them now   and the name was swept altogether from the new city  but the new  great people who had taken their places  the morgans and akerses and  sheridans  they would go  too  george saw that  they would pass  as the  ambersons had passed  and though some of them might do better than  the major and leave the letters that spelled a name on a hospital or a  street  it would be only a word and it would not stay forever  nothing  stays or holds or keeps where there is growth  he somehow perceived  vaguely but truly  great caesar dead and turned to clay stopped no hole  to keep the wind away  dead caesar was nothing but a tiresome bit of  print in a book that schoolboys study for awhile and then forget  the  ambersons had passed  and the new people would pass  and the new people  that came after them  and then the next new ones  and the next  and the  next      he had begun to murmur  and the man on duty as night nurse for the ward  came and bent over him      did you want something       there s nothing in this family business   george told him  confidentially   even george washington is only something in a book      eugene read a report of the accident in the next morning s paper  he was  on the train  having just left for new york  on business  and with less  leisure would probably have overlooked the obscure item     legs broken    g  a  minafer  an employee of the akers chemical co   was run down by  an automobile yesterday at the corner of tennessee and main and had  both legs broken  minafer was to blame for the accident according to  patrolman f  a  kax  who witnessed the affair  the automobile was a  small one driven by herbert cottleman of      noble avenue who stated  that he was making less than   miles an hour  minafer is said to belong  to a family formerly of considerable prominence in the city  he was  taken to the city hospital where physicians stated later that he was  suffering from internal injuries besides the fracture of his legs but  might recover     eugene read the item twice  then tossed the paper upon the opposite  seat of his compartment  and sat looking out of the window  his feeling  toward georgie was changed not a jot by his human pity for georgie s  human pain and injury  he thought of georgie s tall and graceful figure   and he shivered  but his bitterness was untouched  he had never blamed  isabel for the weakness which had cost them the few years of happiness  they might have had together  he had put the blame all on the son  and  it stayed there     he began to think poignantly of isabel  he had seldom been able to  see   her more clearly than as he sat looking out of his compartment window   after reading the account of this accident  she might have been just on  the other side of the glass  looking in at him  and then he thought of  her as the pale figure of a woman  seen yet unseen  flying through the  air  beside the train  over the fields of springtime green and through  the woods that were just sprouting out their little leaves  he closed  his eyes and saw her as she had been long ago  he saw the brown eyed   brown haired  proud  gentle  laughing girl he had known when first he  came to town  a boy just out of the state college  he remembered  as he  had remembered ten thousand times before  the look she gave him when  her brother george introduced him to her at a picnic  it was  like hazel  starlight  he had written her  in a poem  afterward  he remembered  his first call at the amberson mansion  and what a great personage she  seemed  at home in that magnificence  and yet so gay and friendly  he  remembered the first time he had danced with her  and the old waltz song  began to beat in his ears and in his heart  they laughed and sang it  together as they danced to it      oh  love for a year  a week  a day  but alas for the love that lasts  always       most plainly of all he could see her dancing  and he became articulate  in the mourning whisper   so graceful  oh  so graceful       all the way to new york it seemed to him that isabel was near him  and  he wrote of her to lucy from his hotel the next night     i saw an account of the accident to george minafer  i m sorry  though  the paper states that it was plainly his own fault  i suppose it may  have been as a result of my attention falling upon the item that i  thought of his mother a great deal on the way here  it seemed to me that  i had never seen her more distinctly or so constantly  but  as you know   thinking of his mother is not very apt to make me admire him  of course   however  he has my best wishes for his recovery     he posted the letter  and by the morning s mail he received one from  lucy written a few hours after his departure from home  she enclosed the  item he had read on the train     i thought you might not see it     i have seen miss fanny and she has got him put into a room by himself   oh  poor rides down everything i have been thinking so constantly of his  mother and it seemed to me that i have never seen her more distinctly   how lovely she was  and how she loved him     if lucy had not written this letter eugene might not have done the odd  thing he did that day  nothing could have been more natural than that  both he and lucy should have thought intently of isabel after reading  the account of george s accident  but the fact that lucy s letter had  crossed his own made eugene begin to wonder if a phenomenon of telepathy  might not be in question  rather than a chance coincidence  the  reference to isabel in the two letters was almost identical  he and  lucy  it appeared  had been thinking of isabel at the same time  both  said  constantly  thinking of her  and neither had ever  seen her more  distinctly   he remembered these phrases in his own letter accurately     reflection upon the circumstance stirred a queer spot in eugene s  brain  he had one  he was an adventurer  if he had lived in the  sixteenth century he would have sailed the unknown new seas  but having  been born in the latter part of the nineteenth  when geography was a  fairly well settled matter  he had become an explorer in mechanics   but the fact that he was a  hard headed business man  as well as an  adventurer did not keep him from having a queer spot in his brain   because hard headed business men are as susceptible to such spots as  adventurers are  some of them are secretly troubled when they do not see  the new moon over the lucky shoulder  some of them have strange  secret  incredulities  they do not believe in geology  for instance  and some of  them think they have had supernatural experiences   of course there was  nothing in it  still it was queer   they say     two weeks after isabel s death  eugene had come to new york on urgent  business and found that the delayed arrival of a steamer gave him a  day with nothing to do  his room at the hotel had become intolerable   outdoors was intolerable  everything was intolerable  it seemed to him  that he must see isabel once more  hear her voice once more  that he  must find some way to her  or lose his mind  under this pressure he  had gone  with complete scepticism  to a  trance medium  of whom he had  heard wild accounts from the wife of a business acquaintance  he thought  despairingly that at least such an excursion would be  trying to do  something   he remembered the woman s name  found it in the telephone  book  and made an appointment     the experience had been grotesque  and he came away with an  encouraging message from his father  who had failed to identify himself  satisfactorily  but declared that everything was  on a higher plane   in his present state of being  and that all life was  continuous and  progressive   mrs  horner spoke of herself as a  psychic   but otherwise  she seemed oddly unpretentious and matter of fact  and eugene had  no doubt at all of her sincerity  he was sure that she was not an  intentional fraud  and though he departed in a state of annoyance with  himself  he came to the conclusion that if any credulity were played  upon by mrs  horner s exhibitions  it was her own     nevertheless  his queer spot having been stimulated to action by  the coincidence of the letters  he went to mrs  horner s after his  directors  meeting today  he used the telephone booth in the directors   room to make the appointment  and he laughed feebly at himself  and  wondered what the group of men in that mahogany apartment would think if  they knew what he was doing  mrs  horner had changed her address  but he  found the new one  and somebody purporting to be a niece of hers talked  to him and made an appointment for a  sitting  at five o clock  he was  prompt  and the niece  a dull faced fat girl with a magazine under her  arm  admitted him to mrs  horner s apartment  which smelt of camphor   and showed him into a room with gray painted walls  no rug on the floor  and no furniture except a table  with nothing on it  and two chairs  one  a leather easy chair and the other a stiff little brute with a wooden  seat  there was one window with the shade pulled down to the sill  but  the sun was bright outside  and the room had light enough     mrs  horner appeared in the doorway  a wan and unenterprising looking  woman in brown  with thin hair artificially waved  but not recently  and  parted in the middle over a bluish forehead  her eyes were small and  seemed weak  but she recognized the visitor      oh  you been here before   she said  in a thin voice  not unmusical   i  recollect you  quite a time ago  wa n t it       yes  quite a long time       i recollect because i recollect you was disappointed  anyway  you was  kind of cross   she laughed faintly      i m sorry if i seemed so   eugene said   do you happen to have found  out my name      she looked surprised and a little reproachful   why  no  i never try  to find out people s name  why should i  i don t claim anything for  the power  i only know i have it  and some ways it ain t always such a  blessing  neither  i can tell you      eugene did not press an investigation of her meaning  but said vaguely    i suppose not  shall we        all right   she assented  dropping into the leather chair  with her  back to the shaded window   you better set down  too  i reckon  i hope  you ll get something this time so you won t feel cross  but i dunno  i  can t never tell what they ll do  well       she sighed  closed her eyes  and was silent  while eugene  seated in  the stiff chair across the table from her  watched her profile  thought  himself an idiot  and called himself that and other names  and as the  silence continued  and the impassive woman in the easy chair remained  impassive  he began to wonder what had led him to be such a fool  it  became clear to him that the similarity of his letter and lucy s needed  no explanation involving telepathy  and was not even an extraordinary  coincidence  what  then  had brought him back to this absurd place and  caused him to be watching this absurd woman taking a nap in a chair   in brief  what the devil did he mean by it  he had not the slightest  interest in mrs  horner s naps  or in her teeth  which were being  slightly revealed by the unconscious parting of her lips  as her  breathing became heavier  if the vagaries of his own mind had brought  him into such a grotesquerie as this  into what did the vagaries of  other men s minds take them  confident that he was ordinarily saner than  most people  he perceived that since he was capable of doing a thing  like this  other men did even more idiotic things  in secret  and he  had a fleeting vision of sober looking bankers and manufacturers and  lawyers  well dressed church going men  sound citizens  and all as queer  as the deuce inside     how long was he going to sit here presiding over this unknown woman s  slumbers  it struck him that to make the picture complete he ought to be  shooing flies away from her with a palm leaf fan     mrs  horner s parted lips closed again abruptly  and became compressed   her shoulders moved a little  then jerked repeatedly  her small  chest heaved  she gasped  and the compressed lips relaxed to a  slight contortion  then began to move  whispering and bringing forth  indistinguishable mutterings     suddenly she spoke in a loud  husky voice      lopa is here       yes   eugene said dryly   that s what you said last time  i remember   lopa   she s your  control  i think you said       i m lopa   said the husky voice   i m lopa herself       you mean i m to suppose you re not mrs  horner now       never was mrs  horner   the voice declared  speaking undeniably from  mrs  horner s lips  but with such conviction that eugene  in spite of  everything  began to feel himself in the presence of a third party   who was none the less an individual  even though she might be another  edition of the apparently somnambulistic mrs  horner   never was mrs   horner or anybody but just lopa  guide       you mean you re mrs  horner s guide   he asked      your guide now   said the voice with emphasis  to which was  incongruously added a low laugh   you came here once before  lopa  remembers       yes  so did mrs  horner      lopa overlooked his implication  and continued  quickly   you build   build things that go  you came here once and old gentleman on this side   he spoke to you  same old gentleman here now  he tell lopa he s your  grandfather  no  he says  father   he s your father       what s his appearance       how       what does he look like       very fine  white beard  but not long beard  he says someone else wants  to speak to you  see here  lady  not his wife  though  no  very fine  lady  fine lady  fine lady       is it my sister   eugene asked      sister  no  she is shaking her head  she has pretty brown hair  she is  fond of you  she is someone who knows you very well but she is not your  sister  she is very anxious to say something to you  very anxious  very  fond of you  very anxious to talk to you  very glad you came here  oh   very  glad       what is her name       name   the voice repeated  and seemed to ruminate   name hard to  get  always very hard for lopa  name  she wants to tell me her name to  tell you  she wants you to understand names are hard to make  she says  you must think of something that makes a sound   here the voice seemed  to put a question to an invisible presence and to receive an answer   a  little sound or a big sound  she says it might be a little sound or a  big sound  she says a ring  oh  lopa knows  she means a bell  that s it   a bell      eugene looked grave   does she mean her name is belle       not quite  her name is longer       perhaps   he suggested   she means that she was a belle       no  she says she thinks you know what she means  she says you must  think of a colour  what colour   again lopa addressed the unknown  but  this time seemed to wait for an answer      perhaps she means the colour of her eyes   said eugene      no  she says her colour is light  it s a light colour and you can see  through it       amber   he said  and was startled  for mrs  horner  with her eyes still  closed  clapped her hands  and the voice cried out in delight      yes  she says you know who she is from amber  amber  amber  that s it   she says you understand what her name is from a bell and from amber  she  is laughing and waving a lace handkerchief at me because she is pleased   she says i have made you know who it is      this was the strangest moment of eugene s life  because  while it  lasted  he believed that isabel amberson  who was dead  had found means  to speak to him  though within ten minutes he doubted it  he believed it  then     his elbows pressed hard upon the table  and  his head between his hands   he leaned forward  staring at the commonplace figure in the easy chair    what does she wish to say to me       she is happy because you know her  no  she is troubled  oh  a great  trouble  something she wants to tell you  she wants so much to tell you   she wants lopa to tell you  this is a great trouble  she says  oh  yes   she wants you to be  to be kind  that s what she says  that s it  to be  kind       does she        she wants you to be kind   said the voice   she nods when i tell you  this  yes  it must be right  she is a very fine lady  very pretty   she is so anxious for you to understand  she hopes and hopes you will   someone else wants to speak to you  this is a man  he says        i don t want to speak to any one else   said eugene quickly   i want        this man who has come says that he is a friend of yours  he says       eugene struck the table with his fist   i don t want to speak to any  one else  i tell you   he cried passionately   if she is there i    he  caught his breath sharply  checked himself  and sat in amazement  could  his mind so easily accept so stupendous a thing as true  evidently it  could     mrs  horner spoke languidly in her own voice   did you get anything  satisfactory   she asked   i certainly hope it wasn t like that other  time when you was cross because they couldn t get anything for you       no  no   he said hastily   this was different it was very interesting      he paid her  went to his hotel  and thence to his train for home  never  did he so seem to move through a world of dream stuff  for he knew that  he was not more credulous than other men  and  if he could believe what  he had believed  though he had believed it for no longer than a moment  or two  what hold had he or any other human being on reality     his credulity vanished  or so he thought  with his recollection that it  was he  and not the alleged  lopa   who had suggested the word  amber    going over the mortifying  plain facts of his experience  he found that  mrs  horner  or the subdivision of mrs  horner known as  lopa   had told  him to think of a bell and of a colour  and that being furnished with  these scientific data  he had leaped to the conclusion that he spoke  with isabel amberson     for a moment he had believed that isabel was there  believed that she  was close to him  entreating him  entreating him  to be kind   but with  this recollection a strange agitation came upon him  after all  had  she not spoken to him  if his own unknown consciousness had told the   psychic s  unknown consciousness how to make the picture of the pretty  brown haired  brown eyed lady  hadn t the picture been a true one  and  hadn t the true isabel  oh  indeed her very soul   called to him out of  his own true memory of her     and as the train roared through the darkened evening he looked out  beyond his window  and saw her as he had seen her on his journey  a few  days ago  an ethereal figure flying beside the train  but now it  seemed to him that she kept her face toward his window with an infinite  wistfulness      to be kind   if it had been isabel  was that what she would have said   if she were anywhere  and could come to him through the invisible wall   what would be the first thing she would say to him     ah  well enough  and perhaps bitterly enough  he knew the answer to that  question   to be kind   to georgie     a red cap at the station  when he arrived  leaped for his bag   abandoning another which the pullman porter had handed him   yessuh   mist  morgan  yessuh  you  car waitin  front the station fer you  mist   morgan  suh      and people in the crowd about the gates turned to stare  as he passed  through  whispering   that s morgan      outside  the neat chauffeur stood at the door of the touring car like a  soldier in whip cord      i ll not go home now  harry   said eugene  when he had got in   drive  to the city hospital       yes  sir   the man returned   miss lucy s there  she said she expected  you d come there before you went home       she did       yes  sir      eugene stared   i suppose mr  minafer must be pretty bad   he said      yes  sir  i understand he s liable to get well  though  sir   he moved  his lever into high speed  and the car went through the heavy traffic  like some fast  faithful beast that knew its way about  and knew its  master s need of haste  eugene did not speak again until they reached  the hospital     fanny met him in the upper corridor  and took him to an open door     he stopped on the threshold  startled  for  from the waxen face on the  pillow  almost it seemed the eyes of isabel herself were looking at  him  never before had the resemblance between mother and son been so  strong  and eugene knew that now he had once seen it thus startlingly   he need divest himself of no bitterness  to be kind  to georgie     george was startled  too  he lifted a white hand in a queer gesture   half forbidding  half imploring  and then let his arm fall back upon the  coverlet   you must have thought my mother wanted you to come   he said    so that i could ask you to  to forgive me      but lucy  who sat beside him  lifted ineffable eyes from him to her  father  and shook her head   no  just to take his hand  gently      she was radiant     but for eugene another radiance filled the room  he knew that he had  been true at last to his true love  and that through him she had brought  her boy under shelter again  her eyes would look wistful no more     the end            ii  the golden quality   they passed through      iii  the messenger of fate   they seized the favourable moment       iv  the active hand   they

little books like this   they are especially valuable when so much of the author s own experience  forms a thread upon which are suspended jewels of thought and illustration  serviceable to those who would see and know the best things     i have found these characteristics in this small volume  and gladly  recommend it to all those who would become more familiar with what our  author calls  the key to that cabinet of character in which nature  conceals not only the motive power of every day life  but those latent  talents and energies that  through a knowledge of self  we can bring to  bear upon our lives   this book will help many who have small  opportunities in the form of time and money to expend in the use of  larger volumes     charles stewart given          introduction        the fable of jason and the golden fleece is known to old and young the  world around  to the latter  perhaps  no other simple narrative in  greek mythology is more fascinating  nor holds a more valuable lesson  if they will but seek to learn it  but especially to the boy or young  man of thoughtful mind does the glorious adventure appeal and make its  lessons obvious  by way of refreshing the memory of those who were once  familiar with the myth  but who  in the practical school of experience   have lost the chord of their adventure loving days  and also for those   perchance  who are not acquainted with the tale  a brief sketch will  here serve our purpose     in thessaly dwell a king and a queen with their two children  a boy and a  girl  the holy alliance between the two royal members of the household  becomes disrupted  and nephele  the good mother  appeals to mercury  the  messenger of the gods  to assist her in secretly placing the children out  of reach of their father  the king  mercury provides a ram with a golden  fleece  on which the boy and girl are placed  the shining creature springs  into the air  bearing its precious burden across the sea  unfortunately   the girl falls from the ram s back and is drowned  but the boy is landed  safely on the other shore in the kingdom of colchis  here he sacrifices  the ram to jupiter and presents the golden fleece to the king  who places  it in a consecrated grove under the care of a sleepless dragon     now jason is heir to the throne of aeson  ruler of another kingdom in  thessaly  from whence the royal children started on their adventurous  journey  years have passed  however  since this remarkable incident  and  jason  being now a young man and having been told the dramatic tale of  the golden fleece  begins to think what a glorious adventure it would be  to go in quest of the royal prize  forthwith he makes preparations for  the expedition  and with a band of other lusty young heroes starts on a  sea voyage toward the land of the colchian king  it is not without  difficulty  however  that they accomplish the voyage  for at the entrance  of the euxine sea they encounter two floating islands  veritable  mountains of rock  huge and shaggy  which  in their tossings and  heavings  at intervals come together  crushing and grinding to atoms any  object that might be caught between them   but   jason and his men seized  the favorable moment of the rebound  plied their oars with vigor and  passed through in safety       approaching the royal palace jason makes known his mission  whereupon  the king promises to relinquish the valuable possession if jason will  yoke to the plow two fire breathing bulls and sow the teeth of the  dragon  apprehending that by this means the king seeks to destroy him   jason pleads his cause to medea  the king s daughter  who furnishes him  a charm by which he can safely encounter the fiery breath of the beasts  and the armed men that will spring up in the furrow where the dragon s  teeth are sown     in his  age of fable   bullfinch gives us a graphic picture of the scene    at the time appointed the people assembled at the grove of mars  and the  king assumed his royal seat  while the multitude covered the hill sides   the brazen footed bulls rushed in  breathing fire from their nostrils that  burned up the herbage as they passed  the sound was like the roar of a  furnace  and the smoke like that of water upon quick lime  jason advanced  boldly to meet them  his friends  the chosen heroes of greece  trembled to  behold him  regardless of the burning breath  he soothed their rage with  his voice  patted their necks with fearless hand  and adroitly slipped  over them the yoke  and compelled them to drag the plow  the colchians  were amazed  the greeks shouted for joy  jason next proceeded to sow the  dragon s teeth and plow them in  and soon the crop of armed men sprang up   and  wonderful to relate  no sooner had they reached the surface than they  began to brandish their weapons and rush upon jason  the greeks trembled  for their hero  and even she who had provided him a way of safety and  taught him how to use it  medea herself  grew pale with fear  jason for a  time kept his assailants at bay with his sword and shield  till finding  their numbers overwhelming  he resorted to the charm which medea had  taught him  seized a stone and threw it in the midst of his foes  they  immediately turned their arms against one another  and soon there was not  one of the dragon s brood left alive      having complied with all the conditions set forth by the king  the victor  now turns with eager step toward the grove of mars  and seizing the golden  prize makes his way back to thessaly  rejoicing in his glorious success           i    the ruling element         jason and his men            what constitutes a state     not high raised battlements or labored mound       thick wall or moated gate     not cities proud with spires and turrets crowned       not bays and broad armed ports     where  laughing at the storm  rich navies ride       not starred and spangled courts     where low browed baseness wafts perfume to pride       no  men  high minded men      with powers as far above dull brutes endued       in forest  brake  or den     as beasts excel cold rocks and brambles rude         sir william jones           the young man      jason has just stepped over the threshold into the glory of a rich young  manhood  and he is careful to select for his expedition some of the  choicest heroes of greece  young  brave  and strong  it has ever been  thus  youth has always been synonymous with adventure  it is a condition  which seems inherent  nature instilling into the blood of her sons the  very spirit of discontent  of longing to push out from the commonplace  scenes of childhood into broader domains of experience     the very books which most fascinate the boy are those which deal in  thrilling tales of adventure  the wily and unscrupulous traffickers in  cheap literature have ever been awake to this fact  and their  highly colored productions have been flung from the vicious presses like  lava from pelee to pollute the minds of the young  why is it that   robinson crusoe  and stories of this character hold such a charm for  young people  lingering in their minds long after books of a profounder  type have been forgotten  it is the love of adventure  to what boy at  school does not the doleful history lesson assume a more brilliant aspect  when the adventures of columbus are taken up  his interest is awakened   his imagination inspired  and he is delighted  all because again that  chord in his nature has been struck  the love of adventure     perhaps no other single painting in the art galleries at the world s fair  of      attracted the attention of a greater number of people  nor  awakened in so many human breasts a feeling of such intense pathos as  thomas hovenden s painting on  breaking home ties   here we have it once  more  adventure  jason setting off on his journey in search for the golden  fleece of fame and fortune  the narrow path that so long has led him out  into the silent acres  the fields that so many years have responded to  his toil  he has forsaken  the dull routine has ceased to inspire  the  home circle has become too narrow for his expanding soul  he has caught a  glimpse of the glories of a new kingdom  and now he is going out to  realize them     the young man has always been the  ruling element  in every new departure   he has been the rock upon which the ages have been founded  in the words  of another   when the roll call which men have written is read  it will be  found that the young men have ruled the world  the oldest literatures have  this record  the patriarchs unfolded the careers of boys into the conquest  of old age  kingdom and empire rode upon the shoulders of young men  and  their voices of enthusiasm and hope have sounded through many a  black breasted midnight and trumpeted the dawn through skies of thickest  darkness  to causes that drooped they have come and added the raptures of  hope  to enterprises that were sickening and faint they have brought the  bounding power of new enthusiasm  to the dead they have brought life   everything from the foundation of the world has been crying for  young  blood   and the armies of the advance have gained the day at the arrival  of  recruits   whose hope and earnestness have never been defeated  age  and experience put themselves upon dying pillows made by young hands  into  young palms and upon young ears falls the meaning of all the past  and  thus god has written the natural dignity of the young man s life in the  eternal statute book of the universe    footnote  from  young men of  history   by dr  f w  gunsaulus      we have but to turn our gaze back over the centuries to find that it has  always been the young man who has embarked in the world s great  enterprises  if we turn the pages of religious history we shall find that  he has been potent there  for when the stream of hebrew destiny was to be  turned  a young man  joseph  who had been sold as a slave into egypt  was  selected to accomplish it  and later young saul of kish while roaming  through his father s fields was summoned to a throne  it was the young  shepherd boy  david  that was chosen  to keep the banner of israel in the  sky while the shadows hung black above the hills of judah   when the  gospel was to be borne to the gentiles the divine finger fell upon a young  tent maker of tarsus  fourteen centuries later a miner s son  martin  luther  won germany for the reformation  and john wesley  while yet a  student in college  started his mighty world famous movement  at fifteen  john de medici was a cardinal  and bossuet was known by his eloquence  at  sixteen pascal wrote a great work  ignatius loyola before he was thirty  began his pilgrimage  and soon afterward wrote his most famous books  at  twenty two savonarola was rousing the consciences of the florentines  and  at twenty five john huss was an enthusiastic champion of truth     but we see the young man standing before the footlights on the stage of  secular history  too  at twelve remenyi was making his violin tremulous  with melody  and caesar delivered an oration at rome  at thirteen henry m   stanley was a teacher  at fourteen demosthenes was known as an orator  at  fifteen robert burns was a great poet  rossini composed an opera  and  liszt was a wizard in music  at the age of sixteen victor hugo was known  throughout france  at seventeen mozart had made a name in germany  and  michael angelo was a rising star in italy  at eighteen marcus aurelius was  made a consul  at nineteen byron was the  amazing genius  of his time  at  twenty raphael had finished some of his most famous paintings  faraday was  attracting the attention of his country  and two years later was admitted  to the royal institution of great britain  at twenty one alexander the  great conquered the persians  beethoven was entrancing the world with his  music  and william wilberforce was in parliament  at twenty two william  pitt had entered parliament  while william of orange had received from  charles v command of an army  at twenty three

lecturer of science at the university of pisa  and mark antony was the   hero of rome   at twenty six sir isaac newton had made his greatest  discoveries  at twenty seven don john of austria had won lepanto  and  napoleon was commander in chief of the army of italy  at twenty eight  aeschylus was the peer of greek tragedy  at twenty nine maurice of saxony  the greatest statesman of the age  and at thirty frederick the great was  the most conspicuous character of his day  at the same age richelieu was  secretary of state  and cortez little older when he gazed on the  golden  cupolas  of mexico  these are a few of the splendid names that illumine  the pages of history across the sea     but the young man has been no less potent in the affairs of our own  nation  which has always been conspicuous for its production of truly  great men  the story is told that when one of england s great men was  visiting henry clay  and the two were riding over the country  the  distinguished guest inquired of his host   what do you raise on these  hills and in these beautiful valleys    men   was clay s reply  and the  english patriot declared that this was the greatest crop to enrich a  country  we boast that we have given the world a full quota of really  great young men  some of them like jason embarking on the sea of adventure  while the dew of extreme youth is still on their brow  if we wend our way  back through the grand procession of events of but a single century we  will find extreme youth marking out the lines of progress and directing  the course of the nation in politics  in literature and religion     we would see william prescott  a boy of twelve  diligently at work in the  boston athenaeum  or jonathan edwards at thirteen entering yale college   and while yet of a tender age shining in the horizon of american  literature  while the same age finds h  w  longfellow writing for the  portland  gazette   at fourteen john quincy adams was private secretary to  francis h  dana  american minister to russia  at fifteen benjamin franklin  was writing for the  new england courant   and at an early age became a  noted journalist  benjamin west at sixteen had painted  the death of  socrates   at seventeen george bancroft had won a degree in history   washington irving had gained distinction as a writer  at eighteen  alexander hamilton was famous as an orator  and one year later became a  lieutenant colonel under washington  at nineteen washington himself was a  major  nathan hale had distinguished himself in the revolution  bryant had  written

published a whole volume of his poems  at  twenty two charles sumner had attracted the attention of some of the  famous men of his day  william h  seward had entered upon a brilliant  political career

hale had found a place in the hearts and minds of the people  and  at twenty nine john jay  youngest member of the continental congress  was  chosen to draw up the address to the british nation     these illustrious ones  who before their thirtieth year had written their  names on the immortal banner of their country  are only a few which adorn  the pages of our early history  others of like purport might be added  indefinitely both from the early and the later life of our country  and  there has been no time when the young man played so important a role in  human affairs as he does to day in the dawn of the twentieth century   when the heart and the mind  philanthropy and literature  virtue and  truth  science and art  capital and labor are the principal factors in the  world s progress  to refer to but a single instance in this period of our  national life  there is no greater statesman and patriot than our beloved  president  theodore roosevelt   a young man to whom we are proud to point  as a true type of american greatness and american manhood  assuming  control of the nation at such a critical moment in her history  when so  many dangerous rocks lay in her course  tremendous  indeed  was the  responsibility thrust upon him  but by his inherent principle of rule  his  unquenchable patriotism  his indomitable purpose  and the imperiousness of  his will  founded on a rich scholarship and a broad policy  he has spelled  triumph out of difficulty  and his name will go down in twentieth century  history an example of illustrious young manhood     the young man is emphatically the  ruling element  in politics to day  it  is estimated that a sufficient number of young men come of age every four  years to control the issue of the presidential election  constituting  about one half of the present voting population  they hold far more than  the balance of political power  it was goethe who said that the destiny of  any nation at any given time depends on the opinions of the young men who  are under twenty five years of age  and william e  gladstone affirmed that  the sum of the characters of this element constitute the character and  strength of any country     and when we consider the young man in his relation to all the aspects of  life  civic  commercial  industrial  and social  we must recognize him as  the  ruling element   like jason  the young man of to day is the hero to  invade the empire of thought and action in quest of the fleece of gold        lives of great men all remind us     we can make our lives sublime     and departing leave behind us    footprints on the sands of time            ii    the golden quality     they passed through            to live content with small means     to seek elegance rather than

fleece of gold  the onward  progress of the race since our rude forefathers from the leaves of the  tree formed their clothes  and in the somber depths of the primeval forest  constructed their habitation  is due to an insatiable desire to possess  the coveted prize  hanging before man s gaze in the consecrated borders of  his existence  it has inspired him to greater usefulness  he has built  ships and traversed the seas  invented machines  reared cities  and  established laws  in science and art and literature he has vied with his  fellow man and given a mighty impulse to civilization  all for the fleece  of gold  success     the world worships at the shrine of success  it regards it as man s  greatest attribute  and whether we find it in secular affairs   substantiated by material grandeur  or in the mysterious realms of the  inner life characterized by the serene consciousness of truth  it must  ever be the goal of human aspiration     it is the thought of some day having their efforts crowned that causes men  hotly to pursue the phantom or the reality of their lives  this aspiration  keeps the torch of hope ablaze in the midnight darkness  and the spirits  buoyed under the noon day glare  while men forge on to the goal  the  surging throngs of a great city  the active hands and brains in the  bee hives of industry and the many places of business  the vast army of  seekers after knowledge in the schools and colleges throughout the land   the men of fame in the halls of congress molding the affairs of the  nation  the countless army tilling the fields under the open sky  the  legions in the dark caves of earth searching for treasure  all are seeking  to enter the golden gate of success     said mr  a  b  farquhar in a baccalaureate address to the students of  mcdonough college   success colors everything  it is the essence of all  excellencies  the latent power which compels the favor of fortune and  subjugates fate  the world worships success regardless of how acquired   makes it a standard for judging men  an indispensable credential for all  approval  if a man succeeds he is held to be wise  even though mediocre   if he fails  whatever his learning and intrinsic merit  little regard is  paid to him  success gilds and glorifies a multitude of blunders and  littlenesses  and people are thought merely to exist who do not keep  themselves on the road leading to it  in view of all this  it is no wonder  that we see all humanity looking earnestly toward success and moving with  eager step in search of it      success is essentially the accomplishment of one s desires and purposes   the realization of one s ideals  but this definition does not necessarily  imply a high state of being  as i sit by my window writing  the hoarse  cry of a rag man and the mournful strains of a hand organ come to my ears   that able bodied greek  who is so lavish with his  music   and the  rag man  who is buying what the other is distributing freely  both are in  quest of the same thing   success       alas  the world too often measures success by false standards  worships  the golden fleece  forgetting the high purpose it might be made to serve   so dazzled by means that ends become oblivious  the spirit of the age is  to pay homage to great riches  the finely attired custodian of a money bag  too often is regarded as an exponent of success  on this point we should  guard ourselves  first ascertaining if the gorgeous equipage is the   genuine fleece   or only a sham intended to deceive  a mansion on a  valuable corner lot does not constitute the  golden quality   nor does a  million dollars in bank epitomize its character  its language is not  spoken in the dialect of wall street or of wheat pits  gold  grain   stocks  and bonds and estates too often mean the perversion of those  qualities most valuable to human life  realty is not the prime issue of  life  but  reality   if that which a man gets in his pay envelope  however  lucrative that may be  constituted his only reward  his effort would be  miserably compensated     the man who has spent his life like a scaraboid beetle rolling up money   without due regard for the common virtues of life  has not left   footprints on the sands of time   but only a zigzag trail along the  highway over which he has journeyed  he has not achieved success in that  he has accumulated riches without a corresponding accumulation of   wealth   to seek a purely selfish and material success is to defeat the  very purpose of one s existence   life  liberty  and the pursuit of  happiness   in the very conquest for this baser type a man blights his  sensibilities  minifies his present enjoyment  and destroys his prospect  for a full measure of happiness by and by  with but one interest his  happiness is insecure  for when that fails or ceases to satisfy he has  nothing on which to rely  midas craves for gold  and when he gets it his  senses become as metallic as the object of his affection  therefore  if we  are of this type  simply seeking the golden fleece for what it will net us  in dollars and cents  we are not on the road leading to success  for  success does not consist in the acquisition of the material  so much as in  a mental discipline that seeks objectively to subordinate intrinsic value     we must confess  however  that the age in which we live is one of brick  and mortar  that materialism and not aestheticism reigns over us  the  book keeper s pen has usurped the office of the artist s brush and the  carpenter s chisel that of the sculptor  intrinsic worth and  dividend paying value holds sway  and even the gift horse is looked in the  mouth while the priceless motive that prompted its giving is forgotten     the commercial spirit which pervades the atmosphere of modern times is  disintegrating the sublimer side of human life  the gilded god of  materialism is lavishing its blessings in the realm of science and  invention and commercial enterprise  at the expense of aestheticism  till  to day there are thousands of artisans to every artist  we have an  abundance of stone masons  but few phidiases or angelos  hundreds of organ  grinders  but few beethovens or webers or bachs  a full quota of men  engrossed in the cold calculus of business  but a scarcity of homers or  dantes or virgils     speaking of this material aspect of our epoch and how it is likely to be  regarded in the future  when the paradise of ideal living is regained  a  modern writer says   will not the intense preoccupation of material  production  the hurry and strain of our cities  the draining of life into  one channel  at the expense of breadth  richness  and beauty  appear as  mad as the crusades  and perhaps of a lower type of madness  could  anything be more indicative of a slight but general insanity than the  aspect of the crowd on the streets of chicago   why is it that the poems  that have lived for centuries  and the masterpieces of the world s great  painters and sculptors are not being equaled in the dawn of the twentieth  century  the answer lies in the widespread devotion to realism instead of  idealism  the immortals have joined the mortals in search for the fleece  of gold  and wordsworth s oft quoted lines were never more applicable to  us than now       the world is too much with us  late and soon     getting and spending we lay waste our powers     all the capital in the universe does not stand for success unless there is  set over against it the wealth of soul which marcus aurelius  that great  apostle of plain living and high thinking  ever set forth as an antidote  to the treadmill grind of commercial life  shakespeare struck the keynote  of this lofty conception of life  and pronounced a never dying eulogy upon  the supreme dignity of character when he said        who steals my purse steals trash         but he that filches from me my good name    robs me of that which not enriches him     and makes me poor indeed      wealth of soul is incomparably better than all that can be obtained from  pomp and luxury  charlemagne is said to have worn in his crown a nail  taken from the cross on which the savior was crucified  he wore it among  the jewels of his diadem as a reminder that there existed a tenderer  relation in life than kingdoms and material splendor  thus in the crown of  our success  if we would make it truly great  we must place the sublimer  elements of our being  as the ivy softens the roughness of the mountain  side and the unsightly ruin  so will the aesthetic mellow and subdue the  intense commercialism with which we are surrounded  without this quality  our success becomes like the fabled apples on the brink of the dead  sea  fair without  but ashes within     if the avenue to success lay in one direction only  that of accumulating a  fortune  little incentive would be felt by those in the lower walks of  life  moreover  if it were possible for all men to become millionaires   the very organization of human society would become disrupted  for who  then would till the soil  run the factories  clean the streets  nature has  been wise in the distribution of her talents  anticipating the havoc of  endowing all mankind with equal powers  she established a wide diversity  in the range of human ability  to one she has given the gift of sagacity  to achieve success in the world of trade  to another mechanical skill to  create the ideals of inventive genius into reality  to another the highly  artistic sense  and withholding these higher attributes from still others   she has chosen to endow them with a wealth of muscular force that the  physical requirements of organized human effort might be made effective   so that any way we choose to look at this question we must concede that  temporal wealth does not constitute the broadest idea of success  nor is  capable in itself of producing it     even failure may be an element of a glorious success  the volcano that  pours its vengeance upon the fair plantation below  leaving wreck and ruin  in its path  bestows a wealth of sulphur which plays an important part in  the world of commerce  the same frost that kills the harvest of a season  also destroys the locust  preserving the harvests of a century  the death  of the cocoon is the production of the silk  and the failure of the  caterpillar the birth of the butterfly  if the boy newton had not failed  utterly on the farm  he would never have been started in college to become  the mighty man of science  the fall of rome meant the rise of the german  empire   all men   says frederick arnold   need through errors attain to  truth  through struggles to victory  through regrets to that sorrow which  is a very source of life  men must rise in an ever ascending scale  like  the ladder of st  augustine  by which men  through stepping stones of  their dead selves rise to higher things  or those steps of alciphron   which crumbled away into nothingness as fast as each foot fall left  them   thus our very failures we may overrule and convert into  stepping stones to success  lifted to a loftier sphere  to a nobler  experience  we are apt to receive greater benefit than though we escaped  disappointment and rejoiced in easy fruition     success does not consist in not encountering difficulties  but in  overcoming them  if jason is to have the golden fleece he must pass  between the dangerous rocks  he must encounter the dragon  yoke to the  plow the fire breathing bulls  and subdue a regiment of armed men  if  joseph had not been egypt s prisoner  he would never have been egypt s  governor  if millet had not passed through the valley of sorrow  he could  never have painted the  angelus   the restoration in england that gave  charles ii a throne  drove milton into absolute seclusion  and the last  twelve years of his life were passed in enforced isolation  but this  blind  deserted  broken hearted  but illustrious scholar and poet   conquered despair  triumphed over every misfortune  and gave to the world  those three great poems which have made his name immortal  even poverty   which has been a hardship to the individual  has proved a boon to himself  and to the cause of humanity  science teaches us that ordinary mud has in  it elements which  arranged according to the higher laws of nature   produce the opal  the sapphire  and the diamond  likewise does history  teach us that from the morass of poverty the commonest types of men have  passed from stage to stage through the refining processes of experience  till they have dazzled the world with their magnificence  whether it be a  slave like aesop  a beggar like homer  a peasant like raphael  or a  marble cutter like socrates  we see them at last wearing the diadem of a  brilliant success     in fact  the foremost in all nations and in all branches have  as a rule   risen from the ranks of the poor and lowly  shakespeare held horses for a  few pennies a night in front of a london theater  and later did menial  service back of the scenes  disraeli was an office boy  carlyle a  stone mason s attendant  and ben jonson was a bricklayer  morrison and  carey were shoemakers  franklin was a printer s apprentice  burns a  country plowman  stephenson a collier  faraday a bookbinder  arkwright a  barber  and sir humphrey davy a drug clerk  demosthenes was the son of a  cutler  verdi the son of a baker  blackstone the son of a draper  and  luther was the son of a miner  butler was a farmer  hugh miller a  stone cutter  abraham lincoln a rail splitter  and james garfield was a  canal boy  one half of the presidents of the united states were left  orphans at an early age  left to make their way through the world alone   history reveals clearly that it has been not the sons of the rich  but  the sons of poverty that have  compelled the favor of fortune and  subjugated fate      neither rank nor genius nor any other natural endowment forms the only  true basis of success  a right disposition  a desire and determination   founded on the sub structure of right purpose  to cope with the problems  that confront you  constitute the real basis of achievement  in short  the  only demands which success makes of you is that you act with the most of  yourself  bringing all your faculties to bear upon what you have to do   instilling your best effort into the infinite detail that goes to make up  the great finality of your life  to this end  the systematic development  of the whole man  body  mind  and soul  in such a manner as to bring you  into right relation with things as they are and ought to be  is the  paramount question     in fact  education is the only passport to success  i do not mean that  education that is restricted to institutions of learning  these  while  possessing a decided advantage  by no means have a monopoly of learning   genius finds opportunity in the great laboratories of nature  every man  has within himself an educational organization presided over by a full  faculty  and nature s wonderful book is ever open to him  if only he will  lay hold upon the lessons it would teach him  this type of education which  is the drawing out toward all things the latent forces from within  and  the broadening out for greater usefulness  means the acquisition of  ability to meet every emergency and the establishment of high ideals     moreover  in the race for success  the proper nourishment of the brain is  an essential part of self development  the brain is substantially the  great artist that creates our ideals in life  and yet we forget sometimes  that it is the master of our destiny  and allow it to sink into that dull  apathy so fatal to our hopes and aims  it would almost seem  indeed  as if  a kind of fatality clung to some men in the way in which they neglect this  supreme faculty of their being  you possess the power to use your brain as  you choose  but not the right  morally  for society demands of you a high  standard of thinking  since it is the only rational basis for a free  government  thus it is as much your duty properly to nourish your brain as  to give proper care to the body     in the rigid economy of modern life we should use extreme care in the  selection of our reading  our best interests demand more of us than a  gormandizing of newspapers or ephemeral reading of any kind  far be it  from me to disparage that great organ of the times  the newspaper  which  is a source of keen delight and benefit to us all  and almost the only  source of instruction to thousands of the race  but we should be judicious  in this  and not allow transitional matter to monopolize our time   read  not the times  read the eternities   cried thoreau  the shelves of our  home and public libraries are filled with priceless volumes yet unread by  us  and he who is not cultivating a taste for good wholesome reading is  missing one of the highest enjoyments of life as well as minimizing his  chances for success  we should ever be exploring new regions of thought   and in the extreme activity of this electric age we shall be obliged to  take snap shots at our reading  on the street car  in the lunch room   anywhere we find it possible to peruse a single page     if we look into the lives of some of the illustrious ones we shall find  that they obtained knowledge under the greatest disadvantages  we see  lincoln reading his favorite volumes by the dim light of a pineknot blaze   or burritt poring over his books at the forge  or garfield gazing intently  at the pages while riding a mule on the banks of a canal  wesley likewise  diligently searched the scriptures while riding horseback over the  country  william cobbett learned grammar while a common soldier on the  march  and we are told that alexander the great  each night on retiring   would place his favorite book  the  iliad   under his pillow and during  his waking moments would peruse its pages     but the high intellectual plane of present day civilization demands more  of us than the world demanded then  when the avenues to honor and to power  lay over fields of conquest  and the passport to favor was the sword  the  complex problems of today call for a more thorough cultivation of our  mental powers  which  to bring into play upon the multifarious concerns of  our life  is the object of broad education  a well cultivated mind makes a  man monarch of all that he surveys  and no one can be said to be truly  successful who has not invaded the empire of thought in search for the  imperishable fleece of gold     success  then  in the highest sense  is a full realization of the highest  wealth of body  mind  and soul  and while it does not disparage material  aggrandizement  it makes it subservient  ever looking to an equalization  of the greater revenues of life  like truth it consists in a right  proportion of things  and like character  is inherent in the nature of the  individual  success must embrace all the cardinal virtues  it must arise  from the harmonious and fullest use of all the faculties  in its essence   it is the aggregate of those things which we have acquired  and which we  are putting to a wise and useful purpose  the way of life is strewn with  those who have done fairly well  excellence is the golden quality to seek   success  like a commodity  has its price  and he who would have it must be  willing to pay  you can not buy it on a bargain counter  it is a staple  product and demands full value  the sublimest qualities of your being        in the lexicon of youth  which fate reserves for a bright manhood     there is no such words as  fail            iii    the messenger of fate     they seized the favorable moment              take all reasonable advantage of that which the present may offer    you     it is the only time which is ours  yesterday is buried    forever  and to morrow we may never see         victor hugo         master of human destinies am i     fame  love  and fortune on my footsteps wait     cities and fields i walk  i penetrate    deserts and seas remote  and passing by    hovel and mart and palace  soon or late    i knock unbidden once at every gate     if sleeping wake  if feasting  rise before    i turn away  it is the hour of fate     and they who follow me reach every state    mortals desire and conquer every foe    save death  but those who doubt or hesitate     condemned to failure  penury  and woe     seek me in vain and uselessly implore     i answer not and i return no more         john j  ingalls           opportunity    the famous statue   take time by the forelock   was a masterpiece of  greek sculpture  a noted athenian orator  callistratus  has given us a  picture of the work of art   opportunity was a boy in the flower of his  youth  handsome in mien  his hair fluttering at the caprice of the wind   leaving his locks disheveled  like dionysius  his forehead shone with  grace  and his cheeks glowed with splendor  with winged feet to indicate  swiftness  he stood upon a sphere  resting upon the tips of his toes as  if ready for flight  his hair fell in thick curls from his brow  easy to  take hold upon  but upon the back of his head there were only the  beginnings of hairy growths  and  when he had once passed  it was not  possible to seize him      an ancient legend gives us a more vivid idea of the significance of  the statue      who art thou       time  the all subduer       why standest thou on tiptoe       i speed ever       why hast thou double wings on each foot       i fly with the wind       but why is thy hair over thine eye       to be grasped by him who meets me       the back of thy head  why is it bald       when once i have rushed by  with winged feet  one can never grasp me  from behind      in its literal significance  however  opportunity means something either   in front of the door  or  outside of the harbor   for when the word first  crept into common speech it created two pictures   that of a ship with  sails unfurled  riding at anchor  ready to start upon her unknown voyage   with just a moment to spare to catch her before the sails are bent  or the  picture of a veiled figure standing for an instant at the door of one s  life  knocking with sharp  swift strokes and then  if no answer comes   passing away into the darkness  refusing to be recalled     in all the vocabulary of human speech no other word rings with truer  eloquence  or speaks with greater triumph  than that one  word   opportunity  born in the primeval forest of man s first  dwelling place  it has marked the central path of civilization and hewn  its way to the front with unerring stroke  the finger of destiny ever  points back to this factor in human life as the primal element in all  achievement  the forerunner of all success  without it human genius  would die  man s talent and skill waste away  and the hope of the race  would vanish     opportunity is the good angel that reveals the true issues of life   unfolding the bud of possibility into the full blown flower of progress   it is the remorseless foe of sleepy monotony  awakening the passions in  the soul  rousing our powers to action  at the door of your life and mine  comes this silent  veiled figure  its hands laden with wealth  knocking  for admission  but  alas  it has been too often with us as george eliot  with such tragic pathos has put it   the golden moments in the stream of  life rush past us and we see nothing but sand  the angels come to visit us  and we know them only when they are gone      there has been no period of time since god whirled out of chaos this  universe of wonders whose every moment did not hold for some one   somewhere  some kind of opportunity  man is the only creature under heaven  that has been privileged to walk with his face skyward to gaze upon the  stars  to behold the opportunities of life as they surge along his  pathway  in her wisdom  nature has given our eyes the power of both the  telescope and the microscope  that we may see our opportunities afar and  rightly discern them when they come within our reach     do not regard your opportunities as mere visages floating in the horizon  of your life  or autumn leaves driven by the winds of chance across your  path  every opportunity far from being a thing of chance  is a product of  definite causes  opportunity is unrealized possibility supplemented by  conditions favorable for the execution of a purpose  and the power lies  within you to create circumstances  that skillful artist  the human brain   draws a mental picture  an idea  the judgment approves  the will renders  a decision to create that idea into actual being  in other words  gives it  a soul  and then we have opportunity made real by the process of a  creative force     we are apt to regard this quality in our existence as a somewhat  superhuman term  an abstraction beyond the realm of common life  or at  most an asset within the reach of a favored few  whereas it is a common  attribute playing a potential part in our every day activities  in its  very nature opportunity is democratic and goes  like a wayfarer  knocking  at the gates of every man s life     this messenger of fate  however  will not knock at the door of that man  who is unable to meet the demands it would make upon him  it ever  recognizes the eternal fitness of things  since it looks to its own  promotion as well as the promotion of him who seeks to embrace it   opportunity  then  is not opportunity at all if a man is not equal to it   when the steam engine lay in its elementary state in the great laboratory  of nature  it was an opportunity for james watt  and by his accepting it   opportunity realized its own fulfillment  became its own blessing and a  blessing to all mankind  the unskilled laborer who dug out the ore could  not claim this opportunity because he was not equal to its requirements     moreover  every man is himself an opportunity of infinite greatness  and  he who depends upon the world alone to furnish him opportunities is  destined to meet with failure  self reliance is the passport to  success  the man who is continually bemoaning a lack of opportunity  acknowledges his own lack of resources  is wanting in creative force   every golden moment is an opportunity for him to step out from the  shadows into the sunshine  optimism sees opportunity in the ordinary  jog trot of daily duty     one of the most valuable assets which we can possess is the ability to  mold from the adverse circumstances about us our opportunities  and  a  wise man   says bacon   will make more opportunities than he finds   when  michael angelo takes the castaway rock which he finds in his path and  carves from it  the young david   when herschel at the midnight hour   after playing his violin for a living  goes out and studies the star lit  skies  the field of his immortal conquest  when elihu burritt  working at  the forge  grapples with mathematics  and masters several languages  when  obstacles are overcome  and adversity yields to the invincible wills of  men  then has opportunity by this self made principle been hewn out of  the very stumbling blocks which were in the way     every man is a treasury of untold wealth  he is not great merely for what  he is  but for the greatness of his possibility  that undreamed grandeur  which opportunity is ever seeking to reveal  true greatness does not  emanate from the power of genius so much as it does from the wise  discrimination which we exercise in the choice of our opportunities  and  the intelligence with which we lay hold upon them  it is a fine art in  life to know just the thing to do  and the opportune moment for doing it   eternal vigilance is the price we must pay  and the constant whetting of  our faculties     our life is a succession of opportunities  yet however numerous they may  be  or however bright  they are not availing until placed into the  crucible of experience  gold  silver  rubies  sapphires  and diamonds  all  the precious jewels imbedded in the treasure house of nature  become  valuable to us only when we dig them out  polish and shape them for our  use  likewise our opportunities enrich us only as we reach out after them  and make them an abiding element in our life     but to know one s opportunity when he sees it  is the secret of life s  great problem   know thy opportunity   is the motto of pittacus of  mitylene  one of the seven wise men  it is inscribed in the temple of  apollo at delphi  and each day  in the temple of our memory  we should  write it anew  for the practical question is not whether we are making the  most of our opportunities  but whether we are conscious of them at all     moreover  to know them  instantly  as well as to know them instinctively  is essential to our well being  when victor hugo charges us to take all  reasonable advantage of that which the present offers  he reveals the true  character of opportunity  it lives only in the present tense  it knows no  to morrows  and makes a record of the yesterdays only when it has found  lodgment in our lives     suppose dewitt clinton  denounced and ridiculed  had been led into the  belief that his idea was a mere phantom  a mystic nightmare  the erie  canal would not be a reality  suppose robert fulton had accepted the  issuing vapor of the tea kettle as a mere phenomenon without seeking in it  the opportunity for a mighty purpose  suppose that cyrus w  field or  marconi  or edison or ericsson  or the hundreds of others who by their  inventive genius have been a blessing to mankind  had been contented with  simply dreaming of the stupendous undertakings which they achieved     it is the man who knows his opportunities when he sees them  who grips  them as they pass  who stands at the door of his activities ready to  welcome and turn to good account each new opportunity that comes  that is  the typically successful man  many young men have had noble ideas  backed  by strong convictions  but failing to  strike while the iron was hot    have let their convictions die  the mental picture of their ideals vanish   and to their sorrow have seen them wrought by another into reality     and below this class of men we will find a lower type  the man who is  always waiting for something to turn up  and always missing it when it  does  this is the man whom dickens has immortalized in fiction in the  familiar figure of micawber  this class  however  is unmistakably  diminishing in our day  but still there are many who seem to come just  short of the prizes of life  they are always just too late for the  opportunity that should have brought them fame and fortune     shakespeare has aptly portrayed that supreme moment in life which we call  opportunity        there is a tide in the affairs of men     which  taken at the flood  leads on to fortune     omitted  all the voyage of their life    is bound in shallows and in miseries      and the annals of human experience are filled and overflowing with  achievements  examples of opportunities that were laid hold upon at just  the critical moment of the tide     when the armies of saul and goliath were encamped in the valley of elah   an opportunity was given to every soldier in israel to meet the philistine  giant  but the youthful shepherd  david  alone accepted it  and his name  has been praised for thirty centuries     an unlettered girl  a peasant in france  saw an opportunity to save the  glory of her country  and with a courage that baffles human understanding  joan of arc went forth to conquer     when george iii of england ascended the throne and began to oppress the  colonists  an opportunity was created for the american people to act  with  sublime patriotism they arose to the occasion in defense of their rights   and historians allude to the inspiring event as the opening scene in the  revolution     and when  by a stroke of diplomacy  thomas jefferson purchased from  napoleon bonaparte the louisiana territory  one million square miles   or over six hundred millions of acres  for two cents and a half an  acre  an opportunity was seized whose benefit to the american nation no  one can estimate     but if you would know a grand hero in whose life opportunity shone like  mars  read the life of ulysses s  grant  the man out of whose very  failures evolved a most brilliant success  when  standing with leaden  heart in the little store at galena  the opportunity for a military life  came knocking at the door  he welcomed it  for when morning broke on the    th of april        and the first guns of the civil war roared upon  sumter  grant marched to the front  and soon became a brigadier general   the spur of disappointed hopes  the fire of his ambition  and the iron  will that lay back of many of his failures  all the qualities latent in  the man of coming greatness  sprang into mighty being      a gigantic opportunity next confronted him  for yonder on the banks of  the cumberland frowned the massive walls of fort donelson  behind them  buckner s gray legions stood ready for action  it was the hour of fate   grant pressed on  the confederates surrendered the stronghold  and the  first union victory was won  shiloh and vicksburg  cold harbor and  petersburg  richmond and appomattox  and many other glorious victories  tell the story of opportunities masterfully grasped     our country is the land of  the golden fleece   and wherever you may be in  its vast domain  you are the one who must answer for yourself the  stupendous question   to what height shall i attain   you are like the man  in the  arabian nights  dropped into a valley filled with diamonds  it is  within your power to select that which is most valuable for your  enrichment  there are splendid opportunities on every hand  and whether  you shall grasp them or let them go  remains alone for you to determine     the door of opportunity for the highest development of every individual   in every phase of life  is ever open  every golden moment holds something  of value for the earnest seeker  just as every flower holds in its bosom a  treasure for the thrifty bee  no one of us may ever have such splendid  opportunities as did the illustrious ones to whom we owe our present  inheritance  but at the threshold of our lives will ever come the veiled  figure with its gifts  and  however modest may be the treasures which it  brings  if we accept them and turn to good account

their oars  and the blue waters of the euxine are flecked with foam  here  is an ideal picture  a band of enterprising young men  alert  active   ambitions  a scene typical of the highest conception of life  it has ever  been scenes like this that have challenged the admiration of the world   and the plaudits of men and of angels attend the young man today who has a  worthy object in view  who believes in himself  and bends to the oars with  might and main     an  active hand  symbolizes usefulness and thrift  has it ever occurred  to you what a wonderful piece of mechanism is that hand with which nature  has equipped you for seizing the oars of life s activities  galen  the  famous anatomist  after a prolonged study of the human hand  conceiving  it to be the proximate instrument of the soul  was forced to renounce  atheism  to acknowledge the existence of a supreme being  scientists  regard the human hand as being the most remarkable organ  not vital  in  the whole animal kingdom     it is conceded to be  also  the most pronounced physical characteristic  differentiating man from the lower animals  the chimpanzee and the  gorilla  closely allied to the human species in many respects  are  noticeably deficient in the use of their modified hands  being able to  grasp things only in a cumbersome way  the squirrel handles a nut with  agility  the beaver builds his dam  and likewise do many other animals  accomplish much with certain deftness  but the grace  suppleness  and  precision  so characteristic of the human hand  are lacking  only in man  does the organ attain perfection  he alone enjoys the distinction of being  able to manipulate thumb and forefinger in combination  enabling him to  attain a high degree of skill     the hand is the organ of the fifth and last sense  and the only one of the  five which is active  when the other organs of sense fail it comes to  their rescue  the blind man reads with his hand and the dumb man speaks  with it  being an active organ it gives expression to man s capabilities   put a sword into it and it will fight  a plow and it will till  a harp and  it will play  a brush and it will paint     the invention of every machine conceives its first principles in the  structure of the human hand  and every working part of that machine bears  a relation in its function to a corresponding part in the mechanism of the  hand  in fact  physics teaches us that the hand is a combination of the  six mechanical powers  the lever  the wedge  the wheel and axle  the  pulley  the screw  and the inclined plane  but the mechanical effect is  always depreciated  in manufacture hand made goods excel those made by  machine  in art the exquisite hand painting surpasses the lithograph  no  mechanical device  however efficacious  can produce symphonies or pictures  or works of any kind with the high degree of excellence of which the hand  is capable     but aside from its mechanical functions  this wonderful organ is a  revelation of the secrets of human nature  graphology enables us to read  the character of a person in the hand writing which he produces  ages and  ages ago the hindus read the hand itself as the physical expression of the  inner man  they read character by the science of palmistry as we read it  by that of physiognomy  and some profess to translate the delicate tracery  today into language that speaks clearly of both past and future  the hand  is the expression of dishonesty when it steals  of charity when it gives   of anger when it smites  of love when it caresses  and one has called it  the key to that cabinet of character in which nature conceals  not only  the motive power of every day life  but those latent talents and energies  that  by the knowledge of self  we can bring to bear upon our lives     so that this member of our physical organization holds an office of  supreme dignity and importance in the issues of our lives  it is this  marvel of mechanism  overruled and directed by the higher power of  intellect  which elevates man to his high position  and  whether it be the  hand of the galley slave  or the hand that sways the scepter over an  empire  the supreme purpose is revealed they are alike designed to be the  instruments of usefulness and power     even the brain cannot ignore the relative importance of the hand  it  cannot say to the hand   i have no need of thee   the captain cannot man  his ship without the aid of subordinates  neither can the brain pilot us  through the activities of life without the aid of hands  a brilliant mind  is a priceless possession  but all the mental acumen of the universe is  not availing unless supplemented by those inferior officers  the hands   the clothes which you wear once were on the back of a sheep grazing on  some distant hillside  the chair in which you sit once swayed in the  forest midst the soughing winds  the pen with which i am writing once was  imbedded deep in some far away mountain range  but that occult genius  the  human brain  conceived the idea of creating that wool  and wood  and ore  into a higher state of usefulness  and at this juncture was compelled to  acknowledge the infinite necessity of a co worker  hence  the brain  employs the hand as an external agent to put into force the impressions  which it  the brain  receives from the phenomena of nature     moreover  the law of your growth is contingent upon the exercise of these  faculties  the brain is the judicial function and the hand the executive   together these two powers qualify you for the master workman  if you allow  them to exist in the passive sense  you become an apathetic segment in  the midst of a great world pulsing with life around you  you merely add  one to the population  instead of counting for a potential and energizing  influence  if you lift the weight of a clock the smallest fraction of an  inch  the mechanism will cease to operate  and the relaxation of your will  from the great obligation of life will cause your powers to atrophy and  improperly to perform their work  with browning   man was made to grow   not stop      activity and not atrophy is the law of life  action is the expression of  that vital force called energy  and energy moves the world  the keynote of  the natural world is action  the earth revolves  the river moves in its  course  the tempest rages  the mountain acts from volcanic phenomena   vegetation grows  etc  in every tiny seed lies concealed this mysterious  force  only a spark of life which  encouraged by nature  springs into a  waving harvest     this very quality is synonymous with the reality of life  the human mind  ostensibly has an aversion to lifelessness  we turn instinctively from  the dead and withered branch to the blossoming flower  from the stagnant  pool to the dashing cataract  and every healthy mind finds delight in  such terms as vim  vigor  energy  and activity  which are the chief  natural characteristics of the human hand  demosthenes on being asked  what is the first element in oratory  replied   action   when asked to  state the second element  he replied  action   and when questioned as to  the third  he made the same reply  action  first  last  and all the time   is the great principle of life and progress  without it the most perfect  engine  gigantic in proportions and costly in equipment  is a dead  thing  valueless as the formless mass of ore it once was  but that  marvelous product of man s hand and brain  plus steam  becomes a  veritable giant of power

out     shall die and leave his errand unfulfilled          james russell lowell       a man s relation to society    this question of activity is a twofold problem  in the preceding chapter  we viewed it from the standpoint of the individual  as if he were the sole  occupant of the boat  rowing toward a purely selfish end  going  as it  were  in quest of the prize of life for purely personal aggrandizement   whereas  strictly speaking  no man exists in a purely individualistic  sense  he can not regard himself as separable from a social whole  every  individual is a vital element of an organized force working toward a  mutual end  you are an integral factor  so to speak  of the social  problem  but your value is determined by your relation to other quantifies  in the complex system with which you are identified  as a segregated unit   you diminish in value     a combination of diverse and multi form contributions assimilated from a  complex human life  your being looks to many sources for its development   from the lowest phase of experience to the highest  these influences you  must acknowledge as emanating from a social system  influences which you  are totally powerless  alone  to exert upon yourself  for instance  a man  can not be his own educator in all that the term implies  he can not make  his own books  print his own newspapers  if he could he would have to look  outside of himself for the data necessary for his use  in other words  no  man lives to himself alone  he can no more be separated from the social  order of things and retain character value  than any one of a hundred  square inches of canvas in an oil painting  separated from the rest  would  constitute a picture  a single note in a musical composition  however  exquisite the piece may be  has comparatively little value taken by  itself  only when it assumes relationship with other notes and becomes  governed by the law of harmony  does it fulfill its mission and become a  valuable factor     then  as units of a social whole  we have obligations other than those  affecting  individual  problems  society has a rightful claim upon every  one of its members   you are not your own  you are bought with a price    is true in a larger sense than a merely scriptural one  for what one  becomes is really  as already stated  but the effect of combined  influences brought to bear upon one s life by the forces of human society   therefore  society expects us to reciprocate  and is just in its claim   just as parents are entitled to the high esteem and reciprocation of their  offspring  it demands of each one of us all that we are capable of  producing  exacting the highest order of service as well  the paying of  taxes does not placate the demands which society makes upon you  it  demands yourself  body  mind  and soul  not in a passive sense  but in  active relationship to your environment  and every man is morally bound  to respect the claims thus made upon him     the highest socialistic conception is not that which contemplates an  equitable distribution of property and labor  but assuming a more rational  ground  it believes in equal rights to all  is based upon a right  proportion of motives rather than upon the equalization of property  considerations  it is both humanitarian and utilitarian  it seeks its own  principally  yet is generous in the ulterior aim  this is the ideal  relation between the individual and the social order  the greatest duty  confronting each one in the world  and the one which all should earnestly  embrace  is the duty of making the most of one s self with the ulterior  view of contributing the largest measure of usefulness to his fellow men     on the other hand  to employ an extreme example  and yet it is shown by  statistics that there are one hundred thousand tramps and vagrants in this  country  the man who folds his arms and defiantly proclaimes that the  world owes him a living  mutinies against the sacred order of  things   fouls his own nest   as it were  to that man society replies   if  any man is not willing to work  neither let him eat   and this is the  dominant note of the twentieth century as truly as it was in the first  when spoken by the roman philosopher  to harbor the doctrine that the  world owes every man a living  not only discounts the character value of  the individual  but has a reflex action on the entire social organism   just as one wheel out of play in the mechanism of a watch throws the  entire works out of order  or one team in a procession halting the whole  train behind it  the individual failing to do his part affects the  equilibrium of the whole  napoleon lost the battle of waterloo and died in  exile  a prisoner at st  helena  because one of his marshals  failing to  comply with orders  arrived too late with re enforcements  remember that  you have an important part to perform  that  as in mathematics  you are a  quantity so connected with another quantity that if any alteration be made  in the former there will be a consequent alteration in the latter     in the busy hive of twentieth century civilization scant space has been  provided for drones  the drone is a minus quantity in the problem of life   instead of adding to the common weal  he is ever subtracting from it  like  an owl he sits in the gloom of indolence hooting at the caravan of events   the eye of the world is quick to observe the man who is resting on his  oars  a more graphic picture of the man who is ever magnifying the world s  duty to him  and minimizing his duty to the world  could not be painted  than that one which james russell lowell has penned        the busy world shoves angrily aside    the man who stands with arms akimbo set      the world has but one duty to this man  namely  to dispel the cloud from  his vision and arouse him to worthy action     to contend that the world owes every man a living would be as  preposterous as to assert that the government owes every citizen under the  flag a pension  the world owes no man anything except that for which he  pays a just equivalent  every man is indebted to the world  he owes it all  his best possessions  his talent  time  and effort  and the individual who  attempts to throw off this yoke of duty is violating one of nature s great  laws  even the lower forms of life afford example of this supreme law   solomon startles the sluggard with his sharp admonition to betake himself  to the ant  and sir john lubbock points men to the insect world to learn  real diligence and thrift     individual stagnation means public pollution  the man who arms himself  with a  rake   ever reaching out after something without giving an  equivalent  instead of championing the  hoe   determined to exercise his  faculties in the interests of humanity  becomes hostile to the noblest  sentiment and the highest aims of society  as in the case of the tramps  mentioned above who are a national menace  idleness breeds vice  industry  enhances the virtues  when a man ceases to work he retrogrades  he becomes  a stranger to lofty ideals and wholesome activities  the man with an  ambition ever finds himself in the ascendency  while he who deplores the  exercise of his powers  avoiding work as he would a powder magazine or a  pest  is in the descendency toward a state of groveling and low ideals   and the difference between these two men marks the difference between  success and failure     we are ever obligated to a great duty  namely  to reach the maximum of our  possibilities  our greatest prerogative in the economy of life is the wise  husbanding of resources  and the skillful marshaling of our forces on the  field of common duty  the great duty of leading a useful life confronts us  always  we can by no stratagem  whatsoever  escape its presence  we ever  hear its voice calling after us  and can no more flee from it than we can  flee from the voice of conscience  like poe s raven  it sets up a never  ceasing appeal at the door of our lives  prudence forbids that we turn our  back on this duty of self devotion  for as michael angelo saw in the block  of marble the hidden angel  a wise man sees in duty an infinite  opportunity     galileo was so absorbed in his pursuit that he forgot personal comfort and  even personal safety  and lost his eyesight in quest of the mountains in  the moon  the rings around saturn and the  star heaps  in the sky  and  when that distinguished man of science  professor agassiz  was invited to  lecture at a great price  his reply was   i have no time to make money    likewise did the great spurgeon  when offered almost fabulous prices to  cross the atlantic and lecture  refuse because of a zealous devotion to  the purpose of his life  and every one should learn that the thorough and  faithful performance of duty is the first essential of a worthy life     every human soul was made with some design  invested with the possibility  of a useful life  a noble destiny  whether it be the mercenary greek  vending his wares on the street corner  or the roaming italian with his  harp strapped over his shoulder  or the dissolute man behind prison bars  paying the penalty of misspent days  all are invested with latent power  and talent to fill a loftier place in the world  but  unfortunately  while  most men have the desire  not all have the determination to rise above the  ordinary and the common state in which they find themselves  this is a  deplorable condition  seriously detracting from the sum of human  greatness     every man has been called for dominion  each  in the divine plan  is to be  a ruler in the universe  not a  mollusk with aimless revery   he is to be  a man with vitality  not  dead matter known only as avoirdupois   by this  measure a man is not worth so much as a sheep which furnishes two  substantial commodities  food and clothing  minus the attributes which  qualify him for a high rank  man is a being with a buried talent  only a  unit in the great world around him  plus these attributes  no system of  mathematics can compute his worth        let me but do my work from day to day       in field or forest  at the desk or loom       in roaring market place  or tranquil room     let me but find it in my heart to say     when vagrant wishes beckon me astray        this is my work  my blessing not my doom       of all who live i am the one by whom    this work can best be done in the right way                       emigrants had been  chiefly limited to the country on the coast  which  by its proximity to  the waters that rolled between them and europe  afforded the semblance of  a connexion with the land of their forefathers and the distant abodes of  civilization  but enterprise  and a desire to search for still more  fertile domains  together with the temptation offered by the vast and  unknown regions that lay along their western and northern borders  had  induced many bold adventurers to penetrate more deeply into the forests   the precise spot  to which we desire to transport the imagination of the  reader  was one of these establishments of what may  not inaptly  be  called the forlorn hope  in the march of civilization through the country     so little was then known of the great outlines of the american continent   that  when the lords say and seal  and brooke  connected with a few  associates  obtained a grant of the territory which now composes the state  of connecticut  the king of england affixed his name to a patent  which  constituted them proprietors of a country that should extend from the  shores of the atlantic to those of the south sea  notwithstanding the  apparent hopelessness of ever subduing  or of even occupying a territory  like this  emigrants from the mother colony of massachusetts were found  ready to commence the herculean labor  within fifteen years from the day  when they had first put foot upon the well known rock itself  the fort of  say brooke  the towns of windsor  hartford  and new haven  soon sprang  into existence  and  from that period to this  the little community  which  then had birth  has been steadily  calmly  and prosperously advancing its  career  a model of order and reason  and the hive from which swarms of  industrious  hardy and enlightened yeomen have since spread themselves  over a surface so vast  as to create an impression that they still aspire  to the possession of the immense regions included in their original grant     among the religionists  whom disgust of persecution had early driven into  the voluntary exile of the colonies  was more than an usual proportion of  men of character and education  the reckless and the gay  younger sons   soldiers unemployed  and students from the inns of court  early sought  advancement and adventure in the more southern provinces  where slaves  offered impunity from labor  and where war  with a bolder and more  stirring policy  oftener gave rise to scenes of excitement  and  of  course  to the exercise of the faculties best suited to their habits and  dispositions  the more grave  and the religiously disposed  found refuge  in the colonies of new england  thither a multitude of private gentlemen  transferred their fortunes and their families  imparting a character of  intelligence and a moral elevation to the country  which it has nobly  sustained to the present hour     the nature of the civil wars in england had enlisted many men of deep and  sincere piety in the profession of arms  some of them had retired to the  colonies before the troubles of the mother country reached their crisis   and others continued to arrive  throughout the whole period of their  existence  until the restoration  when crowds of those who had been  disaffected to the house of stuart sought the security of these distant  possessions     a stern  fanatical soldier  of the name of heathcote  had been among the  first of his class  to throw aside the sword for the implements of  industry peculiar to the advancement of a newly established country  how  far the influence of a young wife may have affected his decision it is not  germane to our present object to consider  though the records  from which  the matter we are about to relate is gleaned  give reason to suspect that  he thought his domestic harmony would not be less secure in the wilds of  the new world  than among the companions with whom his earlier  associations would naturally have brought him in communion     like himself  his consort was born of one of those families  which  taking  their rise in the franklins of the times of the edwards and henrys  had  become possessors of hereditary landed estates  that  by their  gradually increasing value  had elevated them to the station of small  country gentlemen  in most other nations of europe  they would have been  rated in the class of the  petite noblesse   but the domestic happiness of  capt  heathcote was doomed to receive a fatal blow  from a quarter where  circumstances had given him but little reason to apprehend danger  the  very day he landed in the long wished for asylum  his wife made him the  father of a noble boy  a gift that she bestowed at the melancholy price of  her own existence  twenty years the senior of the woman who had followed  his fortunes to these distant regions  the retired warrior had always  considered it to be perfectly and absolutely within the order of things   that he himself was to be the first to pay the debt of nature  while the  visions which captain heathcote entertained of a future world were  sufficiently vivid and distinct  there is reason to think they were seen  through a tolerably long vista of quiet and comfortable enjoyment in this   though the calamity cast an additional aspect of seriousness over a  character that was already more than chastened by the subtleties of  sectarian doctrines  he was not of a nature to be unmanned by any  vicissitude of human fortune  he lived on  useful and unbending in his  habits  a pillar of strength in the way of wisdom and courage to the  immediate neighborhood among whom he resided  but reluctant from temper   and from a disposition which had been shadowed by withered happiness  to  enact that part in the public affairs of the little state  to which his  comparative wealth and previous habits might well have entitled him to  aspire  he gave his son such an education as his own resources and those  of the infant colony of massachusetts afforded  and  by a sort of delusive  piety  into whose merits we have no desire to look  he thought he had also  furnished a commendable evidence of his own desperate resignation to the  will of providence  in causing him to be publicly christened by the name  of content  his own baptismal appellation was mark  as indeed had been  that of most of his ancestors  for two or three centuries  when the world  was a little uppermost in his thoughts  as sometimes happens with the most  humbled spirits  he had even been heard to speak of a sir mark of his  family  who had ridden a knight in the train of one of the more warlike  kings of his native land     there is some ground for believing  that the great parent of evil early  looked with a malignant eye on the example of peacefulness  and of  unbending morality  that the colonists of new england were setting to the  rest of christendom  at any rate  come from what quarter they might   schisms and doctrinal contentions arose among the emigrants themselves   and men  who together had deserted the fire sides of their forefathers in  quest of religious peace  were ere long seen separating their fortunes  in  order that each might enjoy  unmolested  those peculiar shades of faith   which all had the presumption  no less than the folly  to believe were  necessary to propitiate the omnipotent and merciful father of the  universe  if our task were one of theology  a wholesome moral on the  vanity  no less than on the absurdity of the race  might be here  introduced to some advantage     when mark heathcote announced to the community  in which he had now  sojourned more than twenty years  that he intended for a second time to  establish his altars in the wilderness  in the hope that he and his  household might worship god as to them seemed most right  the intelligence  was received with a feeling allied to awe  doctrine and zeal were  momentarily forgotten  in the respect and attachment which had been  unconsciously created by the united influence of the stern severity of his  air  and of the undeniable virtues of his practice  the elders of the  settlement communed with him freely and in charity  but the voice of  conciliation and alliance came too late  he listened to the reasonings of  the ministers  who were assembled from all the adjoining parishes  in  sullen respect  and he joined in the petitions for light and instruction   that were offered up on the occasion  with the deep reverence with which  he ever drew near to the footstool of the almighty  but he did both in a  temper into which too much positiveness of spiritual pride had entered  to  open his heart to that sympathy and charity  which  as they are the  characteristics of our mild and forbearing doctrines  should be the study  of those who profess to follow their precepts  all that was seemly  and  all that was usual  were done  but the purpose of the stubborn sectarian  remained unchanged  his final decision is worthy of being recorded      my youth was wasted in ungodliness and ignorance   he said   but in my  manhood have i known the lord  near two score years have i toiled for the  truth  and all that weary time have i past in trimming my lamps  lest   like the foolish virgins  i should be caught unprepared  and now  when my  loins are girded and my race is nearly run  shall i become a backslider  and falsifier of the word  much have i endured  as you know  in quitting  the earthly mansion of my fathers  and in encountering the dangers of sea  and land for the faith  and  rather than let go its hold  will i once more  cheerfully devote to the howling wilderness  ease  offspring  and  should  it be the will of providence  life itself      the day of parting was one of unfeigned and general sorrow   notwithstanding the austerity of the old man s character  and the nearly  unbending severity of his brow  the milk of human kindness had often been  seen distilling from his stern nature in acts that did not admit of  misinterpretation  there was scarcely a young beginner in the laborious  and ill requited husbandry of the township he inhabited  a district at no  time considered either profitable or fertile  who could not recall some  secret and kind aid which had flowed from a hand that  to the world   seemed clenched in cautious and reserved frugality  nor did any of the  faithful of his vicinity cast their fortunes together in wedlock  without  receiving from him evidence of an interest in their worldly happiness   that was far more substantial than words     on the morning when the vehicles  groaning with the household goods of  mark heathcote  were seen quitting his door  and taking the road which  led to the sea side  not a human being  of sufficient age  within many  miles of his residence  was absent from the interesting spectacle  the  leave taking  as usual on all serious occasions  was preceded by a hymn  and prayer  and then the sternly minded adventurer embraced his neighbors   with a mien  in which a subdued exterior struggled fearfully and strangely  with emotions that  more than once  threatened to break through even the  formidable barriers of his acquired manner  the inhabitants of every  building on the road were in the open air  to receive and to return the  parting benediction  more than once  they  who guided his teams  were  commanded to halt  and all near  possessing human aspirations and human  responsibility  were collected to offer petitions in favor of him who  departed and of those who remained  the requests for mortal privileges  were somewhat light and hasty  but the askings in behalf of intellectual  and spiritual light were long  fervent  and oft repeated  in this  characteristic manner did one of the first of the emigrants to the new  world make his second removal into scenes of renewed bodily suffering   privation and danger     neither person nor property was transferred from place to place  in this  country  at the middle of the seventeenth century  with the dispatch and  with the facilities of the present time  the roads were necessarily few  and short  and communication by water was irregular  tardy  and far from  commodius  a wide barrier of forest lying between that portion of  massachusetts bay from which mark heathcote emigrated  and the spot  near  the connecticut river  to which it was his intention to proceed  he was  induced to adopt the latter mode of conveyance  but a long delay  intervened between the time when he commenced his short journey to the  coast  and the hour when he was finally enabled to embark  during this  detention he and his household sojourned among the godly minded of the  narrow peninsula  where there already existed the germ of a flourishing  town  and where the spires of a noble and picturesque city now elevate  themselves above so many thousand roofs     the son did not leave the colony of his birth and the haunts of his youth   with the same unwavering obedience to the call of duty  as the father   there was a fair  a youthful  and a gentle being in the  recently established town of boston  of an age  station  opinions   fortunes  and  what was of still greater importance  of sympathies suited  to his own  her form had long mingled with those holy images  which his  stern instruction taught him to keep most familiarly before the mirror of  his thoughts  it is not surprising  then  that the youth hailed the delay  as propitious to his wishes  or that he turned it to the account  which  the promptings of a pure affection so naturally suggested  he was united  to the gentle ruth harding only the week before the father sailed on his  second pilgrimage     it is not our intention to dwell on the incidents of the voyage  though  the genius of an extraordinary man had discovered the world which was now  beginning to fill with civilized men  navigation at that day was not  brilliant in accomplishments  a passage among the shoals of nantucket must  have been one of actual danger  no less than of terror  and the ascent of  the connecticut itself was an exploit worthy of being mentioned  in due  time the adventurers landed at the english fort of hartford  where they  tarried for a season  in order to obtain rest and spiritual comfort  but  the peculiarity of doctrine  on which mark heathcote laid so much stress   was one that rendered it advisable for him to retire still further from  the haunts of men  accompanied by a few followers  he proceeded on an  exploring expedition  and the end of the summer found him once more  established on an estate that he had acquired by the usual simple forms  practised in the colonies  and at the trifling cost for which extensive  districts were then set apart as the property of individuals     the love of the things of this life  while it certainly existed  was far  from being predominant in the affections of the puritan  he was frugal  from habit and principle  more than from an undue longing after worldly  wealth  he contented himself  therefore  with acquiring an estate that  should be valuable  rather from its quality and beauty  than from its  extent  many such places offered themselves  between the settlements of  weathersfield and hartford  and that imaginary line which separated the  possessions of the colony he had quitted  from those of the one he joined   he made his location  as it is termed in the language of the country  near  the northern boundary of the latter  this spot  by the aid of an  expenditure that might have been considered lavish for the country and the  age  if some lingering of taste  which even the self denying and subdued  habits of his later life had not entirely extinguished  and of great  natural beauty in the distribution of land  water and wood  the emigrant  contrived to convert into an abode  that was not more desirable for its  retirement from the temptations of the world  than for its rural  loveliness     after this memorable act of conscientious self devotion  years passed away  in quiet  amid a species of negative prosperity  rumors from the old world  reached the ears of the tenants of this secluded settlement  months after  the events to which they referred were elsewhere forgotten  and tumults  and wars in the sister colonies came to their knowledge only at distant  and tardy intervals  in the mean time  the limits of the colonial  establishments were gradually extending themselves  and valleys were  beginning to be cleared nearer and nearer to their own  old age had now  begun to make some visible impression on the iron frame of the captain   and the fresh color of youth and health  with which his son had entered  the forest  was giving way to the brown covering produced by exposure and  toil  we say of toil  for  independently of the habits and opinions of the  country  which strongly reprobated idleness  even in those most gifted by  fortune  the daily difficulties of their situation  the chase  and the  long and intricate passages that the veteran himself was compelled to  adventure in the surrounding forest  partook largely of the nature of the  term we have used  ruth continued blooming and youthful  though maternal  anxiety was soon added to her other causes of care  still  for a long  season  nought occurred to excite extraordinary regrets for the step they  had taken  or to create particular uneasiness in behalf of the future  the  borderers  for such by their frontier position they had in truth become   heard the strange and awful tidings of the dethronement of one king  of  the interregnum  as a reign of more than usual vigor and prosperity is  called  and of the restoration of the son of him who is strangely enough  termed a martyr  to all these eventful and unwonted chances in the  fortunes of kings  mark heathcote listened with deep and reverential  submission to the will of him  in whose eyes crowns and sceptres are  merely the more costly baubles of the world  like most of his  contemporaries  who had sought shelter in the western continent  his  political opinions  if not absolutely republican  had a leaning to liberty  that was strongly in opposition to the doctrine of the divine rights of  the monarch  while he had been too far removed from the stirring passions  which had gradually excited those nearer to the throne  to lose their  respect for its sanctity  and to sully its brightness with blood  when the  transient and straggling visiters that  at long intervals  visited his  settlement  spoke of the protector  who for so many years ruled england  with an iron hand  the eyes of the old man would gleam with sudden and  singular interest  and once  when commenting after evening prayer on the  vanity and the vicissitudes of this life  he acknowledged that the  extraordinary individual  who was  in substance if not in name  seated on  the throne of the plantagenets  had been the boon companion and ungodly  associate of many of his youthful hours  then would follow a long   wholesome  extemporaneous homily on the idleness of setting the affections  on the things of life  and a half suppressed  but still intelligible  commendation of the wiser course which had led him to raise his own  tabernacle in the wilderness  instead of weakening the chances of eternal  glory by striving too much for the possession of the treacherous vanities  of the world     but even the gentle and ordinarily little observant ruth might trace the  kindling of the eye  the knitting of the brow  and the flushings of his  pale and furrowed cheek  as the murderous conflicts of the civil wars  became the themes of the ancient soldier s discourse  there were moments  when religious submission  and we had almost said religious precepts  were  partially forgotten  as he explained to his attentive son and listening  grandchild  the nature of the onset  or the quality and dignity of the  retreat  at such times  his still nervous hand would even wield the blade   in order to instruct the latter in its uses  and many a long winter  evening was passed in thus indirectly teaching an art  that was so much at  variance with the mandates of his divine master  the chastened soldier   however  never forgot to close his instruction with a petition  extraordinary  in the customary prayer  that no descendant of his should  ever take life from a being unprepared to die  except in justifiable  defence of his faith  his person  or his lawful rights  it must be  admitted  that a liberal construction of the reserved privileges would  leave sufficient matter  to exercise the subtlety of one subject to any  extraordinary propensity to arms     few opportunities were however offered  in their remote situation and  with their peaceful habits  for the practice of a theory that had been  taught in so many lessons  indian alarms  as they were termed  were not  unfrequent  but  as yet  they had never produced more than terror in the  bosoms of the gentle ruth and her young offspring  it is true  they had  heard of travellers massacred  and of families separated by captivity   but  either by a happy fortune  or by more than ordinary prudence in the  settlers who were established along that immediate frontier  the knife  and the tomahawk had as yet been sparingly used in the colony of  connecticut  a threatening and dangerous struggle with the dutch  in the  adjoining province of new netherlands  had been averted by the foresight  and moderation of the rulers of the new plantations  and though a  warlike and powerful native chief kept the neighboring colonies of  massachusetts and rhode island in a state of constant watchfulness  from  the cause just mentioned the apprehension of danger was greatly weakened  in the breasts of those so remote as the individuals who composed the  family of our emigrant     in this quiet manner did years glide by  the surrounding wilderness  slowly retreating from the habitations of the heathcotes  until they  found themselves in the possession of as many of the comforts of life as  their utter seclusion from the rest of the world could give them reason  to expect     with this preliminary explanation  we shall refer the reader to the  succeeding narrative for a more minute  and we hope for a more interesting  account of the incidents of a legend that may prove too homely for the  tastes of those  whose imaginations seek the excitement of scenes more  stirring  or of a condition of life less natural           chapter ii           sir  i do know you     and dare  upon the warrant of my art     commend a dear thing to you       king lear       at the precise time when the action of our piece commences  a fine and  fruitful season was drawing to a close  the harvests of the hay and of the  smaller corns had long been over  and the younger heathcote with his  laborers had passed a day in depriving the luxuriant maize of its tops  in  order to secure the nutritious blades for fodder  and to admit the sun and  air to harden a grain  that is almost considered the staple production of  the region he inhabited  the veteran mark had ridden among the workmen   during their light toil  as well to enjoy a sight which promised abundance  to his flocks and herds  as to throw in  on occasion  some wholesome  spiritual precept  in which doctrinal subtlety was far more prominent than  the rules of practice  the hirelings of his son  for he had long since  yielded the management of the estate to content  were  without an  exception  young men born in the country and long use and much training  had accustomed them to a blending of religious exercises with most of the  employments of life  they listened  therefore  with respect  nor did an  impious smile  or an impatient glance  escape the lightest minded of their  number  during his exhortations  though the homilies of the old man were  neither very brief  nor particularly original  but devotion to the one  great cause of their existence  austere habits  and unrelaxed industry in  keeping alive a flame of zeal that had been kindled in the other  hemisphere  to burn longest and brightest in this  had interwoven the  practice mentioned with most of the opinions and pleasures of these  metaphysical  though simple minded people  the toil went on none the less  cheerily for the extraordinary accompaniment  and content himself  by a  certain glimmering of superstition  which appears to be the concomitant of  excessive religious zeal  was fain to think that the sun shone more  brightly on their labors  and that the earth gave forth more of its  fruits  while these holy sentiments were flowing from the lips of a father  whom he piously loved and deeply reverenced     but when the sun  usually at that season  in the climate of connecticut  a  bright unshrouded orb  fell towards the tree tops which bounded the  western horizon  the old man began to grow weary with his own well doing   he therefore finished his discourse with a wholesome admonition to the  youths to complete their tasks before they quitted the field  and  turning  the head of his horse  he rode slowly  and with a musing air  towards the  dwellings  it is probable that for some time the thoughts of mark were  occupied with the intellectual matter he had just been handling with so  much power  but when his little nag stopped of itself on a small eminence   which the crooked cow path he was following crossed  his mind yielded to  the impression of more worldly and more sensible objects  as the scene   that drew his contemplations from so many abstract theories to the  realities of life  was peculiar to the country  and is more or less  connected with the subject of our tale  we shall endeavor briefly to  describe it     a small tributary of the connecticut divided the view into two nearly  equal parts  the fertile flats that extended on each of its banks for more  than a mile  had been early stripped of their burthen of forest  and they  now lay in placid meadows  or in fields from which the grain of the season  had lately disappeared  and over which the plow had already left the marks  of recent tillage  the whole of the plain  which ascended gently from the  rivulet towards the forest  was subdivided in inclosures  by numberless  fences  constructed in the rude but substantial manner of the country   rails  in which lightness and economy of wood had been but little  consulted  lying in zigzag lines  like the approaches which the besieger  makes in his cautious advance to the hostile fortress  were piled on each  other  until barriers seven or eight feet in height  were interposed to  the inroads of vicious cattle  in one spot  a large square vacancy had  been cut into the forest  and  though numberless stumps of trees darkened  its surface  as indeed they did many of the fields on the flats  themselves  bright  green grain was sprouting forth  luxuriantly  from the  rich and virgin soil  high against the side of an adjacent hill  that  might aspire to be called a low rocky mountain  a similar invasion had  been made on the dominion of the trees  but caprice or convenience had  induced an abandonment of the clearing  after it had ill requited the toil  of felling the timber by a single crop  in this spot  straggling  girdled   and consequently dead trees  piles of logs  and black and charred stubs   were seen deforming the beauty of a field  that would  otherwise  have  been striking from its deep setting in the woods  much of the surface of  this opening  too  was now concealed by bushes of what is termed the  second growth  though  here and there  places appeared  in which the  luxuriant white clover  natural to the country  had followed the close  grazing of the flocks  the eyes of mark were bent  inquiringly  on this  clearing  which  by an air line  might have been half a mile from the  place where his horse had stopped  for the sounds of a dozen differently  toned cow bells were brought  on the still air of the evening  to his  ears  from among its bushes     the evidences of civilization were the least equivocal  however  on and  around a natural elevation in the land  which arose so suddenly on the  very bank of the stream  as to give to it the appearance of a work of art   whether these mounds once existed everywhere on the face of the earth  and  have disappeared before long tillage and labor  we shall not presume to  conjecture  but we have reason to think that they occur much more  frequently in certain parts of our own country  than in any other  familiarly known to ordinary travellers  unless perhaps it may be in some  of the valleys of switzerland  the practised veteran had chosen the summit  of this flattened cone  for the establishment of that species of military  defence  which the situation of the country  and the character of the  enemy he had to guard against  rendered advisable  as well as customary     the dwelling was of wood  and constructed of the ordinary frame work   with its thin covering of boards  it was long  low  and irregular   bearing marks of having been reared at different periods  as the wants of  an increasing family had required additional accommodation  it stood near  the verge of the natural declivity  and on that side of the hill where  its base was washed by the rivulet  a rude piazza stretching along the  whole of its front and overhanging the stream  several large  irregular   and clumsy chimneys  rose out of different parts of the roofs  another  proof that comfort  rather than taste  had been consulted in the  disposition of the buildings  there were also two or three detached  offices on the summit of the hill  placed near the dwelling  and at  points most convenient for their several uses  a stranger might have  remarked that they were so disposed as to form  far as they went  the  different sides of a hollow square  notwithstanding the great length of  the principal building  and the disposition of the more minute and  detached parts  this desirable formation would not  however  have been  obtained  were it not that two rows of rude constructions in logs  from  which the bark had not even been stripped  served to eke out the parts  that were deficient  these primeval edifices were used to contain various  domestic articles  no less than provisions  and they also furnished  numerous lodging rooms for the laborers and the inferior dependants of  the farm  by the aid of a few strong and high gates of hewn timber  those  parts of the buildings which had not been made to unite in the original  construction  were sufficiently connected to oppose so many barriers  against admission into the inner court     but the building which was most conspicuous by its position  no less than  by the singularity of its construction  stood on a low  artificial mound   in the centre of the quadrangle  it was high  hexagonal in shape  and  crowned with a roof that came to a point  and from whose peak rose a  towering flagstaff  the foundation was of stone  but  at the height of a  man above the earth  the sides were made of massive  squared logs  firmly  united by an ingenious combination of their ends  as well as by  perpendicular supporters pinned closely into their sides  in this  citadel  or block house  as from its materials it was technically called   there were two different tiers of long  narrow loop holes  but no regular  windows  the rays of the setting sun  however  glittered on one or two  small openings in the roof  in which glass had been set  furnishing  evidence that the summit of the building was sometimes used for other  purposes than those of defence     about half way up the sides of the eminence  on which the dwelling stood   was an unbroken line of high palisadoes  made of the bodies of young  trees  firmly knit together by braces and horizontal pieces of timber  and  evidently kept in a state of jealous and complete repair  the air of the  whole of this frontier fortress was neat and comfortable  and  considering  that the use of artillery was unknown to those forests  not unmilitary     at no great distance from the base of the hill  stood the barns and the  stables  they were surrounded by a vast range of rude but warm sheds   beneath which sheep and horned cattle were usually sheltered from the  storms of the rigorous winters of the climate  the surfaces of the  meadows  immediately around the out buildings  were of a smoother and  richer sward  than those in the distance  and the fences were on a far  more artificial  and perhaps durable  though scarcely on a more  serviceable plan  a large orchard of some ten or fifteen years  growth   too  added greatly to the air of improvement  which put this smiling  valley in such strong and pleasing contrast to the endless and  nearly untenanted woods by which it was environed     of the interminable forest  it is not necessary to speak  with the  solitary exception on the mountain side  and of here and there a wind row   along which the trees had been uprooted  by the furious blasts that  sometimes sweep off acres of our trees in a minute  the eye could find no  other object to study in the vast setting of this quiet rural picture  but  the seemingly endless maze of wilderness  the broken surface of the land   however  limited the view to an horizon of no great extent  though the art  of man could scarcely devise colors so vivid  or so gay  as those which  were afforded by the brilliant hues of the foliage  the keen  biting  frosts  known at the close of a new england autumn  had already touched  the broad and fringed leaves of the maples  and the sudden and secret  process had been wrought upon all the other varieties of the forest   producing that magical effect  which can be nowhere seen  except in  regions in which nature is so bountiful and luxuriant in summer  and so  sudden and so stern in the change of the seasons     over this picture of prosperity and peace  the eye of old mark heathcote  wandered with a keen degree of worldly prudence  the melancholy sounds of  the various toned bells  ringing hollow and plaintively among the arches  of the woods  gave him reason to believe that the herds of the family were  returning  voluntarily  from their unlimited forest pasturage  his  grandson  a fine spirited boy of some fourteen years  was approaching  through the fields  the youngster drove before him a small flock  which  domestic necessity compelled the family to keep at great occasional loss   and at a heavy expense of time and trouble  both of which could alone  protect them from the ravages of the beasts of prey  a species of  half witted serving lad  whom charity had induced the old man to harbor  among his dependants was seen issuing from the woods  nearly in a line  with the neglected clearing on the mountain side  the latter advanced   shouting and urging before him a drove of colts  as shaggy  as wayward   and nearly as untamed as himself      how now  weak one   said the puritan  with a severe eye  as the two lads  approached him  with their several charges  from different directions  and  nearly at the same instant   how now  sirrah  dost worry the cattle in  this gait  when the eyes of the prudent are turned from thee  do as thou  wouldst be done by  is a just and healthful admonition  that the learned   and the simple  the weak and the strong of mind  should alike recall to  their thoughts and their practice  i do not know that an over driven colt  will be at all more apt to make a gentle and useful beast in its prime   than one treated with kindness and care       i believe the evil one has got into all the kine  no less than into the  foals   sullenly returned the lad   i ve called to them in anger  and i ve  spoken to them as if they had been my natural kin  and yet neither fair  word nor foul tongue will bring them to hearken to advice  there is  something frightful in the woods this very sun down  master  or colts that  i have driven the summer through  would not be apt to give this unfair  treatment to one they ought to know to be their friend       thy sheep are counted  mark   resumed the grandfather  turning towards  his descendant with a less austere  but always an authoritative brow   thy  mother hath need of every fleece  to provide covering for thee and others  like thee  thou knowest  child  that the creatures are few  and our  winters weary and cold       my mother s loom shall never be idle from carelessness of mine   returned  the confident boy   but counting and wishing cannot make seven and thirty  fleeces  where there are only six and thirty backs to carry them  i have  been an hour among the briars and bushes of the hill logging  looking for  the lost wether  and yet neither lock  hoof  hide  nor horn  is there to  say what hath befallen the animal       thou hast lost a sheep   this carelessness will cause thy mother  to grieve       grandfather  i have been no idler  since the last hunt  the flock hath  been allowed to browse the woods  for no man  in all that week  saw wolf   panther  or bear  though the country was up  from the great river to the  outer settlements of the colony  the biggest four footed animal  that lost  its hide in the muster  was a thin ribbed deer  and the stoutest battle  given  was between wild whittal ring  here  and a wood chuck that kept him  at arm s length  for the better part of an afternoon       thy tale may be true  but it neither finds that which is lost  nor  completeth the number of thy mother s flock  hast thou ridden carefully  throughout the clearing  it is not long  since i saw the animals grazing  in that quarter  what hast thou twisting in thy fingers  in that wasteful  and unthankful manner  whittal       what would make a winter blanket  if there was enough of it  wool  and  wool  too  that came from the thigh of old straight horns  else have i  forgotten a leg  that gives the longest and coarsest hair at the  shearing       that truly seemeth a lock from the animal that is wanting   exclaimed the  other boy   there is no other creature in the flock  with fleece so coarse  and shaggy  where found you the handful  whittal ring       growing on the branch of a thorn  queer fruit this  masters  to be seen  where young plums ought to ripen       go  go   interrupted the old man   thou idlest  and misspendest the time  in vain talk  go  fold thy flock  mark  and do thou  weak one  house thy  charge with less uproar than is wont  we should remember that the voice is  given to man  firstly  that he may improve the blessing in thanksgivings  and petitions  secondly  to communicate such gifts as may be imparted to  himself  and which it is his bounden duty to attempt to impart to others   and then  thirdly  to declare his natural wants and inclinations      with this admonition  which probably proceeded from a secret consciousness  in the puritan that he had permitted a momentary cloud of selfishness to  obscure the brightness of his faith  the party separated  the grandson and  the hireling took their several ways to the folds  while old mark himself  slowly continued his course towards the dwellings  it was near enough to  the hours of darkness  to render the preparations we have mentioned  prudent  still  no urgency called for particular haste  in the return of  the veteran to the shelter and protection of his own comfortable and  secure abode  he therefore loitered along the path  occasionally stopping  to look into the prospects of the young crops  that were beginning to  spring up in readiness for the coming year  and at times bending his gaze  around the whole of his limited horizon  like one who had the habit of  exceeding and unremitted care     one of these numerous pauses promised to be much longer than usual   instead of keeping his understanding eye on the grain  the look of the old  man appeared fastened  as by a charm  on some distant and obscure object   doubt and uncertainty  for many minutes  seemed to mingle in his gaze  but  all hesitation had apparently disappeared  as his lips severed  and he  spoke  perhaps unconsciously to himself  aloud      it is no deception   were the low words   but a living and an accountable  creature of the lord s  many a day has passed since such a sight hath been  witnessed in this vale  but my eye greatly deceives me  or yonder cometh  one ready to ask for hospitality  and  peradventure  for christian and  brotherly communion      the sight of the aged emigrant had not deceived him  one  who appeared  a wayworn and weary traveller  had indeed ridden out of the forest  at a  point where a path  that was easier to be traced by the blazed trees  that lay along its route  than by any marks on the earth itself  issued  into the cleared land  the progress of the stranger had  at first  been  so wary and slow  as to bear the manner of exceeding and mysterious  caution  the blind road  along which he must have ridden not only far  but hard  or night had certainly overtaken him in the woods  led to one  of the distant settlements that lay near to the fertile banks of the  connecticut  few ever followed its windings  but they who had especial  affairs  or extraordinary communion  in the way of religious  friendships  with the proprietors of the wish ton wish  as  in  commemoration of the first bird that had been seen by the emigrants  the  valley of the heathcotes was called     once fairly in view  any doubt or apprehension  that the stranger might at  first have entertained  disappeared  he rode boldly and steadily forward   until he drew a rein that his impoverished and weary beast gladly obeyed   within a few feet of the proprietor of the valley  whose gaze had never  ceased to watch his movements  from the instant when the other first came  within view  before speaking  the stranger  a man whose head was getting  gray  apparently as much with hardship as with time  and one whose great  weight would have proved a grievous burthen  in a long ride  to even a  better conditioned beast than the ill favored provincial hack he had  ridden  dismounted  and threw the bridle loose upon the drooping neck of  the animal  the latter  without a moment s delay  and with a greediness  that denoted long abstinence  profited by its liberty  to crop the herbage  where it stood      i cannot be mistaken  when i suppose that i have at length reached the  valley of the wish ton wish   the visiter said  touching a soiled and  slouched beaver that more than half concealed his features  the question  was put in an english that bespoke a descent from those who dwell in the  midland counties of the mother country  rather than in that intonation  which is still to be traced  equally in the western portions of england  and in the eastern states of the union  notwithstanding the purity of his  accent  there was enough in the form of his speech to denote a severe  compliance with the fashion of the religionists of the times  he used that  measured and methodical tone  which was  singularly enough  believed to  distinguish an entire absence of affectation in language      thou hast reached the dwelling of him thou seekest  one who is a  submissive sojourner in the wilderness of the world  and an humble  servitor in the outer temple       this then is mark heathcote   repeated the stranger in tones of interest   regarding the other with a look of long  and  possibly  of suspicious  investigation      such is the name i bear  a fitting confidence in him who knows so well  how to change the wilds into the haunts of men  and much suffering  have  made me the master of what thou seest  whether thou comest to tarry a  night  a week  a month  or even for a still longer season  as a brother in  care  and i doubt not one who striveth for the right  i bid thee welcome      the stranger thanked his host  by a slow inclination of the head  but the  gaze  which began to partake a little of the look of recognition  was  still too earnest and engrossing to admit of verbal reply  on the other  hand  though the old man had scanned the broad and rusty beaver  the  coarse and well worn doublet  the heavy boots and  in short  the whole  attire of his visiter  in which he saw no vain conformity to idle  fashions to condemn  it was evident that personal recollection had not the  smallest influence in quickening his hospitality      thou hast arrived happily   continued the puritan   had night  overtaken thee in the forest  unless much practised in the shifts of  our young woodsmen  hunger  frost  and a supperless bed of brush  would  have given thee motive to think more of the body than is either  profitable or seemly      the stranger might possibly have known the embarrassment of these several  hardships  for the quick and unconscious glance he threw over his soiled  dress  should have betrayed some familiarity already  with the privations  to which his host alluded  as neither of them  however  seemed disposed to  waste further time on matters of such light moment  the traveller put an  arm through the bridle of his horse  and  in obedience to an invitation  from the owner of the dwelling  they took their way towards the fortified  edifice on the natural mound     the task of furnishing litter and provender to the jaded beast was  performed by whittal ring under the inspection  and  at times  under the  instructions  of its owner and his host  both of whom appeared to take a  kind and commendable interest in the comfort of a faithful hack  that had  evidently suffered long and much in the service of its master  when this  duty was discharged  the old man and his unknown guest entered the house  together  the frank and unpretending hospitality of a country like that  they were in  rendering suspicion or hesitation qualities that were  unknown to the reception of a man of white blood  more especially if he  spoke the language of the island  which was then first sending out its  swarms  to subdue and possess so large a portion of a continent that  nearly divides the earth in moieties           chapter iii            this is most strange  your father s in some passion    that works him strongly        tempest       a few hours made a great change in the occupations of the different  members of our simple and secluded family  the kine had yielded their  nightly tribute  the oxen had been released from the yoke  and were now  secure beneath their sheds  the sheep were in their folds  safe from the  assaults of the prowling wolf  and care had been taken to see that every  thing possessing life was gathered within the particular defences that  were provided for its security and comfort  but while all this caution was  used in behalf of living things  the utmost indifference prevailed on the  subject of that species of movable property  which  elsewhere  would have  been guarded with  at least  an equal jealousy  the homely fabrics of the  looms of ruth lay on their bleaching ground  to drink in the night dew   and plows  harrows  carts  saddles  and other similar articles  were left  in situations so exposed  as to prove that the hand of man had occupations  so numerous and so urgent  as to render it inconvenient to bestow labor  where it was not considered absolutely necessary     content himself was the last to quit the fields and the out buildings   when he reached the postern in the palisadoes  he stopped to call to those  above him  in order to learn if any yet lingered without the wooden  barriers  the answer being in the negative  he entered  and drawing to the  small but heavy gate  he secured it with bar  bolt  and lock  carefully  and jealously  with his own hand  as this was no more than a nightly and  necessary precaution  the affairs of the family received no interruption   the meal of the hour was soon ended  and conversation  with those light  toils which are peculiar to the long evenings of the fall and winter in  families on the frontier  succeeded as fitting employments to close the  business of a laborious and well spent day     notwithstanding the entire simplicity which marked the opinions and usages  of the colonists at that period  and the great equality of condition which  even to this hour distinguishes the particular community of which we  write  choice and inclination drew some natural distinctions in the  ordinary intercourse of the inmates of the heathcote family  a fire so  bright and cheerful blazed on an enormous hearth in a sort of upper  kitchen  as to render candles or torches unnecessary  around it were  seated six or seven hardy and athletic young men  some drawing coarse  tools carefully through the curvatures of ox bows  others scraping down  the helves of axes  or perhaps fashioning sticks of birch into homely but  convenient brooms  a demure  side looking young woman kept her great wheel  in motion  while one or two others were passing from room to room  with  the notable and stirring industry of handmaidens  busied in the more  familiar cares of the household  a door communicated with an inner and  superior apartment  here was a smaller but an equally cheerful fire  a  floor which had recently been swept  while that without had been freshly  sprinkled with river sand  candles of tallow  on a table of cherry wood  from the neighboring forest  walls that were wainscoted in the black oak  of the country  and a few other articles  of a fashion so antique  and of  ornaments so ingenious and rich  as to announce that they had been  transported from beyond sea  above the mantel were suspended the armorial  bearings of the heathcotes and the hardings  elaborately emblazoned in  tent stitch     the principal personages of the family were seated around the latter  hearth  while a straggler from the other room  of more than usual  curiosity  had placed himself among them  marking the distinction in  ranks  or rather in situation  merely by the extraordinary care which he  took that none of the scrapings should litter the spotless oaken floor     until this period of the evening  the duties of hospitality and the  observances of religion had prevented familiar discourse  but the offices  of the housewife were now ended for the night  the handmaidens had all  retired to their wheels  and  as the bustle of a busy and more stirring  domestic industry ceased  the cold and self restrained silence which had  hitherto only been broken by distant and brief observations of courtesy   or by some wholesome allusion to the lost and probationary condition of  man  seemed to invite an intercourse of a more general character      you entered my clearing by the southern path   commenced mark heathcote   addressing himself to his guest with sufficient courtesy   and needs must  bring tidings from the towns on the river side  has aught been done by our  councillors  at home  in the matter that pertaineth so closely to the  well being of this colony       you would have me say whether he that now sitteth on the throne of  england  hath listened to the petitions of his people in this province   and hath granted them protection against the abuses which might so readily  flow out of his own ill advised will or out of the violence and injustice  of his successors      we will render unto caesar the things that are caesar s  and speak  reverently of men having authority  i would fain know whether the agent  sent by our people hath gained the ears of those who counsel the prince   and obtained that which he sought       he hath done more   returned the stranger  with singular asperity   he  hath even gained the ear of the lord s anointed       then is charles of better mind  and of stronger justice  than report  hath spoken  we were told that light manners and unprofitable companions  had led him to think more of the vanities of the world  and less of the  wants of those over whom he hath been called by providence to rule  than  is meet for one that sitteth on a high place  i rejoice that the  arguments of the man we sent have prevailed over more evil promptings   and that peace and freedom of conscience are likely to be the fruits of  the undertaking  in what manner hath he seen fit to order the future  government of this people       much as it hath ever stood  by their own ordinances  winthrop hath  returned  and is the bearer of a royal charter  which granteth all the  rights long claimed and practised  none now dwell under the crown of  britain with fewer offensive demands on their consciences  or with lighter  calls on their political duties  than the men of connecticut       it is fitting that thanks should be rendered therefor  where thanks are  most due   said the puritan  folding his hands on his bosom  and sitting  for a moment with closed eyes  like one who communed with an unseen being    is it known by what manner of argument the lord moved the heart of the  prince to hearken to our wants  or was it an open and manifest token of  his power       i think it must needs have been the latter   rejoined the visiter  with a  manner that grew still more caustic and emphatic   the bauble  that was  the visible agent  could not have weighed greatly with one so proudly  seated before the eyes of men      until this point in the discourse  content and ruth  with their  offspring  and the two or three other individuals who composed the  audience  had listened with the demure gravity which characterized the  manners of the country  the language  united with the ill concealed  sarcasm conveyed by the countenance  no less than the emphasis  of the  speaker  caused them now to raise their eyes  as by a common impulse  the  word  bauble  was audibly and curiously repeated  but the look of cold  irony had already passed from the features of the stranger  and it had  given place to a stern and fixed austerity  that imparted a character of  grimness to his hard and sun burnt visage  still he betrayed no  disposition to shrink from the subject  but  after regarding  his auditors  with a glance in which pride and suspicion were strongly blended  he  resumed the discourse      it is known   he added   that the grandfather of him the good people of  these settlements have commissioned to bear their wants over sea  lived in  the favor of the man who last sat upon the throne of england  and a rumor  goeth forth  that the stuart  in a moment of princely condescension  once  decked the finger of his subject  with a ring wrought in a curious  fashion  it was a token of the love which a monarch may bear a man       such gifts are beacons of friendship  but may not be used as gay and  sinful ornaments   observed mark  while the other paused like one who  wished none of the bitterness of his allusions to be lost      it matters not whether the bauble lay in the coffers of the winthrops   or has long been glittering before the eyes of the faithful  in the  bay  since it hath finally proved to be a jewel of price   continued  the stranger   it is said  in secret  that this ring hath returned to  the finger of a stuart  and it is openly proclaimed that connecticut  hath a charter      content and his wife regarded each other in melancholy amazement  such an  evidence of wanton levity and of unworthiness of motive  in one who was  intrusted with the gift of earthly government  pained their simple and  upright minds  while old mark  of still more decided and exaggerated  ideas of spiritual perfection  distinctly groaned aloud the stranger took  a sensible pleasure in this testimony of their abhorrence of so gross and  so unworthy a venality  though he saw no occasion to heighten its effect  by further speech  when his host stood erect  and  in a voice that was  accustomed to obedience  he called on his family to join  in behalf of  the reckless ruler of the land of their fathers  in a petition to him who  alone could soften the hearts of princes  he also arose from his seat   but even in this act of devotion  the stranger bore the air of one who  wished to do pleasure to his entertainers  rather than to obtain that  which was asked     the prayer  though short  was pointed  fervent  and sufficiently personal   the wheels in the outer room ceased their hum  and a general movement  denoted that all there had arisen to join in the office  while one or two  of their number  impelled by deeper piety or stronger interest  drew near  to the open door between the rooms  in order to listen  with this singular  but characteristic interruption  that particular branch of the discourse   which had given rise to it  altogether ceased      and have we reason to dread a rising of the savages on the borders    asked content  when he found that the moved spirit of his father was not  yet sufficiently calmed  to return to the examination of temporal things    one who brought wares from the towns below  a few months since  recited  reasons to fear a movement among the red men      the subject had not sufficient interest to open the ears of the  stranger  he was deaf  or he chose to affect deafness  to the  interrogatory  laying his two large and weather worn  though still  muscular hands  on a visage that was much darkened by exposure  he  appeared to shut out the objects of the world  while he communed deeply   and  as would seem by a slight tremor  that shook even his powerful  frame  terribly  with his own thoughts      we have many to whom our hearts strongly cling  to heighten the smallest  symptom of alarm from that quarter   added the tender and anxious mother   her eye glancing at the uplifted countenances of two little girls  who   busied with their light needle work  sate on stools at her feet   but i  rejoice to see  that one who hath journeyed from parts where the minds of  the savages must be better understood  hath not feared to do it unarmed      the traveller slowly uncovered his features  and the glance that his eye  shot over the face of the last speaker  was not without a gentle and  interested expression  instantly recovering his composure  he arose  and   turning to the double leathern sack  which had been borne on the crupper  of his nag  and which now lay at no great distance from his seat  he drew  a pair of horseman s pistols from two well contrived pockets in its sides   and laid them deliberately on the table      though little disposed to seek an encounter with any bearing the image of  man   he said   i have not neglected the usual precautions of those who  enter the wilderness  here are weapons that  in steady hands  might easily  take life  or  at need preserve it      the young mark drew near with boyish curiosity  and while one finger  ventured to touch a lock  as he stole a conscious glance of wrong doing  towards his mother  he said  with as much of contempt in his air  as the  schooling of his manners would allow       an indian arrow would make a surer aim  than a bore as short as this   when the trainer from the hartford town  struck the wild cat on the hill  clearing  he sent the bullet from a five foot  barrel  besides  this  short sighted gun would be a dull weapon in a hug against the keen edged  knife  that the wicked wampanoag is known to carry         boy  thy years are few  and thy boldness of speech marvellous   sternly  interrupted his parent in the second degree     the stranger manifested no displeasure at the confident language of  the lad  encouraging him with a look  which plainly proclaimed that  martial qualities in no degree lessened the stripling in his favor  he  observed that       the youth who is not afraid to think of the fight  or to reason on its  chances  will lead to a manhood of spirit and independence  a hundred  thousand striplings like this  might have spared winthrop his jewel  and  the stuart the shame of yielding to so vain and so trivial a bribe  but  thou mayst also see  child  that had we come to the death hug  the wicked  wampanoag might have found a blade as keen as his own      the stranger  while speaking  loosened a few strings of his doublet  and  thrust a hand into his bosom  the action enabled more than one eye to  catch a momentary glimpse of a weapon of the same description  but of a  size much smaller than those he had already so freely exhibited  as he  immediately withdrew the member  and again closed the garment with studied  care  no one presumed to advert to the circumstance  but all turned their  attention to the long sharp hunting knife that he deposited by the side of  the pistols  as he concluded  mark ventured to open its blade  but he  turned away with sudden consciousness  when he found that a few fibres of  coarse  shaggy wool  that were drawn from the loosened joint  adhered to  his fingers      straight horns has been against a bush sharper than the thorn    exclaimed whittal ring  who had been at hand  and who watched with  childish admiration the smallest proceedings of the different  individuals   a steel for the back of the blade  a few dried leaves and  broken sticks  with such a carver  would soon make roast and broiled of  the old bell wether himself  i know that the hair of all my colts is  sorrel  and i counted five at sun down  which is just as many as went  loping through the underbrush when i loosened them from the hopples in  the morning  but six and thirty backs can never carry seven and thirty  growing fleeces of unsheared wool  master knows that  for he is a scholar  and can count a hundred      the allusion to the fate of the lost sheep was so plain  as to admit of no  misinterpretation of the meaning of the witless speaker  animals of that  class were of the last importance to the comfort of the settlers  and  there was not probably one within hearing of whittal ring  that was at all  ignorant of the import of his words  indeed  the loud chuckle and the open  and deriding manner with which the lad himself held above his head the  hairy fibres that he had snatched from young mark  allowed of no  concealment  had it been desirable      this feeble gifted youth would hint  that thy knife hath proved its edge  on a wether that is missing from our flock  since the animals went on  their mountain range  in the morning   said the host  calmly  though even  he bent his eye to the floor  as he waited for an answer to a remark   direct as the one his sense of justice  and his indomitable love of right   had prompted     the stranger demanded  in a voice that lost none of its depth or firmness    is hunger a crime  that they who dwell so far from the haunts of  selfishness  visit it with their anger       the foot of christian man never approached the gates of wish ton wish to  be turned away in uncharitableness  but that which is freely given should  not be taken in licentiousness  from off the hill where my flock is wont  to graze  it is easy  through many an opening of the forest  to see these  roofs  and it would have been better that the body should languish  than  that a grievous sin should be placed on that immortal spirit which is  already too deeply laden  unless thou art far more happy than others of  the fallen race of adam       mark heathcote   said the accused  and ever with an unwavering tone    look further at those weapons  which  if a guilty man  i have weakly  placed within thy power  thou wilt find more there to wonder at  than a  few straggling hairs  that the spinner would cast from her as too coarse  for service       it is long since i found pleasure in handling the weapons of strife  may  it be longer to the time when they shall be needed in this abode of peace   these are instruments of death  resembling those used in my youth  by  cavaliers that rode in the levies of the first charles  and of his  pusillanimous father  there were worldly pride and great vanity  with much  and damning ungodliness  in the wars that i have seen  my children  and  yet the carnal man found pleasure in the stirrings of those graceless  days  come hither  younker  thou hast often sought to know the manner in  which the horsemen are wont to lead into the combat  when the  broad mouthed artillery and pattering leaden hail have cleared a passage  for the struggle of horse to horse  and man to man  much of the  justification of these combats must depend on the inward spirit  and on  the temper of him that striketh at the life of fellow sinner  but  righteous joshua  it is known  contended with the heathen throughout a  supernatural day  and therefore always humbly confiding that our cause is  just  i will open to thy young mind the uses of a weapon that hath never  before been seen in these forests       i have hefted many a heavier piece than this   said young mark  frowning   equally with the exertion and with the instigations of his aspiring  spirit  as he held out the ponderous weapon in a single hand   we have  guns that might tame a wolf with greater certainty than any barrel of a  bore less than my own height  tell  me grand ther  at what distance do the  mounted warriors  you so often name  take their sight      but the power of speech appeared suddenly to have deserted the aged  veteran  he had interrupted his own discourse  and now  instead of  answering the interrogatory of the boy  his eye wandered slowly and with a  look of painful doubt from the weapon  that he still held before him  to  the countenance of the stranger  the latter continued erect  like one  courting a strict and meaning examination of his person  this dumb show  could not fail to attract the observation of content  rising from his  seat  with that quiet but authoritative manner which is still seen in the  domestic government of the people of the region where he dwelt  he  beckoned to all present to quit the apartment  ruth and her daughters  the  hirelings  the ill gifted whittal  and even the reluctant mark  preceded  him to the door  which he closed with respectful care  and then the whole  of the wondering party mingled with those of the outer room  leaving the  one they had quitted to the sole possession of the aged chief of the  settlement  and to his still unknown and mysterious guest     many anxious  and to those who were excluded seemingly interminable  minutes passed  and  the secret interview appeared to draw no nearer its  close  that deep reverence  which the years  paternity  and character of  the grandfather had inspired  prevented all from approaching the quarter  of the apartment nearest to the room they had left  but a silence  still  as the grave  did all that silence could do  to enlighten their minds in a  matter of so much general interest  the deep  smothered sentences of the  speakers were often heard  each dwelling with steadiness and propriety on  his particular theme  but no sound that conveyed meaning to the minds of  those without passed the envious walls  at length  the voice of old mark  became more than usually audible  and then content arose  with a gesture  to those around him to imitate his example  the young men threw aside the  subjects of their light employments  the maidens left the wheels which had  not been turned for many minutes  and the whole party disposed themselves  in the decent and simple attitude of prayer  for the third time that  evening was the voice of the puritan heard  pouring out his spirit in a  communion with that being on whom it was his practice to repose all his  worldly cares  but  though long accustomed to all the peculiar forms of  utterance by which their father ordinarily expressed his pious emotions   neither content nor his attentive partner was enabled to decide on the  nature of the feeling that was now uppermost  at times  it appeared to be  the language of thanksgiving  and at others it assumed more of the  imploring sounds of deprecation and petition  in short  it was so varied   and  though tranquil  so equivocal  if such a term may be applied to so  serious a subject  as completely to baffle every conjecture     long and weary minutes passed after the voice had entirely ceased  and yet  no summons was given to the expecting family  nor did any sound proceed  from the inner room  which the respectful son was emboldened to construe  into an evidence that he might presume to enter  at length  apprehension  began to mingle with conjectures  and then the husband and wife communed  apart  in whispers  the misgivings and doubt of the former soon manifested  themselves in still more apparent forms  he arose  and was seen pacing the  wide apartment  gradually approaching nearer to the partition which  separated the two rooms  evidently prepared to retire beyond the limits of  hearing  the moment he should detect any proofs that his uneasiness was  without a sufficient cause  still no sound proceeded from the inner room   the breathless silence which had so shortly before reigned where he was   appeared to be suddenly transferred to the spot in which he was vainly  endeavoring to detect the smallest proof of human existence  again he  returned to ruth  and again they consulted  in low voices  as to the step  that filial duty seemed to require at their hands      we were not bidden to withdraw   said his gentle companion   why not  rejoin our parent  now that time has been given to understand the subject  which so evidently disturbed his mind      content  at length  yielded to this opinion  with that cautious  discretion which distinguishes his people  he motioned to the family to  follow  in order that no unnecessary exclusion should give rise to  conjectures  or excite suspicions  for which  after all  the  circumstances might prove no justification  notwithstanding the subdued  manners of the age and country  curiosity  and perhaps a better feeling   had become so intense  as to cause all present to obey this silent  mandate  by moving as swiftly towards the open door as a never yielding  decency of demeanor would permit     old mark heathcote occupied the chair in which he had been left  with  that calm and unbending gravity of eye and features which were then  thought indispensable to a fitting sobriety of spirit  but the  stranger had disappeared  there were two or three outlets by which the  room  and even the house  might be quitted  without the knowledge of  those who had so long waited for admission  and the first impression  led the family to expect the re appearance of the absent man through one  of these exterior passages  content  however  read in the expression of  his father s eye  that the moment of confidence  if it were ever to  arrive  had not yet come  and  so admirable and perfect was the  domestic discipline of this family  that the questions which the son  did not see fit to propound  no one of inferior condition  or lesser  age  might presume to agitate  with the person of the stranger  every  evidence of his recent visit had also vanished     mark missed the weapon that had excited his admiration  whittal looked in  vain for the hunting knife  which had betrayed the fate of the wether   mrs  heathcote saw  by a hasty glance of the eye  that the leathern sacks   which she had borne in mind ought to be transferred to the sleeping  apartment of their guest  were gone  and a mild and playful image of  herself  who bore her name no less than most of those features which had  rendered her own youth more than usually attractive  sought  without  success  a massive silver spur  of curious and antique workmanship  which  she had been permitted to handle until the moment when the family had been  commanded to withdraw     the night had now worn later than the hour at which it was usual for  people of habits so simple to be out of their beds  the grandfather  lighted a taper  and  after bestowing the usual blessing on those around  him  with an air as calm as if nothing had occurred  he prepared to retire  into his own room  and yet  matter of interest seemed to linger on his  mind  even on the threshold of the door  he turned  and  for an instant   all expected some explanation of a circumstance which began to wear no  little of the aspect of an exciting and painful mystery  but their hopes  were raised only to be disappointed      my thoughts have not kept the passage of the time   he said   in what  hour of the night are we  my son      he was told that it was already past the usual moment of sleep      no matter  that which providence hath bestowed for our comfort and  support  should not be lightly and unthankfully disregarded  take thou the  beast i am wont to ride  thyself  content  and follow the path which  leadeth to the mountain clearing  bring away that which shall meet thine  eye  near the first turning of the route toward the river towns  we have  got into the last quarter of the year  and in order that our industry may  not flag  and that all may be stirring with the sun  let the remainder of  the household seek their rest      content saw  by the manner of his father  that no departure from the  strict letter of these instructions was admissible  he closed the door  after his retiring form  and then  by a quiet gesture of authority   indicated to his dependants that they were expected to withdraw  the  maidens of ruth led the children to their chambers  and in a few more  minutes  none remained in the outer apartment  already so often named  but  the obedient son  with his anxious and affectionate consort      i will be thy companion  husband   ruth half whisperingly commenced  so  soon as the little domestic preparations for leaving the fires and  securing the doors were ended   i like not that thou shouldst go into the  forest alone  at so late an hour of the night       one will be with me  there  who never deserteth those who rely on his  protection  besides  my ruth  what is there to apprehend in a wilderness  like this  the beasts have been lately hunted from the hills  and   excepting those who dwell under our own roof  there is not one within a  long day s ride       we know not  where is the stranger that came within our doors as the sun  was setting       as thou sayest  we know not  my father is not minded to open his lips on  the subject of this traveller  and surely we are not now to learn the  lessons of obedience and self denial       it would  notwithstanding  be a great easing to the spirit to hear at  least the name of him who hath eaten of our bread  and joined in our  family worship  though he were immediately to pass away for ever from  before the sight       that may he have done  already

and his wife now quitted the dwelling  by the only door that was  left unbarred  lighted by a moon that was full  though clouded they passed  a gateway between two of the outer buildings  and descended to the  palisadoes  the bars and bolts of the little postern were removed  and in  a few minutes  the former  mounted on the back of his father s own horse   was galloping briskly along the path which led into the part of the forest  he was directed to seek     while the husband was thus proceeding  in obedience to orders that he  never hesitated to obey his faithful wife withdrew within the shelter of  the wooden defences  more in compliance with a precaution that was become  habitual  than from any present causes of suspicion  she drew a single  bolt and remained at the postern

she proved to content  in the midst of the utmost  equanimity of temper and of deportment  her watchful solicitude in behalf  of the few who formed the limited circle of her existence  never  slumbered  it dwelt unpretendingly but active in her gentle bosom  like a  great and moving principle of life  though circumstances had placed her  on a remote and exposed frontier  where time had not been given for the  several customary divisions of employments  she was unchanged in habits   in feelings  and in character  the affluence of her husband had elevated  her above the necessity of burthensome toil  and  while she had  encountered the dangers of the wilderness  and neglected none of the  duties of her active station  she had escaped most of those injurious  consequences which are a little apt to impair the peculiar loveliness of  woman  notwithstanding the exposure of a border life  she remained  feminine  attractive  and singularly youthful     the reader will readily imagine the state of mind  with which such a being  watched the distant form of a husband  engaged in a duty like that we have  described  notwithstanding the influence of long habit  the forest was  rarely approached  after night fall  by the boldest woodsman  without some  secret consciousness that he encountered a positive danger  it was the  hour when its roaming and hungry tenants were known to be most in motion   and the rustling of a leaf  or the snapping of a dried twig beneath the  light tread of the smallest animal  was apt to conjure images of the  voracious and fire eyed panther  or perhaps of a lurking biped  which   though more artful  was known to be scarcely less savage  it is true  that  hundreds experienced the uneasiness of such sensations  who were never  fated to undergo the realities of the fearful pictures  still  facts were  not wanting to supply sufficient motive for a grave and reasonable  apprehension     histories of combats with beasts of prey  and of massacres by roving and  lawless indians  were the moving legends of the border  thrones might be  subverted  and kingdoms lost and won  in distant europe  and less should  be said of the events  by those who dwelt in these woods  than of one  scene of peculiar and striking forest incident  that called for the  exercise of the stout courage and the keen intelligence of a settler  such  a tale passed from mouth to mouth  with the eagerness of powerful personal  interest  and many were already transmitted from parent to child  in the  form of tradition  until  as in more artificial communities  graver  improbabilities creep into the doubtful pages of history  exaggeration  became too closely blended with truth  ever again to be separated     under the influence of these feelings  and perhaps prompted by his  never failing discretion  content had thrown a well tried piece over his  shoulder  and when he rose the ascent on which his father had met the  stranger  ruth caught a glimpse of his form  bending on the neck of his  horse  and gliding through the misty light of the hour  resembling one of  those fancied images of wayward and hard riding sprites  of which the  tales of the eastern continent are so fond of speaking     then followed anxious moments  during which neither sight nor hearing  could in the least aid the conjectures of the attentive wife  she listened  without breathing  and once or twice she thought the blows of hoofs   falling on the earth harder and quicker than common  might be  distinguished  but it was only as content mounted the sudden ascent of the  hill side  that he was again seen  for a brief instant  while dashing  swiftly into the cover of the woods     though ruth had been familiar with the cares of the frontier  perhaps she  had never known a moment more intensely painful than that  when the form  of her husband became blended with the dark trunks of the trees  the time  was to her impatience longer than usual  and under the excitement of a  feverish inquietude  that had no definite object  she removed the single  bolt that held the postern closed  and passed entirely without the  stockade to her oppressed senses  the palisadoes appeared to place limits  to her vision  still  weary minute passed after minute  without bringing  relief  during these anxious moments  she became more than usually  conscious of the insulated situation in which he and all who were dearest  to her heart were placed  the feelings of a wife prevailed  quitting the  side of the acclivity  she began to walk slowly along the path her husband  had taken  until apprehension insensibly urged her into a quicker  movement  she had paused only when she stood nearly in the centre of the  clearing  on the eminence where her father had halted that evening to  contemplate the growing improvement of his estate     here her steps were suddenly arrested  for she thought a form was issuing  from the forest  at that interesting spot which her eyes had never ceased  to watch  it proved to be no more than the passing shadow of a cloud  denser than common  which threw the body of its darkness on the trees  and  a portion of its outline on the ground near the margin of the wood  just  at this instant  the recollection that she had incautiously left the  postern open flashed upon her mind  and  with feelings divided between  husband and children  she commenced her return  in order to repair a  neglect  to which habit  no less than prudence  imparted a high degree of  culpability  the eyes of the mother  for the feelings of that sacred  character were now powerfully uppermost  were fastened on the ground  as  she eagerly picked her way along the uneven surface  and  so engrossed was  her mind by the omission of duty with which she was severely reproaching  herself  that they drank in objects without conveying distinct or  intelligible images to her brain     notwithstanding the one engrossing thought of the moment  something met  her eye that caused even the vacant organ to recoil  and every fibre in  her frame to tremble with terror  there was a moment in which delirium  nearly heightened terror to madness  reflection came only when ruth had  reached the distance of many feet from the spot where this startling  object had half unconsciously crossed her vision  then for a single and a  fearful instant she paused  like one who debated on the course she ought  to follow  maternal love prevailed  and the deer of her own woods scarcely  bounds with greater agility  than the mother of the sleeping and  defenceless family now fled towards the dwellings  panting and breathless  she gained the postern  which was closed  with hands that performed their  office more by instinct than in obedience to thought  and doubly and  trebly barred     for the first time in some minutes  ruth now breathed distinctly and  without pain  she strove to rally her thoughts  in order to deliberate on  the course that prudence and her duty to content  who was still exposed to  the danger she had herself escaped  prescribed  her first impulse was to  give the established signal that was to recall the laborers from the  field  or to awake the sleepers  in the event of an alarm  but better  reflection told her that such a step might prove fatal to him who balanced  in her affections against the rest of the world the struggle in her mind  only ended  as she clearly and unequivocally caught a view of her husband   issuing from the forest  at the very point where he had entered  the  return path unfortunately led directly past the spot where such sudden  terror had seized her mind  she would have given worlds to have known how  to apprize him of a danger with which her own imagination was full   without communicating the warning to other and terrible ears  the night  was still  and though the distance was considerable  it was not so great  as to render the chances of success desperate  scarcely knowing what she  did  and yet preserving  by a sort of instinctive prudence  the caution  which constant exposure weaves into all our habits  the trembling woman  made the effort      husband  husband   she cried  commencing plaintively  but her voice  rising with the energy of excitement   husband  ride swiftly  our little  ruth lyeth in the agony  for her life and thine  ride at thy horse s  speed  seek not the stables  but come with all haste to the postern  it  shall be open to thee      this was certainly a fearful summons for a father s ear  and there is  little doubt that  had the feeble powers of ruth succeeded in conveying  the words as far as she had wished  they would have produced the desired  effect  but in vain did she call  her weak tones  though raised on the  notes of the keenest apprehension  could not force their way across so  wide a space  and yet  had she reason to think they were not entirely  lost  for once her husband paused and seemed to listen  and once he  quickened the pace of his horse  though neither of these proofs of  intelligence was followed by any further signs of his having understood  the alarm     content was now upon the hillock itself  if ruth breathed at all during  its passage  it was more imperceptibly than the gentlest respiration of  the sleeping infant  but when she saw him trotting with unconscious  security along the path on the side next the dwellings  her impatience  broke through all restraint  and throwing open the postern  she renewed  her cries  in a voice that was no longer useless  the clattering of the  unshodden hoof was again rapid  and in another minute her husband galloped  unharmed to her side      enter   said the nearly dizzy wife  seizing the bridle and leading the  horse within the palisadoes   enter  husband  for the love of all that is  thine  enter  and be thankful       what meaneth this terror  ruth   demanded content  in as much  displeasure  perhaps  as he could manifest to one so gentle  for a  weakness betrayed in his own behalf   is thy confidence in him whose eye  never closeth  and who equally watcheth the life of man and that of the  falling sparrow  lost      ruth was deaf  with hurried hands she drew the fastenings  let fall the  bars  and turned a key which forced a triple bolted lock to perform its  office  not till then did she feel either safe herself  or at liberty to  render thanks for the safety of him  over whose danger she had so lately  watched  in agony      why this care  hast forgotten that the horse will suffer hunger  at this  distance from the rack and manger       better that he starve  than hair of thine should come to harm       nay  nay  ruth  dost not remember that the beast is the favorite of my  father  who will ill brook his passing a night within the palisadoes       husband  you err  there is one in the fields       is there place  where one is not       but i have seen creature of mortal birth  and creature too that hath no  claim on thee  or thine  and who trespasseth on our peace  no less than on  our natural rights  to be where he lurketh       go to  thou art not used to be so late from thy pillow  my poor ruth   sleep hath come over thee  whilst standing on thy watch  some cloud hath  left its shadow on the fields  or  truly  it may be that the hunt did not  drive the beasts as far from the clearing as we had thought  come  since  thou wilt cling to my side  lay hand on the bridle of the horse  while i  ease him of his burthen      as content coolly proceeded to the task he had mentioned  the thoughts of  his wife were momentarily diverted from their other sources of uneasiness   by the object which lay on the crupper of the nag and which  until now   had entirely escaped her observation      here is  indeed  the animal this day missing from our flock   she  exclaimed  as the carcass of a sheep fell heavily on the ground      ay  and killed with exceeding judgment  if not aptly dressed to our  hands  mutton will not be wanting for the husking feast  and the stalled  creature whose days were counted may live another season       and where didst find the slaughtered beast       on the limb of a growing hickory  eben dudley  with all his sleight in  butchering  and in setting forth the excellence of his meats  could not  have left an animal hanging from the branch of a sapling  with greater  knowledge of his craft  thou seest  but a single meal is missing from the  carcass  and that thy fleece is unharmed       this is not the work of a pequod   exclaimed ruth  surprised at her own  discovery   the red men do their mischief with less care       nor has the tooth of wolf opened the veins of poor straight horns  here  has been judgment in the slaughtering  as well as prudence in  consumption of the food  the hand that cut so lightly  had intention of  a second visit       and our father bid thee seek the creature where it was found  husband  i  fear some heavy judgment for the sins of the parents  is likely to befall  the children       the babes are quietly in their slumbers  and  thus far  little wrong hath  been done us  i ll cast the halter from the stalled animal ere i sleep   and straight horns shall content us for the husking  we may have mutton  less savory  for this evil chance  but the number of thy flock will be  unaltered       and where is he  who hath mingled in our prayers  and hath eaten of our  bread  he who counselled so long in secret with our father  and who hath  now vanished from among us  like a vision       that indeed is a question not readily to be answered   returned content   who had hitherto maintained a cheerful air  in order to appease what he  was fain to believe a causeless terror in the bosom of his partner  but  who was induced by this question to drop his head like one that sought  reasons within the repository of his own thoughts   it mattereth not   ruth heathcote  the ordering of the affair is in the hands of a man of  many years and great experience  should his aged wisdom fail  do we not  know that one even wiser than he  hath us in his keeping  i will return  the beast to his rack  and when we shall have jointly asked favor of eyes  that never sleep  we will go in confidence to our rest       husband  thou quittest not the palisadoes again this night   said ruth   arresting the hand that had already drawn a bolt  ere she spoke   i have a  warning of evil       i would the stranger had found some other shelter in which to pass his  short resting season  that he hath made free with my flock  and that he  hath administered to his hunger at some cost  when a single asking would  have made him welcome to the best that the owner of the wish ton wish can  command  are truths that may not be denied  still is he mortal man  as a  goodly appetite hath proven  even should our belief in providence so far  waver as to harbor doubts of its unwillingness to suffer beings of  injustice to wander in our forms and substance  i tell thee  ruth  that  the nag will be needed for to morrow s service  and that our father will  give but ill thanks should we leave it to make a bed on this cold  hill side  go to thy rest and to thy prayers  trembler  i will close the  postern with all care  fear not  the stranger is of human wants  and his  agency to do evil must needs be limited by human power       i fear none of white blood  nor of christian parentage  the murderous  heathen is in our fields       thou dreamest  ruth        tis not a dream  i have seen the glowing eye balls of a savage  sleep  was little like to come over me  when set upon a watch like this  i  thought me that the errand was of unknown character  and that our father  was exceedingly aged  and that perchance his senses might be duped  and  how an obedient son ought not to be exposed   thou knowest  heathcote   that i could not look upon the danger of my children s father with  indifference  and i followed to the nut tree hillock       to the nut tree  it was not prudent in thee  but the postern       it was open  for were the key turned  who was there to admit us quickly   had haste been needed   returned ruth  momentarily averting her face to  conceal the flush excited by conscious delinquency   though i failed in  caution   twas for thy safety  heathcote  but on that hillock  and in the  hollow left by a fallen tree  lies concealed a heathen       i passed the nut wood in going to the shambles of our strange butcher   and i drew the rein to give breath to the nag near it  as we returned with  the burthen  it cannot be  some creature of the forest hath alarmed thee       ay  creature  formed  fashioned gifted like ourselves  in all but color  of the skin and blessing of the faith       this is strange delusion  if there were enemy at hand  would men subtle  as those you fear  suffer the master of the dwelling  and truly i may say  it without vain glory  one as likely as another to struggle stoutly for  his own  to escape  when an ill timed visit to the woods had delivered him  unresisting into their hands  go  go  good ruth  thou mayst have seen a  blackened log  perchance the frosts have left a fire fly untouched  or it  may be that some prowling bear has scented out the sweets of thy  lately gathered hives      ruth again laid her hand firmly on the arm of her husband  who had  withdrawn another bolt  and  looking him steadily in the face  she  answered by saying solemnly  and with touching pathos       think st thou  husband  that a mother s eye could be deceived      it might have been that the allusion to the tender beings whose fate  depended on his care  or that the deeply serious  though mild and gentle  manner of his consort  produced some fresher impression on the mind of  content  instead of undoing the fastenings of the postern as he had  intended  he deliberately drew its bolts again and paused to think      if it produce no other benefit than to quiet thy fears  good ruth   he  said  after a moment of reflection   a little caution will be well repaid   stay you  then  here  where the hillock may be watched  while i go wake a  couple of the people  with stout eben dudley and experienced reuben ring  to back me  my father s horse may surely be stabled      ruth contentedly assumed a task that she was quite equal to perform with  intelligence and zeal   hie thee to the laborers  chambers  for i see a  light still burning in the room of those you seek   was the answer she  gave to a proposal that at least quieted the intenseness of her fears for  him in whose behalf they had so lately been excited nearly to agony      it shall be quickly done  nay  stand not thus openly between the beams   wife  thou mayst place thyself  here  at the doublings of the wood   beneath the loop  where harm would scarcely reach thee  though shot from  artillery were to crush the timber      with this admonition to be wary of a danger that he had so recently  affected to despise  content departed on his errand  the two laborers he  had mentioned by name  were youths of mould and strength  and they were  well inured to toil  no less than to the particular privations and dangers  of a border life  like most men of their years and condition  they were  practised too in the wiles of indian cunning  and though the province of  connecticut  compared to other settlements  had suffered but little in  this species of murderous warfare  they both had martial feats and  perilous experiences of their own to recount  during the light labors of  the long winter evenings     content crossed the court with a quick step  for  notwithstanding his  steady unbelief  the image of his gentle wife posted on her outer watch  hurried his movements  the rap he gave at the door  on reaching the  apartment of those he sought  was loud as it was sudden      who calls   demanded a deep toned and firm voice from within  at the  first blow of the knuckles on the plank      quit thy beds quickly  and come forth with the arms appointed for a  sally       that is soon done   answered a stout woodsman  throwing open the door and  standing before content in the garments he had worn throughout the day    we were just dreaming that the night was not to pass without a summons to  the loops       hast seen aught       our eyes were not shut  more than those of others  we saw him enter that  no man hath seen depart       come  fellow  whittal ring would scarce give wiser speech than this  cunning reply of thine  my wife is at the postern  and it is fit we go to  relieve her watch  thou wilt not forget the horns of powder  since it  would not tell to our credit  were there service for the pieces  and we  lacking in wherewithal to give them a second discharge      the hirelings obeyed  and  as little time was necessary to arm those who  never slept without weapons and ammunition within reach of their hands   content was speedily followed by his dependants  ruth was found at her  post  but when urged by her husband to declare what had passed in his  absence  she was compelled to admit that  though the moon had come forth  brighter and clearer from behind the clouds  she had seen nothing to add  to her alarm      we will then lead the beast to his stall  and close our duty by setting  a single watcher for the rest of the night   said the husband   reuben  shall keep the postern  while eben and i will have a care for my  father s nag  not forgetting the carcass for the husking feast  dost  hear  deaf dudley   cast the mutton upon the crupper of the beast  and  follow to the stables       here has been no common workman at my office   said the blunt eben  who   though an ordinary farm laborer  according to an usage still very  generally prevalent in the country  was also skilful in the craft of the  butcher   i have brought many a wether to his end  but this is the first  sheep  within all my experience  that hath kept the fleece while a  portion of the body has been in the pot  lie there  poor straight horns   if quiet thou canst be after such strange butchery  reuben  i paid thee   as the sun rose  a spanish piece in silver  for the trifle of debt that  lay between us  in behalf of the good turn thou didst the shoes  which  were none the better for the last hunt in the hills  hast ever that  pistareen about thee      this question  which was put in a lowered tone  and only to the ear of the  party concerned  was answered in the affirmative      give it me  lad  in the morning  thou shalt be paid  with usurer s  interest      another summons from content  who had now led the nag loaded with the  carcass of the sheep without the postern  cut short the secret conference   eben dudley  having received the coin  hastened to follow  but the  distance to the out buildings was sufficient to enable him to effect his  mysterious purpose without discovery  whilst content endeavored to calm  the apprehensions of his wife  who still persisted in sharing his danger   by such reasons as he could on the instant command  the credulous dudley  placed the thin piece of silver between his teeth  and  with a pressure  that denoted the prodigious force of his jaws  caused it to assume a  beaten and rounded shape  he then slily dropped the battered coin into the  muzzle of his gun  taking care to secure its presence  until he himself  should send it on its disenchanting message  by a wad torn from the lining  of part of his vestments  supported by this redoubtable auxiliary  the  superstitious but still courageous borderer followed his companion   whistling a low air that equally denoted his indifference to danger of an  ordinary nature  and his sensibility to impressions of a less earthly  character     they who dwell in the older districts of america  where art and labor  have united for generations to clear the earth of its inequalities  and to  remove the vestiges of a state of nature  can form but little idea of the  thousand objects that may exist in a clearing  to startle the imagination  of one who has admitted alarm  when seen in the doubtful light of even a  cloudless moon  still less can they who have never quitted the old world   and who  having only seen  can only imagine fields smooth as the surface  of tranquil water  picture the effect produced by those lingering  remnants  which may be likened to so many mouldering monuments of the  fallen forest scattered at such an hour over a broad surface of open land   accustomed as they were to the sight  content and his partner  excited by  their fears  fancied each dark and distant stump a savage  and they passed  no angle in the high and heavy fences without throwing a jealous glance to  see that some enemy did not lie stretched within its shadows     still no new motive for apprehension arose  during the brief period that  the two adventurers were employed in administering to the comfort of the  puritan s steed  the task was ended  the carcass of the slaughtered  straight horns had been secured  and ruth was already urging her husband  to return  when their attention was drawn to the attitude and mien of  their companion      the man hath departed as he came   said eben dudley  who stood shaking  his head in open doubt  before an empty stall   here is no beast  though  with these eyes did i see the half wit bring hither a well filled measure  of speckled oats  to feed the nag  he who favored us with his presence at  the supper and the thanksgiving  hath tired of his company before the hour  of rest had come       the horse is truly wanting   said content   the man must needs be in  exceeding haste  to have ridden into the forest as the night grew deepest   and when the longest summer day would scarce bring a better hack than  that he rode to another christian dwelling  there is reason for this  industry  but it is enough that it concerns us not  we will now seek our  rest  in the certainty that one watcheth our slumbers whose vigilance can  never fail      though man could not trust himself to sleep in that country without the  security of bars and bolts  we have already had occasion to say that  property was guarded with but little care  the stable door was merely  closed by a wooden latch  and the party returned from this short sortie   with steps that were a little quickened by a sense of an uneasiness that  beset them in forms suited to their several characters  but shelter was at  hand  and it was speedily regained      thou hast seen nothing   said content to reuben ring  who had been chosen  for his quick eye  and a sagacity that was as remarkable as was his  brother s impotency   thou hast seen nothing at thy watch       nought unusual  and yet i like not yonder billet of wood  near to the  fence against the knoll  if it were not so plainly a half burnt log  one  might fancy there is life in it  but when fancy is at work  the sight is  keen  once or twice i have thought it seemed to be rolling towards the  brook  i am not  even now  certain that when first seen it did not lie  eight or ten feet higher against the bank       it may be a living thing       on the faith of a woodman s eye  it well may be   said eben dudley   but  should it be haunted by a legion of wicked spirits  one may bring it to  quiet from the loop at the nearest corner  stand aside  madam heathcote    for the character and wealth of the proprietors of the valley  gave ruth a  claim to this term of respect among the laborers   let me thrust the piece  through the  stop  there is an especial charm in the gun  which it might  be sinful to waste on such a creature  it may be no more than some  sweet toothed bear  i will answer for the charge at my own cost  if thou  wilt lend me thy musket  reuben ring       it shall not be   said his master   one known to my father hath this  night entered our dwelling and fed at our board  if he hath departed in a  way but little wont among those of this colony  yet hath he done no great  wrong  i will go nigh  and examine with less risk of error      there was  in this proposal  too much of that spirit of right doing which  governed all of those simple regions  to meet serious opposition  content   supported by eben dudley  again quitted the postern  and proceeded  directly  though still not without sufficient caution  towards the point  where the suspicious object lay  a bend in the fence had first brought it  into view  for previously to reaching that point  its apparent direction  might for some distance have been taken under shelter of the shadows of  the rails  which  at the immediate spot where it was seen  were turned  suddenly in a line with the eyes of the spectators  it seemed as if the  movements of those who approached were watched  for the instant they left  the defences  the dark object was assuredly motionless  even the keen eye  of reuben ring beginning to doubt whether some deception of vision had not  led him  after all  to mistake a billet of wood for a creature of life     but content and his companion were not induced to change their  determination  even when within fifty feet of the object  though the moon  fell full and brightly upon the surface  its character baffled conjecture   one affirmed it was the end of a charred log  many of which still lay  scattered about the fields  and the other believed it some cringing animal  of the woods  twice content raised his piece to tire  and as often did he  let it fall  in reluctance to do injury to even a quadruped of whose  character he was ignorant  it is more than probable that his less  considerate  and but half obedient companion would have decided the  question soon after leaving he postern  had not the peculiar contents of  his musket rendered him delicate of its uses        look to thy weapons   said the former  loosening his own hunting knife in  its sheath   we will draw near  and make certainty of what is doubtful      they did so  and the gun of dudley was thrust rudely into the side of the  object of their distrust  before it again betrayed life or motion  then   indeed  as if further disguise was useless  an indian lad  of some fifteen  years  rose deliberately to his feet  and stood before them in the sullen  dignity of a captured warrior  content hastily seized the stripling by an  arm  and followed by eben  who occasionally quickened the footsteps of the  prisoner by an impetus obtained from the breech of his own musket  they  hurriedly returned within the defences      my life against that of straight horns  which is now of no great value    said dudley  as he pushed the last bolt of the fastenings into its  socket   we hear no more of this red skin s companions to night i never  knew an indian raise his whoop  when a scout had fallen into the hands of  the enemy       this may be true   returned the other   and yet must a sleeping  household be guarded  we may be brought to rely on the overlooking favor  of providence  working with the means of our own manhood  ere the sun  shall arise      content was a man of few words  but one of exceeding steadiness and  resolution in moments of need  he was perfectly aware that an indian  youth  like him he had captured  would not have been found in that place   and under the circumstances in which he was actually taken  without a  design of sufficient magnitude to justify the hazard  the tender age of  the stripling  too  forbade the belief that he was unaccompanied  but he  silently agreed with his laboring man that the capture would probably  cause the attack  if any such were meditated  to be deferred  he therefore  instructed his wife to withdraw into her chamber  while he took measures  to defend the dwelling in the last emergency  without giving any  unnecessary alarm  a measure that would have produced less effect on an  enemy without  than the imposing stillness which now reigned within the  defences  he ordered two or three more of the stoutest of his dependants  to be summoned to the palisadoes  a keen scrutiny was made into the state  of all the different outlets of the place  muskets were carefully  examined  charges were given to be watchful  and regular sentinels were  stationed within the shadows of the buildings  at points where  unseen  themselves  they could look out in safety upon the fields     content then took his captive  with whom he had made no attempt to  exchange a syllable  and led him to the block house  the door which  communicated with the basement of this building was always open  in  readiness for refuge in the event of any sudden alarm  he entered  caused  the lad to mount by a ladder to the floor above  and then withdrawing the  means of retreat  he turned the key without  in perfect confidence that  his prisoner was secure     notwithstanding all this care  morning had nearly dawned before the  prudent father and husband sought his pillow  his steadiness however had  prevented the apprehensions  which kept his own eyes and those of his  gentle partner so long open  from attending beyond the few whose services  were  in such an emergency  deemed indispensable to safety  towards the  last watches of the night  only  did the images of the scenes through  which they had just passed  become dim and confused  and then both husband  and wife slept soundly  and happily without disturbance           chapter v            are you so brave  i ll have you talked with anon        coriolanus       the axe and the brand had been early and effectually used  immediately  around the dwelling of the heathcotes  a double object had been gained by  removing most of the vestiges of the forest from the vicinity of the  buildings  the necessary improvements were executed with greater facility   and  a consideration of no small importance  the cover  which the american  savage is known to seek in his attacks  was thrown to a distance that  greatly diminished the danger of a surprise     favored by the advantage which had been obtained by this foresight  and by  the brilliancy of a night that soon emulated the brightness of day  the  duty of eben dudley and of his associate on the watch was rendered easy of  accomplishment  indeed  so secure did they become towards morning  chiefly  on account of the capture of the indian lad  that more than once  eyes   that should have been differently employed  yielded to the drowsiness of  the hour and to habit  or were only opened at intervals that left their  owners in some doubt as to the passage of the intermediate time  but no  sooner did the signs of day approach  than  agreeably to their  instructions  the watchers sought their beds  and for an hour or two  they  slept soundly and without fear     when his father had closed the prayers of the morning  content  in the  midst of the assembled family  communicated as many of the incidents of  the past night as in his judgment seemed necessary  his discretion limited  the narrative to the capture of the native youth  and to the manner in  which he had ordered the watch for the security of the family on the  subject of his own excursion to the forest  and all connected therewith   he was guardedly silent     it is unnecessary to relate the manner in which this startling information  was received  the cold and reserved brow of the puritan became still more  thoughtful  the young men looked grave  but resolute  the maidens of the  household grew pale  shuddered  and whispered hurriedly together  while  the little ruth  and a female child of nearly her own age  named martha   clung close to the side of the mistress of the family  who  having nothing  new to learn  had taught herself to assume the appearance of a resolution  she was far from feeling     the first visitation which befell the listeners  after their eager ears  had drunk in the intelligence content so briefly imparted  was a renewal  of the spiritual strivings of his father in the form of prayer  a  particular petition was put up in quest of light on their future  proceedings  for mercy on all men  for a better mind to those who wandered  through the wilderness seeking victims of their wrath  for the gifts of  grace on the heathen  and finally for victory over all their carnal  enemies  let them come whence or in what aspect they might     fortified by these additional exercises  old mark next made himself the  master of all the signs and evidences of the approach of danger  by a more  rigid and minute inquiry into the visible circumstances of the arrest of  the young savage  content received a merited and grateful reward for his  prudence  in the approbation of one whom he still continued to revere with  a mental dependence little less than that with which he had leaned on his  father s wisdom in the days of his childhood      thou hast done well and wisely   said his father   but more remaineth to  be performed by thy wisdom and fortitude  we have had tidings that the  heathen near the providence plantations are unquiet  and that they are  lending their minds to wicked counsellors  we are not to sleep in too much  security  because a forest journey of a few days lies between their  villages and our own clearing  bring forth the captive  i will question  him on the matter of this visit      until now  so much did the fears of all turn towards the enemies who were  believed to be lurking near  that little thought had been bestowed on the  prisoner in the block house  content  who well knew the invincible  resolution  no less than the art of an indian  had forborne to question  him when taken  for he believed the time to be better suited to vigilant  action  than to interrogatories that the character of the boy was likely  to render perfectly useless  he now proceeded  however  with an interest  that began to quicken as circumstances rendered its indulgence less  unsuitable  to seek his captive  in order to bring him before the  searching ordeal of his father s authority     the key of the lower door of the block house hung where it had been  deposited  the ladder was replaced  and content mounted quietly to the  apartment where he had placed his captive  the room was the lowest of  three that the building contained  all being above that which might be  termed its basement  the latter  having up aperture but its door  was a  dark  hexagonal space  partly filled with such articles as might be needed  in the event of an alarm  and which  at the same time  were frequently  required for the purposes of domestic use  in the centre of the area was  a deep well  so fitted and protected by a wall of stone  as to admit of  water being drawn into the rooms above  the door itself was of massive  hewn timber  the squared logs of the upper stories projected a little  beyond the stone work of the basement  the second tier of the timbers  containing a few loops out of which missiles might be discharged  downwards  on any assailants that approached nearer than should be deemed  safe for the security of the basement  as has been stated  the two  principal stories were perforated with long narrow slits through the  timber  which answered the double purposes of windows and loop holes   though the apartments were so evidently arranged for defence  the plain  domestic  furniture they contained was suited to the wants of the family   should they be driven to the building for refuge  there was also an  apartment in the roof  or attic  as already mentioned  but it scarcely  entered into the more important uses of the block house  still the  advantage which it received from its elevation was not overlooked  a small  cannon  of a kind once known and much used under the name of grasshoppers   had been raised to the place  and time had been  when it was rightly  considered as of the last importance to the safety of the inmates of the  dwelling  for some years its muzzle had been seen  by all the straggling  aborigines who visited the valley  frowning through one of those openings  which were now converted into glazed windows  and there is reason to  think  that the reputation which the little piece of ordnance thus  silently obtained  had a powerful agency in so long preserving unmolested  the peace of the valley     the word unmolested is perhaps too strong  more than one alarm had in fact  occurred  though no positive acts of violence had ever been committed  within the limits which the puritan claimed as his own  on only one  occasion  however  did matters proceed so far that the veteran had been  induced to take his post in this warlike attic  where  there is little  doubt  had occasion further offered for his services  he would have made a  suitable display of his knowledge in the science of gunnery  but the  simple history of the wish ton wish had furnished another evidence of a  political truth  which cannot be too often presented to the attention of  our countrymen  we mean that the best preservative of peace is preparation  for war  in the case before us  the hostile attitude assumed by old mark  and his dependants had effected all that was desirable  without proceeding  to the extremity of shedding blood  such peaceful triumphs were far more  in accordance with the present principles of the puritan  than it would  have been with the reckless temper which had governed his youth  in the  quaint and fanatical humor of the times  he had held a family thanksgiving  around the instrument of their security  and from that moment the room  itself became a favorite resorting place for the old soldier  thither he  often mounted  even in the hours of deep night  to indulge in those secret  spiritual exercises which formed the chiefest solace  and seemingly   indeed  the great employment of his life  in consequence of this habit   the attic of the block house came in time to be considered sacred to the  uses of the master of the valley  the care and thought of content had  gradually supplied it with many conveniences that might contribute to the  personal comfort of his father  while the spirit was engaged in these  mental conflicts  at length  the old man was known to use the mattress   that among other things it now contained  and to pass the time between the  setting of the sun in its solitude  the aperture originally cut for the  exhibition of the grasshopper had been glazed  and no article of comfort   which was once caused to mount the difficult ladder that led to the  chamber  was ever seen to descend     there was something in the austere sanctity of old mark heathcote  that  was favorable to the practices of an anchorite  the youths of the dwelling  regarded his unbending brow  and the undisturbed gravity of the eye it  shadowed  with a respect akin to awe  had the genuine benevolence of his  character been less tried  or had he mingled in active life at a later  period  it might readily have been his fate to have shared in the  persecution which his countrymen heaped on those who were believed to deal  with influences it is thought impious to exercise  under actual  circumstances  however  the sentiment went no farther than a deep and  universal reverence  that left its object  and the neglected little piece  of artillery  to the quiet possession of an apartment  to invade which  would have been deemed an act bordering on sacrilege     the business of content  on the occasion which caused his present visit to  the edifice whose history and description we have thought it expedient  thus to give at some length  led him no farther than to the lowest of its  more military apartments  on raising the trap  for the first time a  feeling of doubt came over him  as to the propriety of having left the boy  so long unsolaced by words of kindness  or by deed of charity  it was  appeased by observing that his concern was awakened in behalf of one whose  spirit was quite equal to sustain greater trials     the young indian stood before one of the loops  looking out upon that  distant forest in which he had so lately roamed at liberty  with a gaze  too riveted to turn aside even at the interruption occasioned by the  presence of his captor      come from thy prison  child   said content  in the tones of mildness    whatever may have been thy motive in lurking around this dwelling  thou  art human  and must know human wants  come forth  and receive food  none  here will harm thee      the language of commiseration is universal  though the words of the  speaker were evidently unintelligible to him for whose ears they were  intended  their import was conveyed in the kindness of the accents  the  eyes of the boy turned slowly from the view of the woods  and he looked  his captor long and steadily in the face  content now indeed discovered  that he had spoken in a language that was unknown to his captive  and he  endeavored by gestures of kindness to invite the lad to follow  he was  silently and quietly obeyed  on reaching the court  however  the prudence  of a border proprietor in some degree overcame his feelings of compassion      bring hither yon tether   he said to whittal ring  who at the moment was  passing towards the stables   here is one wild as the most untamed of thy  colts  man is of our nature and of our spirit  let him be of what color  it may have pleased providence to stamp his features  but he who would  have a young savage in his keeping on the morrow  must look sharply to  his limbs to day      the lad submitted quietly  until a turn of the rope was passed around one  of his arms  but when content was fain to complete the work by bringing  the other limb into the same state of subjection  the boy glided from his  grasp  and cast the fetter from him in disdain  this act of decided  resistance was  however  followed by no effort to escape  the moment his  person was released from a confinement which he probably considered as  implying distrust of his ability to endure pain with the fortitude of a  warrior  the lad turned quietly and proudly to his captor  and  with an  eye in which scorn and haughtiness were alike glowing  seemed to defy the  fulness of his anger      be it so   resumed the equal minded content   if thou likest not the  bonds  which  notwithstanding the pride of man  are often healthful to the  body  keep then the use of thy limbs  and see that they do no mischief   whittal  look thou to the postern and remember it is forbidden to go  afield  until my father hath had this heathen under examination  the cub  is seldom found far from the cunning of the aged bear      he then made a sign to the boy to follow  and proceeded to the apartment  where his father  surrounded by most of the family  awaited their coming   uncompromising domestic discipline was one of the striking characteristics  of the sway of the puritans  that austerity of manner which was thought to  mark a sense of a fallen and probationary state  was early taught  for   among a people who deemed all mirth a sinful levity  the practice of  self command would readily come to be esteemed the basis of virtue  but   whatever might have been the peculiar merit of mark heathcote and his  household in this particular  it was likely to be exceeded by the  exhibition of the same quality in the youth who had so strangely become  their captive     we have already said  that this child of the woods might have seen some  fifteen years  though he had shot upwards like a vigorous and thrifty  plant  and with the freedom of a thriving sapling in his native forests   rearing its branches towards the light  his stature had not yet reached  that of man  in height  form  and attitudes  he was a model of active   natural  and graceful boyhood  but  while his limbs were so fair in  their proportions  they were scarcely muscular  still  every movement  exhibited a freedom and ease which announced the grace of childhood   without the smallest evidence of that restraint which creeps into our  air as the factitious feelings of later life begin to assert their  influence  the smooth  rounded trunk of the mountain ash is not more  upright and free from blemish  than was the figure of the boy  who moved  into the curious circle that opened for his entrance and closed against  his retreat  with the steadiness of one who came to bestow instead of  appearing to receive judgment      i will question him   said old mark heathcote  attentively regarding the  keen and settled eye that met his long  stern gaze as steadily as a less  intelligent creature of the woods would return the look of man   i will  question him  and perchance fear will wring from his lips a confession of  the evil that he and his have meditated against me and mine       i think he is ignorant of our forms of speech   returned content    for the words of neither kindness nor anger will force him to a  change of feature       it is then meet that we commence by asking him  who hath the secret to  open all hearts  to be our assistant   the puritan then raised his voice  in a short and exceedingly particular petition  in which he implored the  ruler of the universe to interpret his meaning  in the forthcoming  examination  in a manner that  had his request been granted  would have  savored not a little of the miraculous  with this preparation  he  proceeded directly to his task  but neither questions  signs  nor prayer   produced the slightest visible effect  the boy gazed at the rigid and  austere countenance of his interrogator  while the words were issuing from  his lips  but  the instant they ceased  his searching and quick eye rolled  over the different curious faces by which he was hemmed in  as if he  trusted more to the sense of sight than that of hearing  for the  information he naturally sought concerning his future lot  it was found  impossible to obtain from him gesture or sound that should betray either  the purport of his questionable visit  his own personal appellation  or  that of his tribe      i have been among the red skins of the providence plantations   eben  dudley at length ventured to observe   and their language  though but a  crooked and irrational jargon  is not unknown to me  with the leave of all  present   he continued regarding the puritan in a manner to betray that  this general term meant him alone   with the leave of all present  i will  put it to the younker in such a fashion  that he will be glad to answer      receiving a look of assent  the borderer uttered certain uncouth and  guttural sounds  which  notwithstanding they entirely failed of their  effect  he stoutly maintained were the ordinary terms of salutation among  the people to whom the prisoner was supposed to belong      i know him to be a narragansett   continued eben  reddening with vexation  at his defeat  and throwing a glance of no peculiar amity at the youth who  had so palpably refuted his claim to skill in the indian tongues   you see  he hath the shells of the sea side worked into the bordering of his  moccasons  and besides this sign  which is certain as that night hath its  stars  he beareth the look of a chief that was slain by the pequods  at  the wish of us christians  after an affair in which  whether it was well  done or ill done  i did some part of the work myself       and how call you that chief   demanded mark      why  he had various names  according to the business he was on  to some  he was known as the leaping panther  for he was a man of an extraordinary  jump  and others again used to style him pepperage  since there was a  saying that neither bullet nor sword could enter his body  though that  was a mistake  as his death hath fully proven  but his real name   according to the uses and sounds of his own people  was my anthony mow       my anthony mow       yes  my  meaning that he was their chief  anthony  being the given name   and mow  that of the breed of which he came   rejoined eben with  confidence  satisfied that he had finally produced a sufficiently sonorous  appellative and a perfectly lucid etymology  but criticism was diverted  from its aim by the action of the prisoner  as these equivocal sounds  struck his ear  ruth recoiled  and clasped her little namesake closer to  her side  when she saw the dazzling brightness of his glowing eyes  and  the sudden and expressive dilation of his nostrils  for a moment  his lips  were compressed with more than the usual force of indian gravity  and then  they slightly severed  a low  soft  and as even the startled matron was  obliged to confess  a plaintive sound issued from between them  repeating  mournfully       miantonimoh      the word was uttered with a distinct  but deeply guttural enunciation      the child mourneth for its parent   exclaimed the sensitive mother   the  hand that slew the warrior may have done an evil deed       i see the evident and foreordering will of a wise providence in this    said mark heathcote with solemnity   the youth hath been deprived of one  who might have enticed him still deeper into the bond of the heathen  and  hither hath he been led in order to be placed upon the straight and narrow  path  he shall become a dweller among mine  and we will strive against the  evil of his mind until instruction shall prevail  let him be fed and  nurtured  equally with the things of life and the things of the world  for  who knoweth that which is designed in his behalf      if there were more of faith than of rational conclusion in this opinion  of the old puritan  there was no external evidence to contradict it  while  the examination of the boy was going on in the dwelling  a keen scrutiny  had taken place in the out buildings  and in the adjacent fields  those  engaged in this duty soon returned  to say that not the smallest trace of  an ambush was visible about the place  and as the captive himself had no  weapons of hostility  even ruth began to hope that the mysterious  conceptions of her father on the subject were not entirely delusive  the  captive was now fed  and old mark was on the point of making a proper  beginning in the task he had so gladly assumed  by an up offering of  thanks  when whittal ring broke rudely into the room  and disturbed the  solemnity of his preparations  by a sudden and boisterous outcry      away with scythe and sickle   shouted the witling   it s many a day since  the fields of wish ton wish have been trodden down by horsemen in buff  jerkins  or ambushed by creeping wampanoags       there is danger at hand   exclaimed the sensitive ruth   husband  the  warning was timely       here are truly some riding from the forest  and drawing nigh to the  dwelling  but as they are seemingly men of our kind and faith  we have  need rather of rejoicing than terror  they bear the air of messengers from  the river      mark heathcote listened with surprise  and perhaps with a momentary  uneasiness  but all emotion passed away on the instant  for one so  disciplined in mind rarely permitted any outward exposure of his secret  thoughts  the puritan calmly issued an order to replace the prisoner in  the block house  assigning the upper of the two principal floors for his  keeping  and then he prepared himself to receive guests were little wont  to disturb the quiet of his secluded valley  he was still in the act of  giving forth the necessary mandates  when the tramp of horses was heard in  the court  and he was summoned to the door to greet his unknown visiters      we have reached wish ton wish  and the dwelling of captain mark  heathcote   said one  who appeared  by his air and better attire  to be  the principal of four that composed the party      by the favor of providence  i call myself the unworthy owner of this  place of refuge       then a subject so loyal  and a man who hath so long proved himself  faithful in the wilderness  will not turn from his door the agents of his  anointed master       there is one greater than any of earth  who hath taught us to leave the  latch free  i pray you to alight  and to partake of that we can offer      with this courteous but quaint explanation  the horsemen dismounted  and   giving their steeds into the keeping of the laborers of the farm  they  entered the dwelling     while the maidens of ruth were preparing a repast suited to the hour and  to the quality of the guests  mark and his son had abundant opportunity to  examine the appearance of the strangers  they were men who seemed to wear  visages peculiarly adapted to the characters of their entertainers being  in truth so singularly demure and grave in aspect  as to excite some  suspicion of their being newly converted zealots to the mortifying customs  of the colony  notwithstanding their extraordinary gravity  and contrary  to the usages of those regions  too  they bore about their persons certain  evidence of being used to the fashions of the other hemisphere  the  pistols attached to their saddle bows  and other accoutrements of a  warlike aspect  would perhaps have attracted no observation  had they not  been accompanied by a fashion in the doublet  the hat  and the boot  that  denoted a greater intercourse with the mother country  than was usual  among the less sophisticated natives of those regions  none traversed the  forests without the means of defence but  on the other hand  few wore the  hostile implements with so much of a worldly air  or with so many minor  particularities of some recent caprice in fashion  as they had however  announced themselves to be officers of the king  they  who of necessity  must be chiefly concerned in the object of their visit  patiently awaited  the pleasure of the strangers  to learn why duty had called them so far  from all the more ordinary haunts of men  for  like the native owners of  the soil  the self restrained religionists appeared to reckon an  indiscreet haste in any thing  among the more unmanly weaknesses  nothing  for the first half hour of their visit escaped the guarded lips of men  evidently well skilled in their present duty  which might lead to a clue  of its purport  the morning meal passed almost without discourse  and one  of the party had arisen with the professed object of looking to their  steeds  before he  who seemed the chief  led the conversation to a  subject  that by its political bearing might  in some degree  be supposed  to have a remote connexion with the principal object of his journey to  that sequestered valley      have the tidings of the gracious boon that hath lately flowed from the  favor of the king  reached this distant settlement   asked the principal  personage  one that wore a far less military air than a younger companion   who  by his confident mien  appeared to be the second in authority      to what boon hath thy words import   demanded the puritan  turning a  glance of the eye it his son and daughter  together with the others in  hearing  is if to admonish them to be prudent      i speak of the royal charter by which the people on the banks of the  connecticut  and they of the colony of new haven  are henceforth permitted  to unite in government  granting them liberty of conscience  and great  freedom of self control       such a gift were worthy of a king  hath charles done this       that hath he  and much more that is fitting in a kind and royal mind  the  realm is finally freed from the abuses of usurpers  and power now resteth  in the hands of a race long set apart for its privileges       it is to be wished that practice shall render them expert and sage in its  uses   rejoined mark  somewhat drily      it is a merry prince  and one but little given to the study and exercises  of his martyred father  but he hath great cunning in discourse  and few  around his dread person have keener wit or more ready tongue      mark bowed his head in silence  seemingly little disposed to push the  discussion of his earthly master s qualities to a conclusion that might  prove offensive to so loyal an admirer  one inclining to suspicion would  have seen  or thought he saw certain equivocal glances from the stranger   while he was thus lauding the vivacious qualities of the restored monarch   which should denote a desire to detect how far the eulogiums might be  grateful to his host  he acquiesced however in the wishes of the puritan   though whether understandingly  or without design  it would have been  difficult to say and submitted to change the discourse      it is likely  by thy presence  that tidings have reached the colonies  from home   said content  who understood  by the severe and reserved  expression of his father s features  that it was a fitting time for him to  interpose      there is one arrived in the bay  within the month  by means of a king s  frigate  but no trader hath yet passed between the countries  except the  ship which maketh the annual voyage from bristol to boston       and he who hath arrived  doth he come in authority   demanded mark   or  is he merely another servant of the lord  seeking to rear his tabernacle  in the wilderness       thou shalt know the nature of his errand   returned the stranger  casting  a glance of malicious intelligence obliquely towards his companions  at  the same time that he arose and placed in the hand of his host a  commission which evidently bore the seal of state   it is expected that  all aid will be given to one bearing this warranty  by a subject of a  loyalty so approved as that of captain mark heathcote            chapter vi              but  by your leave     i am an officer of state  and come    to speak with           coriolanus       notwithstanding the sharp look which the messenger of the crown  deliberately and now openly fastened on the master of wish ton wish  while  the latter was reading the instrument that was placed before his eyes   there was no evidence of uneasiness to be detected in the unmoved features  of the latter  mark heathcote had too long schooled his passions  to  suffer an unseemly manifestation of surprise to escape him  and he was by  nature a man of far too much nerve  to betray alarm at any trifling  exhibition of danger  returning the parchment to the other  he said with  unmoved calmness to his son       we must open wide the doors of wish ton wish  here is one charged with  authority to look into the secrets of all the dwellings of the colony    then  turning with dignity to the agent of the crown  he added   thou  hadst better commence thy duty in season  for we are many and occupy  much space      the face of the stranger flushed a little  it might have been with shame  for the vocation in which he had come so far  or it might have been in  resentment at so direct a hint that the sooner his disagreeable office  should be ended  the better it would please his host  still  he betrayed  no intention of shrinking from its performance  on the contrary   discarding somewhat of that subdued manner which he had probably thought  it politic to assume  while sounding the opinions of one so rigid  he  broke out rather suddenly in the exhibition of a humor somewhat better  suited to the tastes of him he served      come then   he cried  winking at his companions   since doors are opened   it would speak ill of our breeding should we refuse to enter  captain  heathcote has been a soldier  and he knows how to excuse a traveller s  freedom  surely one who has tasted of the pleasures of the camp  must  weary at times of this sylvan life       the stedfast in faith weary not  though the road be long and the  wayfaring grievous       hum   tis pity that the journeying between merry england and these  colonies is not more brisk  i do not presume to instruct a gentleman who  is my senior  and peradventure my better  but opportunity is everything   in a man s fortunes  it were charity to let you know  worthy sir  that  opinions have changed at home  it is full a twelvemonth since i have heard  a line of the psalms  or a verse of st  paul quoted  in discourse  at  least by men who are at all esteemed for their discretion       this change in the fashion of speech may better suit thy earthly than thy  heavenly master   said mark heathcote  sternly      well  well  that peace may exist between us  we will not bandy words  about a text more or less  if we may escape the sermon   rejoined the  stranger  no longer affecting restraint  but laughing with sufficient  freedom at his own conceit  a species of enjoyment in which his companions  mingled with great good will  and without much deference to the humor of  those under whose roof they found themselves     a small glowing spot appeared on the pale cheek of the puritan  and  disappeared again  like some transient deception produced by the play of  light  even the meek eye of content kindled at the insult  but  like his  father  the practice of self denial  and a never slumbering consciousness  of his own imperfections  smothered the momentary exhibition of  displeasure      if thou hast authority to look into the secret places of our habitations   do thy office   he said  with a peculiarity of tone which served to remind  the other  that though he bore the commission of the stuart  he was in an  extremity of his empire  where even the authority of a king lost some of  its value     affecting to be  and possibly in reality conscious of his indiscretion   the stranger hastily disposed himself to the execution of his duty      it would be a great and a pain saving movement   he said   were we  to assemble the household in one apartment  the government at home  would be glad to hear something of the quality of its lieges in this  distant quarter  thou hast doubtless a bell to summon the flock at  stated periods       our people are yet near the dwelling   returned content   if it be thy  pleasure  none shall be absent from the search      gathering from the eye of the other that he was serious in this wish  the  quiet colonist proceeded to the gate  and  placing a shell to his mouth   blew one of those blasts that are so often heard in the forests summoning  families to their homes  and which are alike used as the signals of  peaceful recall  or of alarm  the sound soon brought all within hearing to  the court  whither the puritan and his unpleasant guests now repaired as  to the spot best suited to the purposes of the latter      hallam   said the principal personage of the four visiters  addressing  him who might once have been  if he were not still  some subaltern in the  forces of the crown  for he was attired in a manner that bespoke him but a  half disguised dragoon   i leave thee to entertain this goodly assemblage   thou mayst pass the time in discoursing on the vanities of the world  of  which i believe few are better qualified to speak understandingly than  thyself  or a few words of admonition to hold fast to the faith would come  with fitting weight from thy lips  but look to it  that none of thy flock  wander  for here must every creature of them remain  stationary as the  indiscreet partner of lot  till i have cast an eye into all the cunning  places of their abode  so set wit at work  and show thy breeding as an  entertainer      after this irreverent charge to his subordinate the speaker signified to  content and his father  that he and his remaining attendant would proceed  to a more minute examination of the premises     when mark heathcote saw that the man who had so rudely broken in upon the  peaceful habits of his family was ready to proceed  he advanced steadily  in his front  like one who boldly invited inquiry  and by a grave gesture  desired him to follow  the stranger  perhaps as much from habit as from  any settled design  first cast a free glance around at the bevy of  fluttered maidens  leered even upon the modest and meek eyed ruth herself   and then took the direction indicated by him who had so unhesitatingly  assumed the office of a guide     the object of this examination still remained a secret between those who  made it  and the puritan  who had probably found its motive in the written  warranty which had been submitted to his inspection  that it proceeded  from fitting authority  none might doubt  and that it was in some manner  connected with the events that were known to have wrought so sudden and  so great a change in the government of the mother country  all believed  probable  notwithstanding the seeming mystery of the procedure  the search  was not the less rigid  few habitations of any size or pretension were  erected in those times  which did not contain certain secret places  where  valuables and even persons might be concealed  at need  the strangers  displayed great familiarity with the nature and ordinary positions of  these private recesses  not a chest  a closet  or even a drawer of size   escaped their vigilance  nor was there a plank that sounded hollow  but  the master of the valley was called on to explain the cause  in one or two  instances  boards were wrested violently from their fastenings  and the  cavities beneath were explored  with a wariness that increased as the  investigation proceeded without success     the strangers appeared irritated by their failure  an hour passed in the  keenest scrutiny  and nothing had transpired which brought them any nearer  to their object  that they had commenced the search with more than usually  confident anticipations of a favorable result  might have been gathered  from the boldness of tone assumed by their chief  and the pointed  personal allusions in which  from time to time  he indulged  often too  freely  and always at some expense to the loyalty of the heathcotes  but  when he had completed the circuit of the buildings  having entered all  parts from their cellars to the garrets  his spleen became so strong as   in some degree  to get the better of a certain parade of discretion  which  he had hitherto managed to maintain in the midst of all his levity      hast seen nothing  mr  hallam   he demanded of the individual left on  watch  as they crossed the court in retiring from the last of the  out buildings   or have those traces which led us to this distant  settlement proved false  captain heathcote  you have seen that we come not  without sufficient warranty  and it is in my power to say we come not  without sufficient         checking himself as if about to utter more than was prudent  he suddenly  cast an eye on the block house  and demanded its uses      it is  as thou seest  a building erected for the purposes of defence    replied mark   one to which  in the event of an inroad of the savages  the  family may fly for refuge       ah  these citadels are not unknown to me  i have met with others during  my journey  but none so formidable or so military as this  it hath a  soldier for its governor  and should hold out for a reasonable siege   being a place of pretension  we will look closer into its mystery      he then signified an intention to close the search by an examination of  this edifice  content unhesitatingly threw open its door  and invited  him to enter      on the word of one who  though now engaged in a more peaceful calling   has been a campaigner in his time   twould be no child s play to carry  this tower without artillery had thy spies given notice of our approach   captain heathcote  the entrance might have been more difficult than we now  find it  we have a ladder  here  where the means of mounting are found   there must be something to tempt one to ascend  i will taste your forest  air from an upper room       you will find the apartment above  like this below  merely provided for  the security of the unoffending dwellers of the habitations   said  content  while he quietly arranged the ladder before the trap  and then  led the way himself to the floor above      here have we loops for the musketoons   cried the stranger  looking about  him  understandingly   and reasonable defences against shot  thou hast not  forgotten thy art  captain heathcote  and i consider myself fortunate in  having entered thy fortress by surprise  or i should rather say  in amity   since the peace is not yet broken between us  but why have we so much of  household gear in a place so evidently equipped for war       thou forgettest that women and children may be driven to this block for a  residence   replied content   it would show little discretion to neglect  matters that might be useful to their wants       is there trouble with the savages   demanded the stranger  a little  quickly   the gossips of the colony bade us fear nothing on that head       one cannot say at what hour creatures trained in their wild natures may  choose to rise  the dwellers on the borders therefore never neglect a  fitting caution       hist   interrupted the stranger   i hear a footstep above  ha  the scent  will prove true at last  hilloa  master hallam   he cried from one of the  loops   let thy statues of salt dissolve  and come hither to the tower   here is work for a regiment  for well do we know the nature of  that we  are to deal with      the sentinel in the court shouted to his companion in the stables  and  then  openly and boisterously exulting in the prospects of a final success  to a search which had hitherto given them useless employment throughout  many a long day and weary ride  they rushed together to the block house      now  worthy lieges of a gracious master   said the leader  when he  perceived himself backed by all his armed followers  and speaking with the  air of a man flushed with success   now quickly provide the means of  mounting to the upper story  i have thrice heard the tread of man  moving  across that floor  though it hath been light and wary  the planks are  tell tales  and have not had their schooling      content heard the request  which was uttered sufficiently in the manner of  an order  perfectly unmoved  without betraying either hesitation or  concern  he disposed himself to comply  drawing the light ladder through  the trap below  he placed it against the one above him  and ascending he  raised the door  he then returned to the floor beneath  making a quiet  gesture to imply that they who chose might mount  but the strangers  regarded each other with very visible doubts  neither of the inferiors  seemed disposed to precede his chief  and the latter evidently hesitated  as to the order in which it was meet to make the necessary advance      is there no other manner of mounting  but by this narrow ascent   he  asked      none  thou wilt find the ladder secure  and of no difficult height  it is  intended for the use of women and children       ay   muttered the officer   but your women and children are not called  upon to confront the devil in a human form  fellows  are thy weapons in  serviceable condition  here may be need of spirit  ere we get our  hist   by the divine right of our gracious master  there is truly one stirring  above  harkee  my friend  thou knowest the road so well  we will choose to  follow thy conduct      content  who seldom permitted ordinary events to disturb the equanimity of  his temper  quietly assented  and led the way up the ladder  like one who  saw no ground for apprehension in the undertaking  the agent of the crown  sprang after him  taking care to keep as near as possible to the person of  his leader  and calling to his inferiors to lose no time in backing him  with their support  the whole mounted through the trap  with an alacrity  nothing short of that with which they would have pressed through a  dangerous breach  nor did either of the four take time to survey the  lodgment he had made  until the whole party was standing in array  with  hands grasping the handles of their pistols  or seeking as it were  instinctively the hilts of their broadswords      by the dark visage of the stuart   exclaimed the principal personage   after satisfying himself by a long and disappointed gaze  that what he  said was true   here is nought but an unarmed savage boy       didst expect to meet else   demanded the still unmoved content      hum  that which we expected to meet is sufficiently known to the quaint  old gentleman below  and to our own good wisdom  if thou doubtest of our  right to look into thy very hearts  warranty for that we do can be  forthcoming  king charles hath little cause to be tender of his mercies to  the dwellers of these colonies  who lent but too willing ears to the  whinings and hypocrisies of the wolves in sheeps  clothing  of whom old  england hath now so happily gotten rid  thy buildings shall again be  rummaged from the bricks of the chimney tops to the corner stone in thy  cellars  unless deceit and rebellious cunning shall be abandoned  and the  truth proclaimed with the openness and fairness of bold speaking  englishmen       i know not what is called the fairness of bold speaking englishmen  since  fairness of speech is not a quality of one people  or of one land  but  well i do know that deceit is sinful  and little of it  i humbly trust  is  practised in this settlement  i am ignorant of what is sought  and  therefore it cannot be that i meditate treachery       thou hearest  hallam  he reasoneth on a matter that toucheth the peace  and safety of the king   cried the other  his arrogance of manner  increasing with the anger of disappointment   but why is this dark skinned  boy a prisoner  dost dare to constitute thyself a sovereign over the  natives of this continent  and affect to have shackles and dungeons for  such as meet thy displeasure       the lad is in truth a captive  but he has been taken in defence of life   and hath little to complain of  more than loss of freedom       i will inquire deeply into this proceeding  though commissioned on an  errand of different interest  yet  as one trusted in a matter of moment  i  take upon me the office of protecting every oppressed subject of the  crown  there may grow discoveries out of this practice  hallam  fit to go  before the council itself       thou wilt find but little here  worthy of the time and attention of those  burthened with the care of a nation   returned content   the youthful  heathen was found lurking near our habitations  the past night  and he is  kept where thou seest  that he may not carry the tidings of our condition  to his people  who are doubtless outlying in the forest  waiting for the  fit moment to work their evil       how meanest thou   hastily exclaimed the other   at hand  in the forest   didst say       there can be little doubt  one young as this would scarce be found  distant from the warriors of his tribe  and that the more especially  as  he was taken in the commission of an ambush       i hope thy people are not without good provision of arms  and other  sufficient muniments of resistance  i trust the palisadoes are firm  and  the posterns ingeniously defended       we look with a diligent eye to our safety  for it is well known to us  dwellers on the borders that there is little security but in untiring  watchfulness  the young men were at the gates until the morning  and we  did intend to make a strong scouting into the woods as the day advanced   in order to look for those signs that may lead us to conclusions on the  number and purposes of those by whom we are environed  had not thy visit  called us to other duties       and why so tardy in speaking of this intent   demanded the agent of the  king  leading the way down the ladder with suspicious haste   it is a  commendable prudence  and must not be delayed  i take upon me the  responsibleness of commanding that all proper care be had in defence of  the weaker subjects of the crown who are here collected  are our roadsters  well replenished  hallam  duty  as thou sayest  is an imperative master   it recalls us more into the heart of the colony  i would it might shortly  point the way to europe   he muttered as he reached the ground   go   fellows  see to our beasts  and let them be speedily prepared for  departure      the attendants  though men of sufficient spirit in open war  and when it  was to be exercised in a fashion to which they were accustomed  had  like  other mortals  a wholesome deference for unknown and terrific looking  danger  it is a well known truth  and one that has been proved by the  experience of two centuries  that while the european soldier has ever been  readiest to have recourse to the assistance of the terrible warrior of the  american forest  he has  in nearly every instance  when retaliation or  accident has made him the object instead of the spectator of the ruthless  nature of his warfare  betrayed the most salutary  and frequently the most  abject and ludicrous apprehension of the prowess of his ally  while  content therefore looked so steadily  though still seriously  at the  peculiar danger in which he was placed  the four strangers seemingly saw  all of its horrors without any of the known means of avoiding them  their  chief quickly abandoned the insolence of office  and the tone of  disappointment  for a mien of greater courtesy  and  as policy is often  seen suddenly to change the sentiments of even more pretending personages   when interests assume a new aspect  so did his language rapidly take a  character of conciliation and courtesy     the handmaidens were no longer leered at  the mistress of the dwelling was  treated with marked deference  and the air of deep respect with which even  the principal of the party addressed the aged puritan  bordered on an  exhibition of commendable reverence  something was said  in the way of  apology  for the disagreeable obligations of duty  and of a difference  between a manner that was assumed to answer secret purposes  and that  which nature and a sense of right would dictate  but neither mark nor his  son appeared to have sufficient interest in the motives of their visiters   to put them to the trouble of repeating explanations that were as awkward  to those who uttered them  as they were unnecessary to those who listened     so far from offering any further obstacle to the movements of the family   the borderers were seriously urged to pursue their previous intentions of  thoroughly examining the woods  the dwelling was accordingly intrusted   under the orders of the puritan  to the keeping of about half the  laborers  assisted by the europeans  who clung with instinctive  attachment to the possession of the block house  their leader repeatedly  and rightly enough declaring that though ready at all times to risk life  on a plain  he had an unconquerable distaste to putting it in jeopardy in  a thicket  attended by eben dudley  reuben ring  and two other stout  youths  all well though lightly armed  content then left the palisadoes   and took his way towards the forest  they entered the woods at the  nearest point  always marching with the caution and vigilance that a  sense of the true nature of the risk they ran would inspire  and much  practice only could properly direct     the manner of the search was as simple as it was likely to prove  effectual  the scouts commenced a circuit around the clearing  extending  their line as far as might be done without cutting off support  and each  man lending his senses attentively to the signs of the trail  or of the  lairs  of those dangerous enemies  who they had reason to think were  outlying in their neighborhood  but  like the recent search in the  buildings  the scouting was for a long time attended by no results  many  weary miles were passed slowly over  and more than half their task was  ended  and no sign of being having life was met  except the very visible  trail of their four guests  and the tracks of a single horse along the  path leading to the settlements from the quarter by which the visiter of  the previous night had been known to approach  no comments were made by  any of the party  as each in succession struck and crossed this path   nearly at the same instant  but a low call from reuben ring which soon  after met their ears  caused them to assemble in a body at the spot whence  the summons had proceeded      here are signs of one passing  from  the clearing   said the quick eyed  woodsman   and of one too that is not numbered among the family of  wish ton wish  since his beast hath had a shodden hoof  a mark which  belongeth to no animal of ours       we will follow   said content  immediately striking in upon a straggling  trail  that by many unequivocal signs had been left by some animal which  had passed that way not many hours before  their search  however  soon  grew to a close  ere they had gone any great distance  they came upon the  half demolished carcass of a dead horse  there was no mistaking the  proprietor of this unfortunate animal  though some beast  or rather beasts  of prey  had fed plentifully on the body  which was still fresh and had  scarcely yet done bleeding  it was plain  by the remains of the torn  equipments  as well as by the color and size of the animal  that it was no  other than the hack ridden by the unknown and mysterious guest  who  after  sharing in the worship and in the evening meal of the family of the  wish ton wish  had so strangely and so suddenly disappeared  the leathern  sack  the weapons which had so singularly riveted the gaze of old mark   and indeed all but the carcass and a ruined saddle  were gone  but what  was left  sufficiently served to identify the animal      here has been the tooth of wolf   said eben dudley  stooping to  examine into the nature of a ragged wound in the neck   and here  too   has been cut of knife  but whether by the hand of a red skin  it  exceedeth my art to say      each individual of the party now bent curiously over the wound  but the  results of their inquiries went no further than to prove that it was  undeniably the horse of the stranger  that had forfeited its life  to the  fate of its master  however there was not the slightest clue  abandoning  the investigation  after a long and fruitless examination  they proceeded  to finish the circuit of the clearing  night had approached ere the  fatiguing task was accomplished  as ruth stood at the postern waiting  anxiously for their return  she saw by the countenance of her husband   that while nothing had transpired to give any grounds of additional alarm   no satisfactory testimony had been obtained to explain the nature of the  painful doubts  with which  as a tender and sensitive mother  she had been  distressed throughout the day           chapter vii            is there not milking time     when you go to bed  or kiln hole     to whistle off these secrets  but you must be    tattling before all our guests        winter s tale      long experience hath shown that the white man  when placed in situations  to acquire such knowledge  readily becomes the master of most of that  peculiar skill for which the north american indian is so remarkable  and  which enables him  among other things  to detect the signs of a forest  trail  with a quickness and an accuracy of intelligence that amount nearly  to an instinct  the fears of the family were therefore greatly quieted by  the reports of the scouts  all of whom agreed in the opinion that no party  of savages  that could be at all dangerous to a force like their own  was  lying near the valley  and some of whom  the loudest of which number being  stout eben dudley  boldly offered to answer for the security of those who  depended on their vigilance  with their own lives  these assurances had   beyond a doubt  a soothing influence on the apprehensions of ruth and her  handmaidens  but they somewhat failed of their effect  with those  unwelcome visiters who still continued to cumber wish ton wish with their  presence  though they had evidently abandoned all ideas connected with the  original object of their visit  they spoke not of departure  on the  contrary as night approached  their chief entered into council with old  mark heathcote  and made certain propositions for the security of his  dwelling  which the puritan saw no reason to oppose     a regular watch was  in consequence  set  and maintained till morning  at  the palisadoes  the different members of the family retired to their usual  places of rest  tranquil in appearance  if not in entire confidence of  peace  and the military messengers took post in the lower of the two  fighting apartments of the citadel  with this simple  and to the strangers  particularly satisfactory arrangement  the hours of darkness passed away  in quiet  morning returning to the secluded valley  as it had so often  done before  with its loveliness unimpaired by violence or tumult     in the same peaceful manner did the sun set successively three several  times  and as often did it arise on the abode of the heathcotes  without  further sign of danger  or motive of alarm  with the passage of time  the  agents of the stuart gradually regained their confidence  still they never  neglected to withdraw within the protection of the block house with the  retiring light  a post which the subordinate named hallam  more than once  gravely observed  they were  by their disciplined and military habits   singularly qualified to maintain  though the puritan secretly chafed under  this protracted visit  habitual self denial  and a manner so long subdued   enabled him to conceal his disgust  for the first two days after the  alarm  the deportment of his guests was unexceptionable  all their  faculties appeared to be engrossed with keen and anxious watchings of the  forest  out of which it would seem they expected momentarily to see issue  a band of ferocious and ruthless savages  but symptoms of returning levity  began to be apparent  as confidence and a feeling of security increased   with the quiet passage of the hours     it was on the evening of the third day from that on which they had made  their appearance in the settlement  that the man called hallam was seen  strolling  for the first time  through the postern so often named  and  taking a direction which led towards the out buildings  his air was less  distrustful than it had been for many a weary hour  and his step  proportionably confident and assuming  instead of wearing  as he had been  wont  a pair of heavy horseman s pistols at his girdle  he had even laid  aside his broadsword  and appeared more in the guise of one who sought his  personal ease  than in that cumbersome and martial attire which all of his  party  until now  had deemed it prudent to maintain  he cast his glance  cursorily over the fields of the heathcotes  as they glowed under the soft  light of a setting sun  nor did his eye even refuse to wander vacantly  along the outline of that forest  which his imagination had so lately been  peopling with beings of a fierce and ruthless nature     the hour was one when rustic economy brings the labors of the day to a  close  among those who were more than usually active at that busy moment   was a handmaiden of ruth  whose clear sweet voice was heard  in one of the  inclosures  occasionally rising on the notes of a spiritual song  and as  often sinking to a nearly inaudible hum  as she extracted from a favorite  animal liberal portions of its nightly tribute to the dairy of her  mistress  to that inclosure the stranger  as it were by accident  suffered  his sauntering footsteps to stroll  seemingly as much in admiration of the  sleek herd as of any other of its comely tenants      from what thrush hast taken lessons  my pretty maid  that i mistook thy  notes for one of the sweetest songsters of thy woods   he asked  trusting  his person to the support of the pen in an attitude of easy superiority    one might fancy it a robin  or a wren  trolling out his evening song   instead of human voice rising and falling in every day psalmody       the birds of our forest rarely speak   returned the girl   and the one  among them which has most to say  does it like those who are called  gentlemen  when they set wit to work to please the ear of simple  country maidens       and in what fashion may that be       mockery       ah  i have heard of the creature s skill  it is said to be a compound of  the harmony of all other forest songsters  and yet i see little  resemblance to the honest language of a soldier  in its manner of  utterance       it speaketh without much meaning  and oftener to cheat the ear  than in  honest reason       thou forgettest that which i told thee in the morning  child  it would  seem that they who named thee  have no great cause to exult in their  judgment of character  since unbelief would better describe thy  disposition  than faith       it may be  that they who named me little knew how great must be  credulity  to give ear to all i have been required to credit       thou canst have no difficulty in admitting that thou art comely  since  the eye itself will support thy belief  nor can one of so quick speech  fail to know that her wit is sharper than common  thus far  i admit  the  name of faith will not surely belie thy character       if eben dudley hear thee use such vanity stirring discourse   returned  the half pleased girl   he might give thee less credit for wit than thou  seemest willing to yield to others  i hear his heavy foot among the  cattle  and ere long we shall be sure to see a face that hath little more  of lightness to boast       this eben dudley is a personage of no mean importance  i find   muttered  the other  continuing his walk  as the borderer named made his appearance  at another entrance of the pen  the glances exchanged between them were  far from friendly  though the woodsman permitted the stranger to pass  without any oral expression of displeasure      the skittish heifer is getting gentle at last  faith ring    said the  borderer  casting the butt of his musket on the ground with a violence that  left a deep impression on the faded sward at his feet   that brindled ox   old logger  is not more willing to come into his yoke  than is the  four year old to yield her milk       the creature has been getting kind  since you taught the manner to tame  its humor   returned the dairy girl  in a voice that  spite of every  effort of maiden pride  betrayed something of the flurry of her spirits   while she plied her light task with violent industry      umph  i hope some other of my teachings may be as well remembered  but  thou art quick at the trick of learning  faith  as is plain by the ready  manner in which thou hast so shortly got the habit of discourse with a man  as nimble tongued as yon riding reprobate from over sea       i hope that civil listening is no proof of unseemly discourse on the part  of one who hath been trained in modesty of speech  eben dudley  thou hast  often said  it was the bounden duty of her who was spoken to  to give ear   lest some might say she was of scornful mind  and her name for pride be  better earned than that for good nature       i see that more of my lessons than i had hoped are still in thy keeping   so thou listenest thus readily  faith  because it is meet that a maiden  should not be scornful       thou sayest so  whatever ill name i may deserve  thou hast no right to  count scorn among my failings       if i do  may i    eben dudley bit his lip and checked an expression which  would have given grievous offence to one whose habits of decency were as  severe as those of his companion   thou must have heard much that was  profitable to day  faith ring   he added   considering that thy ear is so  open  and that thy opportunities have been great       i know not what thou wouldst say by speaking of my opportunities    returned the girl  bending still lower beneath the object of her industry   in order to conceal the glow which her own quick consciousness told her  was burning on her cheek      i would say that the tale must be long  that needeth four several trials  of private speech to finish       four  as i hope to be believed for a girl of truth in speech or deed   this is but the third time that the stranger hath spoken to me apart   since the sun hath risen       if i know the number of the fingers of my hand  it is the fourth       nay  how canst thou  eben dudley  who hast been afield since the crowing  of the cock  know what hath passed about the dwellings  it is plain that  envy  or some other evil passion  causeth thee to speak angrily       how is it that i know  perhaps thou thinkest faith  thy brother reuben   only  hath the gift of sight       the labor must have gone on with great profit to the captain  whilst eyes  have been roving over other matters  but perhaps they kept the strong of  arm for the lookers out  and have set them of feebler bodies to the toil       i have not been so careless of thy life as to forget  at passing  moments  to cast an eye abroad  pert one  whatever thou mayst think of  the need  there would be fine wailings in the butteries and dairies  did  the wampanoags get into the clearing  and were there none to give the  alarm in season       truly  eben  thy terror of the child in the block must be grievous for  one of thy manhood  else wouldst thou not watch the buildings so  narrowly   retorted faith  laughing  for with the dexterity of her sex   she began to feel the superiority she was gradually obtaining in the  discourse   thou dost not remember that we have valiant troopers  from old  england  to keep the younker from doing harm  but here cometh the brave  soldier himself  it will be well to ask vigilance at his hands  or this  night may bring us to the tomahawk in our sleep       thou speakest of the weapon of the savages   said the messenger  who had  drawn near again with a visible willingness to share in an interview which  while he had watched its progress at a distance appeared to be growing  interesting   i trust all fear is over  from that quarter       as you say  for  this  quarter   said eben  adjusting his lips to a low  whistle  and coolly looking up to examine the heavenly body to which he  meant allusion   but the  next  quarter may bring us a pretty piece of  indian skirmishing       and what hath the moon in common with an incursion of the savages  are  there those among them  who study the secrets of the stars       they study deviltries and other wickedness  more than aught else  it is  not easy for the mind of man to fancy horrors such as they design  when  providence has given them success in an inroad       but thou didst speak of the moon  in what manner is the moon leagued with  their bloody plots       we have her now in the full  and there is little of the night when the  eye of a watcher might not see a red skin in the clearing  but a different  tale may be heard  when an hour or two of jet darkness shall again fall  among these woods  there will be a change shortly  it behoveth us  therefore to be on our guard       thou thinkest then  truly  that there are outlyers waiting for the  fitting moment   said the officer  with an interest so marked  as to cause  even the but half pacified faith to glance an arch look at her companion   though he still had reason to distrust a wilful expression that lurked in  the corner of her eyes  which threatened at each moment to contradict his  relation of the sinister omens      there may be savages lying in the hills  at day s journey in the forest   but they know the aim of a white man s musket too well  to be sleeping  within reach of its range  it is the nature of an indian to eat and sleep  while he has time for quiet  and to fast and murder when the killing hour  hath come       and what call you the distance to the nearest settlement on the  connecticut   demanded the other with an air so studiously indifferent as  to furnish an easy clue to the inner workings of his mind      some twenty hours would bring a nimble runner to the outer habitations   granting small time for food and rest  he that is wise  however  will take  but little of the latter  until his head be safely housed within some such  building as yon block  or until there shall stand between him and the  forest at least a goodly row of oaken pickets       there is no path ridden by which travellers may avoid the forest during  the darkness       i know of none  he who quits wish ton wish for the towns below  must make  his pillow of the earth  or be fain to ride as long as beast can carry       we have truly had experience of this necessity  journeying hither  thou  thinkest  friend  the savages are in their resting time  and that they  wait the coming quarter of the moon       to my seeming  we shall not have them sooner   returned eben dudley   taking care to conceal all qualification of this opinion  if any such he  entertained  by closely locking its purport in a mental reservation      and what season is it usual to choose for getting into the saddle  when  business calls any to the settlements below       we never fail to take our departure about the time the sun touches the  tall pine  which stands on yonder height of the mountain  much experience  hath told us it is the safest hour  hand of time piece is not more sure  than yon tree       i like the night   said the other  looking about him with the air of one  suddenly struck with the promising appearance of the weather   the  blackness no longer hangs about the forest  and it seems a fitting moment  to push the matter  on which we are sent  nearer to its conclusion      so saying  and probably believing that he had sufficiently concealed the  motive of his decision  the uneasy dragoon walked with an air of soldierly  coolness towards the dwellings  signing at the same time to one of his  companions  who was regarding him from a distance  to approach      now dost thou believe  witless dudley  that the four fingers of thy  clumsy hand have numbered the full amount of all that thou callest my  listenings   said faith  when she thought no other ear but his to whom  she spoke could catch her words  and at the same time laughing merrily  beneath her heifer  though still speaking with a vexation she could not  entirely repress      have i spoken aught but truth  it is not for such as i to give lessons in  journeying  to one who follows the honest trade of a man hunter  i have  said that which all who dwell in these parts know to be reasonable       surely nought else  but truth is made so powerful in thy hands  that it  needs be taken  like a bitter healing draught  with closed eyes and at  many swallows  one who drinketh of it too freely  may well nigh be  strangled  i marvel that he who is so vigilant in providing for the cares  of others  should take so little heed of those he is set to guard       i know not thy meaning  faith  when was danger near the valley  and my  musket wanting       the good piece is truer to duty than its master thou mayest have lawful  license to sleep on thy post  for we maidens know nothing of the pleasure  of the captain in these matters  but it would be as seemly  if not as  soldierly  to place the arms at the postern and thyself in the chambers   when next thou hast need of watching and sleeping in the same hour      dudley looked as confused as one of his mould and unbending temperament  might well be  though he stubbornly refused to understand the allusion of  his offended companion      thou hast not discussed with the trooper from over sea in vain   he said    since thou speakest so wisely of watches and arms       truly he hath much schooled me in the matter       umph  and what may be the amount of his teaching       that he who sleepeth at a postern should neither talk too boldly of the  enemy  nor expect maidens to put too much trust          in what  faith       thou surely knowest i mean in his watchfulness  my life on it  had one  happened to pass at a later hour than common near the night post of that  gentle spoken soldier  he would not have been found  like a sentinel of  this household  in the second watch of the night that is gone  dreaming of  the good things of the madam s buttery       didst truly come then  girl   said eben  dropping his voice  and equally  manifesting his satisfaction and his shame   but thou knowest  faith  that  the labor had fallen behind in behalf of the scouting party  and that the  toil of yesterday exceeded that of our usual burthens  nevertheless  i  keep the postern again to night  from eight to twelve and        will make a goodly rest of it  i doubt not  no  he who hath been so  vigilant throughout the day must needs tire of the task as night draws on   fare thee well  wakeful dudley  if thine eyes should open on the morrow   be thankful that the maidens have not stitched thy garments to the  palisadoes      notwithstanding the efforts of the young man to detain her  the  light footed girl eluded his grasp  and  bearing her burden towards the  dairy  she tripped along the path with a half averted face  in which  triumph and repentance were already struggling for the possession     in the mean time  the leader of the messengers and his military  subordinate had a long and interesting conference  when it was ended  the  former took his way to the apartment in which mark heathcote was wont to  pass those portions of his time that were not occupied in his secret  strivings for the faith  or in exercise without  while superintending the  laborers in the fields  with some little circumlocution  which was  intended to mask his real motives  the agent of the king announced his  intention to take his final departure that very night      i felt it a duty  as one who has gained experience in arms by some  practice in the wars of europe   he said   to tarry in thy dwelling while  danger threatened from the lurking savage  it would ill become soldiers to  speak of their intentions  but had the alarm in truth sounded  thou wilt  give faith  when i say that the block house would not have been lightly  yielded  i shall make report to them that sent me  that in captain mark  heathcote  charles hath a loyal subject  and the constitution a firm  supporter  the rumors  of a seemingly mistaken description  which have led  us hither  shall be contradicted  and doubtless it will be found  that  some accident hath given rise to the deception  should there be occasion  to dwell on the particulars of the late alarm  i trust the readiness of my  followers to do good service to one of the king s subjects will not be  overlooked       it is the striving of an humble spirit to speak nought evil of its  fellows  and to conceal no good   returned the reserved puritan   if thou  hast found thy abode in my dwelling to thy liking  thou art welcome  and  if duty or pleasure calleth thee to quit it  peace go with thee  it will  be useful to unite with us in asking that thy passage through the  wilderness may be unharmed  that he who watcheth over the meanest of his  creatures should take thee in his especial keeping  and that the savage  heathen          dost think the savage out of his villages   demanded the messenger  with  an indecorous rapidity  that cut short the enumeration of the particular  blessings and dangers that his host thought it meet to include in the  leave taking prayer      thou surely hast not tarried with us to aid in the defence  and yet  feel it doubtful that thy services might be useful   observed mark  heathcote  drily      i would the prince of darkness had thee and all the other diabolicals of  these woods in his own good gripe   muttered the messenger between his  teeth  and then  as if guided by a spirit that could not long be quelled   he assumed something more of his unbridled and natural air  boldly  declining to join in the prayer on the plea of haste  and the necessity of  his looking in person to the movements of his followers   but this need  not prevent thee  worthy captain  from pouring out an asking in our  behalf  while we are in the saddle   he concluded   for ourselves  there  remaineth much of thy previously bestowed pious aliment to be digested   though we doubt not  that should thy voice be raised in our behalf  while  journeying along the first few leagues of the forest  the tread of the  hacks would not be heavier  and  it is certainty  that we ourselves should  be none the worse for the favor      then casting a glance of ill concealed levity at one of his followers  who  had come to say that their steeds awaited  he made the parting salutation  with an air  in which the respect that one like the puritan could scarce  fail to excite  struggled with his habitual contempt for things of a  serious character     the family of mark heathcote  the lowest dependant included  saw these  strangers depart with great inward satisfaction  even the maidens  in whom  nature  in moments weaker than common  had awakened some of the lighter  vanities  were gladly rid of gallants  who could not soothe their ears  with the unction of flattery  without frequently giving great offence to  their severe principles  by light and irreverent allusions to things on  which they themselves were accustomed to think with fitting awe  eben  dudley could scarcely conceal the chuckle with which he saw the party bury  themselves in the forest  though neither he  nor any of the more  instructed in such matters  believed they incurred serious risk from their  sudden enterprise     the opinions of the scouts proved to be founded on accurate premises  that  and many a subsequent night passed without alarm  the season continued to  advance  and the laborers pursued their toil to its close  without another  appeal to their courage  or any additional reasons for vigilance  whittal  ring followed his colts with impunity  among the recesses of the  neighboring forests  and the herds of the family went and came  as long as  the weather would permit them to range the woods  in regularity and peace   the period of the alarm  and the visit of the agents of the crown  came to  be food for tradition  and during the succeeding winter  the former often  furnished motive of merriment around the blazing fires that were so  necessary to the country and the season     still there existed in the family a living memorial if the unusual  incidents of that night  the captive remained  long after the events  which had placed him in the power of the heathcotes were beginning to be  forgotten     a desire to quicken the seeds of spiritual regeneration  which  however  dormant they might be  old mark heathcote believed to exist in the whole  family of man  and consequently in the young heathen as well as in others   had become a sort of ruling passion in the puritan  the fashions and mode  of thinking of the times had a strong leaning towards superstition  and it  was far from difficult for a man of his ascetic habits and exaggerated  doctrines  to believe that a special interposition had cast the boy into  his hands  for some hidden but mighty purpose  that time in the good  season would not fail to reveal     notwithstanding the strong coloring of fanaticism which tinged the  characters of the religionists of those days  they were rarely wanting in  worldly discretion  the agents they saw fit to employ  in order to aid the  more hidden purposes of providence  were in common useful and rational   thus  while mark never forgot to summon the lad from his prison at the  hour of prayer  or to include an especial asking in behalf of the ignorant  heathen in general and of this chosen youth in particular  he hesitated to  believe that a manifest miracle would be exerted in his favor  that no  blame might attach to the portion of duty that was confided to human  means  he had recourse to the discreet agency of kindness and unremitted  care  but all attempts to lure the lad into the habits of a civilized man   were completely unsuccessful  as the severity of the weather increased   the compassionate and thoughtful ruth endeavored to induce him to adopt  the garments that were found so necessary to the comfort of men who were  greatly his superiors in hardihood and in strength  clothes  decorated in  a fashion suited to the taste of an indian  were considerately provided   and entreaties and threats were both freely used  with a view to make the  captive wear them  on one occasion  he was even forcibly clad by eben  dudley  and being brought  in the unwonted guise  into the presence of old  mark  the latter offered up an especial petition that the youth might be  made to feel the merits of this concession to the principles of a  chastened and instructed man  but within an hour  the stout woodsman  who  had been made on the occasion so active an instrument of civilization   announced to the admiring faith that the experiment was unsuccessful  or   as eben somewhat irreverently described the extraordinary effort of the  puritan   the heathen hath already resumed his skin leggings and painted  waist cloth  notwithstanding the captain has strove to pin better garments  on his back  by virtue of a prayer that might have clothed the nakedness  of a whole tribe   in short  the result proved  in the case of this lad   as similar experiments have since proved in so many other instances  the  difficulty of tempting one trained in the freedom and ease of a savage  to  consent to admit of the restraints of a state of being that is commonly  thought to be so much superior  in every instance in which the youthful  captive had liberty of choice  he disdainfully rejected the customs of the  whites  adhering with a singular  and almost heroic pertinacity to the  usages of his people and his condition     the boy was not kept in his bondage without extraordinary care  once  when  trusted in the fields  he had openly attempted to escape  nor was the  possession of his person recovered without putting the speed of eben  dudley and reuben ring to a more severe trial  as was confessed by the  athletic young borderers themselves  than any they had hitherto undergone   from that moment  he was never permitted to pass the palisadoes  when  duty called the laborers afield  the captive was invariably secured in his  prison  where  as some compensation for his confinement  he was supposed  to enjoy the benefit of long and familiar communication with mark  heathcote  who had the habit of passing many hours of each day  and  not  unfrequently long portions of the night  too  within the retirement of the  block house  during the time only when the gates were closed  or when some  one of strength and activity sufficient to control his movements was  present  was the lad permitted to stroll  at will  among the buildings of  the border fortress  this liberty he never failed to exercise  and often  in a manner that overcame the affectionate ruth with a painful excess of  sensibility     instead of joining in the play of the other children  the young captive  would stand aloof  and regard their sports with a vacant eye  or  drawing  near to the palisadoes  he often passed hours in gazing wistfully at those  endless forests in which he first drew breath  and which probably  contained all that was most prized in the estimation of his simple  judgment  ruth  touched to the heart by this silent but expressive  exhibition of suffering  endeavored in vain to win his confidence  with a  view of enticing him into employments that might serve to relieve his  care  the resolute but still quiet boy would not be lured into a  forgetfulness of his origin  he appeared to comprehend the kind intentions  of his gentle mistress  and frequently he even suffered himself to be led  by the mother into the centre of her own joyous and merry offspring  but  it was only to look upon their amusements with his former cold air  and to  return  at the first opportunity  to his beloved site at the pickets   still there were singular and even mysterious evidences of a growing  consciousness of the nature of the discourse of which he was occasionally  an auditor  that would have betrayed greater familiarity with the language  and opinions of the inhabitants of the valley  than his known origin and  his absolute withdrawal from communication could give reason to expect   this important and inexplicable fact was proved by the frequent and  meaning glances of his dark eye  when aught was uttered in his hearing  that affected  ever so remotely  his own condition  and  once or twice  by  the haughty gleamings of ferocity that escaped him  when eben dudley was  heard to vaunt the prowess of the white men in their encounters with the  original owners of the country  the puritan did not fail to note these  symptoms of a budding intelligence  as the pledges of a fruit that would  more than reward his pious toil  and they served to furnish a great relief  to certain occasional repugnance  which all his zeal could not entirely  subdue  at being the instrument of causing so much suffering to one who   after all  had inflicted no positive wrong on himself     at the period of which we are writing  the climate of these states  differed materially from that which is now known to their inhabitants  a  winter in the province of connecticut was attended by many successive  falls of snow  until the earth was entirely covered with firmly  compressed masses of the frozen element  occasional thaws and passing  storms of rain  that were driven away by a return of the clear and  cutting cold of the north western gales  were wont at times to lay a  covering on the ground  that was congealed to the consistency of ice   until men  and not unfrequently beasts  and sometimes sleighs  were seen  moving on its surface  as on the bed of a frozen lake  during the  extremity of a season like this  the hardy borderers  who could not toil  in their customary pursuits  were wont to range the forest in quest of  game  which  driven for food to known resorting places in the woods   then fell most easily a prey to the intelligence and skill of such men as  eben dudley and reuben ring     the youths never left the dwellings on these hunts  without exciting the  most touching interest in their movements  on the part of the indian boy   on all such occasions  he would linger at the loops of his prison  throughout the day  listening intently to the reports of the distant  muskets  as they resounded in the forest  and the only time  during a  captivity of so many months  that he was ever seen to smile  was when he  examined the grim look and muscular claws of a dead panther  that had  fallen beneath the aim of dudley  in one of these excursions to the  mountains  the compassion of all the borderers was powerfully awakened in  behalf of the patient and dignified young sufferer  and gladly would they  have given their captive the pleasure of joining in the chase  had not the  task been one that was far from easy of accomplishment  the former of the  woodsmen just mentioned had even volunteered to lead him like a hound in a  leash  but this was a species of degradation against which it was certain  that a young indian  ambitious of the character and jealous of the dignity  of a warrior  would have openly rebelled     the quick interest of the observant ruth had  as it has been seen  early  detected a growing intelligence in the boy  the means by which one  who  never mingled in the employments  and who rarely seemed to listen to the  dialogues of the family could come to comprehend the meaning of a language  that is found sufficiently difficult for a scholar  were however as much  of a mystery to her  as to all around her  still  by the aid of that  instinctive tact which so often enlightens the mind of woman was she  certain of the fact  profiting by this knowledge  she assumed the task of  endeavoring to obtain an honorary pledge from her protege  that  if  permitted to join the hunters  he would return to the valley at the end of  the day  but though the language of the woman was gentle as her own kind  nature  and her entreaties that he would give some evidence of having  comprehended her meaning were zealous and oft repeated  not the smallest  symptom of intelligence  on this occasion  could be extracted from her  pupil  disappointed  and not without sorrow  ruth had abandoned the  compassionate design in despair  when  on a sudden  the old puritan  who  had been a silent spectator of her fruitless efforts  announced his faith  in the integrity of the lad  and his intention to permit him to make one  of the very next party  that should leave the habitations     the cause of this sudden change in the hitherto stern watchfulness of mark  heathcote was  like so many other of his impulses  a secret in his own  bosom  it has just been said  that during the time ruth was engaged in her  kind and fruitless experiment to extract some evidence of intelligence  from the boy  the puritan was a close and interested observer of her  efforts  he appeared to sympathize in her disappointment  but the weal of  those unconverted tribes who were to be led from the darkness of their  ways by the instrumentality of this youth  was far too important to admit  the thought of rashly losing the vantage ground he had gained  in the  gradually expanding intellect of the boy  by running the hazard of an  escape  to all appearance  the intention of permitting him to quit the  defences had therefore been entirely abandoned  when old mark so suddenly  announced a change of resolution  the conjectures on the causes of this  unlooked for determination were exceedingly various  some believed that the  puritan had been favored with a mysterious intimation of the pleasure of  providence  in the matter  and others thought that  beginning to despair  of success in his undertaking  he was willing to seek for a more visible  manifestation of its purposes  by hazarding the experiment of trusting the  boy to the direction of his own impulses  all appeared to be of opinion  that if the lad returned  the circumstance might be set down to the  intervention of a miracle  still  with his resolution once taken  the  purpose of mark heathcote remained unchanged  he announced this unexpected  intention  after one of his long and solitary visits to the block house   where it is possible he had held a powerful spiritual strife on the  occasion  and  as the weather was exceedingly favorable for such an  object  he commanded his dependants to prepare to make the sortie on the  following morning     a sudden and an uncontrollable gleam of delight flashed on the dark  features of the captive  when ruth was about to place in his hands the bow  of her own son  and  by signs and words  she gave him to understand that  he was to be permitted to use it in the free air of the forest  but the  exhibition of pleasure disappeared as quickly as it had been betrayed   when the lad received the weapons  it was rather with the manner of a  hunter accustomed to their use  than of one to whose hands they had so  long been strangers  as he left the gates of wish ton wish  the  handmaidens of ruth clustered about him  in wondering interest  for it was  strange to see a youth so long guarded with jealous care  again free and  unwatched  notwithstanding their ordinary dependence on the secret lights  and great wisdom of the puritan  there was a very general impression that  the lad  around whose presence there was so much that was mysterious and  of interest to their own security  was now to be gazed upon for the last  time  the boy himself was unmoved to the last  still he paused  with his  foot on the threshold of the dwelling  and appeared to regard ruth and  her young offspring with momentary concern  then  assuming the calm air of  an indian warrior  he suffered his eye to grow cold and vacant  following  with a nimble step the hunters who were already passing without the  palisadoes           chapter viii            well  i am your theme  you have the start of me  i am dejected  i am    not able to answer the welsh flannel  ignorance itself is a plummet    over me  use me as you will        merry wives of windsor       poets  aided by the general longing of human nature  have given a  reputation to the spring  that it rarely merits  though this imaginative  class of writers have said so much of its balmy airs and odoriferous  gales  we find it nearly everywhere the most reluctant  churlish  and  fickle of the four seasons  it is the youth of the year  and  like that  probationary period of life  most fitted to afford the promise of better  things  there is a constant struggle between reality and hope throughout  the whole of this slow moving and treacherous period  which has an  unavoidable tendency to deceive  all that is said of its grateful  productions is fallacious  for the earth is as little likely to yield a  generous tribute without the quickening influence of the summer heats  as  man is wont to bring forth commendable fruits without the agency of a  higher moral power than any he possesses in virtue of his innate  propensities  on the other hand  the fall of the year  possesses a  sweetness  a repose  and a consistency  which may be justly likened to the  decline of a well spent life  it is  in all countries and in every  climate  the period when physical and moral causes unite to furnish the  richest sources of enjoyment  if the spring is the time of hope  autumn is  the season of fruition  there is just enough of change to give zest to the  current of existence  while there is too little of vicissitude to be  pregnant of disappointment  succeeding to the nakedness of winter  the  spring is grateful by comparison  while the glories of autumn are enjoyed   after the genial powers of summer have been lavishly expended     in obedience to this great law of the earth  let poets sing and fancy as  they may  the spring and autumn of america partake largely of the  universally distinctive characters of the rival seasons  what nature has  done on this continent  has not been done niggardly  and  while we may  boast of a decline of the year that certainly rivals  and  with few  exceptions  eclipses the glories of most of the climates of the old world   the opening months rarely fail of equalizing the gifts of providence  by a  very decided exhibition of all the disagreeable qualities for which they  are remarkable     more than half a year had elapsed  between the time when the indian boy  had been found lurking in the valley of the heathcotes  and that day when  he was first permitted to go into the forest  fettered by no other  restraint than the moral tie which the owner of the valley either knew  or  fancied  would not fail to cause him to return to a bondage he had found  so irksome  it was april  but it was april as the month was known a  century ago in connecticut  and as it is even now so often found to  disappoint all expectations of that capricious season of the year  the  weather had returned suddenly and violently to the rigor of winter  a thaw  had been succeeded by a storm of snow and sleet  and the interlude of the  spring time of blossoms had terminated with a biting gale from the  north west  which had apparently placed a permanent seal on the lingering  presence of a second february     on the morning that content led his followers into the forest  they issued  from the postern clad in coats of skin  their lower limbs were protected  by the coarse leggings which they had worn in so many previous hunts   during the past winter  if that might be called past which had returned   weakened but little of its keenness  and bearing all the outward marks of  january  when last seen  eben dudley  the heaviest of the band  was moving  firmly on the crust of the snow  with a step as sure as if he had trodden  on the frozen earth itself  more than one of the maidens declared  that  though they had endeavored to trace the footsteps of the hunters from the  palisadoes  it would have exceeded even the sagacity of an indian eye to  follow their trail along the icy path they travelled     hour after hour passed  without bringing tidings from the chase  the  reports of fire arms had indeed been occasionally heard  ringing among the  arches of the woods  and broken echoes were  for some hours  rolling from  one recess of the hills to another  but even these signs of the presence  of the hunters gradually receded with the advance of the day  and  long  ere the sun had gained the meridian  and its warmth  at that advanced  season not without power  was shed into the valley  the whole range of the  adjoining forest lay in its ordinary dull and solemn silence     the incident of the hunt  apart from the absence of the indian boy  was  one of too common occurrence to give birth to any particular motives of  excitement  ruth quietly busied herself among her women  and when the  recollection of those who were scouring the neighboring forest came at all  to her mind  it was coupled with the care with which she was providing to  administer to their comforts after the fatigue of a day of extraordinary  personal efforts  this was a duty never lightly performed  her situation  was one eminently fitted to foster the best affections of woman  since it  admitted of few temptations to yield to other than the most natural  feeling  she was  in consequence  known on all occasions to exercise them  with the devotedness of her sex      thy father and his companions will look on our care with pleasure   said  the thoughtful matron to her youthful image  as she directed a more than  usual provision of her larder to be got in readiness for the hunters    home is ever sweetest after toil and exposure       i doubt if mark be not ready to faint with so weary a march   said the  child already introduced by the name of martha   he is young to go into  the woods  with scouters tall as great dudley       and the heathen   added the little ruth   he is young too as mark   though more used to the toil  it may be  mother  that he will never come  to us more       that would grieve our venerable parent  for thou knowest  ruth  that he  hath hopes of working on the mind of the boy  until his savage nature  shall yield to the secret power  but the sun is falling behind the hill   and the evening is coming in cool as winter  go to the postern  and look  out upon the fields  i would know if there be any signs of thy father and  his party      though ruth gave this mandate to her daughter  she did not the less  neglect to exercise her own faculties in the same grateful office  while  the children went  as they were ordered  to the outer gate  the matron  herself ascended to the lower apartment of the block  and  from its  different loops  she took a long and anxious survey of the limited  prospect  the shadows of the trees  that lined the western side of the  view  were already thrown far across the broad sheet of frozen snow  and  the sudden chill which succeeded the disappearance of the sun announced  the rapid approach of a night that promised to support the severe  character of the past day  a freezing wind  which had brought with it the  cold airs of the great lakes  and which had even triumphed over the more  natural influence of an april sun  had however fallen  leaving a  temperature not unlike that which dwells in the milder seasons of the year  among the glaciers of the upper alps     ruth was too long accustomed to such forest scenes  and to such a   lingering of winter in the lap of may   to feel  on their account  any  additional uneasiness  but the hour had now arrived when she had reason to  look for the return of the hunters  with the expectation of seeing their  forms issuing from the forest  came the anxiety which is an unavoidable  attendant of disappointment  the shadows continued to deepen in the  valley  until the gloom thickened to the darkness of night  without  bringing any tidings from those without     when a delay  which was unusual in the members of a family circumstanced  like that of the wish ton wish  came to be coupled with various little  observations that had been made during the day  it was thought that  reasons for alarm were beginning  at each instant  to grow more plausible   reports of fire arms had been heard  at an early hour  from opposite  points in the hills  and in a manner too distinct to be mistaken for  echoes  a certain proof that the different members of the hunt had  separated in the forest  under such circumstances  it was not difficult  for the imagination of a wife and a mother  of a sister  or of her who  secretly confessed a still more tender interest in some one of the  hunters  to conjure to the imagination the numberless dangers to which  those who were engaged in these expeditions were known to be exposed      i doubt that the chase hath drawn them further from the valley than is  fitting for the hour and the season   observed ruth to her maidens  who  had gathered in a group about her  at a point that overlooked as much of  the cleared land around the buildings  as the darkness would allow   the  gravest man becomes thoughtless as the unreflecting child when led by the  eagerness of the pursuit  it is the duty of older heads to think for those  that want experience  but into what indiscreet complaints are my fears  leading  it may be that my husband is even now striving to collect his  party  in order to return  hast any heard his conch sounding the recall       the woods are still as the day the first echo of the axe was heard  among the trees   returned faith   i did hear that which sounded like a  strain of brawling dudley s songs  but it proved to be no more than the  lowing of one of his own oxen  perchance the animal misseth some of its  master s care       whittal ring hath looked to the beasts  and it may not be that he hath  neglected to feed  among others  the creatures of dudley  thy mind is  given to levity  faith  in the matter of this young man  it is not seemly  that one of thy years and sex should manifest so great displeasure at the  name of a youth  who is of an honest nature  and of honest habits  too   though he may appear ungainly to the eye  and have so little favor with  one of thy disposition       i did not fashion the man   said faith  biting her lip  and tossing her  head   nor is it aught to me whether he be gainly or not  as to my favor  when he asks it  the man shall not wait long to know the answer  but is  not yon figure the fellow himself  madam heathcote   here  coming in from  the eastern hill  along the orchard path  the form i mean is just here   you may see it  at this moment  turning by the bend in the brook       there is one of a certainty  and it should be one of our hunting party   too  and yet he doth not seem to be of a size or of a gait like that of  eben dudley  thou shouldst have a knowledge of thy kindred  girl  to me it  seemeth thy brother       truly  it may be reuben ring  still it hath much of the swagger of the  other  though their stature be nearly equal  the manner of carrying the  musket is much the same with all the borderers too  one cannot easily tell  the form of man from a stump by this light  and  yet do i think it will  prove to be the loitering dudley       loiterer or not  he is the first to return from this long and weary  chase   said ruth  breathing heavily  like one who regretted that the  truth were so   go thou to the postern  and admit him  girl  i ordered  bolts to be drawn  for i like not to leave a fortress defended by a female  garrison  at this hour  with open gates  i will hie to the dwelling  and  see to the comforts of those who are a hungered  since it will not be long  ere we shall have more of them at hand      faith complied  with affected indifference and sufficient delay  by the  time she had reached the place of admission  a form was seen ascending the  acclivity  and taking the direction which led to the same spot  in the  next minute  a rude effort to enter announced an arrival without      gently  master dudley   said the wilful girl  who held the bolt with  one hand  though she maliciously delayed to remove it   we know thou  art powerful of arm  and yet the palisadoes will scarcely fall at thy  touch  here are no sampsons to pull down the pillars on our heads   perhaps we may not be disposed to give entrance to them who stay  abroad out of all season       open the postern  girl   said eben dudley   after which  if thou hast  aught to say  we shall be better convenienced for discourse       it may be that thy conversation is most agreeable when heard from  without  render an account of thy backslidings  throughout this day   penitent dudley  that i may take pity on thy weariness  but lest hunger  should have overcome thy memory  i may serve to help thee to the  particulars  the first of thy offences was to consume more than thy  portion of the cold meats  the second was to suffer reuben ring to kill  the deer  and for thee to claim it  and a third was the trick thou hast of  listening so much to thine own voice  that even the blasts fled thee  from  dislike of thy noise       thou triflest unseasonably  faith  i would speak with the captain   without delay       it may be that he is better employed than to desire such company  thou  art not the only strange animal by many who hath roared at the gate of  wish ton wish       have any come within the day  faith   demanded the borderer  with the  interest such an event would be likely to create in the mind of one who  habitually lived in so great retirement      what sayest thou to a second visit from the gentle spoken stranger  he  who favored us with so much gay discourse  the by gone fall of the year   that would be a guest fit to receive  i warrant me his knock would not be  heard a second time       the gallant had better beware the moon   exclaimed dudley  striking the  but of his musket against the ice with so much force as to cause his  companion to start  in alarm   what fool s errand hath again brought him  to prick his nag so deep into the forest       nay  thy wit is ever like the unbroken colt  a headstrong run away  i  said not  in full meaning that the man had come  i only invited thee to  give an opinion in the event that he should arrive unexpectedly  though i  am far from certain that any here ever expect to see his face again       this is foolish prating   returned the youth  provoked at the exhibition  of jealousy into which he had been incautiously betrayed   i tell thee to  withdraw the bolt  for i have great need to speak with the captain  or  with his son       thou mayst open thy mind to the first  if he will listen to what thou  hast to say   returned the girl  removing the impediment to his entrance    but thou wilt sooner get the ear of the other by remaining at the gate   since he has not yet come in from the forest      dudley recoiled a pace  and repeated her words in the tone of one who  admitted a feeling of alarm to mingle with his surprise      not in from the forest   he said   surely there are none abroad  now that  i am home       why dost say it  i have put my jibes upon thee more in payment of ancient  transgressions than for any present offence  so far from being last  thou  art the first of the hunters we have yet seen  go in to the madam without  delay  and tell her of the danger  if any there be  that we take speedy  measures for our safety       that would do little good  truly   muttered the borderer  like one  musing   stay thou here  and watch the postern  faith  i will back to the  woods  for a timely word  or a signal blown from my conch  might quicken  their footsteps       what madness hath beset thee  dudley  thou wouldst not go into the forest  again  at this hour and alone  if there be reason for fear  come farther  within the gate  man  that i may draw the bolt the madam will wonder that  we tarry here so long       ha   i hear feet moving in the meadow  i know it by the creaking of the  snow  the others are not lagging      notwithstanding the apparent certainty of the young man  instead of going  forth to meet his friends  he withdrew a step  and with his own hand drew  the bolt that faith had just desired might be fastened  taking care at the  same time to let fall a swinging bar of wood  which gave additional  security to the fastenings of the postern  his apprehensions  if any such  had induced this caution  were however unnecessary  for ere he had time to  make  or even to reflect on any further movement  admission was demanded  in the well known voice of the son of him who owned the valley  the bustle  of the arrival  for with content entered a group of companions loaded with  venison  put an end to the dialogue  faith seized the opportunity to glide  away in the obscurity  in order to announce to her mistress that the  hunters had returned  an office that she performed without entering at all  into the particulars of her own interview with eben dudley     it is needless to dwell on the satisfaction with which ruth received her  husband and son  after the uneasiness she had just suffered  though the  severe manners of the province admitted of no violent exhibition of  passing emotions  secret joy was reigning in the mild eyes and glowing  about the flushed cheeks of the discreet matron  while she personally  officiated in the offices of the evening meal     the party had returned teeming with no extraordinary incidents  nor did  they appear to be disturbed with any of that seriousness of air which had  so unequivocally characterized the deportment of him who had preceded  them  on the contrary  each had his quiet tale to relate  now perhaps at  the expense of a luckless companion  and sometimes in order that no part  of his own individual skill  as a hunter  should be unknown  the delay was  accounted for  as similar delays are commonly explained  by distance and  the temptations of an unusually successful chase  as the appetites of  those who had passed the day in the exciting toil were keen and the viands  tempting  the first half hour passed quickly  as all such half hours are  wont to pass  in garrulous recitals of personal exploits  and of the  hairbreadth escapes of deer  which  had fortune not been fickle  should  have now been present as trophies of the skill of the hand by which they  fell  it was only after personal vanity was sufficiently appeased  and  when the hunger even of a border man could achieve no more  that the  hunters began to look about them with a diminished excitement  and to  discuss the events of the day with a fitting calmness  and with a  discretion more suited to their ordinary self command      we lost the sound of thy conch  wandering dudley  as we fell into the  deep hollow of the mountain   said content  in a pause of the discourse    since which time  neither eye nor ear of any has had trace of thy  movements  until we met thee at the postern  stationed like a looker out  on his watch      the individual addressed had mingled in none of the gaiety of the hour   while others fed freely  or joined in the quiet joke  which could escape  the lips of even men chastened as his companions  eben dudley had tasted  sparingly of the viands  nor had the muscles of his hard countenance once  relaxed in a smile  a gravity and silence so extraordinary  in one so  little accustomed to exhibit either quality  did not fail to attract  attention  it was universally ascribed to the circumstance that he had  returned empty handed from the hunt  and now that one having authority  had seen fit to give such a direction to the discourse  the imaginary  delinquent was not permitted to escape unscathed      the butcher had little to do with this day s killing   said one of the  young men   as a punishment for his absence from the slaughter  he should  be made to go on the hill and bring in the two bucks he will find hanging  from a maple sapling near to the drinking spring  our meat should pass  through his hands in some fashion or other  else will it lack savor       ever since the death of the straggling wether  the trade of eben hath  been at a stand   added another   the down hearted youth seems like one  ready to give up his calling to the first stranger that shall ask it       creatures which run at large prove better mutton than the stalled  wether   continued a third   and thereby custom was getting low before  this hunt  beyond a doubt  he has a full supply for all who shall be  likely to seek venison in his stall      ruth observed that the countenance of her husband grew grave  at these  allusions to an event he had always seemed to wish forgotten  and she  interposed with a view to lead the minds of those who listened  back to  matter more fitting to be discussed      how is this   she exclaimed in haste   hath the stout dudley lost any of  his craft  i have never counted with greater certainty on the riches of  the table  than when he hath been sent among the hills for the fat deer   or the tender turkey  it would much grieve me to learn that he beginneth  to lack the hunter s skill       the man is getting melancholy with over feeding   muttered the wilful  tones of one busied among the vessels  in a distant part of the room   he  taketh his exercise alone  in order that none need discover the failing   i think he be much disposed to go over sea  in order to become a trooper      until now  the subject of these mirthful attacks had listened like one too  confident of his established reputation to feel concern  but at the sound  of the last speaker s voice  he grasped the bushy covering of one entire  cheek in his hand  and turning a reproachful and irritated glance at the  already half repentant eye of faith ring  all his natural spirit returned      it may be that my skill hath left me   he said   and that i love to be  alone  rather than to be troubled with the company of some that might  readily be named  no reference being had to such gallants as ride up and  down the colony  putting evil opinions into the thoughts of honest men s  daughters  but why is eben dudley to bear all the small shot of your  humors  when there is another who  it might seem  hath strayed even  further from your trail than he      eye sought eye  and each youth by hasty glances endeavored to read the  countenances of all the rest in company  in order to learn who the  absentee might be  the young borderers shook their heads  as the features  of every well known face were recognised  and a general exclamation of  denial was about to break from their lips  when ruth exclaimed       truly  the indian is wanting      so constant was the apprehension of danger from the savages  in the  breasts of those who dwelt on that exposed frontier  that every man arose  at the words  by a sudden and common impulse  and each individual gazed  about him in a surprise that was a little akin to dismay      the boy was with us when we quitted the forest   said content  after a  moment of death like stillness   i spoke to him in commendation of his  activity  and of the knowledge he had shown in beating up the secret  places of the deer  though there is little reason to think my words were  understood       and were it not sinful to take such solemn evidence in behalf of so light  a matter  i could be qualified on the book itself  that he was at my elbow  as we entered the orchard   added reuben ring  a man renowned in that  little community for the accuracy of his vision      and i will make oath or declaration of any sort  lawful or conscientious   that he came not within the postern when it was opened by my own hand    returned eben dudley   i told off the number of the party as you passed   and right sure am i that no red skin entered       canst thou tell us aught of the lad   demanded ruth  quick to take the  alarm on a subject that had so long exercised her care  and given food to  her imagination      nothing  with me he hath not been since the turn of the day  i have not  seen the face of living man from that moment  unless in truth one of  mysterious character  whom i met in the forest  may be so called      the manner in which the woodsman spoke was too serious and too natural   not to give birth in his auditors to some of his own gravity  perhaps the  appearance of the puritan  at that moment  aided in quieting the levity  that had been uppermost in the minds of the young men  for  it is certain   that when he entered  a deeper and a general curiosity came over the  countenances of all present  content waited a moment in respectful  silence  till his father had moved slowly through the circle  and then he  prepared himself to look further into an affair that began to assume the  appearance of matter worthy of investigation           chapter ix                  last night of all     when yon same star  that s westward from the pole     had made its course to illume that part of heaven    where now it burns  marcellus  and myself    the bell then beating one        peace  break thee off  look  where it comes again        hamlet       it is our duty  as faithful historians of the events recorded in this  homely legend  to conceal no circumstance which may throw the necessary  degree of light on its incidents  nor any opinion that may serve for the  better instruction of the reader in the characters of its actors  in order  that this obligation may be discharged with sufficient clearness and  precision  it has now become necessary to make a short digression from the  immediate action of the tale     enough has been already shown  to prove that the heathcotes lived at a  time  and in a country  where very quaint and peculiar religious dogmas  had the ascendancy  at a period when visible manifestations of the  goodness of providence  not only in spiritual but in temporal gifts  were  confidently expected and openly proclaimed  it is not at all surprising  that more evil agencies should be thought to exercise their power in a  manner that is somewhat opposed to the experience of our own age  as we  have no wish  however  to make these pages the medium of a theological or  metaphysical controversy  we shall deal tenderly with certain important  events  that most of the writers  who were cotemporary with the facts   assert took place in the colonies of new england  at and about the period  of which we are now writing  it is sufficiently known that the art of  witchcraft  and one even still more diabolical and direct in its origin   were then believed to flourish  in that quarter of the world  to a degree  that was probably in a very just proportion to the neglect with which most  of the other arts of life were treated     there is so much grave and respectable authority  to prove the existence  of these evil influences  that it requires a pen hardier than any we  wield  to attack them without a suitable motive   flashy people   says the  learned and pious cotton mather  doctor of divinity and fellow of the  royal society   may burlesque these things  but when hundreds of the most  sober people  in a country where they have as much mother wit  certainly   as the rest of mankind   know them to be true   nothing but the absurd and  froward spirit of sadducism can question them   against this grave and  credited authority  we pretend to raise no question of scepticism  we  submit to the testimony of such a writer as conclusive  though as  credulity is sometimes found to be bounded by geographical limits  and to  possess something of a national character  it may be prudent to refer  certain readers  who dwell in the other hemisphere  to the common law of  england  on this interesting subject  as it is ingeniously expounded by  keeble and approved by the twelve judges of that highly civilized and  enlightened island  with this brief reference to so grave authorities  in  support of what we have now to offer  we shall return to the matter of the  narrative  fully trusting that its incidents will throw some additional  light on the subject of so deep and so general concern     content waited respectfully until his father had taken his seat  and then  perceiving that the venerable puritan had no immediate intention of moving  personally in the affair  he commenced the examination of his dependant as  follows  opening the matter with a seriousness that was abundantly  warranted by the gravity of the subject itself      thou hast spoken of one met in the forest   he said   proceed with the  purport of that interviews and tell us of what manner of man it was      thus directly interrogated  eben dudley disposed himself to give a full  and satisfactory answer  first casting a glance around  so as to embrace  every curious and eager countenance  and letting his look rest a little  longer than common on a half interested  half incredulous  and a somewhat  ironical dark eye  that was riveted on his own from a distant corner of  the room  he commenced his statement as follows      it is known to you all   said the borderer   that when we had gained the  mountain top  there was a division of our numbers  in such a fashion that  each hunter should sweep his own range of the forest  in order that  neither moose  deer  nor bear  might have reasonable chance of escape   being of large frame and it may be of swifter foot than common  the young  captain saw fit to command reuben ring to flank one end of the line  and a  man  who is nothing short of him in either speed  or strength  to do the  same duty on the other  there was nothing particularly worthy of mention  that took place on the flank i held  for the first two hours  unless  indeed the fact  that three several times did i fall upon a maze of  well beaten deer tracks  that as often led to nothing          these are signs common to the woods  and they are no more than so many  proofs that the animal has its sports  like any other playful creature   when not pressed by hunger or by danger   quietly observed content      i pretend not to take those deceitful tracks much into the account    resumed dudley   but shortly after losing the sound of the conchs  i  roused a noble buck from his lair beneath a thicket of hemlocks  and  having the game in view  the chase led me wide off towards the wilderness   it may have been the distance of two leagues       and in all that time  had you no fitting moment to strike the beast       none whatever  nor  if opportunity had been given  am i bold to say that  hand of mine would have been hardy enough to aim at its life       was there aught in the deer  that a hunter should seek to spare it       there was that in the deer  that might bring a christian man to much  serious reflection       deal more openly with the nature and appearance of the animal   said  content  a little less tranquil than usual  while the youths and maidens  placed themselves in attitudes still more strongly denoting attention     dudley pondered an instant  and then he commenced a less equivocal  enumeration of what he conceived to be the marvels of his tale      firstly   he said   there was no trail  neither to nor from the spot  where the creature had made its lair  secondly  when roused  it took not  the alarm  but leaped sportingly ahead  taking sufficient care to be  beyond the range of musket  without ever becoming hid from the eye  and  lastly its manner of disappearance was as worthy of mention as any other  of its movements       and in what manner didst thou lose the creature       i had gotten it upon the crest of a hillock  where true eye and steady  hand might make sure of a buck of much smaller size  when  didst hear  aught that might be accounted wonderful  at a season of the year when the  snows are still lying on the earth      the auditors regarded one another curiously  each endeavoring to recall  some unwonted sound which might sustain a narrative that was fast  obtaining the seducing interest of the marvellous      wast sure  charity  that the howl we heard from the forest was the yell  of the beaten hound   demanded a handmaiden of ruth  of a blue eyed  companion  who seemed equally well disposed to contribute her share of  evidence in support of any exciting legend      it might have been other   was the answer  though the hunters do speak of  their having beaten the pup for restiveness       there was a tumult among the echoes  that sounded like the noises which  follow the uproar of a falling tree   said ruth  thoughtfully   i remember  to have asked if it might not be that some fierce beast had caused a  general discharge of the musketry  but my father was of opinion that death  had undermined some heavy oak       at what hour might this have happened       it was past the turn of the day  for it was at the moment i bethought me  of the hunger of those who had toiled since light  in the hills       that then was the sound i mean  it came not from falling tree  but was  uttered in the air  far above all forests  had it been heard by one better  skilled in the secrets of nature          he would say it thundered   interrupted faith ring  who  unlike most of  the other listeners  manifested little of the quality which was expressed  by her name   truly  eben dudley hath done marvels in this hunt  he hath  come in with a thunderbolt in his head  instead of a fat buck on his  shoulders       speak reverently  girl  of that thou dost not comprehend   said mark  heathcote  with stern authority   marvels are manifested equally to the  ignorant and to the learned  and although vain minded pretenders to  philosophy affirm  that the warring of the elements is no more than nature  working out its own purification  yet do we know  from all ancient  authorities  that other manifestations are therein exhibited  satan may  have control over the magazines of the air  he can  let off the ordnance  of heaven   that the prince of the powers of darkness hath as good a share  in chemistry as goes to the making of aurum fulminans  is asserted by one  of the wisest writers of our age      from this declaration  and more particularly from the learning  discovered in the puritan s speech  there was no one so hardy as to  dissent  faith was glad to shrink back among the bevy of awe struck  maidens  while content  after a sufficiently respectful pause  invited  the woodsman  who was yet teeming with the most important part of his  communication  to proceed      while my eye was searching for the lightning  which should in reason have  attended that thunder  had it been uttered in the manner of nature  the  buck had vanished  and when i rushed upon the hillock  in order to keep  the game in view  a man mounting its opposite side came so suddenly upon  me  that our muskets were at each other s breasts before either had time  for speech       what manner of man was he       so far as human judgment might determine  he seemed a traveller  who was  endeavoring to push through the wilderness  from the towns below to the  distant settlements of the bay province  but i account it exceeding  wonderful  that the trail of a leaping buck should have brought us  together in so unwonted a manner       and didst thou see aught of the deer  after that encounter       in the first hurry of the surprise  it did certainly appear as if an  animal were bounding along the wood into a distant thicket  but it is  known how readily one may be led by seeming probabilities into a false  conclusion  and so i account that glimpse as delusion  no doubt  the  animal  having done that which it was commissioned to perform  did then  and there disappear  in the manner i have named       it might have been thus  and the stranger  had you discourse with him   before parting       we tarried together a short hour  he related much marvellous matter of  the experiences of the people  near the sea  according to the testimony  of the stranger  the powers of darkness have been manifested in the  provinces in a hideous fashion  numberless of the believers have been  persecuted by the invisibles  and greatly have they endured suffering   both in soul and body       of all this have i witnessed surprising instances  in my day   said mark  heathcote  breaking the awful stillness that succeeded the annunciation of  so heavy a visitation on the peace of the colony  with his deep toned and  imposing voice   did he  with whom you conferred  enter into the  particulars of the trials       he spoke also of certain other signs that are thought to foretell the  coming of trouble  when i named the weary chase that i had made  and the  sound which came from the air  he said that these would be accounted  trifles in the towns of the bay where the thunder and its lightnings had  done much evil work  the past season  satan having especially shown his  spite  by causing them to do injury to the houses of the lord       there has long been reason to think that the pilgrimage of the righteous   into these wilds  will be visited by some fierce opposition of those  envious natures  which  fostering evil themselves  cannot brook to look  upon the toiling of such as strive to keep the narrow path  we will now  resort to the only weapon it is permitted us to wield in this  controversy  but which  when handled with diligence and zeal  never fails  to lead to victory      so saying  without waiting to hear more of the tale of eben dudley  old  mark heathcote arose  and assuming the upright attitude usual among the  people of his sect  he addressed himself to prayer  the grave and  awe struck but deeply confiding congregation imitated his example  and  the lips of the puritan had parted in the act of utterance  when a low   faltering note  like that produced by a wind instrument  rose on the  outer air  and penetrated to the place where the family was assembled  a  conch was suspended at the postern  in readiness to be used by any of the  family whom accident or occupation should detain beyond the usual hour of  closing the gates  and both by the direction and nature of this  interruption  it would seem that an applicant for admission stood at the  portal  the effect on the auditors was general and instantaneous   notwithstanding the recent dialogue  the young men involuntarily sought  their arms  while the startled females huddled together like a flock of  trembling and timid deer      there is  of a certainty  a signal from without   content at length  observed  after waiting to suffer the sounds to die away among the angles  of the buildings   some hunter  who hath strayed from his path  claimeth  hospitality      eben dudley shook his head like one who dissented  but  having with all  the other youths grasped his musket  he stood as undetermined as the rest  concerning the course it was proper to pursue  it is uncertain how long  this indecision might have continued  had no further summons been given   but he without appeared too impatient of delay to suffer much time to be  lost  the conch sounded again  and with far better success than before   the blast was longer  louder  and bolder  than that which had first  pierced the walls of the dwelling  rising full and rich on the air  as  though one well practised in the use of the instrument had placed lips to  the shell     content would scarcely have presumed to disobey a mandate coming from his  father  had it been little in conformity with his own intentions  but  second thoughts had already shown him the necessity of decision  and he  was in the act of motioning to dudley and reuben ring to follow  when the  puritan bade him look to the matter  making a sign for the rest of the  family to remain where they were  and arming himself with a musket which  had more than once that day been proved to be of certain aim  he led the  way to the postern which has already been so often mentioned      who sounds at my gate   demanded content  when he and his followers had  gained a position  under cover of a low earthen mound erected expressly  for the purpose of commanding the entrance   who summons a peaceful  family  at this hour of the night  to their outer defences       one who hath need of what he asketh  or he would not disturb thy  quiet   was the answer   open the postern  master heathcote  without  fear  it is a brother in the faith  and a subject of the same laws  that  asketh the boon       here is truly a christian man without   said content  hurrying to the  postern  which  without a moment s delay  he threw freely open  saying  as he did so   enter of heaven s mercy  and be welcome to that we have  to bestow      a tall  and  by his tread  a heavy man  wrapped in a riding cloak  bowed  to the greeting  and immediately passed beneath the low lintel  every eye  was keenly fastened on the stranger  who  after ascending the acclivity a  short distance  paused  while the young men  under their master s orders   carefully and scrupulously renewed the fastenings of the gate  when bolts  and bars had done their office  content joined his guest  and after making  another fruitless effort  by the feeble light which fell from the stars   to scan his person  he said  in his own meek and quiet manner       thou must have great need of warmth and nourishment  the distance from  this valley to the nearest habitation is wearisome  and one who hath  journeyed it  in a season like this  may well be nigh fainting  follow   and deal with that we have to bestow as freely as if it were thine own      although the stranger manifested none of that impatience which the heir of  the wish ton wish appeared to think one so situated might in all reason  feel  thus invited he did not hesitate to comply  as he followed in the  footsteps of his host  his tread  however  was leisurely and dignified   and once or twice  when the other half delayed in order to make some  passing observation of courtesy  he betrayed no indiscreet anxiety to  enter on those personal indulgences which might in reality prove so  grateful to one who had journeyed far in an inclement season  and along a  road where neither dwelling nor security invited repose      here is warmth and a peaceful welcome   pursued content  ushering his  guest into the centre of a group of fearfully anxious faces   in a little  time  other matters shall be added to thy comfort      when the stranger found himself under the glare of a powerful light  and  confronted to so many curious and wondering eyes  for a single instant he  hesitated  then stepping calmly forward  he cast the short riding cloak   which had closely muffled his features  from his shoulders  and discovered  the severe eye  the stern lineaments  and the athletic form of him who had  once before been known to enter the doors of wish ton wish with little  warning  and to have quitted them so mysteriously     the puritan had arisen  with quiet and grave courtesy  to receive his  visiter  but obvious  powerful  and extraordinary interest gleamed  about his usually subdued visage  when  as the features of the other  were exposed to view  he recognised the person of the man who advanced  to meet him      mark heathcote   said the stranger   my visit is to thee  it may  or it  may not  prove longer than the last  as thou shalt receive my tidings   affairs of the last moment demand that there should be little delay in  hearing that which i have to offer      notwithstanding the excess and nature of the surprise which the veteran  mark had certainly betrayed  it endured just long enough to allow those  wondering eyes  which were eagerly devouring all that passed  to note  its existence  then  the subdued and characteristic manner  which in  general marked his air  instantly returned  and with a quiet gesture   like that which friends use in moments of confidence and security  he  beckoned to the other to follow to an inner room  the stranger complied   making a slight bow of recognition to ruth  as he passed her on the way  to the apartment chosen for an interview that was evidently intended to  be private           chapter x             mar   shall i strike at it with my partizan      hor   do  if it will not stand        mar    tis here            hor    tis here        mar    tis gone        hamlet       the time that this unexpected visiter stood uncloaked and exposed to  recognition  before the eyes of the curious group in the outer room  did  not much exceed a minute  still it was long enough to allow men who rarely  overlooked the smallest peculiarity of dress or air  to note some of the  more distinguishing accompaniments of his attire  the heavy horseman s  pistols  once before exhibited  were in his girdle  and young mark got a  glimpse of a silver handled dagger which had pleased his eye before that  night  but the passage of his grandfather and the stranger from the room  prevented the boy from determining whether it was entirely of the same  fashion as that  which  rather as a memorial of by gone scenes than for  any service that it might now be expected to perform  hung above the bed  of the former      the man hath not yet parted with his arms   exclaimed the quick sighted  youth  when he found that every other tongue continued silent   i would he  may now leave them with my grand ther  that i may chase the skulking  wampanoag to his hiding        hot headed boy  thy tongue is too much given to levity   said ruth  who  had not only resumed her seat  but the light employment that had been  interrupted by the blast at the gate with a calmness of mien that did not  fail in some degree to reassure her maidens   instead of cherishing the  lessons of peace that are taught thee  thy unruly thoughts are ever bent  on strife       is there harm in wishing to be armed with a weapon suited to my years   that i may do service in beating down the power of our enemies  and  perhaps aid something  too  in affording security to my mother       thy mother hath no fears   returned the matron gravely  while grateful  affection prompted a kind but furtive glance towards the high spirited  though sometimes froward lad   reason hath already taught me the folly  of alarm  because one has knocked at our gate in the night season  lay  aside thy arms  men  you see that my husband no longer clings to the  musket  be certain that his eye will give us warning  when there shall be  danger at hand      the unconcern of her husband was even more strikingly true  than the  simple language of his wife would appear to convey  content had not only  laid aside his weapon  but he had resumed his seat near the fire  with an  air as calm  as assured  and it might have seemed to one watchfully  observant  as understanding  as her own  until now  the stout dudley had  remained leaning on his piece  immovable and apparently unconscious as a  statue  but  following the injunctions of one he was accustomed to obey   he placed the musket against the wall  with the care of a hunter  and then  running a hand through his shaggy locks  as though the action might  quicken ideas that were never remarkably active  he bluntly exclaimed       an armed hand is well in these forests  but an armed heel is not less  wanting to him who would push a roadster from the connecticut to the  wish ton wish  between a rising and a setting sun  the stranger no longer  journeys in the saddle  as is plain by the sign that his boot beareth no  spur  when he worried  by dint of hard pricking  the miserable hack that  proved food for the wolves  through the forest  he had better  appointments  i saw the bones of the animal no later than this day  they  have been polished by fowls and frost  till the driven snow of the  mountains is not whiter      meaning and uneasy  but hasty glances of the eye were exchanged between  content and ruth  as eben dudley thus uttered the thoughts which had been  suggested by the unexpected return of the stranger      go you to the look out at the western palisadoes   said the latter   and  see if perchance the indian may not be lurking near the dwellings  ashamed  of his delay  and perchance fearful of calling us to his admission  i  cannot think that the child means to desert us  with no sign of kindness   and without leave taking       i will not take upon me to say  how much or how little of ceremony the  youngster may fancy to be due to the master of the valley and his kin  but  if not gone already  the snow will not melt more quietly in the thaw  than  the lad will one day disappear  reuben ring  thou hast an eye for light or  darkness  come forth with me  that no sign escape us  should thy sister   faith  make one of our party  it would not be easy for the red skin to  pass the clearing without a hail       go to   hurriedly answered the female   it is more womanly that i tarry  to see to the wants of him who hath journeyed far and hard  since the  rising of the sun  if the boy pass thy vigilance  wakeful dudley  he will  have little cause to fear that of others      though faith so decidedly declined to make one of the party  her brother  complied without reluctance  the young men were about to quit the place  together  when the latch  on which the hand of dudley was already laid   rose quietly without aid from his finger  the door opened  and the object  of their intended search glided past them  and took his customary position  in one of the more retired corners of the room  there was so much of the  ordinary  noiseless manner of the young captive in this entrance  that for  a moment they who witnessed the passage of his dark form across the  apartment  were led to think the movement no more than the visit he was  always permitted to make at that hour  but recollection soon came  and  with it not only the suspicious circumstance of his disappearance  but the  inexplicable manner of his admission within the gates      the pickets must be looked to   exclaimed dudley  the instant a second  look assured him that his eyes in truth beheld him who had been missing   the place that a stripling can scale  might well admit a host       truly   said content   this needeth explanation  hath not the boy entered  when the gate was opened for the stranger   here cometh one that may speak  to the fact       it is so   said the individual named  who re entered from the inner room  in season to hear the nature of the remark   i found this native child  near thy gate  and took upon me the office of a christian man to bid him  welcome  certain am i  that one  kind of heart and gently disposed  like  the mistress of this family  will not turn him away in anger       he is no stranger at our fire  or at our board   said ruth   had it been  otherwise  thou wouldst have done well      eben dudley looked incredulous  his mind had been powerfully exercised  that day with visions of the marvellous  and  of a certainty  there was  some reason to distrust the manner in which the re appearance of the  youth had been made      it will be well to look to the fastenings   he muttered   lest others   less easy to dispose of  should follow  now that invisible agencies are at  work in the colony  one may not sleep too soundly       then go thou to the look out  and keep the watch  till the clock shall  strike the hour of midnight   said the puritan  who uttered the command in  a manner to show that he was in truth moved by considerations far deeper  than the vague apprehensions of his dependant   ere sleep overcome thee   another shall be ready for the relief      mark heathcote seldom spoke  but respectful silence permitted the lowest  of his syllables to be audible  on the present occasion  when his voice  was first heard  such a stillness came over all in presence  that he  finished the sentence amid the nearly imperceptible breathings of the  listeners  in this momentary but death like quiet  there arose a blast  from the conch at the gate  that might have seemed an echo of that which  had so lately startled the already excited inmates of the dwelling  at the  repetition of sounds so unwonted  all sprang to their feet  but no one  spoke  content cast a hurried and inquiring glance at his father  who in  his turn had anxiously sought the eye of the stranger  the latter stood  firm and unmoved  one hand was clenched upon the back of the chair from  which he had arisen  and  the other grasped  perhaps unconsciously  the  handle of one of those weapons which had attracted the attention of young  mark  and which still continued thrust through the broad leathern belt  that girded his doublet      the sound is like that  which one little used to deal with earthly  instruments might raise   muttered one of those whose mind had been  prepared  by the narrative of dudley  to believe in any thing marvellous      come from what quarter it may  it is a summons that must be answered    returned content   dudley  thy musket  this visit is so unwonted  that  more than one hand should do the office of porter      the borderer instantly complied  muttering between his teeth as he shook  the priming deeper into the barrel of his piece   your over sea gallants  are quick on the trail to night   then throwing the musket into the hollow  of his arm  he cast a look of discontent and resentment towards faith  ring  and was about to open the door for the passage of content  when  another blast arose on the silence without  the second touch  of the shell  was firmer  longer  louder  and more true  than that by which it had just  been preceded      one might fancy the conch was speaking in mockery   observed content   looking with meaning towards their guest   never did sound more resemble  sound than these we have just heard  and those thou drew from the shell  when asking admission      a sudden light appeared to break in upon the intelligence of the stranger   advancing more into the circle  rather with the freedom of long  familiarity than with the diffidence of a newly arrived guest  he motioned  for silence as he said       let none move  but this stout woodsman  the young captain and myself  we  will go forth  and doubt not that the safety of those within shall be  regarded      notwithstanding the singularity of this proposal  as it appeared to excite  neither surprise nor opposition in the puritan or his son  the rest of the  family offered no objection  the stranger had no sooner spoken  than he  advanced near to the torch  and looked closely into the condition of his  pistols  then turning to old mark  he continued in an under tone       peradventure there will be more worldly strife than any which can flow  from the agencies that stir up the unquiet spirits of the colonies  in  such an extremity  it may be well to observe a soldier s caution       i like not this mockery of sound   returned the puritan   it argueth a  taunting and fiend like temper  we have  of late  had in this colony  tragical instances of what the disappointed malice of azazel can attempt   and it would be vain to hope that the evil agencies are not vexed with the  sight of my bethel      though the stranger listened to the words of his host with respect  it was  plain that his thoughts dwelt on dangers of a different character  the  member that still rested on the handle of his weapon  was clenched with  greater firmness  and a grim  though a melancholy expression was seated  about a mouth  that was compressed in a manner to denote the physical   rather than the spiritual resolution of the man  he made a sign to the two  companions he had chosen  and led the way to the court     by this time  the shades of night had materially thickened  and  although  the hour was still early  a darkness had come over the valley that  rendered it difficult to distinguish objects at any distance from the  eye  the obscurity made it necessary that they  who now issued from the  door of the dwelling  should advance with caution  lest  ere properly  admonished of its presence  their persons should be exposed to some  lurking danger  when the three  however  were safely established behind  the thick curtain of plank and earth that covered and commanded the  entrance  and where their persons  from the shoulders downward  were  completely protected  alike from shot and arrow  content demanded to  know  who applied at his gates for admission at an hour when they were  habitually closed for the night  instead of receiving  as before  a ready  answer  the silence was so profound  that his own words were very  distinctly heard repeated  as was not uncommon at that quiet hour  among  the recesses of the neighboring woods      come it from devil  or come it from man  here is treachery   whispered  the stranger after a fitting pause   artifice must be met by artifice   but thou art much abler to advise against the wiles of the forest  than  one trained  as i have been  in the less cunning deceptions of  christian warfare       what think st  dudley   asked content   will it be well to sally  or  shall we wait another signal from the conch       much dependeth on the quality of the guests expected   returned he of  whom counsel was asked   as for the braggart gallants  that are  over valiant among the maidens  and heavy of heart when they think the  screech of the jay an indian whoop  i care not if ye beat the pickets to  the earth  and call upon them to enter on the gallop  i know the manner to  send them to the upper story of the block  quicker than the cluck of the  turkey can muster its young  but           tis well to be discreet in language  in a moment of such serious  uncertainty   interrupted the stranger   we look for no gallants of  the kind       then will i give you a conceit that shall know the reason of the music of  yon conch  go ye two back into the house  making much conversation by the  way  in order that any without may hear  when ye have entered  it shall be  my task to find such a post nigh the gate  that none shall knock again   and no porter be at hand to question them in the matter of their errand       this soundeth better   said content   and that it may be done with all  safety  some others of the young men  who are accustomed to this species  of artifice  shall issue by the secret door and lie in wait behind the  dwellings  in order that support shall not be wanting in case of violence   whatever else thou dost  dudley  remember that thou dost not undo the  fastenings of the postern       look to the support   returned the woodsman   should it be keen eyed  reuben ring  i shall feel none the less certain that good aid is at my  back  the whole of that family are quick of wit and ready of  invention  unless it may be the wight who hath got the form without  the reason of a man       thou shalt have reuben  and none other of his kin   said content   be  well advised of the fastenings  and so i wish thee all fitting success  in  a deception that cannot be sinful  since it aims only at our safety      with this injunction  content and the stranger left dudley to the practice  of his own devices  the former observing the precaution to speak aloud  while returning  in order that any listeners without might be led to  suppose the whole party had retired from the search  satisfied of its  fruitlessness     in the mean time  the youth left nigh the postern set about the  accomplishment of the task he had undertaken  in sober earnest  instead of  descending in a direct line to the palisadoes  he also ascended  and made  a circuit among the out buildings on the margin of the acclivity  then  bending so low as to blend his form with objects on the snow  he gained an  angle of the palisadoes  at a point remote from the spot he intended to  watch  and  as he hoped  aided by the darkness of the hour and the shadows  of the hill  completely protected from observation  when beneath the  palisadoes  the sentinel crouched to the earth  creeping with extreme  caution along the timber which bound their lower ends  until he found  himself arrived at a species of sentry box that was erected for the very  purpose to which he now intended it should be applied  once within the  cover of this little recess  the sturdy woodsman bestowed his large frame   with as much attention to comfort and security as the circumstances would  permit  here he prepared to pass many weary minutes  before there should  be further need of his services     the reader will find no difficulty in believing that one of opinions like  those of the borderer  did not enter on his silent watch without much  distrust of the character of the guests that he might be called upon to  receive  enough has been shown to prove that the suspicion uppermost in  his mind was  that the unwelcome agents of the government had returned on  the heels of the stranger  but  notwithstanding the seeming probability of  this opinion  there were secret misgivings of the earthly origin of the  two last windings of the shell  all the legends  and all the most credited  evidence in cases of prestigious agency  as it had been exhibited in the  colonies of new england  went to show the malignant pleasure the evil  spirits found  in indulging their wicked mockeries  or in otherwise  tormenting those who placed their support on a faith  that was believed to  be so repugnant to their own ungrateful and abandoned natures  under the  impressions  naturally excited by the communication he had held with the  traveller in the mountains  eben dudley found his mind equally divided  between the expectation of seeing  at each moment  one of the men whom he  had induced to quit the valley so unceremoniously  returning to obtain   surreptitiously  admission within the gate  or of being made an unwilling  witness of some wicked manifestation of that power which was temporarily  committed to the invisibles  in both of these expectations  however  he  was fated to be disappointed notwithstanding the strong spiritual bias of  the opinions of the credulous sentinel  there was too much of the dross of  temporal things in his composition  to elevate him altogether above the  weakness of humanity  a mind so encumbered began to weary with its own  contemplations  and  as it grew feeble with its extraordinary efforts  the  dominion of matter gradually resumed its sway  thought  instead of being  clear and active  as the emergency would have seemed to require  began to  grow misty  once or twice the borderer half arose  and appeared to look  about him with observation  and then  as his large frame fell heavily back  into its former semi recumbent attitude  he grew tranquil and stationary   this movement was several times repeated  at intervals of increasing  length  till  at the end of an hour  forgetting alike the hunt  the  troopers  and the mysterious agents of evil  the young man yielded to the  fatigue of the day  the tall oaks of the adjoining forest stood not more  immovable in the quiet of the tranquil hour  than his frame now leaned  against the side of its narrow habitation     how much time was thus lost in inactivity  eben dudley could never  precisely tell  he always stoutly maintained it could not have been long   since his watch was not disturbed by the smallest of those sounds from the  woods  which sometimes occur in deep night  and which may be termed the  breathing of the forest in its slumbers  his first distinct recollection   was that of feeling a hand grasped with the power of a giant  springing to  his feet  the young man eagerly stretched forth an arm  saying as he did  so  in words sufficiently confused       if the buck hath fallen by a shot in the head  i grant him to be thine   reuben ring  but if struck in limb or body  i claim the venison for a  surer hand       truly  a very just division of the spoil   returned one in an under tone   and speaking as if sounds too loud might be dangerous   thou givest the  head of the deer for a target to reuben ring  and keepest the rest of the  creature to thine own uses       who hath sent thee  at this hour  to the postern  dost not know that  there are thought to be strangers  outlying in the fields       i know that there are some  who are not strangers  in lying on their  watch   said faith ring   what shame would come upon thee  dudley  did the  captain  and they who have been so strongly exercised in prayer within   but suspect how little care thou hast had of their safety  the while       have they come to harm  if the captain hath held them to spiritual  movements  i hope he will allow that nothing earthly hath passed this  postern to disturb the exercise  as i hope to be dealt honestly by  in  all matters of character  i have not once quitted the gate  since the  watch was set       else wouldst thou be the famousest sleep walker in the connecticut  colony  why  drowsy one  conch cannot raise a louder blast than that thou  soundest  when eyes are fairly shut in sleep  this may be watching   according to thy meaning of the word  but infant in its cradle is not half  so ignorant of that which passeth around it  as thou hast been       i think  faith ring  that thou hast gotten to be much given to  backbiting  and evil saying against friends  since the visit of the  gallants from over sea       out upon the gallants from over sea  and thee too  man  i am not a girl  to be flouted with bold speech from one who doth not know whether he be  sleeping or waking  i tell thee  thy good name would be lost in the  family  did it come to the ears of the captain  and more particularly to  the knowledge of that soldier stranger  up in the dwelling  of whom even  the madam maketh so great ceremony  that thou hast been watching with a  tuneful nose  an open mouth  and a sealed eye       if any but thee hadst said this slander of me  girl  it would go nigh to  raise hot speech between us  thy brother  reuben ring  knows better than  to stir my temper  by such falsity of accusation       thou dealest so generously by him  that he is prone to forget thy  misdeeds  truly he hath the head of the buck  while thou contentest  thyself with the offals and all the less worthy parts  go to  dudley  thou  wast in a heavy dream when i caused thee to awake       a pretty time have we fallen upon  when petticoats are used instead of  beards and strong armed men  to go the rounds of the sentinels  and to say  who sleepeth and who is watchful  what hath brought thee so far from the  exercises and so nigh the gates  mistress faith  now that there is no  oversea gallant to soothe thy ears with lying speech and light  declarations       if speech not to be credited is that i seek   returned the girl   truly  the errand hath not been without its reward  what brought me hither   sooth  why  the madam hath need of articles from the outer  buttery  and  ay  and my ears led me to the postern  thou knowest  musical  dudley  that i have had occasion to hearken to thy watchful notes before  this night  but my time is too useful to be wasted in idleness  thou art  now awake  and may thank her who hath done thee a good turn with no wish  to boast of it  that one of a black beard is not the laughing stock of all  the youths in the family  if thou keepest thine own counsel  the captain  may yet praise thee for a vigilant sentinel  though heaven forgive him the  wrong he will do the truth      perhaps a little anger at unjust suspicions may have prompted more than  the matter needed  faith  when i taxed thee with the love of backbiting   and i do now recall that word  though i will ever deny that aught more   than some wandering recollection concerning the hunt of this day  hath  come over my thoughts  and perhaps made me even forgetful that it was  needful to be silent at the postern  and therefore  on the truth of a  christian man  i do forgive thee  the         but faith was already out of sight and out of hearing  dudley himself  who  began to have certain prickings of conscience concerning the ingratitude  he had manifested to one who had taken so much interest in his reputation   now bethought him seriously of that which remained to be done  he had much  reason to suspect that there was less of the night before him than he had  at first believed  and he became in consequence more sensible of the  necessity of making some report of the events of his watch  accordingly   he cast a scrutinizing glance around  in order to make sure that the facts  should not contradict his testimony  and then  first examining the  fastenings of the postern  he mounted the hill  and presented himself  before the family  the members of the latter  having in truth passed most  of the long interval of his absence in spiritual exercises  and in  religious conversation  were not so sensible of his delay in reporting  as  they might otherwise have been      what tidings dost thou bring us from without   said content  so soon as  the self relieved sentinel appeared   hast seen any  or hast heard that  which is suspicious      ere dudley would answer  his eye did not fail to study the half malicious  expression of the countenance of her who was busy in some domestic toil   directly opposite to the place where he stood  but reading there no more  than a glance of playful though smothered irony  he was encouraged to  proceed in his report      the watch has been quiet   was the answer   and there is little cause to  keep the sleepers longer from their beds  some vigilant eyes  like those  of reuben ring and my own  had better be open until the morning  further  than that  is there no reason for being wakeful      perhaps the borderer would have dwelt more at large on his own readiness  to pass the remainder of the hours of rest in attending to the security of  those who slept  had not another wicked glance from the dark  laughing eye  of her who stood so favorably placed to observe his countenance   admonished him of the prudence of being modest in his professions      this alarm hath then happily passed away   said the puritan  arising   we  will now go to our pillows in thankfulness and peace  thy service shall  not be forgotten  dudley  for thou hast exposed thyself to seeming danger   at least  in our behalf       that hath he   half whispered faith   and sure am i  that we maidens will  not forget his readiness to lose the sweets of sleep  in order that the  feeble may not come to harm       speak not of the trifle   hurriedly returned the other   there has been  some deception in the sounds  for it is now my opinion  except to summon  us to the gate  that this stranger might enter  the conch hath not been  touched at all to night       then is it a deception which is repeated   exclaimed content  rising from  his chair as a faint and broken blast from the shell  like that which had  first announced their visiter  again struggled among the buildings  until  it reached every ear in the dwelling      here is warning as mysterious as it may prove portentous   said old mark  heathcote  when the surprise  not to say consternation of the moment had  subsided   hast seen nothing that might justify this      eben dudley  like most of the auditors  was too much confounded to reply   all seemed to attend anxiously for the second and more powerful blast   which was to complete the imitation of the stranger s summons  it was not  necessary to wait long  for in a time as near as might be  to that which  had intervened between the two first peals of the horn followed another   and in a note so true  again  as to give it the semblance of an echo           chapter xi                 i will watch to night     perchance  t will walk again        hamlet        may not this be a warning given in mercy   the puritan  at all times  disposed to yield credit to supernatural manifestations of the care of  providence  demanded with a solemnity that did not fail to produce its  impression on most of his auditors   the history of our colonies is full  of the evidences of these merciful interpositions       we will thus consider it   returned the stranger  to whom the question  seemed more particularly addressed   the first measure shall be to seek  out the danger to which it points  let the youth they call dudley  give me  the aid of his powerful frame and manly courage  then trust the discovery  of the meaning of these frequent speakings of the conch  to me       surely  submission  thou wilt not again be the first to go forth    exclaimed mark  in a surprise that was equally manifested by content and  ruth  the latter of whom pressed her little image to her side as though  the bare proposal presented a powerful picture of supernatural danger     twill be well to think maturely on the step  ere thou runnest the hazard  of such an adventure       better it should be i   said content   who am accustomed to forest  signs  and all the usual testimonials of the presence of those who may  wish us harm       no   said he  who for the first time had been called  submission   a name  that savored of the religious enthusiasm of the times  and which might  have been adopted as an open avowal of his readiness to bow beneath some  peculiar dispensation of providence   this service shall be mine  thou art  both husband and father  and many are there who look to thy safety as to  their rock of earthly support and comfort  while neither kindred  nor  but  we will not speak of things foreign to our purpose  thou knowest  mark  heathcote  that peril and i are no strangers  there is little need to bid  me be prudent  come  bold woodsman  shoulder thy musket  and be ready to  do credit to thy manhood  should there be reason to prove it       and why not reuben ring   said a hurried female voice  that all knew to  proceed from the lips of the sister of the youth just named   he is quick  of eye and ready of hand  in trials like these  would it not be well to  succor thy party with such aid       peace  girl   meekly observed ruth   this matter is already in the  ordering of one used to command  there needeth no counsel from thy short  experience      faith shrunk back abashed  the flush which had mantled over her brown  cheek deepening to a tint like that of blood     submission  we use the appellation in the absence of all others  fastened  a searching glance  for a single moment  on the countenance of the girl   and then  as if his intention had not been diverted from the principal  subject in hand  he rejoined coolly       we go as scouters and observers of that which may hereafter call for the  ready assistance of this youth  but numbers would expose us to  observation  without adding to our usefulness  and yet   he added   arresting his footstep  which was already turned towards the door  and  looking earnestly and long at the indian boy   perhaps there standeth one  who might much enlighten us  would he but speak      this remark drew every eye on the person of the captive  the lad stood the  scrutiny with the undismayed and immovable composure of his race  but  though his eye met the looks of those around him haughtily and in pride   it was not gleaming with any of that stern defiance which had so often  been known to glitter in his glances  when he had reason to think that his  fortunes  or his person  was the subject of the peculiar observation of  those with whom he dwelt  on the contrary  the expression of his dark  visage was rather that of amity than of hatred  and there was a moment  when the look he cast upon ruth and her offspring was visibly touched with  a feeling of concern  a glance  charged with such a meaning  could not  escape the quick sighted vigilance of a mother      the child hath proved himself worthy to be trusted   she said   and in  the name of him who looketh into and knoweth all hearts  let him once  more go forth      her lips became sealed  for again the conch announced the seeming  impatience of those without to be admitted  the full tones of the shell  thrilled on the nerves of the listeners  as though they proclaimed the  coming of some great and fearful judgment     in the midst of these often repeated and mysterious sounds  submission  alone seemed calm and unmoved  turning his look from the countenance of  the boy  whose head had dropped upon his breast as the last notes of the  conch rang among the buildings  he motioned hurriedly to dudley to follow   and left the place     there was  in good truth  that in the secluded situation of the valley   the darkness of the hour  and the nature of the several interruptions   which might readily awaken deep concern in the breasts of men as firm  even as those who now issued into the open air  in quest of the solution  of doubts that were becoming intensely painful  the stranger  or  submission  as we may in future have frequent occasion to call him  led  the way in silence to a point of the eminence  without the buildings   where the eye might overlook the palisadoes that hedged the sides of the  acclivity  and command a view beyond of all that the dusky and imperfect  light would reveal     it was a scene that required familiarity with a border life to be looked  on  at any moment  with indifference  the broad  nearly interminable  and  seemingly trackless forest lay about them  bounding the view to the narrow  limits of the valley  as though it were some straitened oasis amidst an  ocean of wilderness  within the boundaries of the cleared land  objects  were less indistinct  though even those nearest and most known were now  seen only in the confused and gloomy outlines of night     across this dim prospect  submission and his companion gazed long and  cautiously      there is nought but motionless stumps  and fences loaded with snow    said the former  when his eye had roamed over the whole circuit of the  view which lay on the side of the valley where they stood   we must go  forth  that we may look nearer to the fields       thither then is the postern   said dudley  observing that the other took  a direction opposite to that which led to the gate  but a gesture of  authority induced him at the next instant to restrain his voice  and to  follow whither his companion chose to lead the way     the stranger made a circuit of half the hill ere he descended to the  palisadoes  at a point where lay long and massive piles of wood  which  had been collected for the fuel of the family  this spot was one that  overlooked the steepest acclivity of the eminence  which was in itself   just there  so difficult of ascent  as to render the provision of the  pickets far less necessary than in its more even faces  still no useful  precaution for the security of the family had been neglected  even at  this strong point of the works  the piles of wood were laid at such a  distance from the pickets as to afford no facilities for scaling them   while  on the other hand  they formed platforms and breast works that  might have greatly added to the safety of those who should be required to  defend this portion of the fortress  taking his way directly amid the  parallel piles  the stranger descended rapidly through the whole of their  mazes  until he had reached the open space between the outer of the  rows and the palisadoes  a space that was warily left too wide to be  passed by the leap of man       tis many a day since foot of mine has been in this spot   said eben  dudley  feeling his way along a path that his companion threaded without  any apparent hesitation   my own hand laid this outer pile  some winters  since  and certain am i  that from that hour to this  man hath not touched  a billet of the wood  and yet  for one who hath come from over sea  it  would appear that thou hast no great difficulty in making way among the  narrow lanes       he that hath sight may well choose between air and beechen logs    returned the other  stopping at the palisadoes  and in a place that was  concealed from any prying eyes within the works  by triple and quadruple  barriers of wood  feeling in his girdle  he then drew forth something  which dudley was not long in discovering to be a key  while the latter   aided by the little light that fell from the heavens  was endeavoring to  make the most of his eyes  submission applied the instrument to a lock  that was artfully sunk in one of the timbers  at the height of a man s  breast from the ground  and giving a couple of vigorous turns  a piece of  the palisado  some half a fathom long  yielded on a powerful hinge below   and  falling  made an opening sufficiently large for the passage of a  human body      here is a sally port ready provided for our sortie   the stranger  coolly observed  motioning to the other to precede him  when dudley had  passed  his companion followed  and the opening was then carefully  closed and locked      now is all fast again  and we are in the fields without raising alarm to  any of mortal birth  at least   continued the guide  thrusting a hand into  the folds of his doublet  as if to feel for a weapon  and preparing to  descend the difficult declivity which still lay between him and the base  of the hill  eben dudley hesitated to follow  the interview with the  traveller in the mountains occurred to his heated imagination  and the  visions of a prestigious agency revived with all their original force   the whole manner and the mysterious character of his companion  was  little likely to reassure a mind disturbed with such images      there is a rumor going in the colony   muttered the borderer   that the  invisibles are permitted for a time to work their evil  and it may well  happen that some of their ungodly members shall journey to the  wish ton wish  in lack of better employment       thou sayest truly   replied the stranger   but the power that allows of  their wicked torments may have seen fit to provide an agent of its own  to  defeat their subtleties  we will now draw nearer to the gate  in order  that an eye may be kept on their malicious designs      submission spoke with gravity  and not without a certain manner of  solemnity  dudley yielded  though with a divided and a disturbed mind  to  his suggestion  still he followed in the footsteps of the stranger  with a  caution that might well have eluded the vigilance of any agency short of  that which drew its means of information from sources deeper than any of  human power     when the two watches had found a secret and suitable place  not far from  the postern  they disposed themselves in silence to await the result  the  outbuildings lay in deep quiet  not a sound of any sort arising from all  of the many tenants they were known to contain  the lines of ragged  fences  the blackened stumps  capped with little pyramids of snow  the  taller and sometimes suspiciously looking stubs  an insulated tree  and  finally the broad border of forest   were alike motionless  gloomy  and  clothed in the doubtful forms of night  still  the space around the  well secured and trebly barred postern was vacant  a sheet of spotless  snow served as a back ground  that would have been sure to betray the  presence of any object passing over its surface  even the conch might be  seen suspended from one of the timbers  as mute and inoffensive as the  hour  when it had been washed by the waves  on the sands of the sea shore      here will we watch for the coming of the stranger  be he commissioned by  the powers of air  or be he one sent on an errand of earth   whisper ed  submission  preparing his arms for immediate use  and disposing of his  person  at the same time  in a manner most convenient to endure the  weariness of a patient watch      i would my mind were at ease on the question of right doing in dealing  harm to one who disturbs the quiet of a border family   said dudley  in a  tone sufficiently repressed for caution   it may be found prudent to  strike the first blow  should one like an over sea gallant  after all  be  inclined to trouble us at this hour       in that strait thou wilt do well to give little heed to the order of the  offences   gloomily returned the other   should another messenger of  england appear         he paused  for a note of the conch was heard rising gradually on the air   until the whole of the wide valley was filled with its rich and  melancholy sound      lip of man is not at the shell   exclaimed the stranger  who like dudley  had made a forward movement towards the postern  the instant the blast  reached his ear  and who like dudley  recoiled in an amazement that even  his practised self command could not conceal  as he undeniably perceived  the truth of that his speech affirmed   this exceedeth all former  instances of marvellous visitations       it is vain to pretend to raise the feeble nature of man to the level of  things coming from the invisible world   returned the woodsman at his  side   in such a strait  it is seemly that sinful men should withdraw to  the dwellings  where we may sustain our feebleness by the spiritual  strivings of the captain      to this discreet proposal the stranger raised no objection  without taking  the time necessary to effect their retreat with the precaution that had  been observed in their advance  the two adventurers quickly found  themselves at the secret entrance through which they had so lately issued      enter   said the stranger  lowering the piece of the palisado for the  passage of his companion   enter  of a heaven s sake  for it is truly meet  that we assemble all our spiritual succor      dudley was in the act of complying  when a dark line  accompanied by a low  rushing sound  cut the air between his head and that of his companion  at  the next instant  a flint headed arrow quivered in the timber      the heathen   shouted the borderer  recovering all his manhood as the  familiar danger became apparent  and throwing back a stream of fire in the  direction from which the treacherous missile had come   to the  palisadoes  men  the bloody heathen is upon us       the heathen   echoed the stranger  in a deep steady  commanding voice   that had evidently often raised the warning in scenes of even greater   emergency  and levelling a pistol  which brought a dark form that was  gliding across the snow to one knee   the heathen  the bloody heathen  is upon us      as if both assailants and assailed paused  one moment of profound  stillness succeeded this fierce interruption of the quiet of the night   then the cries of the two adventurers were answered by a burst of yells  from a wide circle  that nearly environed the hill  at the same moment   each dark object  in the fields  gave up a human form  the shouts were  followed by a cloud of arrows  that rendered further delay without the  cover of the palisadoes eminently hazardous  dudley entered  but the  passage of the stranger would have been cut off  by a leaping  whooping  band that pressed fiercely on his rear  had not a broad sheet of flame   glancing from the hill directly in their swarthy and grim countenances   driven the assailants back upon their own footsteps  in another moment   the bolts of the lock were passed  and the two fugitives were in safety  behind the ponderous piles of wood           chapter xii            there need no ghost  my lord  come from the grave    to tell us this        hamlet      although the minds of most  if not of all the inmates of the  wish ton wish  had been so powerfully exercised that night with a belief  that the powers of the invisible world were about to be let loose upon  them  the danger had now presented itself in a shape too palpable to admit  of further doubt  the cry of  the heathen  had been raised from every lip   even the daughter and eleve of ruth repeated it  as they fled wailing  through the buildings  and  for a moment  terror and surprise appeared to  involve the assailed in inextricable confusion  but the promptitude of the  young men in rushing to the rescue  with the steadiness of content  soon  restored order  even the females assumed at least the semblance of  composure  the family having been too long trained to meet the exigencies  of such an emergency  to be thrown entirely off its guard  for more than  the first and the most appalling moments of the alarm     the effect of the sudden repulse was such as all experience had taught  the colonists to expect  in their indian warfare  the uproar of the onset  ceased as abruptly as it had commenced  and a calmness so tranquil  and a  stillness so profound  succeeded  that one who had for the first time  witnessed such a scene  might readily have fancied it the effects of some  wild and fearful illusion     during these moments of general and deep silence  the two adventurers   whose retreat had probably hastened the assault by offering the temptation  of an easy passage within the works  left the cover of the piles of wood   and ascended the hill to the place where dudley knew content was to be  posted  in the event of a summons to the defences      unless much inquiry hath deceived me in the nature of the heathen s  craftiness   said the stranger   we shall have breathing time ere the  onset be renewed  the experience of a soldier bids me say  that prudence  now urges us to look into the number and position of our foes  that we may  order our resistance with better understanding of their force       in what manner of way may this be done  thou seest nought about us but  the quiet and the darkness of night  speak of the number of our enemies we  cannot  and sally forth we may not  without certain destruction to all who  quit the palisadoes       thou forgottest that we have a hostage in the boy  he may be turned to  some advantage  if our power over his person be used with discretion       i doubt that we deceive ourselves with a hope that is vain   returned  content  leading the way as he spoke  however  towards the court which  communicated with the principal dwelling   i have closely studied the eye  of that lad  since his unaccountable entrance within the works  and little  do i find there that should teach us to expect confidence  it will be  happy if some secret understanding with those without  has not aided him  in passing the palisadoes  and that he prove not a dangerous spy on our  force and movements       in regard to that he hath entered the dwelling without sound of conch or  aid of postern  be no disturbed   returned the stranger with composure    were it fitting  this mystery might be of easy explanation  but it may  truly need all our sagacity to discover whether he hath connection with  our foes  the mind of a native does not give up its secrets like the  surface of a vanity feeding mirror      the stranger  spoke like a man who wrapped a portion of his thoughts in  reserve  and his companion listened as one who comprehended more than it  might be seemly or discreet to betray  with this secret and yet equivocal  understanding of each other s meaning  they entered the dwelling  and soon  found themselves in the presence of those they sought     the constant danger of their situation had compelled the family to  bring themselves within the habits of a methodical and severely regulated  order of defense  duties were assigned  in the event of alarm  to the  feeblest bodies and the faintest hearts  and during the moments which  preceded the visit of her husband  ruth had been endeavoring to commit  to her female subordinates the several necessary charges that usage  and  more particularly the emergency of the hour  appeared so imperiously to  require      hasten  charity  to the block   she said   and look into the condition of  the buckets and the ladders  that should the heathen drive us to its  shelter  provision of water  and means of retreat  be not wanting in our  extremity  and hie thee  faith  into the upper apartments  to see that no  lights may direct their murderous aim at any in the chambers  thoughts  come tardily  when the arrow or the bullet hath already taken its flight   and now  that the first assault is over  mark  and we may hope to meet the  wiles of the enemy by some prudence of our own  thou mayst go forth to thy  father  it would have been tempting providence too rashly  hadst thou  rushed  unbidden and uninformed  into the first hurry of the danger  come  hither  child  and receive the blessing and prayers of thy mother  after  which thou shalt  with better trust in providence  place thy young person  among the combatants  in the hope of victory  remember that thou art now  of an age to do justice to thy name and origin  and yet art thou of years  too tender to be foremost in speech  and far less in action  on such a  night as this      a momentary flush  that only served to render the succeeding paleness more  obvious  passed across the brow of the mother  she stooped  and imprinted  a kiss on the forehead of the impatient boy  who scarcely waited to  receive this act of tenderness  ere he hurried to place himself in the  ranks of her defenders      and now   said ruth  slowly turning her eye from the door by which the  lad had disappeared  and speaking with a sort of unnatural composure   and  now will we look to the safety of those who can be of but little service   except as sentinels to sound the alarm  when thou art certain  faith  that  no neglected light is in the rooms above  take the children to the secret  chamber  thence they may look upon the fields  without danger from any  chance direction of the savages  aim  thou knowest  faith  my frequent  teaching in this matter  let no sounds of alarm  nor frightful whoopings  of the people without  cause thee to quit the spot  since thou wilt there  be safer even than in the block  against which many missiles will  doubtless be driven on account of its seeming air of strength  timely  notice shall be given of the change  should we seek its security  thou  wilt descend  only  shouldst thou see enemies scaling the palisadoes on  the side which overhangs the stream  since there have we the fewest eyes  to watch their movements  remember that on the side of the out buildings  and of the fields  our force is chiefly posted  there can be less reason  therefore that thou shouldst expose thy lives by endeavoring to look  too  curiously  into that which passeth in the fields  go  my children  and a  heavenly providence prove thy guardian      ruth stooped to kiss the cheek that her daughter offered to the salute   the embrace was then given to the other child  who was in truth scarcely  less near her heart  being the orphan daughter of one who had been as a  sister in her affections  but  unlike the kiss she had impressed on the  forehead of mark  the present embraces were hasty  and evidently awakened  less intense emotion  she had committed the boy to a known and positive  danger  but  under the semblance of some usefulness  she sent the others  to a place believed to be even less exposed  so long as the enemy could be  kept without the works  than the citadel itself  still  a feeling of deep  and maternal tenderness came over her mind  as her daughter retired  and   yielding to its sudden impulse  she recalled the girl to her side      thou wilt repeat the prayer for especial protection against the dangers  of the wilderness   she solemnly continued   in thy asking  fail not to  remember him to whom thou owest being  and who now exposeth life  that we  may be safe  thou knowest the christian s rock  place thy faith on its  foundation       and they who seek to kill us   demanded the well instructed child   are  they too of the number of those for whom he died       it may not be doubted  though the manner of the dispensation be so  mysterious  barbarians in their habits  and ruthless in their enmities   they are creatures of our nature  and equally objects of his care      flaxen locks  that half covered a forehead and face across which ran the  most delicate tracery of veins  added lustre to a skin as spotlessly fair  as if the warm breezes of that latitude had never fanned the countenance  of the girl  through this maze of ringlets  the child turned her full   clear  blue eyes  bending her looks  in wonder and in fear  on the dark  visage of the captive indian youth  who at that moment was to her a  subject of secret horror  unconscious of the interest he excited  the lad  stood calm  haughty  and seemingly unobservant  cautious to let no sign of  weakness or of concern escape him  in this scene of womanly emotion      mother   whispered the still wondering child   may we not let him go into  the forest  i do not love to        this is no time for speech  go to thy hiding place  my child  and  remember both thy askings and the cautions i have named  go  and heavenly  care protect thy innocent head      ruth again stooped  and bowing her face until the features were lost in  the rich tresses of her daughter  a moment passed during which there was  an eloquent silence  when she arose  a tear glistened on the cheek of the  child  the latter had received the embrace more in apathy than in concern   and now  when led towards the upper rooms  she moved from the presence of  her mother  it was with an eye that never bent its riveted gaze from the  features of the young indian  until the intervening walls hid him entirely  from her sight      thou hast been thoughtful and like thyself  my good ruth   said content   who at that moment entered  and who rewarded the self command of his wife  by a look of the kindest approbation   the youths have not been more  prompt in meeting the foe at the stockades  than thy maidens in looking to  their less hardy duties  all is again quiet  without  and we come  now   rather for consultation  than for any purposes of strife       then must we summon our father from his post at the artillery  in  the block       it is not needful   interrupted the stranger   time presses  for this  calm may be too shortly succeeded by a tempest that all our power shall  not quell  bring forth the captive      content signed to the boy to approach  and when he was in reach of his  hand  he placed him full before the stranger      i know not thy name  nor yet even that of thy people   commenced the  latter  after a long pause in which he seemed to study deeply the  countenance of the lad   but certain am i  though a more wicked spirit may  still be struggling for the mastery in thy wild mind  that nobleness of  feeling is no stranger to thy bosom  speak  hast thou aught to impart  concerning the danger that besets this family  i have learned much this  night from thy manner  but to be clearly understood  it is now time that  thou shouldst speak in words      the youth kept his eye fastened on that of the speaker  until the other  had ended  and then he bent it slowly  but with searching observation  on  the anxious countenance of ruth  it seemed as if he balanced between his  pride and his sympathies  the latter prevailed  for  conquering the deep  reluctance of an indian  he spoke openly  and for the first time  since  his captivity  in the language of the hated race      i hear the whoops of warriors   was his calm answer   have the ears of  the pale men been shut       thou hast spoken with the young men of thy tribe in the forest  and thou  hadst knowledge of this onset      the youth made no reply  though the keen look of his interrogator was met  steadily  and without fear  perceiving that he had demanded more than  would be answered  the stranger changed his mode of investigation  masking  his inquiries with a little more of artifice      it may not be that a great tribe is on the bloody path   he said    warriors would have walked over the timbers of the palisadoes  like  bending reeds   tis a pequot who hath broken faith with a christian  and  who is now abroad  prowling as a wolf in the night      a sudden and wild expression gleamed over the swarthy features of the  boy  his lips moved  and the words that issued from between them were  uttered in the tones of biting scorn  still he rather muttered than  pronounced aloud       the pequot is a dog       it is as i had thought  the knaves are out of their villages  that the  yengeese may feed their squaws  but a narragansett  or a wampanoag  is a  man  he scorns to lurk in the darkness  when he comes  the sun will light  his path  the pequot steals in silence  for he fears that the warriors  will hear his tread      it was not easy to detect any evidence that the captive listened  either  to the commendation or the censure  with answering sympathy  for marble is  not colder that were the muscles of his unmoved countenance     the stranger studied the expression of his features in vain  and drawing  so near as to lay his hand on the naked shoulder of the lad  he  added   boy  thou hast heard much moving matter concerning the nature of  our christian faith  and thou hast been the subject of many a fervent  asking  it may not be that so much good seed hath been altogether  scattered by the way side  speak  may i again trust thee       let my father look on the snow  the print of the moccasin goes and  comes       it is true  thus far hast thou proved honest  but when the war whoop  shall be thrilling through thy young blood  the temptation to join the  warriors may be too strong  hast any gage  any pledge  in which we may  find warranty for letting thee depart      the boy regarded his interrogator with a look that plainly denoted  ignorance of his meaning      i would know what thou canst leave with me  to show that our eyes shall  again look upon thy face  when we have opened the gate for thy passage  into the fields      still the gaze of the other was wondering and confused      when the white man goes upon the war path and would put trust in his foe   he takes surety for his faith  by holding the life of one dear as a  warranty of its truth  what canst offer  that i may know thou wilt return  from the errand on which i would fain send thee       the path is open       open  but not certain to be used  fear may cause thee to forget the way  it leads      the captive now understood the meaning of the other s doubts  but  as  if disdaining to reply  he bent his eyes aside  and stood in one of  those immovable attitudes which so often gave him the air of a piece of  dark statuary     content and his wife had listened to this short dialogue  in a manner to  prove that they possessed some secret knowledge  which lessened the wonder  they might otherwise have felt  at witnessing so obvious proofs of a  secret acquaintance between the speakers  both however manifested  unequivocal signs of astonishment  when they first heard english sounds  issuing from the lips of the boy  there was  at least  the semblance of  hope in the mediation of one who had received  and who had appeared to  acknowledge  so much kindness from herself  and ruth clung to the cheering  expectation with the quickness of maternal care      let the boy depart   she said   i will be his hostage  and should he  prove false  there can be less to fear in his absence than in his  presence      the obvious truth of the latter assertion probably weighed more with the  stranger than the unmeaning pledge of the woman      there is reason in this   he resumed   go  then  into the fields  and say  to thy people that they have mistaken the path  that  they are on  hath  led them to the dwelling of a friend  here are no pequots  nor any of the  men of the manhattoes  but christian yengeese  who have long dealt with  the indian as one just man dealeth with another  go  and when thy signal  shall be heard at the gate  it shall be open to thee  for readmission      thus saying  the stranger motioned to the boy to follow  taking care  as  they left the room together  to instruct him in all such minor matters as  might assist in effecting the pacific object of the mission on which he  was employed     a few minutes of doubt and of fearful suspense succeeded this experiment   the stranger  after seeing that egress was permitted to his messenger  had  returned to the dwelling  and rejoined his companions  he passed the  moments in pacing the apartment  with the strides of one in whom powerful  concern was strongly at work  at times  the sound of his heavy footstep  ceased  and then all listened intently  in order to catch any sound that  might instruct them in the nature of the scene that was passing without   in the midst of one of these pauses  a yell like that of savage delight  arose in the fields  it was succeeded by the death like and portentous  calm  which had rendered the time since the momentary attack even more  alarming than when the danger had a positive and known character  but all  the attention the most intense anxiety could now lend  furnished no  additional clue to the movement of their foes  for many minutes  the quiet  of midnight reigned both within and without the defences  in the midst of  this suspense  the latch of the door was lifted  and their messenger  appeared with that noiseless tread and collected mien which distinguish  the people of his race      thou hast met the warriors of thy tribe   hastily demanded the stranger      the noise did not cheat the yengeese  it was not a girl  laughing in  the woods       and thou hast said to thy people   we are friends        the words of my father were spoken       and heard  were they loud enough to enter the ears of the young men      the boy was silent      speak   continued the stranger  elevating his form  proudly  like one  ready to breast a more severe shock   thou hast men for thy listeners  is  the pipe of the savage filled  will he smoke in peace  or holdeth he the  tomahawk in a clenched hand      the countenance the boy worked with a feeling that it was not usual for an  indian to betray  he bent his look  with concern  on the mild eyes of the  anxious ruth  then drawing a hand slowly from beneath the light robe that  partly covered his body  he cast at the feet of the stranger a bundle of  arrows  wrapped in the glossy and striped skin of the rattlesnake      this is warning we may not misconceive   said content  raising the  well known emblem of ruthless hostility to the light  and exhibiting it  before the eyes of his less instructed companion   boy  what have the  people of my race done  that thy warriors should seek their blood  to this  extremity      when the boy had discharged his duty  he moved aside  and appeared  unwilling to observe the effect which his message might produce on his  companions  but thus questioned  all gentle feelings were near being  forgotten  in the sudden force of passion  a hasty glance at ruth quelled  the emotion  and he continued calm as ever  and silent      boy   repeated content   i ask thee why thy people seek our blood      the passage of the electric spark is not more subtle  nor is it  scarcely more brilliant  than was the gleam that shot into the dark eye  of the indian  the organ seemed to emit rays coruscant as the glance of  the serpent  his form appeared to swell with the inward strivings of  the spirit  and for a moment there was every appearance of a fierce and  uncontrollable burst of ferocious passion  the conquest of feeling was   however  but momentary  he regained his self command by a surprising  effort of the will  and advancing so near to him who had asked this  bold question  as to lay a finger on his breast  the young savage  haughtily said       see  this world is very wide  there is room on it for the panther and the  deer  why have the yengeese and the red men met       we waste the precious moments in probing the stern nature of a heathen    said the stranger   the object of his people is certain  and  with the aid  of the christian s staff  will we beat back their power  prudence  requireth at our hands  that the lad be secured  after which  will we  repair to the stockades and prove ourselves men      against this proposal no reasonable objection could be raised  content  was about to secure the person of his captive in a cellar  when a  suggestion of his wife caused him to change his purpose  notwithstanding  the sudden and fierce mien of the youth  there had been such an  intelligence created between them by looks of kindness and interest  that  the mother was reluctant to abandon all hope of his aid      miantonimoh   she said   though others distrust thy purpose  i will  have confidence  come  then  with me  and while i give thee promise of  safety in thine own person  i ask at thy hands the office of a protector  for my babes      the boy made no reply  but as he passively followed his conductress to the  chambers  ruth fancied she read assurance of his faith  in the expression  of his eloquent eye  at the same moment  her husband and submission left  the house  to take their stations at the palisadoes           chapter xiii            thou art  my good youth  my page     i ll be thy master  walk with me  speak freely        cymbeline       the apartment  in which ruth had directed the children to be placed  was  in the attic  and  as already stated  on the side of the building which  faced the stream that ran at the foot of the hill  it had a single  projecting window  through which there was a view of the forest and of the  fields on that side of the valley  small openings in its sides admitted  also of glimpses of the grounds which lay further in the rear  in addition  to the covering of the roofs  and of the massive frame work of the  building  an interior partition of timber protected the place against the  entrance of most missiles then known in the warfare of the country  during  the infancy of the children  this room had been their sleeping apartment   nor was it abandoned for that purpose  until the additional outworks   which increased with time around the dwellings  had emboldened the family  to trust themselves  at night  in situations more convenient  and which  were believed to be no less equally secure against surprise      i know thee to be one who feeleth the obligations of a warrior   said  ruth  as she ushered her follower into the presence of the children   thou  wilt not deceive me  the lives of these tender ones are in thy keeping   look to them  miantonimoh  and the christian s god will remember thee in  thine own hour of necessity      the boy made no reply  but in a gentle expression which was visible in his  dark visage  the mother endeavored to find the pledge she sought  then  as  the youth  with the delicacy of his race  moved aside in order that they  who were bound to each other by ties so near might indulge their feelings  without observation  ruth again drew near her offspring  with all the  tenderness of a mother beaming in her eyes      once more i bid thee not to look too curiously at the fearful strife that  may arise in front of our habitations   she said   the heathen is truly  upon us  with bloody mind  young  as well as old  must now show faith in  the protection of our master  and such courage as befitteth believers       and why is it  mother   demanded her child   that they seek to do us  harm  have we ever done evil to them       i may not say  he that hath made the earth hath given it to us for our  uses  and reason would seem to teach that if portions of its surface are  vacant  he that needeth truly  may occupy       the savage   whispered the child  nestling still nearer to the bosom of  her stooping parent   his eye glittereth like the star which hangs above  the trees       peace  daughter  his fierce nature broodeth over some fancied wrong       surely  we are here rightfully  i have heard my father say  that when the  lord made me a present to his arms  our valley was a tangled forest  and  that much toil only has made it as it is       i hope that what we enjoy  we enjoy rightfully  and yet it seemeth that  the savage is ready to deny our claims       and where do these bloody enemies dwell  have they  too  valleys like  this  and do the christians break into them to shed blood  in the night       they are of wild and fierce habits  ruth  and little do they know of our  manner of life  woman is not cherished as among the people of thy father s  race  for force of body is more regarded than kinder ties      the little auditor shuddered  and when she buried her face deeper in the  bosom of her parent  it was with a more quickened sense of maternal  affection  and with a livelier view  than her infant perception had ever  yet known  of the gentle charities of kindred  when she had spoken  the  matron impressed the final kiss on the forehead of each of the children   and asking  aloud  that god might bless them  she turned to go to the  performance of duties that called for the exhibition of very different  qualities  before quitting the room  however  she once more approached the  boy  and  holding the light before his steady eye  she said solemnly       i trust my babes to the keeping of a young warrior      the look he returned was like the others  cold but not discouraging  a  gaze of many moments elicited no reply  and ruth prepared to quit the  place  troubled by uncertainty concerning the intentions of the guardian  she left with the girls  while she still trusted that the many acts of  kindness which she had shown him  during his captivity  would not go  without their reward  her hand rested on the bolt of the door  in  indecision  the moment was favorable to the character of the youth  for  she recalled the manner of his return that night  no less than his former  acts of faith  and she was about to leave the passage for his egress open   when an uproar arose on the air which filled the valley with all the  hideous cries and yells of a savage onset  drawing the bolt  the startled  woman descended  without further thought  and rushed to her post  with the  hurry of one who saw only the necessity of exertion in another scene      stand to the timbers  reuben ring  bear back the skulking murderers on  their bloody followers  the pikes  here  dudley is opening for thy valor   the lord have mercy on the souls of the ignorant heathen   mingled with  the reports of musketry  the whoops of the warriors  the whizzing of  bullets and arrows  with all the other accompaniments of such a contest   were the fearful sounds that saluted the senses of ruth as she issued into  the court  the valley was occasionally lighted by the explosion of  fire arms  and then  at times  the horrible din prevailed in the gloom of  deep darkness  happily  in the midst of all this  confusion and violence   the young men of the valley were true to their duties  an alarming attempt  to scale the stockade had already been repulsed  and  the true character  of two or three feints having been ascertained  the principal force of the  garrison was now actively employed in resisting the main attack      in the name of him who is with us in every danger   exclaimed ruth   advancing to two figures that were so busily engaged in their own  concerns  as not to heed her approach   tell me how goes the struggle   where are my husband and the boy   or has it pleased providence that any  of our people should be stricken       it hath pleased the devil   returned eben dudley  somewhat irreverently  for one of that chastened school   to send an indian arrow through jerkin  and skin  into this arm of mine  softly  faith  dost think  girl  that  the covering of man is like the coat of a sheep  from which the fleece  may be plucked at will  i am no moulting fowl  nor is this arrow a  feather of my wing  the lord forgive the rogue for the ill turn he hath  done my flesh  say i  and amen like a christian  he will have occasion  too for the mercy  seeing he hath nothing further to hope for in this  world  now  faith  i acknowledge the debt of thy kindness  and let there  be no more cutting speech between us  thy tongue often pricketh more  sorely than the indian s arrow       whose fault is it that old acquaintance hath sometimes been overlooked   in new conversations  thou knowest that  wooed by proper speech  no maiden  in the colony is wont to render gentler answer  dost feel uneasiness in  thine arm  dudley        tis not tickling with a straw  to drive a flint headed arrow to the  bone  i forgive thee the matter of too much discourse with the trooper   and all the side cuts of thy over ambling tongue  on conditions that          out upon thee  brawler  wouldst be prating here the night long on  pretence of a broken skin  and the savage at our gates  a fine character  will the madam render of thy deeds  when the other youths have beaten back  the indian  and thou loitering among the buildings      the discomfited borderer was about to curse in his heart the versatile  humor of his mistress  when he saw  by a side glance  that ears which had  no concern in the subject  had liked to have shared in the matter of their  discourse  seizing the weapon which was leaning against the foundation of  the block  he hurried past the mistress of the family  and  in another  minute  his voice and his musket were again heard ringing in the uproar      does he bring tidings from the palisadoes   repeated ruth  too anxious  that the young man should return to his post  to arrest his retreat   what  saith he of the onset       the savage hath suffered for his boldness  and little harm hath yet come  to our people  except that yon block of a man hath managed to put arm  before the passage of an arrow  i know not that any of our people have  been harmed       hearken  they retire  ruth  the yells are less near  and our young men  will prevail  go thou to thy charge among the piles of the fuel  and see  that no lurker remaineth to do injury  the lord hath remembered mercy  and  it may yet arrive that this evil shall pass away from before us      the quick ear of ruth had not deceived her  the tumult of the assault was  gradually receding from the works  and though the flashings of the muskets  and the bellowing reports that rang in the surrounding forest were not  less frequent than before  it was plain that the critical moment of the  onset was already past  in place of the fierce effort to carry the place  by surprise  the savages had now resorted to means that were more  methodical  and which  though not so appalling in appearance  were perhaps  quite as certain of final success  ruth profited by a momentary cessation  in the flight of the missiles  to seek those in whose welfare she had  placed her chief concern      has other  than brave dudley  suffered by this assault   demanded the  anxious wife  as she passed swiftly among a group of dusky figures that  were collected in consultation  on the brow of the declivity   has any  need of such care as a woman s hand may bestow  heathcote  thy person is  unharmed       truly  one of great mercy hath watched over it  for little opportunity  hath been given to look to our own safety  i fear that some of our young  men have not regarded the covers with the attention that prudence  requires       the thoughtless mark hath not forgotten my admonitions  boy  thou hast  never lost sight of duty so far as to precede thy father       one sees or thinks but little of the red skins  when the whoop is ringing  among the timbers of the palisadoes  mother   returned the boy  dashing  his hand across his brow  in order that the drops of blood which were  trickling from a furrow left by the passage of an arrow  might not be  seen   i have kept near my father  but whether in his front or in his  rear  the darkness hath not permitted me to note       the lad hath behaved in a bold and seemly manner   said the stranger    and he hath shown the metal of his grandsire s stock  ha  what is t we  see gleaming among the sheds  a sortie may be needed  to save the  granaries and thy folds from destruction       to the barns  to the barns   shouted two of the youths  from their  several look outs   the brand is in the buildings   exclaimed a maiden  who discharged a similar duty under cover of the dwellings  then  followed a discharge of muskets  all of which were levelled at the  glancing light that was glaring in fearful proximity to the combustible  materials which filled the most of the out buildings  a savage yell  and  the sudden extinguishment of the blazing knot  announced the fatal  accuracy of the aim      this may not be neglected   exclaimed content  moved to extraordinary  excitement by the extremity of the danger   father   he called aloud     tis fitting time to show our utmost strength      a moment of suspense succeeded this summons  the whole valley was then as  suddenly lighted  as if a torrent of the electric fluid had flashed  across its gloomy bed  a sheet of flame glanced from the attic of the  block  and then came the roar of the little piece of artillery  which had  so long dwelt there in silence  the rattling of a shot among the sheds   and the rending of timber  followed  fifty dark forms were seen  by the  momentary light  gliding from among the out buildings  in an alarm  natural to their ignorance  and with an agility proportioned to their  alarm  the moment was propitious  content silently motioned to reuben  ring  they passed the postern together  and disappeared in the direction  of the barns  the period of their absence was one of intense care to  ruth  and it was not without its anxiety even to those whose nerves were  better steeled  a few moments  however  served to appease these feelings   for the adventurers returned in safety  and as silently as they had  quitted the defences  the trampling of feet on the crust of the snow  the  neighing of horses  and the bellowing of frightened cattle  as the  terrified beasts scattered about the fields  soon proclaimed the object  of the risk which had just been run      enter   whispered ruth  who held the postern with her own hand   enter   of heaven s mercy  thou hast given liberty to every hoof  that no living  creature perish by the flames       all  and truly not too speedily  for  see  the brand is again at work      content had much reason to felicitate himself on his expedition  for   even while he spoke  half concealed torches  made as usual of blazing  knots of pine  were again seen glancing across the fields  evidently  approaching the out buildings by such indirect and covered paths  as might  protect those who bore them from the shot of the garrison  a final and  common effort was made to arrest the danger  the muskets of the young men  were active  and more than once did the citadel of the stern old puritan  give forth its flood of flame  in order to beat back the dangerous  visitants  a few shrieks of savage disappointment and of bodily anguish   announced the success of these discharges  but  though most of those who  approached the barns were either driven back in fear  or suffered for  their temerity  one among them  more wary or more practised than his  companions  found means to effect his object  the firing had ceased  and  the besieged were congratulating themselves on success  when a sudden  light glared across the fields  a sheet of flame soon came curling over  the crest of a wheat stack  and quickly wrapped the inflammable material  in its fierce torrent  against this destruction there remained no remedy   the barns and inclosures which  so lately  had been lying in the darkness  of the hour  were instantly illuminated  and life would have been the  penalty paid by any of either party  who should dare to trust his person  within the bright glare  the borderers were soon compelled to fall back   even within the shadows of the hill  and to seek such covers as the  stockades offered  in order to avoid the aim of the arrow or the bullet      this is a mournful spectacle to one that has harvested in charity with  all men   said content to the trembler who convulsively grasped his arm   as the flame whirled in the currents of the heated air  and  sweeping once  or twice across the roof of a shed  left a portion of its torrent creeping  insidiously along the wooden covering   the in gathering of a blessed  season is about to melt into ashes  before the brand of these accur          peace  heathcote  what is wealth  or the fulness of thy granaries  to  that which remains  check these repinings of thy spirit  and bless god  that he leaveth us our babes  and the safety of our inner roofs       thou sayest truly   returned the husband  endeavoring to imitate the meek  resignation of his companion   what indeed are the gifts of the world  set  in the balance against the peace of mind  ha  that evil blast of wind  sealeth the destruction of our harvest  the fierce element is in the heart  of the granaries      ruth made no reply  for though less moved by worldly cares than her  husband  the frightful progress of the conflagration alarmed her with a  sense of personal danger  the flames had passed from roof to roof  and  meeting everywhere with fuel of the most combustible nature  the whole of  the vast range of barns  sheds  granaries  cribs and out buildings  was  just breaking forth in the brightness of a torrent of fire  until this  moment  suspense  with hope on one side and apprehension on the other  had  kept both parties mute spectators of the scene  but yells of triumph soon  proclaimed the delight with which the indians witnessed the completion of  their fell design  the whoops followed this burst of pleasure  and a third  onset was made     the combatants now fought under a brightness which  though less natural   was scarcely less brilliant than that of noon day  stimulated by the  prospect of success  which was offered by the conflagration  the savages  rushed upon the stockade with more audacity than it was usual to display  in their cautious warfare  a broad shadow was cast  by the hill and its  buildings  across the fields on the side opposite to the flames  and  through this belt of comparative gloom  the fiercest of the band made  their way to the very palisadoes  with impunity  their presence was  announced by the yell of delight  for too many curious eyes had been  drinking in the fearful beauty of the conflagration  to note their  approach  until the attack had nearly proved successful  the rushes to the  defence  and to the attack  were now alike quick and headlong  volleys  were useless  for the timbers offered equal security to both assailant and  assailed  it was a struggle of hand to hand  in which numbers would have  prevailed  had it not been the good fortune of the weaker party to act on  the defensive  blows of the knife were passed swiftly between the timbers   and occasionally the discharge of the musket  or the twanging of the bow  was heard      stand to the timbers  my men   said the deep tones of the stranger  who  spoke in the midst of the fierce struggle with that commanding and  stirring cheerfulness that familiarity with danger can alone inspire    stand to the defences  and they are impassable  ha   twas well meant   friend savage   he muttered between his teeth  as he parried  at some  jeopardy to one hand  a thrust aimed at his throat  while with the other  he seized the warrior who had inflicted the blow  and drawing his naked  breast  with the power of a giant  full against the opening between the  limbers  he buried his own keen blade to its haft in the body  the eyes of  the victim rolled wildly  and when the iron hand which bound him to the  wood  with the power of a vice  loosened its grasp  he fell motionless on  the earth  this death was succeeded by the usual yell of disappointment   and the assailants disappeared  as swiftly as they had approached      god be praised  that we have to rejoice in this advantage   said content   enumerating the individuals of his force  with an anxious eye  when all  were again assembled at the stand on the hill  where  favored by the  glaring light  they could overlook  in comparative security  the more  exposed parts of their defences   we count our own  though i fear me  many  may have suffered      the silence and the occupations of his listeners  most of whom were  stanching their blood  was a sufficient answer      hist  father   said the quick eyed and observant mark   one remaineth on  the palisado nearest the wicket  is it a savage  or do i see a stump  in  the field beyond      all eyes followed the direction of the hand of the speaker  and there was  seen  of a certainty  something clinging to the inner side of one of the  timbers  that bore a marked resemblance to the human form  the part of the  stockades  where the seeming figure clung  lay more in obscurity than the  rest of the defences  and doubts as to its character were not alone  confined to the quick sighted lad who had first detected its presence      who hangs upon our palisadoes   called eben dudley   speak  that we do  not harm a friend      the wood itself was not more immovable than the dark object  until the  report of the borderer s musket was heard  and then it came tumbling to  the earth like an insensible mass      fallen like a stricken bear from his tree  life was in it  or no bullet  of mine could have loosened the hold   exclaimed dudley  a little in  exultation as he saw the success of his aim      i will go forward  and see that he is past         the mouth of young mark  was stopped by the hand of the stranger  who  calmly observed       i will look into the fate of the heathen  myself   he was about to  proceed to the spot  when the supposed dead  or wounded man  sprang to his  feet  with a yell that rang in echoes along the margin of the forest  and  bounded towards the cover of the buildings  with high and active leaps   two or three muskets sent their streaks of flame across his path  but  seemingly without success  jumping in a manner to elude the certainty of  their fire  the unharmed savage gave forth another yell of triumph  and  disappeared among the angles of the dwellings  his cries were understood   for answering whoops were heard in the fields  and the foe without again  rallied to the attack      this may not be neglected   said he who  more by his self possession and  air of authority  than by any known right to command  had insensibly  assumed so much authority in the important business of that night   one  like this  within our walls  may quickly bring destruction on the  garrison  the postern may be opened to an inroad          a triple lock secures it   interrupted content   the key is hid where  none know to seek it  other than such as are of our household       and happily the means of passing the private wicket are in my  possession   muttered the other  in an under tone   so far  well  but the  brand  the brand  the maidens must look to the fires and lights  while  the youths make good the stockade  since this assault admitteth not of  further delay      so saying  the stranger gave an example of courage by proceeding to his  stand at the pickets  where  supported by his companions  he continued to  defend the approaches against a discharge of arrows and bullets that was  more distant  but scarcely less dangerous to the safety of those who  showed themselves on the side of the acclivity  than those which had been  previously showered upon the garrison     in the mean time  ruth summoned her assistants  and hastened to discharge  the duty which had just been prescribed  water was cast freely on all the  fires  and  as the still raging conflagration continued to give far more  light than was either necessary or safe  care was taken to extinguish any  torch or candle that  in the hurry of alarm  might have been left to  moulder in its socket  throughout the extensive range of the dwellings and  the offices           chapter xiv            thou mild  sad mother                  quit him not so soon     mother  in mercy  stay     despair and death are with him  and canst thou     with that kind  earthward look  go leave him now        dana       when these precautions were taken  the females returned to their several  look outs  and ruth  whose duty it was in moments of danger to exercise a  general superintendence  was left to her meditations and to such  watchfulness as her fears might excite  quitting the inner rooms  she  approached the door that communicated with the court  and for a moment  lost the recollection of her immediate cares in a view of the imposing  scene by which she was surrounded     by this time  the whole of the vast range of out buildings  which had been  constructed  as was usual in the colonies  of the most combustible  materials and with no regard to the expenditure of wood  was wrapt in  fire  notwithstanding the position of the intermediate edifices  broad  flashes of light were constantly crossing the court itself  on whose  surface she was able to distinguish the smallest object  while the heavens  above her were glaring with a lurid red  through the openings between the  buildings the quadrangle  the eye could look out upon the fields  where  she saw every evidence of a sullen intention on the part of the savages to  persevere in their object  dark  fierce looking  and nearly naked human  forms were seen flitting from cover to cover while there was no stump nor  log within arrow s flight of the defences  that did not protect the person  of a daring and indefatigable enemy  it was plain the indians were there  in hundreds  and as the assaults continued after the failure of a  surprise  it was too evident that they were bent on victory  at some  hazard to themselves  no usual means of adding to the horrors of the scene  were neglected  whoops and yells were incessantly ringing around the  place  while the loud and often repeated tones of a conch betrayed the  artifice by which the savages had so often endeavored  in the earlier part  of the night  to lure the garrison out of the palisadoes  a few scattering  shot  discharged with deliberation and from every exposed point within the  works  proclaimed both the coolness and the vigilance of the defendants   the little gun in the block house was silent  for the puritan knew too  well its real power to lessen its reputation by a too frequent use the  weapon was therefore reserved for those moments of pressing danger that  would be sure to arrive     on this spectacle ruth gazed in fearful sadness  the long sustained and  sylvan security of her abode was violently destroyed  and in the place of  a quiet which had approached as near as may be on earth to that holy peace  for which her spirit strove  she and all she most loved were suddenly  confronted to the most frightful exhibition of human horrors  in such a  moment  the feelings of a mother were likely to revive  and ere time was  given for reflection  aided by the light of the conflagration  the matron  was moving swiftly through the intricate passages of the dwelling  in  quest of those whom she had placed in the security of the chambers      thou hast remembered to avoid looking on the fields  my children   said  the nearly breathless woman as she entered the room   be thankful  babes   hitherto the efforts of the savages have been vain and we still remain  masters of our habitations       why is the night so red  come hither  mother thou mayest look into the  wood as if the sun were shining       the heathens have fired our granaries  and what thou seest is the light  of the flames  but happily they cannot put brand into the dwellings  while  thy father and the young men stand to their weapons  we must be grateful  for this security  frail as it seemeth  thou hast knelt  my ruth  and hast  remembered to think of thy father and brother in thy prayers       i will do so again  mother   whispered the child  bending to her knees   and wrapping her young features in the garments of the matron      why hide thy countenance  one young and innocent as thou  may lift thine  eyes to heaven with confidence       mother  i see the indian  unless my face be hid  he looketh at me  i  fear  with wish to do us harm       thou art not just to miantonimoh  child   answered ruth  as she glanced  her eye rapidly round to seek the boy  who had modestly withdrawn into a  remote and shaded corner of the room   i left him with thee for a  guardian  and not as one who would wish to injure  now think of thy god   child   imprinting a kiss on the cold  marble like forehead of her  daughter   and have reliance in his goodness  miantonimoh  i again leave  you with a charge  to be their protector   she added  quitting her  daughter and advancing towards the youth      mother   shrieked the child   come to me  or i die      ruth turned from the listening captive  with the quickness of instinct  a  glance showed her the jeopardy of her offspring  a naked savage  dark   powerful of frame  and fierce in the frightful masquerade of his  war paint  stood winding the silken hair of the girl in one hand  while he  already held the glittering axe above a head that seemed inevitably  devoted to destruction      mercy  mercy   exclaimed ruth  hoarse with horror  and dropping to her  knees  as much from inability to stand as with intent to petition    monster  strike me  but spare the child      the eyes of the indian rolled over the person of the speaker  but it was  with an expression that seemed rather to enumerate the number of his  victims  than to announce any change of purpose  with a fiend like  coolness  that bespoke much knowledge of the ruthless practice  he again  swung the quivering but speechless child in the air  and prepared to  direct the weapon with a fell certainty of aim  the tomahawk had made its  last circuit  and an instant would have decided the fate of the victim   when the captive boy stood in front of the frightful actor in this  revolting scene  by a quick  forward movement of his arm  the blow was  arrested  the deep guttural ejaculation  which betrays the surprise of an  indian  broke from the chest of the savage  while his hand fell to his  side  and the form of the suspended girl was suffered again to touch the  floor  the look and gesture with which the boy had interfered  expressed  authority rather than resentment or horror  his air was calm  collected   and  as it appeared by the effect  imposing      go   he said in the language of the fierce people from whom he had  sprung   the warriors of the pale men are calling thee by name       the snow is red with the blood of our young men   the other fiercely  answered   and not a scalp is at the belt of my people       these are mine   returned the boy with dignity  sweeping his arm  while  speaking  in a manner to show that he extended protection to all present     the warrior gazed about him grimly  and like one but half convinced  he  had incurred a danger too fearful  in entering the stockade  to be easily  diverted from his purpose      listen   he continued  after a short pause  during which the artillery of  the puritan had again bellowed in the uproar  without   the thunder is  with the yengeese  our young women will look another way and call us  pequots  should there be no scalps on our pole      for a single moment  the countenance of the boy changed  and his  resolution seemed to waver  the other  who watched his eyes with longing  eagerness  again seized his victim by the hair  when ruth shrieked in the  accents of despair       boy  boy  if thou art not with us  god hath deserted us       she is mine   burst fiercely from the lips of the lad   hear my words   wompahwisset  the blood of my father is very warm within me      the other paused  and the blow was once more suspended  the glaring  eye balls of the savage rested intently on the swelling form and stern  countenance of the young hero  whose uplifted hand appeared to menace  instant punishment  should he dare to disregard the mediation  the lips of  the warrior severed  and the word  miantonimoh  was uttered as softly as  if it recalled a feeling of sorrow  then  as a sudden burst of yells rose  above the roar of the conflagration  the fierce indian turned in his  tracks  and  abandoning the trembling and nearly insensible child  he  bounded away like a hound loosened on a fresh scent of blood      boy  boy   murmured the mother   heathen or christian  there is one that  will bless thee        a rapid gesture of the hand interrupted the fervent expression of  her gratitude  pointing after the form of the retreating savage  the  lad encircled his own head with a finger  in a manner that could not  be mistaken  as he uttered steadily  but with the deep emphasis of  an indian       the young pale face has a scalp      ruth heard no more  with instinctive rapidity  every feeling of her soul  quickened nearly to agony  she rushed below  in order to warn mark against  the machinations of so fearful an enemy  her step was heard but for a  moment in the vacant chambers  and then the indian boy  whose steadiness  and authority had just been so signally exerted in favor of the children   resumed his attitude of meditation  as quietly as if he took no further  interest in the frightful events of the night     the situation of the garrison was now  indeed  to the last degree  critical  a torrent of fire had passed from the further extremity of the  out houses to that which stood nearest to the defences  and  as building  after building melted beneath its raging power  the palisadoes became  heated nearly to the point of ignition  the alarm created by this imminent  danger had already been given  and  when ruth issued into the court  a  female was rushing past her  seemingly on some errand of the last  necessity      hast seen him   demanded the breathless mother  arresting the steps of  the quick moving girl      not since the savage made his last onset  but i warrant me he may be  found near the western loops  making good the works against the enemy       surely he is not foremost in the fray  of whom speakest thou  faith  i  questioned thee of mark  there is one  even now  raging within the  pickets seeking a victim       truly  i thought it had been question of    the boy is with his father  and the stranger soldier who does such deeds of valor in our behalf  i  have seen no enemy within the palisadoes  madam heathcote  since the entry  of the man who escaped  by favor of the powers of darkness  from the shot  of eben dudley s musket       and is this evil like to pass from us   resumed ruth  breathing more  freely  as she learned the safety of her son   or does providence veil its  face in anger       we keep our own  though the savage hath pressed the young men to  extremity  oh  it gladdened heart to see how brave a guard reuben ring   and others near him  made in our behalf  i do think me  madam heathcote   that  after all  there is real manhood in the brawler dudley  truly  the  youth hath done marvels in the way of exposure and resistance  twenty  times this night have i expected to see him slain       and he that lyeth there   half whispered the alarmed ruth  pointing to  a spot near them  where  aside from the movements of those who still  acted in the bustle of the combat  one lay stretched on the earth   who  hath fallen      the cheek of faith blanched to a whiteness that nearly equalled that of  the linen  which  even in the hurry of such a scene  some friendly hand  had found leisure to throw  in decent sadness  over the form      that   said the faltering girl   though hurt and bleeding  my brother  reuben surely keepeth the loop at the western angle  nor is whittal  wanting in sufficient sense to take heed of danger  this may not be the  stranger  for under the covers of the postern breast work he holdeth  counsel with the young captain       art certain  girl       i saw them both within the minute  would to god we could hear the shout  of noisy dudley  madam heathcote  his cry cheereth the heart  in a moment  awful as this       lift the cloth   said ruth with calm solemnity   that we may know which  of our friends hath been called to the great account      faith hesitated  and when  by a powerful effort  in which secret interest  had as deep an influence as obedience  she did comply  it was with a sort  of desperate resolution  on raising the linen  the eyes of the two women  rested on the pallid countenance of one who had been transfixed by an  iron headed arrow  the girl dropped the linen  and in a voice that sounded  like a burst of hysterical feeling  she exclaimed        tis but the youth that came lately among us  we are spared the loss of  any ancient friend       tis one who died for our safety  i would give largely of this world s  comforts  that this calamity might not have been  or that greater leisure  for the last fearful reckoning had been accorded  but we may not lose the  moments in mourning  hie thee  girl  and sound the alarm that a savage  lurketh within our walls  and that he skulketh in quest of a secret blow   bid all be wary  if the young mark should cross thy path  speak to him  twice of this danger  the child hath a froward spirit  and may not hearken  to words uttered in too great hurry      with this charge  ruth quitted her maiden  while the latter proceeded to  give the necessary notice  the other sought the spot where she had just  learned there was reason to believe her husband might be found     content and the stranger were in fact met in consultation over the danger  which threatened destruction to their most important means of defence  the  savages themselves appeared to be conscious that the flames were working  in their favour  for their efforts sensibly slackened  and having already  severely suffered in their attempts to annoy the garrison  they had fallen  back to their covers  and awaited the moment when their practised cunning  should tell them they might  with more flattering promises of success   again  rally to the onset  a brief explanation served to make ruth  acquainted with the imminent jeopardy of their situation  under a sense of  a more appalling danger  she lost the recollection of her former purpose   and with a contracted and sorrowing eye  she stood like her companions  in  impotent helplessness  an entranced spectator of the progress of the  destruction      a soldier should not waste words in useless plaints   observed the  stranger  folding his arms like one who was conscious that human effort  could do no more   else should i say   tis pity that he who drew yon line  of stockade hath not remembered the uses of the ditch       i will summon the maidens to the wells   said ruth       twill not avail us  the arrow would be among them  nor could mortal long  endure the heat of yon glowing furnace  thou seest that the timbers  already smoke and blacken  under its fierceness      the stranger was still speaking  when a small quivering flame played on  the corners of the palisado nearest the burning pile  the element  fluttered like a waving line along the edges of the heated wood  after  which it spread over the whole surface of the timber  from its larger base  to the pointed summit  as if this had merely been the signal of a general  destruction  the flames kindled in fifty places at the same instant  and  then the whole line of the stockade  nearest the conflagration  was  covered with fire  a yell of triumph arose in the fields  and a flight of  arrows  sailing tauntingly into the works  announced the fierce impatience  of those who watched the increase of the conflagration      we shall be driven to our block   said content  assemble thy maidens   ruth  and make speedy preparation for the last retreat       i go  but hazard not thy life in any vain endeavor to retard the flames   there will yet be time for all that is needful to our security       i know not   hurriedly observed the stranger   here cometh the assault in  a new aspect      the feet of ruth were arrested  on looking upward  she saw the object  which had drawn this remark from the last speaker  a small bright ball of  fire had arisen out of the fields  and  describing an arc in the air  it  sailed above their heads and fell on the shingles of a building which  formed part of the quadrangle of the inner court  the movement was that of  an arrow thrown from a distant bow  and its way was to be traced by a long  trail of light  that followed its course like a blazing meteor  this  burning arrow had been sent with a cool and practised judgment  it lighted  upon a portion of the combustibles that were nearly as inflammable as  gunpowder  and the eye had scarcely succeeded in tracing it to its fall   ere the bright flames were seen stealing over the heated roof      one struggle for our habitations   cried content  but the hand of the  stranger was placed firmly on his shoulder  at that instant  a dozen  similar meteor looking balls shot into the air  and fell in as many  different places on the already half kindled pile  further efforts would  have been useless  relinquishing the hope of saving his property  every  thought was now given to personal safety     ruth recovered from her short trance  and hastened with hurried steps to  perform her well known office  then came a few minutes of exertion  during  which the females transferred all that was necessary to their subsistence   and which had not been already provided in the block  to their little  citadel  the glowing light  which penetrated the darkest passages among  the buildings  prevented this movement from being made without discovery   the whoop summoned their enemies to another attack  the arrows thickened  in the air  and the important duty was not performed without risk  as all  were obliged  in some degree  to expose their persons  while passing to  and fro  loaded with necessaries  the gathering smoke  however  served in  some measure for a screen  and it was not long before content received the  welcome tidings that he might command the retreat of his young men from  the palisadoes  the conch sounded the necessary signal  and ere the foe  had time to understand its meaning  or profit by the defenceless state of  the works  every individual within them had reached the door of the block  in safety  still  there was more of hurry and confusion than altogether  comported with their safety  they who were assigned to that duty  however   mounted eagerly to the loops  and stood in readiness to pour out their  fire on whoever might dare to come within its reach  while a few still  lingered in the court  to see that no necessary provision for resistance   or of safety  was forgotten  ruth had been foremost in exertion  and she  now stood pressing her hands to her temples  like one whose mind was  bewildered by her own efforts      our fallen friend   she said   shall we leave his remains to be mangled  by the savage       surely not  dudley  thy hand  we will bear the body within the lower  ha   death hath struck another of our family      the alarm with which content made this discovery passed quickly to all in  hearing  it was but too apparent  by the shape of the linen  that two  bodies lay beneath its folds  anxious and rapid looks were cast from face  to face  in order to learn who was missing  and then  conscious of the  hazard of further delay  content raised the linen  in order to remove all  doubts by certainty  the form of the young borderer  who was known to have  fallen  was first slowly and reverently uncovered  but even the most  self restrained among the spectators started back in horror  as his robbed  and reeking head showed that a savage hand had worked its ruthless will on  the unresisting corpse      the other   ruth struggled to say  and it was only as her husband had  half removed the linen that she could succeed in uttering the  words   beware the other      the warning was not useless  for the linen waved violently as it rose  under the hand of content  and a grim indian sprang into the very centre  of the startled group  sweeping his armed hand widely about him  the  savage broke through the receding circle  and  giving forth the appalling  whoop of his tribe  he bounded into the open door of the principal  dwelling  so swiftly as utterly to defeat any design of pursuit  the arms  of ruth were frantically extended towards the place where he had  disappeared  and she was about to rush madly on his footsteps  when the  hand of her husband stopped the movement      wouldst hazard life  to save some worthless trifle       husband  release me   returned the woman  nearly choked with her  agony   nature hath slept within me       fear blindeth thy reason      the form of ruth ceased to struggle  all the madness  which had been  glaring wildly about her eyes  disappeared in the settled look of an  almost preternatural calm  collecting the whole of her mental energy in  one desperate effort of self command  she turned to her husband  and  as  her bosom swelled with the terror that seemed to stop her breath  she said  in a voice that was frightful by its composure       if thou hast a father s heart  release me   our babes have been  forgotten      the hand of content relaxed its hold  and  in another instant  the form of  his wife was lost to view on the track that had just been taken by the  successful savage  this was the luckless moment chosen by the foe to push  his advantage  a fierce burst of yells proclaimed the activity of the  assailants  and a general discharge from the loops of the block house  sufficiently apprised those in the court that the onset of the enemy was  now pushed into the very heart of the defences  all had mounted  but the  few who lingered to discharge the melancholy duty to the dead  they were  too few to render resistance prudent  and yet too many to think of  deserting the distracted mother and her offspring without an effort      enter   said content  pointing to the door of the block   it is my duty  to share the fate of those nearest my blood      the stranger made no answer  placing his powerful hands on the nearly  stupified husband  he thrust his person  by an irresistible effort  within  the basement of the building  and then he signed  by a quick gesture  for  all around him to follow  after the last form had entered  he commanded  that the fastenings of the door should be secured  remaining himself  as  he believed  alone without  but when by a rapid glance he saw there was  another gazing in dull awe on the features of the fallen man  it was too  late to rectify the mistake  yells were now rising out of the black smoke   that was rolling in volumes from the heated buildings  and it was plain  that only a few feet divided them from their pursuers  beckoning the man  who had been excluded from the block to follow  the stern soldier rushed  into the principal dwelling  which was still but little injured by the  fire  guided rather by chance than by any knowledge of the windings of the  building  he soon found himself in the chambers  he was now at a loss  whither to proceed  at that moment  his companion  who was no other than  whittal ring  took the lead  and in another instant  they were at the door  of the secret apartment      hist   said the stranger  raising a hand to command silence as he entered  the room   our hope is in secrecy       and how may we escape without detection   demanded the mother  pointing  about her at objects illuminated by a light so powerful as to penetrate  every cranny of the ill constructed building   the noon day sun is scarce  brighter than this dreadful fire       god is in the elements  his guiding hand shall point the way  but here we  may not tarry  for the flames are already on the shingles  follow  and  speak not      ruth pressed the children to her side  and the whole party left the  apartment of the attic in a body  their descent to a lower room was made  quickly  and without discovery  but here their leader paused  for the  state of things without was one to demand the utmost steadines of nerve   and great reflection     the indians had by this time gained command of the whole of mark  heathcote s possessions  with the exception of the block house  and as  their first act had been to apply the brand wherever it might be wanting   the roar of the conflagration was now heard in every direction  the  discharge of muskets and the whoops of the combatants  however  while they  added to the horrible din of such a scene  proclaimed the unconquered  resolution of those who held the citadel  a window of the room they  occupied enabled the stranger to take a cautious survey of what was  passing without  the court  lighted to the brilliancy of day  was empty   for the increasing heat of the fires  no less than the discharges from the  loops  still kept the cautious savages to their covers  there was barely  hope  that the space between the dwelling and the block house might yet be  passed in safety      i would i had asked that the door of the block should be held in hand    muttered submission   it would be death to linger an instant in that  fierce light  nor have we any manner of         a touch was laid upon his arm  and turning  the speaker saw the dark eye  of the captive boy looking steadily in his face      wilt do it   demanded the other  in a manner to show that he doubted   while he hoped     a speaking gesture of assent was the answer  and then the form of the lad  was seen gliding quietly from the room     another instant  and miantonimoh appeared in the court  he walked with the  deliberation that one would have shown in moments of the most entire  security  a hand was raised towards the loops  as if to betoken amity  and  then dropping the limb  he moved with the same slow step into the very  centre of the area  here the boy stood in the fullest glare of the  conflagration  and turned his face deliberately on every side of him  the  action showed that he wished to invite all eyes to examine his person  at  this moment the yells ceased in the surrounding covers  proclaiming alike  the common feeling that was awakened by his appearance  and the hazard  that any other would have incurred by exposing himself in that fearful  scene  when this act of exceeding confidence had been performed  the boy  drew a pace nearer to the entrance of the block      comest thou in peace  or is this another device of indian treachery    demanded a voice  through an opening in the door left expressly for the  purposes of parley     the boy raised the palm of one hand towards the speaker  while he laid the  other with a gesture of confidence on his naked breast      hast aught to offer in behalf of my wife and babes  if gold will buy  their ransom  name thy price      miantonimoh was at no loss to comprehend the other s meaning  with the  readiness of one whose faculties had been early schooled in the inventions  of emergencies  he made a gesture that said even more than his figurative  words  as he answered       can a woman of the pale faces pass through wood  an indian arrow is  swifter than the foot of my mother       boy  i trust thee   returned the voice from within the loop   if  thou deceivest beings so feeble and so innocent  heaven will remember  the wrong      miantonimoh again made a sign to show that caution must be used  and then  he retired with a step calm and measured as that used in his advance   another pause to the shouts betrayed the interest of those whose fierce  eyes watched his movements in the distance     when the young indian had rejoined the party in the dwelling  he led them   without being observed by the lurking band that still hovered in the smoke  of the surrounding buildings  to a spot that commanded a full view of  their short but perilous route  at this moment the door of the  block house half opened  and was closed again  still the stranger  hesitated  for he saw how little was the chance that all should cross the  court unharmed  and to pass it by repeated trials he knew to be  impossible      boy   he said   thou  who hast done thus much  may still do more  ask  mercy for these children  in some manner that may touch the hearts of  thy people      miantonimoh shook his head  and pointing to the ghastly corpse that lay in  the court  he answered coldly       the red man has tasted blood       then must the desperate trial be done  think not of thy children  devoted  and daring mother  but look only to thine own safety  this witless youth  and i will charge ourselves with the care of the innocents      ruth waved him away with her hand  pressing her mute and trembling  daughter to her bosom  in a manner to show that her resolution was taken   the stranger yielded  and turning to whittal  who stood near him   seemingly as much occupied in vacant admiration of the blazing piles as in  any apprehension of his own personal danger  he bade him look to the  safety of the remaining child  moving in front himself  he was about to  offer ruth such protection as the case afforded  when a window in the rear  of the house was dashed inward  announcing the entrance of the enemy  and  the imminent danger that their flight would be intercepted  there was no  time to lose  for it was now certain that only a single room separated  them from their foes  the generous nature of ruth was roused  and catching  martha from the arms of whittal ring  she endeavored  by a desperate  effort  in which feeling rather than any reasonable motive predominated   to envelop both the children in her robe      i am with ye   whispered the agitated woman   hush ye  hush ye  babes   thy mother is nigh      the stranger was very differently employed  the instant the crash of glass  was heard  he rushed to the rear  and he had already grappled with the  savage so often named  and who acted as guide to a dozen fierce and  yelling followers      to the block   shouted the steady soldier  while with a powerful arm he  held his enemy in the throat of the narrow passage  stopping the approach  of those in the rear by the body of his foe   for the love of life and  children  woman  to the block      the summons rang frightfully in the ears of ruth  but in that moment of  extreme jeopardy her presence of mind was lost  the cry was repeated  and  not till then did the bewildered mother catch her daughter from the  floor  with eyes still bent on the fierce struggle in her rear  she  clasped the child to her heart and fled  calling on whittal ring to  follow  the lad obeyed  and ere she had half crossed the court  the  stranger  still holding his savage shield between him and his enemies   was seen endeavoring to take the same direction  the whoops  the flight  of arrows  and the discharges of musquetry  that succeeded  proclaimed  the whole extent of the danger  but fear had lent unnatural vigor to the  limbs of ruth  and the gliding arrows themselves scarce sailed more  swiftly through the heated air  than she darted into the open door of the  block  whittal ring was less successful  as he crossed the court  bearing  the child intrusted to his care  an arrow pierced his flesh  stung by the  pain  the witless lad turned  in anger  to chide the hand that had  inflicted the injury      on  foolish boy   cried the stranger  as he passed him  still making a  target of the body of the savage that was writhing in his grasp   on  for  thy life  and that of the babe      the mandate came too late  the hand of an indian was already on the  innocent victim  and in the next instant the child was sweeping the air   while with a short yell the keen axe flourished above his head  a shot  from the loops laid the monster dead in his tracks  the girl was instantly  seized by another hand  and as the captor with his prize darted unharmed  into the dwelling  there arose in the block a common exclamation of the  name of  miantonimoh   two more of the savages profited by the pause of  horror that followed  to lay hands on the wounded whittal and to drag him  within the blazing building  at the same moment  the stranger cast the  unresisting savage back upon the weapons of his companions  the bleeding  and half strangled indian met the blows which had been aimed at the life  of the soldier  and as he staggered and fell  his vigorous conqueror  disappeared in the block  the door of the little citadel was instantly  closed  and the savages  who rushed headlong against the entrance  heard  the fitting of the bars which secured it against their attacks  the yell  of retreat was raised  and in the next instant the court was left to be  possession of the dead           chapter xv                  did heaven look on     and would not take their part                heaven rest them now        macbeth        we will be thankful for this blessing   said content  as he aided the  half unconscious ruth to mount the ladder  yielding himself to a feeling  of nature that said little against his manhood   if we have lost one  that  we loved  god hath spared our own child      his breathless wife threw herself into a seat  and folding the treasure to  her bosom  she whispered rather than said aloud   from my soul  heathcote   am i grateful       thou shieldest the babe from my sight   returned the father  stooping to  conceal a tear that was stealing down his brown cheek  under a pretence of  embracing the child  but suddenly recoiling  he added in alarm   ruth      startled by the tone in which her husband uttered her name  the mother  threw aside the folds of her dress  which still concealed the girl  and  stretching her out to the length of an arm  she saw that  in the hurry of  the appalling scene  the children had been exchanged  and that she had  saved the life of martha     notwithstanding the generous disposition of ruth  it was impossible to  repress the feeling of disappointment which came over her with the  consciousness of the mistake  nature at first had sway  and to a degree  that was fearfully powerful      it is not our babe   shrieked the mother  still holding the child at the  length of her arm  and gazing at its innocent and terrified countenance   with an expression that martha had never yet seen gleaming from eyes that  were  in common  so soft and so indulgent      i am thine  i am thine   murmured the little trembler  struggling in vain  to reach the bosom that had so long cherished her infancy   if not thine   whose am i      the gaze of ruth was still wild  the workings of her features hysterical      madam  mrs  heathcote  mother   came timidly  and at intervals  from the  lips of the orphan  then the heart of ruth relented  she clasped the  daughter of her friend to her breast  and nature found a temporary relief  in one of those frightful exhibitions of anguish  which appear to threaten  the dissolution of the link which connects the soul with the body      come  daughter of john harding   said content  looking around him with  the assumed composure of a chastened man  while natural regret struggled  hard at his heart   this has been god s pleasure  it is meet that we kiss  his parental hand  let us be thankful   he added  with a quivering lip but  steady eye   that even this mercy hath been shown  our babe is with the  indian  but our hopes are far beyond the reach of savage malignity  we  have not  laid up treasure where moth and rust can corrupt  or where  thieves may break in and steal   it may be that the morning shall bring  means of parley  and haply  opportunity of ransom      there was the glimmering of hope in this suggestion  the idea seemed to  give a new direction to the thoughts of ruth  and the change enabled the  long habits of self restraint to regain something of their former  ascendancy  the fountains of her tears became dry  and  after one short  and terrible struggle  she was again enabled to appear composed  but at  no time during the continuance of that fearful struggle  was ruth  heathcote again the same ready and useful agent of activity and order that  she had been in the earlier events of the night     it is scarcely necessary to remind the reader that the brief burst of  parental agony which has just been related  escaped content and his wife  amid a scene in which the other actors were too much occupied by their  exertions to note its exhibition  the fate of those in the block was too  evidently approaching its close  to allow of any interest in such an  episode to the great tragedy of the moment     the character of the contest had in some measure changed  there was no  longer any immediate apprehension from the missiles of the assailants   though danger pressed upon the besieged in a new and even in a more  horrible aspect  now and then indeed an arrow quivered in the openings of  the loops  and the blunt dudley had once a narrow escape from the passage  of a bullet  which  guided by chance  or aimed by a hand surer than  common  glanced through one of the narrow slits  and would have terminated  the history of the borderer  had not the head it obliquely encountered   been too solid to yield even to such an assault  the attention of the  garrison was chiefly called to the imminent danger of the surrounding  fire  though the probability of such an emergency as that in which the  family was now placed  had certainly been foreseen  and in some degree  guarded against  in the size of the area and in the construction of the  block  yet it was found that the danger exceeded all former calculations     for the basement  there was no reason to feel alarm  it was of stone  and  of a thickness and a material to put at defiance any artifices that their  enemy might find time to practise  even the two upper stories were  comparatively safe  for they were composed of blocks so solid as to  require time to heat them  and they were consequently as little liable to  combustion as wood well could be  but the roof  like all of that  and  indeed  like most of the present day in america  was composed of short  inflammable shingles of pine  the superior height of the tower was some  little protection  but as the flames rose roaring above the buildings of  the court  and waved in wide circuits around the heated area  the whole of  the fragile covering of the block was often wrapped in folds of fire  the  result may be anticipated  content was first recalled from the bitterness  of his parental regret  by a cry  which passed among the family  that the  roof of their little citadel was in flames  one of the ordinary wells of  the habitation was in the basement of the edifice  and it was fortunate  that no precaution necessary to render it serviceable in an emergency like  that which was now arrived  had been neglected  a well secured shaft of  stone rose through the lower apartment into the upper floor  profiting by  this happy precaution  the handmaidens of ruth plied the buckets with  diligence  while the young men cast water freely on the roof  from the  windows of the attic  the latter duty  it may readily be supposed  was not  performed without hazard  flights of arrows were constantly directed  against the borers  and more than one of the youths received greater or  less injuries  while exposed to their annoyance  there were indeed a few  minutes  during which it remained a question of grave interest how far the  risk they ran was likely to be crowned with success  the excessive heat of  so many fires  and the occasional contact with the flames  as they swept  in eddies over the place  began to render it doubtful whether any human  efforts could long arrest the evil  even the massive and moistened logs of  the body of the work began to smoke  and it was found  by experiment   that the hand could rest but a moment on their surface     during this interval of deep suspense  all the men posted at the loops  were called to aid in extinguishing the fire  resistance was forgotten  in the discharge of a duty that had become still more pressing  ruth  herself was aroused by the nature of the alarm  and all hands and all  minds were arduously occupied in a toil that diverted attention from  incidents which had less interest  because they were teeming less with  instant destruction  danger is known to lose its terrors by familiarity   the young borderers became reckless of their persons in the ardor of  exertion  and as success began to crown their efforts  something like  the levity of happier moments got the better of their concern  stolen  and curious glances were thrown around a place that had so long been  kept sacred to the secret uses of the puritan  when it was found that  the flames were subdued  and that the present danger was averted  the  light glared powerfully through several openings in the shingles  no  less than through the windows  and every eye was enabled to scan the  contents of an apartment which all had longed  though none had ever  before presumed  to enter      the captain looketh well to the body   whispered reuben ring to one of his  comrades  as he wiped the effects of the toil from a sun burnt brow   thou  seest  hiram  that there is good store of cheer       the buttery is not better stored   returned the other  with the  shrewdness and ready observation of a border man   it is known that he  never toucheth that which the cow yields  except as it comes from the  creature  and here we find of the best that the madam s dairy can yield       surely yon buff jerkin is like to those worn by the idle cavaliers  at home  i think it be long since the captain hath ridden forth in  such a guise       that may be matter of ancient usage  for thou seest he hath relics of the  fashion of the english troopers in this bit of steel  it is like  he  holdeth deep exercise over the vanities of his youth  while recalling the  times in which they were worn      this conjecture appeared to satisfy the other  though it is probable that  a sight of a fresh store of bodily aliment  which was soon after exposed  in order to gain access to the roof  might have led to some further  inferences  had more time been given to conjectures  but at this moment a  new wail proceeded from the maidens who plied the buckets beneath      to the loops  to the loops  or we are lost   was a summons that admitted  of no delay  led by the stranger  the young men rushed below  where  in  truth  they found a serious demand on all their activity and courage     the indians were wanting in none of the sagacity which so remarkably  distinguishes the warfare of this cunning race  the time spent by the  family  in arresting the flames  had not been thrown away by the  assailants  profiting by the attention of those within  to efforts that  were literally of the last importance  they had found means to convey  burning brands to the door of the block  against which they had piled a  mass of blazing combustibles  that threatened shortly to open the way into  the basement of the citadel itself  in order to mask this design  and to  protect their approaches  the savages had succeeded in dragging bundles of  straw and other similar materials to the foot of the work  to which the  fire soon communicated  and which consequently served both to increase the  actual danger of the building and to distract the attention of those by  whom it was defended  although the water that fell from the roof served  to retard the progress of these flames  it contributed to produce the  effect of all others that was most desired by the savages  the dense  volumes of smoke that arose from the half smothered fire  first apprised  the females of the new danger which assailed them  when content and the  stranger reached the principal floor of their citadel  it required some  little time  and no small degree of coolness  to comprehend the situation  in which they were now placed  the vapor that rolled upward from the wet  straw and hay had already penetrated into the apartment  and it was with  no slight difficulty that they who occupied it were enabled to distinguish  objects  or even to breathe      here is matter to exercise our utmost fortitude   said the stranger to  his constant companion   we must look to this new device  or we come to  the fate of death by fire  summon the stoutest hearted of thy youths  and  i will lead them to a sortie  ere the evil get past a remedy       that were certain victory to the heathen  thou hearest  by their yells   that  tis no small band of scouters who beleaguer us  a tribe hath sent  forth its chosen warriors to do their wickedness  better is it that we  bestir ourselves to drive them from our door  and to prevent the further  annoyance of this cloud  since  to issue from the block  at this moment   would be to offer our heads to the tomahawk  and to ask mercy is as vain  as to hope to move the rock with tears       and in what manner may we do this needful service       our muskets will still command the entrance  by means of these downward  loops  and water may be yet applied through the same openings  thought  hath been had of this danger  in the disposition of the place       then  of heaven s mercy  delay not the effort      the necessary measures were taken  instantly  eben dudley applied the  muzzle of his piece to a loop  and discharged it downward  in the  direction of the endangered door  but aim was impossible in the obscurity   and his want of success was proclaimed by a taunting shout of triumph   then followed a flood of water  which however was scarcely of more  service  since the savages had foreseen its use  and had made a provision  against its effects by placing boards  and such vessels as they found  scattered among the buildings  above the fire  in a manner to prevent most  of the fluid from reaching its aim      come hither with thy musket  reuben ring   said content  hurriedly    the wind stirreth the smoke  here  the savages still heap fuel against  the wall      the borderer complied  there were in fact moments when dark human forms  were to be seen gliding in silence around the building  though the density  of the vapor rendered the forms indistinct and their movements doubtful   with a cool and practised eye  the youth sought a victim  but as he  discharged his musket  an object glanced near his own visage  as though  the bullet had recoiled on him who had given it a very different mission   stepping backward a little hurriedly  he saw the stranger pointing through  the smoke at an arrow which still quivered in the floor above them      we cannot long abide these assaults   the soldier muttered   something  must be speedily devised  or we fall      his words ceased  for a yell that appeared to lift the floor on which he  stood  announced the destruction of the door and the presence of the  savages in the basement of the tower  both parties appeared momentarily  confounded at this unexpected success  for while the one stood mute with  astonishment and dread  the other did little more than triumph  but this  inaction soon ended  the conflict was resumed  though the efforts of the  assailants began to assume the confidence of victory  while  on the part  of the besieged  they partook fearfully of the aspect of despair     a few muskets were discharged  both from below and above  at the  intermediate floor  but the thickness of the planks prevented the bullets  from doing injury  then commenced a struggle in which the respective  qualities of the combatants were exhibited in a singularly characteristic  manner  while the indians improved their advantages beneath  with all the  arts known to savage warfare  the young men resisted with that wonderful  aptitude of expedient  and readiness of execution  which distinguish the  american borderer     the first attempt of the assailants was to burn the floor of the lower  apartment  in order to effect this  they threw vast piles of straw into  the basement  but ere the brand was applied  water had reduced the  inflammable material to a black and murky pile  still the smoke had nearly  effected a conquest which the fire itself had failed to achieve  so  suffocating indeed were the clouds of vapor which ascended through the  crevices  that the females were compelled to seek a refuge in the attic   here the openings in the roof  and a swift current of air  relieved them   in some degree  from its annoyance     when it was found that the command of the well afforded the besieged the  means of protecting the wood work of the interior  an effort was made to  cut off the communication with the water  by forcing a passage into the  circular stone shaft  through which it was drawn into the room above  this  attempt was defeated by the readiness of the youths  who soon cut holes in  the floor  whence they sent down certain death on all beneath  perhaps no  part of the assault was more obstinate than that which accompanied this  effort  nor did either assailants or assailed  at any time during its  continuance  suffer greater personal injury  after a long and fierce  struggle  the resistance was effectual  and the savages had recourse to  new schemes in order to effect their ruthless object     during the first moments of their entrance  and with a view to reap the  fruits of the victory when the garrison should be more effectually  subdued  most of the furniture of the dwelling had been scattered by the  conquerors on the side of the hill  among other articles  some six or  seven beds had been dragged from the dormitories  these were now brought  into play  as powerful instruments in the assault  they were cast  one by  one  on the still burning though smothered flames  in the basement of the  block  whence they sent up a cloud of their intolerable effluvia  at this  trying moment  the appalling cry was heard in the block  that the well had  failed  the buckets ascended as empty as they went down  and they were  thrown aside as no longer useful  the savages seemed to comprehend their  advantage  for they profited by the confusion that succeeded among the  assailed  to feed the slumbering fires  the flames kindled fiercely  and  in less than a minute they became too violent to be subdued  they were  soon seen playing on the planks of the floor above  the subtle element  flashed from point to point  and it was not long ere it was stealing up  the outer side of the heated block itself     the savages now knew that conquest was sure  yells and whoopings  proclaimed the fierce delight with which they witnessed the certainty of  their victory  still there was something portentous in the death like  silence with which the victims within the block awaited their fate  the  whole exterior of the building was already wrapped in flames  and yet no  show of further resistance  no petition for mercy  issued from its bosom   the unnatural and frightful stillness  that reigned within  was gradually  communicated to those without  the cries and shouts of triumph ceased  and  the crackling of the flames  or the falling of timber in the adjoining  buildings  alone disturbed the awful calm  at length a solitary voice was  heard in the block  its tones were deep  solemn  and imploring  the fierce  beings who surrounded the glowing pile bent forward to listen  for their  quick faculties caught the first sounds that were audible  it was mark  heathcote pouring out his spirit in prayer  the petition was fervent  but  steady  and though uttered in words that were unintelligible to those  without  they knew enough of the practices of the colonists  to be aware  that it was the chief of the pale faces holding communion with his god   partly in awe  and partly in doubt of what might be the consequences of  so mysterious an asking  the dark crowd with drew to a little distance   and silently watched the progress of the destruction  they had heard  strange sayings of the power of the deity of their invaders  and as their  victims appeared suddenly to cease using any of the known means of safety   they appeared to expect  perhaps they did expect  some unequivocal  manifestation of the power of the great spirit of the stranger     still no sign of pity  no relenting from the ruthless barbarity of their  warfare  escaped any of the assailants  if they thought at all of the  temporal fate of those who might still exist within the fiery pile  it was  only to indulge in some passing regret  that the obstinacy of the defence  had deprived them of the glory of bearing the usual bloody tokens of  victory  in triumph to their villages  but even these peculiar and  deeply rooted feelings were for gotten  as the progress of the flames   placed the hope of its indulgence beyond all possibility     the roof of the block rekindled  and  by the light that shone through the  loops  it was but too evident the interior was in a blaze  once or twice   smothered sounds came out of the place  as if suppressed shrieks were  escaping the females  but they ceased so suddenly as to leave doubts among  the auditors  whether it were more than the deception of their own excited  fancies  the savages had witnessed many a similar scene of human  suffering  but never one before in which death was met by so unmoved a  calmness  the serenity that reigned in the blazing block communicated to  them a feeling of awe  and when the pile came a tumbling and blackened  mass of ruins to the earth  they avoided the place  like men that dreaded  the vengeance of a deity who knew how to infuse so deep a sentiment of  resignation in the breasts of his worshippers     though the yells of victory were again heard in the valley that night  and  though the sun had arisen before the conquerors deserted the hill  but few  of the band found resolution to approach the smouldering pile  where they  had witnessed so impressive an exhibition of christian fortitude  the few  that did draw near  stood around the spot rather in the reverence with  which an indian visits the graves of the just  than in the fierce  rejoicings with which he is known to glut his revenge over a fallen enemy           chapter xvi                                     what are these     so withered  and so wild in their attire     that look not like the inhabitants of earth     and yet are on t        macbeth       that sternness of the season  which has already been mentioned in these  pages  is never of long continuance in the month of april  a change in the  wind had been noted by the hunters  even before they retired from their  range among the hills  and though too seriously occupied to pay close  attention to the progress of the thaw  more than one of the young men had  found occasion to remark  that the final breaking up of the winter had  arrived  long ere the scene of the preceding chapter reached its height   the southern winds had mingled with the heat of the conflagration  warm  airs  that had been following the course of the gulf stream  were driven  to the land  and  sweeping over the narrow island that at this point forms  the advanced work of the continent  but a few short hours had passed  before they destroyed every chilling remnant of the dominion of winter   warm  bland  and rushing in torrents  the subtle currents penetrated the  forests  melted the snows from the fields  and as all alike felt the  genial influence  it appeared to bestow a renovated existence on man and  beast  with morning  therefore  a landscape very different from that last  placed before the mind of the reader  presented itself in the valley of  the wish ton wish     the winter had entirely disappeared  and as the buds had begun to swell  under the occasional warmth of the spring  one ignorant of the past would  not have supposed that the advance of the season had been subject to so  stern an interruption  but the principal and most melancholy change was in  the more artificial parts of the view  instead of those simple and happy  habitations which had crowned the little eminence  there remained only a  mass of blackened and charred ruins  a few abused and half destroyed  articles of household furniture lay scattered on the sides of the hill   and  here and there  a dozen palisadoes  favored by some accidental cause   had partially escaped the flames  eight or ten massive and dreary looking  stacks of chimneys rose out of the smoking piles  in the centre of the  desolation was the stone basement of the block house  on which still stood  a few gloomy masses of the timber  resembling coal  the naked and  unsupported shaft of the well reared its circular pillar from the centre   looking like a dark monument of the past  the wide ruin of the  out buildings blackened one side of the clearing  and  in different  places  the fences  like radii diverging from the common centre of  destruction  had led off the flames into the fields  a few domestic  animals ruminated in the back ground  and even the feathered inhabitants  of the barns still kept aloof  as if warned by their instinct that danger  lurked around the site of their ancient abodes  in all other respects  the  view was calm  and lovely as ever  the sun shone from a sky in which no  cloud was visible  the blandness of the winds  and the brightness of the  heavens  lent an air of animation to even the leafless forest  and the  white vapor  that continued to rise from the smouldering piles  floated  high over the hills  as the peaceful smoke of the cottage curled above its  roof  the ruthless band which had occasioned this sudden change was  already far on the way to its villages  or  haply  it sought some other  scene of blood  a skilful eye might have traced the route these fierce  creatures of the woods had taken  by fences hurled from their places  or  by the carcass of some animal that had fallen  in the wantonness of  victory  beneath a parting blow  of all these wild beings  one only  remained  and he appeared to linger at the spot in the indulgence of  feelings that were foreign to those passions that had so recently stirred  the bosoms of his comrades     it was with a slow  noiseless step that the solitary loiterer moved about  the scene of destruction  he was first seen treading  with a thoughtful  air  among the ruins of the buildings that had formed the quadrangle  and  then  seemingly led by an interest in the fate of those who had so  miserably perished  he drew nearer to the pile in its centre  the nicest  and most attentive ear could not have detected the fall of his foot  as  the indian placed it within the gloomy circle of the ruined wall  nor is  the breathing of the infant less audible  than the manner in which he drew  breath  while standing in a place so lately consecrated by the agony and  martyrdom of a christian family  it was the boy called miantonimoh   seeking some melancholy memorial of those with whom he had so long dwelt  in amity  if not in confidence     one skilled in the history of savage passions might have found a clue to  the workings of the mind of the youth  in the play of his speaking  features  as his dark glittering eye rolled over the smouldering  fragments  it seemed to search keenly for some vestige of the human form   the element however had done its work too greedily  to have left many  visible memorials of its fury  an object resembling that he sought   however  caught his glance  and stepping lightly to the spot where it lay   he raised the bone of a powerful arm from the brands  the flashing of his  eye  as it lighted on this sad object  was wild and exulting  like that  of the savage when he first feels the fierce joy of glutted vengeance  but  gentler recollections came with the gaze  and kinder feelings evidently  usurped the place of the hatred he had been taught to bear a race  who  were so fast sweeping his people from the earth  the relic fell from his  hand  and had ruth been there to witness the melancholy and relenting  shade that clouded his swarthy features  she might have found pleasure in  the certainty that all her kindness had not been wasted     regret soon gave place to awe  to the imagination of the indian  it seemed  as if a still voice  like that which is believed to issue from the grave   was heard in the place  bending his body forward  he listened with the  intensity and acuteness of a savage  he thought the smothered tones of  mark heathcote were again audible  holding communion with his god  the  chisel of the grecian would have loved to delineate the attitudes and  movements of the wondering boy  as he slowly and reverently withdrew from  the spot  his look was riveted on the vacancy where the upper apartments  of the block had stood  and where he had last seen the family  calling  in  their extremity  on their deity for aid  imagination still painted the  victims  in their burning pile  for a minute longer  during which brief  space the young indian probably expected to see some vision of the  pale faces  did he linger near  and then  with a musing air and softened  mind  he trod lightly along the path which led on the trail of his people   when his active form reached the boundary of the forest  he again paused   and taking a final gaze at the place where fortune had made him a witness  to so much domestic peace and of so much sudden misery  his form was  quickly swallowed in the gloom of his native woods     the work of the savages now seemed complete  an effectual check appeared  to be placed to the further progress of civilization in the ill fated  valley of the wish ton wish  had nature been left to its own work  a few  years would have covered the deserted clearing with its ancient  vegetation  and half a century would have again buried the whole of its  quiet glades  in the shadows of the forest  but it was otherwise decreed     the sun had reached the meridian  and the hostile band had been gone some  hours  before aught occurred likely to affect this seeming decision of  providence  to one acquainted with the recent horrors  the breathing of  the airs over the ruins might have passed for the whisperings of departed  spirits  in short  it appeared as if the silence of the wilderness had  once more resumed its reign  when it was suddenly though slightly  interrupted  a movement was made within the ruins of the block  it sounded  as if billets of wood were gradually and cautiously displaced  and then a  human head was reared slowly  and with marked suspicion  above the shaft  of the well  the wild and unearthly air of this seeming spectre  was in  keeping with the rest of the scene  a face begrimed with smoke and stained  with blood  a head bound in some fragment of a soiled dress  and eyes that  were glaring in a species of dull horror  were objects in unison with all  the other frightful accessories of the place      what seest thou   demanded a deep voice from within the walls of the  shaft   shall we again come to our weapons  or have the agents of moloch  departed  speak  entranced youth  what dost behold       a sight to make a wolf weep   returned eben dudley  raising his large  frame so as to stand erect on the shaft  where he commanded a bird s eye  view of most of the desolation of the valley   evil though it be  we may  not say that forewarning signs have been withheld  but what is the  cunningest man  when mortal wisdom is weighed in the scale against the  craft of devils  come forth  belial hath done his worst  and we have a  breathing time      the sounds  which issued still deeper from the well  denoted the  satisfaction with which this intelligence was received  no less than the  alacrity with which the summons of the borderer was obeyed  sundry blocks  of wood and short pieces of plank were first passed  with care  up to the  hands of dudley  who cast them  like useless lumber  among the other ruins  of the building  he then descended from his perch  and made room for  others to follow     the stranger next arose  after him came content  the puritan  reuben ring   and  in short  all the youths  with the exception of those who had  unhappily fallen in the contest  after these had mounted  and each in turn  had leaped to the ground  a very brief preparation served for the  liberation of the more feeble of body  the readiness of border skill soon  sufficed to arrange the necessary means  by the aid of chains and buckets   ruth and the little martha  faith and all of the handmaidens  without even  one exception  were successively drawn from the bowels of the earth  and  restored to the light of day  it is scarcely necessary to say to those  whom experience has best fitted to judge of such an achievement  that no  great time or labor was necessary for its accomplishment     it is not our intention to harass the feelings of the reader  further than  is required by a simple narrative of the incidents of the legend  we shall  therefore say nothing of the bodily pain  or of the mental alarm  by which  this ingenious retreat from the flames and the tomahawk had been effected   the suffering was chiefly confined to apprehension  for as the descent was  easy  so had the readiness and ingenuity of the young men found means  by  the aid of articles of furniture first cast into the shaft  and by  well secured fragments of the floors properly placed across  both to  render the situation of the females and children less painful than might  at first be supposed  and effectually to protect them from the tumbling  block  but little of the latter however  was likely to affect their  safety  as the form of the building was  in itself  a sufficient security  against the fall of its heavier parts     the meeting of the family  amid the desolation of the valley  though  relieved by the consciousness of having escaped a more shocking fate  may  easily be imagined  the first act was to render brief but solemn thanks  for their deliverance  and then  with the promptitude of people trained in  hardship  their attention was given to those measures which prudence told  them were yet necessary     a few of the more active and experienced of the youths were dispatched  in  order to ascertain the direction taken by the indians  and to gain what  intelligence they might concerning their future movements  the maidens  hastened to collect the kine  while others searched  with heavy hearts   among the ruins  in quest of such articles of food and comfort as could be  found  in order to administer to the first wants of nature     two hours had effected most of that which could immediately be done  in  these several pursuits  the young men returned with the assurance that the  trails announced the certain and final retreat of the savages  the cows  had yielded their tribute and such provision had been made against hunger  as circumstances would allow  the arms had been examined  and put  as far  as the injuries they had received would admit  in readiness for instant  service  a few hasty preparations had been made  in order to protect the  females against the cool airs of the coming night  and  in short  all was  done that the intelligence of a border man could suggest  or his exceeding  readiness in expedients could in so brief a space supply     the sun began to fall towards the tops of the beeches that crowned the  western outline of the view  before all these necessary arrangements were  ended  it was not till then  however  that reuben ring  accompanied by  another youth of equal activity and courage  appeared before the puritan   equipped  as well as men in their situation might be  for a journey  through the forest      go   said the old religionist  when the youths presented themselves  before him   go  carry forth the tidings of this visitation  that men come  to our succor  i ask not vengeance on the deluded and heathenish imitators  of the worshippers of moloch  they have ignorantly done this evil  let no  man arm in behalf of the wrongs of one sinful and erring  rather let them  look into the secret abominations of their own hearts  in order that they  crush the living worm  which  by gnawing on the seeds of a healthful hope   may yet destroy the fruits of the promise in their own souls  i would that  there be profit in this example of divine displeasure  go  make the  circuit of the settlements for some fifty miles  and bid such of the  neighbors as may be spared  come to our aid  they shall be welcome  and  may it be long ere any of them send invitation to me or mine  to enter  their clearings on the like melancholy duty  depart  and bear in mind   that you are messengers of peace  that your errand toucheth not the  feelings of vengeance  but that it is succor  in all fitting reason  and  no arming of the hand to chase the savage to his retreats  that i ask of  the brethren      with this final admonition  the young men took their leaves  still it was  evident  by their frowning brows and compressed lips  that some part of  its forgiving principle might be forgotten  should chance  in their  journey  bring them on the trail of any wandering inhabitant of the  forest  in a few minutes  they were seen passing  with swift steps  from  the fields into the depths of the forest  along that path which led to the  towns that lay lower on the connecticut     another task still remained to be performed  in making the temporary  arrangements for the shelter of the family  attention had been first paid  to the block house  the walls of the basement of this building were still  standing  and it was found easy  by means of half burnt timbers  with an  occasional board that had escaped the conflagration  to cover it  in a  manner that offered a temporary protection against the weather  this  simple and hasty construction  with an extremely inartificial office  erected around the stack of a chimney  embraced nearly all that could be  done  until time and assistance should enable them to commence other  dwellings  in clearing the ruins of the little tower of its rubbish  the  remains of those who had perished in the fray were piously collected  the  body of the youth who had died in the earlier hours of the attack  was  found  but half consumed  in the court  and the bones of two more  who  fell within the block  were collected from among the ruins  it had now  become a melancholy duty to consign them all to the earth  with decent  solemnity     the time selected for this sad office was just as the western horizon  began to glow with that which one of our own poets has so beautifully  termed   the pomp that brings and shuts the day   the sun was in the  tree tops  and a softer or sweeter light could not have been chosen for  such a ceremony  most of the fields still lay in the soft brightness of  the hour  though the forest was rapidly getting the more obscure look of  night  a broad and gloomy margin was spreading from the boundary of the  woods  and  here and there  a solitary tree cast its shadow on the meadows  without its limits  throwing a dark ragged line  in bold relief  on the  glow of the sun s rays  one  it was the dusky image of a high and waving  pine  that reared its dark green pyramid of never fading foliage nearly a  hundred feet above the humbler growth of beeches  cast its shade to the  side of the eminence of the block  here the pointed extremity of the  shadow was seen  stealing slowly towards the open grave   an emblem of  that oblivion in which its humble tenants were so shortly to be wrapped     at this spot  mark heathcote and his remaining companions had assembled   an oaken chair  saved from the flames  was the seat of the father  and two  parallel benches  formed of planks placed on stones  held the other  members of the family  the grave lay between  the patriarch had taken his  station at one of its ends  while the stranger  so often named in these  pages  stood with folded arms and a thoughtful brow at the other  the  bridle of a horse  caparisoned in that imperfect manner which the  straitened means of the borderers now rendered necessary  was hanging from  one of the half burnt palisadoes  in the back ground      a just  but a merciful hand hath been laid heavily on my household    commenced the old puritan  with the calmness of one who had long been  accustomed to chasten his regrets by humility   he that hath given freely   hath taken away  and one  that hath long smiled upon my weakness  hath now  veiled his face in anger  i have known him in his power to bless  it was  meet that i should see him in his displeasure  a heart that was waxing  confident would have hardened in its pride  at that which hath befallen   let no man murmur  let none imitate the speech of her who spoke  foolishly   what  shall we receive good at the hand of god  and shall we  not receive evil   i would that the feeble minded of the world  they that  jeopard the soul on vanities  they that look with scorn on the neediness  of the flesh  might behold the riches of one stedfast i would that they  might know the consolation of the righteous  let the voice of thanksgiving  be heard in the wilderness  open thy mouths in praise  that the gratitude  of a penitent be not hid      as the deep tones of the speaker ceased  his stern eye fell upon the  features of the nearest youth  and it seemed to demand an audible response  to his own lofty expression of resignation  but the sacrifice exceeded the  power of the individual to whom had been made this silent  but  intelligible  appeal  after regarding the relics that lay at his feet   casting a wandering glance at the desolation which had swept over a place  his own hand had helped to decorate  and receiving a renewed consciousness  of his own bodily suffering in the shooting pain of his wounds  the young  borderer averted his look  and seemed to recoil from so officious a  display of submission  observing his inability to reply  mark continued        hath no one a voice to praise the lord  the bands of the heathen have  fallen upon my herds  the brand hath been kindled within my dwellings  my  people have died by the violence of the unenlightened  and none are here  to say that the lord is just  i would that the shouts of thanksgiving  should arise in my fields  i would that the song of praise should grow  louder than the whoop of the savage  and that all the land might speak  joyfulness      a long  deep  and expecting pause succeeded  then content rejoined  in his  quiet tones  speaking firmly  but with the modest utterance he rarely  failed to use       the hand that hath held the balance is just   he said   and we have been  found wanting  he that made the wilderness blossom hath caused the  ignorant and the barbarous to be the instruments of his will  he hath  arrested the season of our prosperity  that we may know he is the lord  he  hath spoken in the whirlwind  but his mercy granteth that our ears shall  know his voice      as his son ceased  a gleam of satisfaction shot across the countenance of  the puritan  his eye next turned inquiringly towards ruth  who sate among  her maidens the image of womanly sorrow  common interest seemed to still  the breathing of the little assembly  and sympathy was quite as active as  curiosity  when each one present suffered a glance to steal towards her  benignant but pallid face  the eye of the mother was gazing earnestly  but  without a tear  on the melancholy spectacle before her  it unconsciously  sought  among the dried and shrivelled remnants of mortality that lay at  her feet  some relic of the cherub she had lost  a shudder and struggle  followed  after which her gentle voice breathed so low that those nearest  her person could scarce distinguish the words       the lord gave  and the lord hath taken away  blessed be his holy name       now know i that he who hath smote me is merciful  for he chasteneth them  he loveth   said mark heathcote  rising with dignity to address his house  hold   our life is a life of pride  the young are wont to wax insolent   while he of many years saith to his own heart   it is good to be here    there is a fearful mystery in one who sitteth on high  the heavens are his  throne  and he hath created the earth for his footstool  let not the  vanity of the weak of mind presume to understand it  for  who that hath  the breath of life  lived before the hills   the bonds of the evil one  of  satan  and of the sons of belial  have been loosened  that the faith of  the elect may be purified  that the names of those written  since the  foundations of the earth were laid  may be read in letters of pure gold   the time of man is but a moment in the reckoning of him whose life is  eternity  earth the habitation of a season  the bones of the bold  of the  youthful  and of the strong of yesterday  lie at our feet  none know what  an hour may bring forth  in a single night my children  hath this been  done  they whose voices were heard in my halls are now speechless and they  who so lately rejoiced are sorrowing  yet hath this seeming evil been  ordered that good may come thereof  we are dwellers in a wild and distant  land   he continued  insensibly permitting his thoughts to incline towards  the more mournful details of their affliction   our earthly home is afar  off  hither have we been led by the flaming pillar of truth  and yet the  malice of the persecuters hath not forgotten to follow  one houseless  and  sought like the hunted deer  is again driven to flee  we have the canopy  of the stars for a roof  none may tarry longer to worship  secretly   within our walls  but the path of the faithful  though full of thorns   leadeth to quiet  and the final rest of the just man can never know alarm   he that hath borne hunger  and thirst  and the pains of the flesh  for the  sake of truth  knoweth how to be satisfied  nor will the hours of bodily  suffering be accounted weary to him whose goal is the peace of the  righteous   the strong lineaments of the stranger grew even more than  usually austere  and as the puritan continued  the hand which rested on  the handle of a pistol grasped the weapon  until the fingers seemed  imbedded in the wood  he bowed  however  as if to acknowledge the personal  allusion  and remained silent      if any mourn the early death of those who have rendered up their being   struggling  as it may be permitted  in behalf of life and dwelling    continued mark heathcote  regarding a female near him   let her remember   that from the beginning of the world were his days numbered  and that not  a sparrow falleth without answering the ends of wisdom  rather let the  fulfilment of things remind us of the vanity of life  that we may learn  how easy it is to become immortal  if the youth hath been cut down   seemingly like unripened grass  he hath fallen by the sickle of one who  knoweth best when to begin the in gathering of the harvest to his eternal  garners  though a spirit bound unto his  as one feeble is wont to lean on  the strength of man and mourn over his fall  let her sorrow be mingled  with rejoicing   a convulsive sob broke out of the bosom of the handmaiden  who was known to have been affianced to one of the dead  and for a moment  the address of mark was interrupted  but when silence again ensued  he  continued  the subject leading him  by a transition that was natural  to  allude to his own sorrows   death hath been no stranger in my habitation    he said   his shaft fell heaviest  when it struck her  who  like those  that have here fallen  was in the pride of her youth  and when her soul  was glad with the first joy of the birth of a man child  thou who sittest  on high   he added  turning a glazed and tear less eye to heaven   thou  knowest how heavy was that blow  and thou hast written down the strivings  of an oppressed soul  the burthen was not found too heavy for endurance   the sacrifice hath not sufficed  the world was again getting uppermost in  my heart  thou didst bestow an image of that innocence and loveliness that  dwelleth in the skies  and this hast thou taken away  that we might know  thy power  to this judgment we bow  if thou hast called our child to the  mansions of bliss  she is wholly thine  and we presume not to complain   but if thou hast still left her to wander further in the pilgrimage of  life  we confide in thy goodness  she is of a long suffering race  and  thou wilt not desert her to the blindness of the heathen  she is thine   she is wholly thine  king of heaven  and yet hast thou permitted our  hearts to yearn towards her  with the fondness of earthly love  we await  some further manifestation of thy will  that we may know whether the  fountains of our affection shall be dried in the certainty of her  blessedness     scalding tears were rolling down the cheeks of the pallid  and immovable mother   or whether hope  nay  whether duty to thee calleth  for the interference of those bound to her in the tenderness of the flesh   when the blow was heaviest on the bruised spirit of a lone and solitary  wanderer  in a strange and savage land  he held not back the offspring it  was thy will to grant him in the place of her called to thyself  and now  that the child hath become a man  he too layeth  like abraham of old  the  infant of his love  a willing offering at thy feet  do with it as to thy  never failing wisdom seemeth best    the words were interrupted by a heavy  groan  that burst from the chest of content  a deep silence ensued  but  when the assembly ventured to throw looks of sympathy and awe at the  bereaved father  they saw that he had arisen and stood gazing steadily at  the speaker  as if he wondered  equally with the others  whence such a  sound of suffering could have come  the puritan renewed the subject  but  his voice faltered  and for an instant  as he proceeded  his hearers were  oppressed with the spectacle of an aged and dignified man shaken with  grief  conscious of his weakness  the old man ceased speaking in  exhortation  and addressed himself to prayer  while thus engaged  his  tones again became clear  firm and distinct  and the petition was ended  in the midst of a deep and holy calm     with the performance of this preliminary office  the simple ceremony was  brought to its close  the remains were lowered  in solemn silence  into  the grave  and the earth was soon replaced by the young men  mark  heathcote then invoked aloud the blessing of god on his household  and  bowing in person  as he had before done in spirit  to the will of heaven   he motioned to the family to withdraw     the interview that succeeded was over the resting place of the dead  the  hand of the stranger was firmly clenched in that of the puritan  and the  stern self command of both appeared to give way  before the regrets of a  friendship that had endured through so many trying scenes      thou knowest that i may not tarry   said the former  as if he replied to  some expressed wish of his companion   they would make me a sacrifice to  the moloch of their vanities  and yet would i fain abide  until the weight  of this heavy blow may be forgotten  i found thee in peace  and i quit  thee in the depths of suffering       thou distrustest me  or thou dost injustice to thine own belief    interrupted the puritan  with a smile  that shone on his haggard and  austere visage  as the rays of the setting sun light a wintry cloud   seemed i happier when this hand placed that of a loved bride into mine  own  than thou now seest me in this wilderness  houseless  stripped of my  wealth  and  god forgive the ingratitude  but i had almost said   childless  no  indeed  thou mayest not tarry  for the blood hounds of  tyranny will be on their scent  here is shelter no longer      the eyes of both turned  by a common and melancholy feeling  towards the  ruin of the block  the stranger then pressed the hand of his friend in  both his own  and said in a struggling voice       mark heathcote  adieu  he that had a roof for the persecuted  wanderer shall not long be houseless  neither shall the resigned for  ever know sorrow      his words sounded in the ears of his companion like the revelation of a  prophecy  they again pressed their hands together  and  regarding each  other with looks in which kindness could not be altogether smothered by  the repulsive character of an acquired air  they parted  the puritan  slowly took his way to the dreary shelter which covered his family  while  the stranger was shortly after seen urging the beast he had mounted   across the pastures of the valley  towards one of the most retired paths  of the wilderness           chapter xvii            together towards the village then we walked     and of old friends and places much we talked     and who had died  who left them  would he tell     and who still in their father s mansion dwell        dana      we leave the imagination of the reader to supply an interval of several  years  before the thread of the narrative shall be resumed  it will be  necessary to take another hasty view of the condition of the country in  which the scene of our legend had place     the exertions of the provincials were no longer limited to the first  efforts of a colonial existence  the establishments of new england had  passed the ordeal of experiment  and were become permanent  massachusetts  was already populous  and connecticut  the colony with which we have more  immediate connexion  was sufficiently peopled to manifest a portion of  that enterprise which has since made her active little community so  remarkable  the effects of these increased exertions were becoming  extensively visible  and we shall endeavor to set one of these changes  as  distinctly as our feeble powers will allow  before the eyes of those who  read these pages     when compared with the progress of society in the other hemisphere  the  condition of what is called  in america  a new settlement  becomes  anomalous  there  the arts of life have been the fruits of an intelligence  that has progressively accumulated with the advancement of civilization   while here  improvement is  in a great degree  the consequence of  experience elsewhere acquired  necessity  prompted by an understanding of  its wants incited by a commendable spirit of emulation  and encouraged by  liberty  early gave birth to those improvements which have converted a  wilderness into the abodes of abundance and security  with a rapidity that  wears the appearance of magic  industry has wrought with the confidence of  knowledge  and the result has been peculiar     it is scarcely necessary to say that  in a country where the laws favor  all commendable enterprise  where unnecessary artificial restrictions are  unknown  and where the hand of man has not yet exhausted its efforts  the  adventurer is allowed the greatest freedom of choice  in selecting the  field of his enterprise  the agriculturist passes the heath and the  barren  to seat himself on the river bottom  the trader looks for the site  of demand and supply and the artisan quits his native village to seek  employment in situations where labor will meet its fullest reward  it is a  consequence of this extraordinary freedom of election  that  while the  great picture of american society has been sketched with so much  boldness  a large portion of the filling up still remains to be done  the  emigrant has consulted his immediate interests  and  while no very  extensive and profitable territory  throughout the whole of our immense  possessions  has been wholly neglected  neither has any particular  district yet attained the finish of improvement  the city is even now   seen in the wilderness  and the wilderness often continues near the city   while the latter is sending forth its swarms to distant scenes of  industry  after thirty years of fostering care on the part of the  government  the capital  itself  presents its disjointed and sickly  villages  in the centre of the deserted  old fields  of maryland  while  numberless youthful rivals are flourishing on the waters of the west  in  spots where the bear has ranged and the wolf howled  long since the former  has been termed a city     thus it is that high civilization  a state of infant existence  and  positive barbarity  are often brought so near each other  within the  borders of this republic  the traveller  who has passed the night in an  inn that would not disgrace the oldest country in europe  may be compelled  to dine in the shantee  footnote   shanty   or  shantee   is a word much  used in the newer settlements  it strictly means a rude cabin of bark and  brush  such as is often erected in the forest for temporary purposes  but  the borderers often quaintly apply it to their own habitations  the only  derivation which the writer has heard for this american word  is one that  supposes it to be a corruption of  chiente   a term said to be used among  the canadians to express a dog kennel   of a hunter  the smooth and  gravelled road sometimes ends in an impassable swamp  the spires of the  town are often hid by the branches of a tangled forest  and the canal  leads to a seemingly barren and unprofitable mountain  he that does not  return to see what another year may bring forth  commonly bears away from  these scenes  recollections that conduce to error  to see america with the  eyes of truth  it is necessary to look often  and in order to understand  the actual condition of these states  it should be remembered  that it is  equally unjust to believe that all the intermediate points partake of the  improvements of particular places  as to infer the want of civilization at  more remote establishments  from a few unfavorable facts gleaned near the  centre  by an accidental concurrence of moral and physical causes  much of  that equality which distinguishes the institutions of the country is  extended to the progress of society over its whole surface     although the impetus of improvement was not as great in the time of mark  heathcote as in our own days  the principle of its power was actively in  existence  of this fact we shall furnish a sufficient evidence  by  pursuing our intention of describing one of those changes to which  allusion has already been made     the reader will remember that the age of which we write had advanced into  the last quarter of the seventeenth century  the precise moment at which  the action of the tale must re commence  was that period of the day when  the gray of twilight was redeeming objects from the deep darkness with  which the night draws to its close  the month was june  and the scene such  as it may be necessary to describe with some particularity     had there been light  and had one been favorably placed to enjoy a  bird s eye view of the spot  he would have seen a broad and undulating  field of leafy forest  in which the various deciduous trees of new england  were relieved by the deeper verdure of occasional masses of evergreens  in  the centre of this swelling and nearly interminable outline of woods  was  a valley that spread between three low mountains  over the bottom land   for the distance of several miles  all the signs of a settlement in a  state of rapid and prosperous improvement were visible  the devious course  of a deep and swift brook  that in the other hemisphere would have been  termed a river  was to be traced through the meadows by its borders of  willow and sumach  at a point near the centre of the valley  the waters  had been arrested by a small dam  and a mill  whose wheel at that early  hour was without motion  stood on the artificial mound  near it was the  site of a new england hamlet     the number of dwellings in the village might have been forty  they were   as usual  constructed of a firm frame work  neatly covered with sidings of  boards  there was a surprising air of equality in the general aspect of  the houses  and  if there were question of any country but our own  it  might be added there was an unusual appearance of comfort and abundance in  even the humblest of them all  they were mostly of two low stories  the  superior overhanging the inferior  by a foot or two  a mode of  construction much in use in the earlier days of the eastern colonies  as  paint was but little used at that time  none of the buildings exhibited a  color different from that the wood would naturally assume  after the  exposure of a few years to the weather  each had its single chimney in the  centre of the roof  and but two or three showed more than a solitary  window on each side of the principal or outer door  in front of every  dwelling was a small neat court  in green sward  separated from the public  road by a light fence of deal  double rows of young and vigorous elms  lined each side of the wide street  while an enormous sycamore still kept  possession of the spot  in its centre  which it had occupied when the  white man entered the forest  beneath the shade of this tree the  inhabitants often collected  to gather tidings of each others welfare  or  to listen to some matter of interest that rumor had borne from the towns  nearer the sea  a narrow and little used wheel track ran  with a graceful  and sinuous route  through the centre of the wide and grassy street   reduced in appearance to little more than a bridle path  it was to be  traced  without the hamlet  between high fences of wood  for a mile or  two  to the points where it entered the forest  here and there  roses were  pressing through the openings of the fences before the doors of the  different habitations  and bushes of fragrant lilacs stood in the angles  of most of the courts     the dwellings were detached  each occupied its own insulated plot of  ground  with a garden in its rear  the out buildings were thrown to that  distance which the cheapness of land  and security from fire  rendered  both easy and expedient     the church stood in the centre of the highway  and near one end of the  hamlet  in the exterior and ornaments of the important temple  the taste  of the times had been fastidiously consulted  its form and simplicity  furnishing no slight resemblance to the self denying doctrines and quaint  humors of the religionists who worshipped beneath its roof  the building   like all the rest  was of wood  and externally of two stories  it  possessed a tower  without a spire  the former alone serving to betray its  sacred character  in the construction of this edifice  especial care had  been taken to eschew all deviations from direct lines and right angles   those narrow arched passages for the admission of light  that are  elsewhere so common  were then thought  by the stern moralists of  new england  to have some mysterious connexion with her of the scarlet  mantle  the priest would as soon have thought of appearing before his  flock in the vanities of stole and cassock  as the congregation of  admitting the repudiated ornaments into the outline of their severe  architecture  had the genii of the lamp suddenly exchanged the windows of  the sacred edifice with those of the inn that stood nearly opposite  the  closest critic of the settlement could never have detected the liberty   since  in the form  dimensions  and style of the two  there was no visible  difference     a little inclosure  at no great distance from the church  and on one side  of the street  had been set apart for the final resting place of those who  had finished their race on earth  it contained but a solitary grave     the inn was to be distinguished from the surrounding buildings  by its  superior size  an open horse shed  and a sort of protruding air  with  which it thrust itself on the line of the street  as if to invite the  traveller to enter  a sign swung on a gallows looking post  that  in  consequence of frosty nights and warm days  had already deviated from the  perpendicular  it bore a conceit that  at the first glance  might have  gladdened the heart of a naturalist  with the belief that he had made the  discovery of some unknown bird  the artist  however  had sufficiently  provided against the consequences of so embarrassing a blunder  by  considerately writing beneath the offspring of his pencil   this is the  sign of the whip poor will   a name  that the most unlettered traveller   in those regions  would be likely to know was vulgarly given to the  wish ton wish  or the american night hawk     but few relics of the forest remained immediately around the hamlet  the  trees had long been felled  and sufficient time had elapsed to remove most  of the vestiges of their former existence  but as the eye receded from the  cluster of buildings  the signs of more recent inroads on the wilderness  became apparent  until the view terminated with openings  in which piled  logs and mazes of felled trees announced the recent use of the axe     at that early day  the american husbandman like the agriculturists of most  of europe  dwelt in his village  the dread of violence from the savages  had given rise to a custom similar to that which  centuries before  had  been produced in the other hemisphere by the inroads of more pretending  barbarians  and which  with few and distant exceptions  has deprived rural  scenery of a charm that  it would seem  time and a better condition of  society are slow to repair  some remains of this ancient practice are  still to be traced in the portion of the union of which we write  where   even at this day  the farmer often quits the village to seek his scattered  fields in its neighborhood  still  as man has never been the subject of a  system here  and as each individual has always had the liberty of  consulting his own temper  bolder spirits early began to break through a  practice  by which quite as much was lost in convenience as was gained in  security  even in the scene we have been describing  ten or twelve humble  habitations were distributed among the recent clearings on the sides of  the mountains  and in situations too remote to promise much security  against any sudden inroad of the common enemy     for general protection  in cases of the last extremity  however  a  stockaded dwelling  not unlike that which we have had occasion to  describe in our earlier pages  stood in a convenient spot near the  hamlet  its defences were stronger and more elaborate than usual  the  pickets being furnished with flanking block houses  and  in other  respects  the building bore the aspect of a work equal to any resistance  that might be required in the warfare of those regions  the ordinary  habitation of the priest was within its gates  and hither most of the  sick were timely conveyed  in order to anticipate the necessity of  removals at more inconvenient moments     it is scarcely necessary to tell the american  that heavy wooden fences  subdivided the whole of this little landscape into inclosures of some  eight or ten acres in extent  that  here and there  cattle and flocks were  grazing without herdsmen or shepherds  and that  while the fields nearest  to the dwellings were beginning to assume the appearance of a careful and  improved husbandry  those more remote became gradually wilder and less  cultivated  until the half reclaimed openings  with their blackened stubs  and barked trees  were blended with the gloom of the living forest  these  are  more or less  the accompaniments of every rural scene  in districts  of the country where time has not yet effected more than the first two  stages of improvement     at the distance of a short half mile from the fortified house  or  garrison  as by a singular corruption of terms the stockaded building was  called  stood a dwelling of pretensions altogether superior to any in the  hamlet  the buildings in question  though simple  were extensive  and  though scarcely other than such as might belong to an agriculturist in  easy circumstances  still they were remarkable  in that settlement  by the  comforts which time alone could accumulate  and some of which denoted an  advanced condition for a frontier family  in short  there was an air about  the establishment  as in the disposition of its out buildings  in the  superior workmanship  in the materials  and in numberless other well known  circumstances  which went to show that the whole of the edifices were  re constructions  the fields near this habitation exhibited smoother  surfaces than those in the distance  the fences were lighter and less  rude  the stumps had absolutely disappeared  and the gardens and homestead  were well planted with flourishing fruit trees  a conical eminence arose   at a short distance  in the rear of the principal dwelling  it was covered  with that beautiful and peculiar ornament of an american farm  a regular   thrifty  and luxuriant apple orchard  still  age had not given its full  beauty to the plantation  which might have had a growth of some eight or  ten years  a blackened tower of stone  which sustained the charred ruins  of a superstructure of wood  though of no great height in itself  rose  above the tallest of the trees  and stood a sufficient memorial of some  scene of violence  in the brief history of the valley  there was also a  small block house near the habitation  but  by the air of neglect that  reigned around  it was quite apparent the little work had been of a  hurried construction  and of but temporary use  a few young plantations of  fruit trees were also to be seen in different parts of the valley  which  was beginning to exhibit many other evidences of an improved agriculture     so far as all these artificial changes went  they were of an english  character  but it was england devoid alike of its luxury and its poverty   and with a superfluity of space that gave to the meanest habitation in the  view  an air of abundance and comfort that is so often wanting about the  dwellings of the comparatively rich  in countries where man is found  bearing a far greater numerical proportion to the soil  than was then  or  is even now the case  in the regions of which we write           chapter xviii            come hither  neighbor sea coal  god hath blessed you with a good name     to be a well favored man is the gift of fortune  but to write and read    comes by nature        much ado about nothing       it has already been said  that the hour at which the action of the tale  must re commence  was early morning  the usual coolness of night  in a  country extensively covered with wood  had passed  and the warmth of a  summer morning  in that low latitude  was causing the streaks of light  vapor  that floated about the meadows  to rise above the trees  the  feathery patches united to form a cloud that sailed away towards the  summit of a distant mountain  which appeared to be a common rendezvous for  all the mists that had been generated by the past hours of darkness     though the burnished sky announced his near approach  the sun was not yet  visible  notwithstanding the earliness of the hour  a man was already  mounting a little ascent in the road  at no great distance from the  southern entrance of the hamlet  and at a point where he could command a  view of all the objects described in the preceding chapter  a musket  thrown across his left shoulder  with the horn and pouch at his sides   together with the little wallet at his back  proclaimed him one who had  either been engaged in a hunt  or in some short expedition of even a less  peaceable character  his dress was of the usual material and fashion of a  countryman of the age and colony  though a short broadsword  that was  thrust through a wampum belt which girded his body  might have attracted  observation  in all other respects  he had the air of an inhabitant of the  hamlet  who had found occasion to quit his abode on some affair of  pleasure or of duty  that had made no very serious demand on his time     whether native or stranger  few ever passed the hillock named  without  pausing to gaze at the quiet loveliness of the cluster of houses that lay  in full view from its summit  the individual mentioned loitered as usual   but  instead of following the line of the path  his eye rather sought some  object in the direction of the fields  moving leisurely to the nearest  fence  he threw down the upper rails of a pair of bars  and beckoned to a  horseman  who was picking his way across a broken bit of pasture land  to  enter the highway by the passage he had opened      put the spur smartly into the pacer s flank   said he who had done this  act of civility  observing that the other hesitated to urge his beast  across the irregular and somewhat scattered pile   my word for it  the  jade goes over them all  without touching with more than three of her four  feet  fie  doctor  there is never a cow in the wish ton wish  but it would  take the leap to be in the first at the milking       softly  ensign   returned the timid equestrian  laying the emphasis on  the final syllable of his companion s title  and pronouncing the first as  if it were spelt with the third instead of the second vowel      thy courage is meet for one set apart for deeds of valor  but it would be  a sorrowful day when the ailing of the valley should knock at my door  and  a broken limb be made the apology for want of succor  thy efforts will  not avail thee  man  for the mare hath had schooling  as well as her  master  i have trained the beast to methodical habits  and she hath come  to have a rooted dislike to all irregularities of movement  so  cease  tugging at the rein  as if thou wouldst compel her to pass the pile in  spite of her teeth  and throw down the upper bar altogether       a doctor in these rugged parts should be mounted on one of these ambling  birds of which we read   said the other  removing the obstacle to the  secure passage of his friend   for truly a journey at night  in the paths  of these clearings  is not always as safe moving as that which is said to  be enjoyed by the settlers nearer sea       and where hast found mention of a bird of a size and velocity fit to be  the bearer of the weight of a man   demanded he who was mounted  with a  vivacity that betrayed some jealousy on the subject of a monopoly of  learning   i had thought there was never a book in the valley  out of mine  own closet  that dealeth in these abstrusities       dost think the scriptures are strangers to us  there  thou art now in the  public path  and thy journey is without danger  it is matter of marvel to  many in this settlement  how thou movest about at midnight  amongst  upturned roots of trees  holes  logs and stumps  without falling        i have told thee  ensign  it is by virtue of much training given to the  beast  certain am i  that neither whip nor spur would compel the animal to  pass the bounds of discretion  often have i travelled this bridle path   without fear as in truth without danger  when sight was a sense of as  little use as that of smelling       i was about to say  falling into thine own hands  which would be a  tumble of little less jeopardy than even that of the wicked spirits      the medical man affected to laugh at his companion s joke  but   remembering the dignity suited to one of his calling  he immediately  resumed the discourse with gravity       these may be matters of levity  with those who know little of the  hardships that are endured in the practice of the settlements  here have i  been on yonder mountain  guided by the instinct of my horse        ha  hath there been a call at the dwelling of my brother ring   demanded  the pedestrian  observing  by the direction of the other s eye  the road  he had been travelling      truly  there hath  and at the unseasonable hour that is wont  in a very  unreasonable proportion of the cases of my practice       and reuben numbereth another boy to the four that he could count  yesterday      the medical man held up three of his fingers  in a significant manner  as  he nodded assent      this putteth faith something in arrears   returned he who has been called  ensign  and who was no other than the reader s old acquaintance eben  dudley  preferred to that station in the train band of the valley   the  heart of my brother reuben will be gladdened by these tidings  when he  shall return from the scout       there will be occasion for thankfulness  since he will find seven beneath  a roof where he left but four       i will close the bargain with the young captain for the mountain lot   this very day   muttered dudley  like one suddenly convinced of the  prudence of a long debated measure   seven pounds of the colony money  is no usurer s price  after all  for a hundred acres of  heavily timbered land  and they in full view of a settlement where  boys come three at a time      the equestrian stopped his horse  and regarding his companion intently and  with a significant air  he answered       thou hast now fallen on the clue of an important mystery  ensign dudley   this continent was created with a design  the fact is apparent by its  riches  its climate  its magnitude  its facilities of navigation  and  chiefly in that it hath been left undiscovered until the advanced  condition of society hath given opportunity and encouragement to men of a  certain degree of merit  to adventure in its behalf  consider  neighbor   the wonderful progress it hath already made in the arts and in learning   in reputation and in resources  and thou wilt agree with me in the  conclusion that all this hath been done with a design        twould be presuming to doubt it  for he hath indeed a short memory  to  whom it shall be necessary to recall the time when this very valley was  little other than a den for beasts of prey  and this beaten highway  a  deer track  dost think that reuben will be like to raise the whole of the  recent gift       with judgment  and by the blessing of providence  the mind is active   ensign dudley  when the body is journeying among the forests  and much  have my thoughts been exercised in this matter  whilst thou and others  have been in your slumbers  here have we the colonies in their first  century  and yet thou knowest to what a pass of improvement they have  arrived  they tell me the hartford settlement is getting to be apportioned  like the towns of mother england  that there is reason to think the day  may come when the provinces shall have a power  and a convenience of  culture and communication  equalling that which belongeth to some parts of  the venerable island itself       nay  nay  doctor ergot   returned the other with an incredulous smile    that is exceeding the bounds of a discretionable expectation       thou wilt remember that i said equalling to  certain  parts  i think we  may justly imagine  that ere many centuries shall elapse  there may be  millions counted in these regions  and truly that  too  where one seeth  nought  at present  but the savage and the beast       i will go with any man  in this question  as far as reason will justify   but doubtless thou hast read in the books uttered by writers over sea  the  matters concerning the condition of those countries  wherein it is plain  that we may never hope to reach the exalted excellence they enjoy       neighbor dudley  thou seemest disposed to push an unguarded expression to  extremity  i said equalling  certain  parts  meaning always  too  in  certain things  now it is known in philosophy  that the stature of man  hath degenerated  and must degenerate in these regions  in obedience to  established laws of nature  therefore it is meet that allowance should be  made for some deficiency in less material qualities       it is like  then  that the better sort of the men over sea are  ill disposed to quit their country   returned the ensign  glancing an eye  of some unbelief along the muscular proportions of his own vigorous frame    we have no less than three from the old countries in our village  here   and yet i do not find them men like to have been sought for at the  building of babel       this is settling a knotty and learned point by the evidence of a few  shallow exceptions  i presume to tell you  ensign dudley  that the  science  and wisdom  and philosophy of europe  have been exceeding active  in this matter  and they proved to their own perfect satisfaction  which  is the same thing as disposing of the question without appeal  that man  and beast  plant and tree  hill and dale  lake and pond  sun  air  fire  and water  are all wanting in some of the perfectness of the older  regions  i respect a patriotic sentiment  and can carry the disposition to  applaud the bounties received from the hands of a beneficent creator as  far as any man  but that which hath been demonstrated by science  or  collected by learning  is placed too far beyond the objections of  light minded cavillers  to be doubted by graver faculties       i shall not contend against things that are proven   returned dudley  who  was quite as meek in discussion as he was powerful and active in more  physical contests   since it needs be that the learning of men in the old  countries must have an exceeding excellence  in virtue of its great age   it would be a visit to remember  should some of its rare advantages be  dispersed in these our own youthful regions       and can it be said that our mental wants have been forgotten  that the  nakedness of the mind hath been suffered to go without its comely  vestment  neighbor dudley  to me  it seemeth  that therein we have  unwonted reason to rejoice  and that the equilibrium of nature is in a  manner restored by the healing exercises of art  it is unseemly in an  unenlightened province  to insist on qualities that have been discreetly  disproven  but learning is a transferable and communicable gift  and it is  meet to affirm that it is to be found here  in quantities adapted to the  wants of the colony       i ll not gainsay it  for having been more of an adventurer in the forest  than one who hath travelled in quest of sights among the settlements along  the sea shore  it may happen that many things are to be seen there  of  which my poor abilities have formed no opinion       and are we utterly unenlightened  even in this distant valley  ensign    returned the leech  leaning over the neck of his horse  and addressing his  companion in a mild and persuasive tone  that he had probably acquired in  his extensive practice among the females of the settlement   are we to be  classed with the heathen in knowledge  or to be accounted as the  unnurtured men who are known once to have roamed through these forests in  quest of their game  without assuming any infallibility of judgment  or  aspiring to any peculiarity of information  it doth not appear to my  defective understanding  master dudley  that the progress of the  settlement hath ever been checked for want of necessary foresight  nor  that the growth of reason among us hath ever been stunted from any lack of  mental aliment  our councils are not barren of wisdom  ensign  nor hath it  often arrived that abstrusities have been propounded  that some one  intellect  to say no more in our own favor  hath not been known to grapple  with  successfully       that there are men  or perhaps i ought to say that there  is a  man   in the valley  who is equal to many marvels in the way of  enlightened gifts        i knew we should come to peaceable conclusions  ensign dudley    interrupted the other  rising erect in his saddle  with an air of appeased  dignity   for i have ever found you a discreet and consequent reasoner   and one who is never known to resist conviction  when truth is pressed  with understanding  that the men from over sea are not often so well  gifted as some  we will say  for the sake of a convenient illustration  as  thyself  ensign  is placed beyond the reach of debate  since sight  teacheth us that numberless exceptions may be found to all the more  general and distinctive laws of nature  i think we are not likely to carry  our disagreement further       it is impossible to make head against one so ready with his knowledge    returned the other  well content to exist in his own person a striking  exception to the inferiority of his fellows   though it appeareth to me  that my brother ring might be chosen  as another instance of a reasonable  stature  a fact that thou mayst see  doctor  by regarding him as he  approaches through yon meadow  he hath been  like myself  on the scout  among the mountains       there are many instances of physical merit among thy connexions  master  dudley   returned the complaisant physician   though it would seem that  thy brother hath not found his companion among them  he is attended by an  ill grown  and  it may be added  an ill favored comrade  that i know not       ha  it would seem that reuben hath fallen on the trail of savages  the  man in company is certainly in paint and blanket  it may be well to pause  at yonder opening  and await their coming      as this proposition imposed no particular inconvenience  the doctor  readily assented  the two drew nigh to the place where the men  whom  they saw crossing the fields in the distance  were expected to enter  the highway     but little time was lost in attendance  ere many minutes had elapsed   reuben ring  accoutred and armed like the borderer already introduced  in this chapter  arrived at the opening  followed by the stranger  whose appearance had caused so much surprise to those who watched  their approach      what now  sergeant   exclaimed dudley  when the other was within  ear shot  speaking a little in the manner of one who had legal right to  propound his questions   hast fallen on a trail of the savage  and made a  captive  or hath some owl permitted one of its brood to fall from the  nest across thy foot path       i believe the creature may be accounted a man   returned the successful  reuben  throwing the breech of his gun to the earth  and leaning on its  long barrel  while he intently regarded the half painted  vacant  and  extremely equivocal countenance of his captive   he hath the colors of a  narragansett about the brow and eyes  and yet he faileth greatly in the  form and movements       there are anomalies in the physicals of an indian  as in those of other  men   interrupted doctor ergot  with a meaning glance at dudley   the  conclusion of our neighbor ring may be too hasty  since paint is the fruit  of art  and may be applied to any of our faces  after an established  usage  but the evidences of nature are far less to be distrusted  it hath  come within the province of my studies  to note the differences in

usually called  sergeant ring   he hath  been spoken to in the language of a christian  no less than in that of a  heathen  and as yet no reply hath been made  while he obeys commands  uttered in both forms of speech       it mattereth not   said ergot  dismounting and drawing near to his  subject  with a look towards dudley that should seem to court his  admiration      happily the examination before me leaneth but little on any subtleties  of speech  let the man be placed in an attitude of ease  one in which  nature may not be fettered by restraint  the conformation of the whole  head is remarkably aboriginal  but the distinction of tribes is not to be  sought in these general delineations  the forehead  as you see  neighbors   is retreating and narrow  the cheek bones  as usual  high  and the  olfactory member  as in all of the natives  inclining to roman       now to me it would seem that the nose of the man hath a marked  upturning at the end   dudley ventured to remark  as the other ran  volubly over the general and well known distinctive points of physical  construction in an indian      as an exception  thou seest  ensign  by this elevation of the bone  and  the protuberance of the more fleshy parts  that the peculiarity is an  exception  i should rather have said that the nose originally inclined to  the roman  the departure from regularity has been produced by some  casualty of their warfare  such as a blow from a tomahawk  or the gash of  a knife  ay  here thou seest the scar left by the weapon  it is concealed  by the paint  but remove that  and you will find it hath all the form of a  cicatrice of a corresponding shape  these departures from generalities  have a tendency to confound pretenders  a happy circumstance  in itself   for the progress of knowledge on fixed principles  place the subject more  erect  that we may see the natural movement of the muscles  here is an  evidence of great aquatic habits in the dimensions of the foot  which go  to confirm original conceptions  it is a happy proof  through which   reasonable and prudent conclusions confirm the quick sighted glances of  practice  i pronounce the fellow to be a narragansett       is it then a narragansett that hath a foot to confound a trail    returned eben dudley  who had been studying the movements and attitudes of  the captive with quite as much keenness  and with something more of  understanding  than the leech   brother ring  hast ever known an indian  leave such an out turning foot print on the leaves       ensign  i marvel that a man of thy discretion should dwell on a slight  variety of movement  when a case exists in which the laws of nature may be  traced to their sources  this training for the indian troubles hath made  thee critical in the position of a foot  i have said that the fellow is a  narragansett  and what i have uttered hath not been lightly ventured  here  is the peculiar formation of the foot  which hath been obtained in  infancy  a fullness in the muscles of the breast and shoulders  from  unusual exercise in an element denser than the air  and a nicer  construction in       the physician paused  for dudley had coolly advanced to the captive  and   raising the thin robe of deer skin which was thrown over the whole of his  superior members  he exposed the unequivocal skin of a white man  this  would have proved an embarrassing refutation to one accustomed to the  conflict of wits  but monopoly  in certain branches of knowledge  had  produced in favor of doctor ergot an acknowledged superiority  that  in  its effects  might be likened to the predominating influence of any other  aristocracy  on those faculties that have been benumbed by its operation   his opinion changed  which is more than can be said of his countenance   for  with the readiness of invention which is so often practised in the  felicitous institutions we have named  and by which the reasoning instead  of regulating is adapted to the practice  he exclaimed with uplifted hands  and eyes that bespoke the fullness of his admiration       here have we another proof of the wonderful agency by which the changes  in nature are gradually wrought  now do we see in this narragansett        the man is white   interrupted dudley  tapping the naked shoulder  which  he still held exposed to view      white  but not a tittle the less a narragansett  your captive  beyond a  doubt  oweth his existence to christian parentage  but accident hath  thrown him early among the aboriginals  and all those parts  which were  liable to change  were fast getting to assume the peculiarities of the  tribe  he is one of those beautiful and connecting links in the chain of  knowledge  by which science followeth up its deductions to demonstration       i should ill brook coming to harm for doing violence to a subject of the  king   said reuben ring  a steady  open faced yeoman  who thought far less  of the subtleties of his companion  than of discharging his social duties  in a manner fitting the character of a quiet and well conditioned citizen    we have had so much of stirring tidings  latterly  concerning the manner  the savages conduct their warfare  that it behoveth men in place of trust  to be vigilant  for   glancing his eyes towards the ruin of the distant  block house   thou knowest  brother dudley  that we have occasion to be  watchful  in a settlement as deep in the forest as this       i will answer for the indemnity  sergeant ring   said dudley  with an air  of dignity   i take upon myself the keeping of this stranger  and will see  that he be borne  properly and in fitting season  before the authorities   in the mean time  duty hath caused us to overlook matters of moment in thy  household  which it may be seemly to communicate  abundance hath not been  neglectful of thy interests  during the scout       what   demanded the husband  with rather more of earnestness than was  generally exhibited by one of habits as restrained as his own   hath the  woman called upon the neighbors  during my absence      dudley nodded an assent      and shall i find another boy beneath my roof      doctor ergot nodded three times with a gravity that might have suited a  communication even more weighty than the one he made      thy woman rarely doth a good turn by halves  reuben  thou wilt find that  she hath made provision for a successor to our good neighbor ergot  since  a seventh son is born in thy house      the broad  honest face of the father flushed with joy  and then a feeling  less selfish came over him  he asked  with a slight tremor in the voice   that was none the less touching for coming from the lips of one so stout  of frame and firm of movement       and the woman   in what manner doth abundance bear up under the  blessing       bravely   returned the leech   go to thy dwelling  sergeant ring  and  praise god that there is one to look to its concerns  in thy absence  he  who hath received the gift of seven sons  in five years  need never be a  poor nor a dependent man  in a country like this  seven farms  added to  that pretty homestead of mountain land which thou now tillest  will render  thee a patriarch in thine age  and sustain the name of ring  hundreds of  years hence  when these colonies shall become peopled and powerful  and  i  say it boldly  caring not who may call me one that vaunteth out of reason   equal to some of your lofty and self extolled kingdoms of europe  ay  even  peradventure to the mighty sovereignty of portugal  itself  i have  enumerated thy future farms at seven  for the allusion of the ensign to  the virtues of men born with natural propensities to the healing art   must be taken as pleasant speech  since it is a mere delusion of old  wives  fancy  and it would be particularly unnecessary  here  where every  reasonable situation of this nature is already occupied  go to thy wife   sergeant  and bid her be of good cheer  for she hath done herself  thee   and thy country  a service  and that without dabbling in pursuits foreign  to her comprehension      the sturdy yeoman  on whom this rich gift of providence had been  dispensed  raised his hat  and placing it decently before his face  he  offered up a silent thanksgiving for the favor  then  transferring his  captive to the keeping of his superior and kinsman  he was soon seen  striding over the fields towards his upland dwelling  with a heavy foot   though with a light heart     in the mean time  dudley and his companion bestowed a more particular  attention on the silent and nearly motionless object of their curiosity   though the captive appeared to be of middle age  his eye was unmeaning   his air timid and uncertain  and his form cringing and ungainly  in all  these particulars  he was seen to differ from the known peculiarities of a  native warrior     previously to departing  reuben ring had explained  that while traversing  the woods  on that duty of watchfulness to which the state of the colony  and some recent signs had given rise  this wandering person had been  encountered and secured  as seemed necessary to the safety of the  settlement  he had neither sought nor avoided his captor  but when  questioned concerning his tribe  his motive for traversing those hills   and his future intentions  no satisfactory reply could be extracted  he  had scarcely spoken  and the little that he said was uttered in a jargon  between the language of his interrogator and the dialect of some barbarous  nation  though there was much in the actual state of the colonies  and in  the circumstances in which this wanderer had been found  to justify his  detention  little had in truth been discovered  to supply a clue either to  any material facts in his history  or to any of his views in being in the  immediate vicinity of the valley     guided only by this barren information  dudley and his companion  endeavored  as they moved towards the hamlet  to entrap their prisoner  into some confession of his object  by putting their questions with a  sagacity not unusual to men in remote and difficult situations  where  necessity and danger are apt to keep alive all the native energies of  the human mind  the answers were little connected and unintelligible   sometimes seeming to exhibit the finest subtlety of savage cunning  and  at others to possess the mental helplessness of appearing the most  abject fatuity           chapter xix            i am not prone to weeping  as our sex    commonly are            but i have    that honorable grief lodged here  which burns    worse than tears drown        winter s tale       if the pen of a compiler  like that we wield  possessed the mechanical  power of the stage  it would be easy to shift the scenes of this legend as  rapidly and effectively as is required for its right understanding  and  for the proper maintenance of its interest  that which cannot be done with  the magical aid of machinery  must be attempted by less ambitious  and we  fear by far less efficacious means     at the same early hour of the day  and at no great distance from the spot  where dudley announced his good fortune to his brother ring  another  morning meeting had place  between persons of the same blood and  connexions  from the instant when the pale light  that precedes the day   was first seen in the heavens  the windows and doors of the considerable  dwelling  on the opposite side of the valley  had been unbarred  ere the  glow of the sun had gilded the sky over the outline of the eastern woods   this example of industry and providence was followed by the inmates of  every house in the village  or on the surrounding hills  and  by the time  the golden globe itself was visible above the trees  there was not a human  being in all that settlement  of proper age and health  who was not  actively afoot     it is unnecessary to say that the dwelling particularly named was the  present habitation of the household of mark heathcote  though age had  sapped the foundations of his strength  and had nearly dried the channels  of his existence  the venerable religionist still lived  while his  physical perfection had been gradually giving way before the ordinary  decay of nature  the moral man was but little altered  it is even probable  that his visions of futurity were less dimmed by the mists of carnal  interests than when last seen  and that the spirit had gained some portion  of that energy which had certainly been abstracted from the more corporeal  parts of his existence  at the hour already named  the puritan was seated  in the piazza  which stretched along the whole front of a dwelling  that   however it might be deficient in architectural proportions  was not  wanting in the more substantial comforts of a spacious and commodious  frontier residence  in order to obtain a faithful portrait of a man so  intimately connected with our tale  the reader will fancy him one who had  numbered four score and ten years  with a visage on which deep and  constant mental striving had wrought many and menacing furrows  a form  that trembled while it yet exhibited the ruins of powerful limb and  flexible muscle  and a countenance in which ascetic reflections had  engraved a severity  that was but faintly relieved by the gleamings of a  natural kindness  which no acquired habits  nor any traces of metaphysical  thought  could ever entirely erase  across this picture of venerable and  self mortifying age  the first rays of the sun were now softly cast   lighting a dimmed eye and furrowed face with a look of brightness and  peace  perhaps the blandness of the expression belonged as much to the  season and hour  as to the habitual character of the man  this benignancy  of feature  unusual rather in its strength than in its existence  might  have been heightened by the fact that his spirit had just wrought in  prayer  as was usual  in the circle of his children and dependants  ere  they left those retired parts of the building where they had found rest  and security during the night  of the former  none known and cherished in  the domestic circle had been absent  and the ample provision that was  making for the morning meal  sufficiently showed that the number of the  latter had in no degree diminished since the reader was familiar with the  domestic economy of his household     time had produced no very striking alteration in the appearance of  content  it is true that the brown hue of his features had deepened  and  that his frame was beginning to lose some of its elasticity and ease of  action  in the more measured movements of middle age  but the governed  temperament of the individual had always kept the animal in more than  usual subjection  even his earlier days had rather exhibited the promise  than the performance of the ordinary youthful qualities  mental gravity  had long before produced a corresponding physical effect  in reference to  his exterior  and using the language of the painter  it would now be said   that  without having wrought any change in form and proportions  the  colors had been mellowed by time  if a few hairs of gray were sprinkled   here and there  around his brow  it was as moss gathers on the stones of  the edifice  rather furnishing evidence of its increased adhesion and  approved stability  than denoting any symptoms of decay     not so with his gentle and devoted partner  that softness and sweetness of  air which had first touched the heart of content was still to be seen   though it existed amid the traces of a constant and a corroding grief  the  freshness of youth had departed  and in its place was visible the more  lasting  and  in her case  the more affecting beauty of expression  the  eye of ruth had lost none of its gentleness  and her smile still continued  kind and attractive  but the former was often painfully vacant  seeming to  look inward upon those secret and withering sources of sorrow that were  deeply and almost mysteriously seated in her heart  while the latter  resembled the cold brightness of that planet  which illumines objects by  repelling the borrowed lustre from its own bosom  the matronly form  the  feminine beaming of the countenance  and the melodious voice  yet  remained  but the first had been shaken till it stood on the very verge of  a premature decay  the second had a mingling of anxious care in its most  sympathetic movements  and the last was seldom without that fearful thrill  which so deeply affects the senses  by conveying to the understanding a  meaning so foreign from the words  and yet an uninterested and ordinary  observer might not have seen  in the faded comeliness and blighted  maturity of the matron  more than the every day signs that betray the turn  in the tide of human existence  as befitted such a subject  the coloring  of sorrow had been traced by a hand too delicate to leave the lines  visible to every vulgar eye  like the master touches of art  her grief  as  it was beyond the sympathies  so it lay beyond the ken of those whom  excellence may fail to excite  or in whom absence can deaden affections   still her feelings were true to all who had any claims on her love  the  predominance of wasting grief over the more genial springs of her  enjoyments  only went to prove how much greater is the influence of the  generous than the selfish qualities of our nature  in a heart that is  truly endowed with tenderness  it is scarce necessary to say  that this  gentle and constant woman sorrowed for her child     had ruth heathcote known that the girl ceased to live  it would not have  been difficult for one of her faith to have deposited her regrets by the  side of hopes that were so justifiable  in the grave of the innocent  but  the living death to which her offspring might be condemned  was rarely  absent from her thoughts  she listened to the maxims of resignation  which  were heard flowing from lips she loved with the fondness of a woman and  the meekness of a christian  and then  even while the holy lessons were  still sounding in her attentive organs  the workings of an unconquerable  nature led her insidiously back to the sorrow of a mother     the imagination of this devoted and feminine being had never possessed an  undue control over her reason  her visions of happiness with the man whom  her judgment not less than her inclination approved  had been such as  experience and religion might justify  but she was now fated to learn  there is a fearful poetry in sorrow  which can sketch with a grace and an  imaginative power that no feebler efforts of a heated fancy may ever  equal  she heard the sweet breathing of her slumbering infant in the  whispering of the summer airs  its plaints came to her ears amid the  howlings of the gale  while the eager question and fond reply were mixed  up with the most ordinary intercourse of her own household  to her the  laugh of childish happiness that often came on the still air of evening  from the hamlet  sounded like the voice of mourning  and scarce an  infantile sport met her eye  that did not bring with it a pang of anguish   twice  since the events of the inroad  had she been a mother  and  as if  an eternal blight were doomed to destroy her hopes  the little creatures  to whom she had given birth  slept  side by side  near the base of the  ruined block  thither she often went  but it was rather to be the victim  of those cruel images of her fancy  than as a mourner  her visions of the  dead were calm and even consolatory  but if ever her thoughts mounted to  the abodes of eternal peace  and her feeble fancy essayed to embody the  forms of the blessed  her mental eye sought her who was not  rather than  those who were believed to be secure in their felicity  wasting and  delusory as were these glimpses of the mind  there were others far more  harrowing  because they presented themselves with more of the coarse and  certain features of the world  it was the common  and perhaps it was the  better  opinion of the inhabitants of the valley  that death had early  sealed the fate of those who had fallen into the hands of the savages on  the occasion of the inroad  such a result was in conformity with the known  practices and ruthless passions of the conquerors  who seldom spared life   unless to render revenge more cruelly refined  or to bring consolation to  some bereaved mother of the tribe  by offering a substitute for the dead  in the person of a captive  there was relief  to picture the face of the  laughing cherub in the clouds  or to listen to its light footstep in the  empty halls of the dwelling  for in these illusive images of the brain   suffering was confined to her own bosom  but when stern reality usurped  the place of fancy  and she saw her living daughter shivering in the  wintry blasts or sinking beneath the fierce heats of the climate   cheerless in the desolation of female servitude  and suffering meekly the  lot of physical weakness beneath a savage master  she endured that anguish  which was gradually exhausting the springs of life     though the father was not altogether exempt from similar sorrow  it beset  him less ceaselessly  he knew how to struggle with the workings of his  mind  as best became a man  though strongly impressed with the belief that  the captives had early been put beyond the reach of suffering  he had  neglected no duty  which tenderness to his sorrowing partner  parental  love  or christian duty  could require at his hands     the indians had retired on the crust of the snow  and with the thaw every  foot print  or sign  by which such wary foes might be traced  had  vanished  it remained matter of doubt to what tribe or even to what  nation  the marauders belonged  the peace of the colony had not yet been  openly broken  and the inroad had been rather a violent and fierce symptom  of the evils that were contemplated  than the actual commencement of the  ruthless hostilities which had since ravaged the frontier  but while  policy had kept the colonists quiet  private affection omitted no rational  means of effecting the restoration of the sufferers  in the event of their  having been spared     scouts had passed among the conspiring and but half peaceable tribes   nearest to the settlement  and rewards and menaces had both been liberally  used  in order to ascertain the character of the savages who had laid  waste the valley  as well as the more interesting fortunes of their  hapless victims  every expedient to detect the truth had failed  the  narragansetts affirmed that their constant enemies the mohicans  acting  with their customary treachery  had plundered their english friends while  the mohicans vehemently threw back the imputation on the narragansetts  at  other times  some indians affected to make dark allusions to the hostile  feelings of fierce warriors  who  under the name of the five nations  were  known to reside within the limits of the dutch colony of new netherlands   and to dwell upon the jealousy of the pale faces who spoke a language  different from that of the yengeese  in short  inquiry had produced no  result  and content  when he did permit his fancy to represent his  daughter as still living  was forced to admit to himself the probability  that she might be buried far in the ocean of wilderness which then covered  most of the surface of this continent     once  indeed  a rumor of an exciting nature had reached the family  an  itinerant trader  bound from the wilds of the interior to a mart on the  sea shore  had entered the valley  he brought with him a report  that a  child  answering in some respects to the appearance which might now be  supposed to belong to her who was lost  was living among the savages  on  the banks of the smaller lakes of the adjoining colony  the distance to  this spot was great  the path led through a thousand dangers  and the  result was far from certain  yet it quickened hopes which had long been  dormant  ruth never urged any request that might involve serious hazard to  her husband  and for many months the latter had even ceased to speak on  the subject  still  nature was working powerfully within him  his eyes  at  all times reflecting and calm  grew more thoughtful  deeper lines of care  gathered about his brow  and at length  melancholy took possession of a  countenance which was usually so placid     it was at this precise period  that eben dudley chose to urge the suit  he  had always pressed after his own desultory fashion  on the decision of  faith  one of those well ordered accidents  which  from time to time  had  brought the girl and the young borderer in private conversation  enabled  him to effect his design with sufficient clearness  faith heard him  without betraying any of her ordinary waywardness  and answered with as  little prevarication as the subject seemed to demand      this is well  eben dudley   she said   and it is no more than an honest  girl hath a right to hear  from one who hath taken as many means as thou  to get into her favor  but he who would have his life tormented by me   hath a solemn duty to do  ere i listen to his wishes       i have been in the lower towns and studied their manner of life  and i  have been upon the scouts of the colony  to keep the indians in their  wigwams   returned her suitor  endeavoring to recount the feats of  manliness that might reasonably be expected of one inclined to venture on  so hazardous an experiment as matrimony   the bargain with the young  captain for the hill lot  and for a village homestead  is drawing near a  close  and as the neighbors will not be backward at the stone bee  or the  raising  i see nothing to        thou deceivest thyself  observant dudley   interrupted the girl   if thou  believest eye of thine can see that which is to be sought  ere one and the  same fortune shall be the property of thee and me  hast noted  eben  the  manner in which the cheek of the madam hath paled  and how her eye is  getting sunken  since the time when the fur trader tarried with us  the  week of the storm       i cannot say that there is much change in the wearing of the madam   within the bearing of my memory   answered dudley  who was never  remarkable for minute observations of this nature  however keen he might  prove in subjects more intimately connected with his daily pursuits   she  is not young and blooming as thou  faith  nor is it often that we see        i tell thee  man  that sorrow preyeth upon her form  and that she liveth  but in the memory of the lost infant       this is carrying mourning beyond the bounds of reason  the child is at  peace  as is thy brother  whittal  beyond all manner of question  that we  have not discovered their bones  is owing to the fire  which left but  little to tell of        thy head is a charnel house  dull dudley  but this picture of its  furniture shall not suffice for me  the man who is to be my husband must  have a feeling for a mother s sorrows       what is now getting uppermost in thy mind  faith  is it for me to bring  back the dead to life  or to place a child that hath been lost so many  years once more in the arms of its parents       it is   nay  open not thine eyes  as if light were first breaking into  the darkness of a clouded brain  i repeat  it is       i am glad that we have got to these open declarations  for too much of my  life hath been already wasted in unsettled gallanting  when sound wisdom   and the example of all around me  have shown that in order to become the  father of a family  and to be esteemed for a substantial settler  i should  have both cleared and wived some years ago  i wish to deal justly by all   and having given thee reason to think that the day might come when we  should live together  as is fitting to people of our condition  i felt it  a duty to ask thee to share my chances  but now that thou dealest in  impossibilities  it is needful to seek elsewhere       this hath ever been thy way  when a good understanding hath been  established between us  thy mind is ever getting into some discontent  and  then blame is heaped on one who rarely doth anything that should in reason  offend thee  what madness maketh thee dream that i ask impossibilities   surely  dudley  thou canst not have noted the manner in which the nature  of the madam is giving way before the consuming heat of her grief  thou  canst not look into the sorrow of woman  or thou wouldst have listened  with more kindness to a plan of travelling the woods for a short season   in order that it might be known whether she of whom the trader spoke is  the lost one of our family  or the child of some stranger      though faith spoke with vexation  she also spoke with feeling  her dark  eye swam in tears  and the color of her brown cheek deepened  until her  companion saw new reasons to forget his discontent in sympathies  which   however obtuse they might be  were never entirely dormant      if a journey of a few hundred miles be all thou askest  girl  why speak  in parables   he good naturedly replied   the kind word was not wanting to  put me on such a trial  we will be married on the sabbath  and  please  heaven  the wednesday  or the saturday at most  shall see me on the path  of the western trader       no delay  thou must depart with the sun  the more active thou provest on  the journey the sooner wilt thou have the power to make me repent a  foolish deed      but faith had been persuaded to relax a little from this severity  they  were married on the sabbath  and the following day content and dudley left  the valley  in quest of the distant tribe on which the scion of another  stock was said to have been so violently engrafted     it is needless to dwell on the dangers and privations of such an  expedition  the hudson  the delaware  and the susquehannah  rivers that  were then better known in tales than to the inhabitants of new england   were all crossed  and after a painful and hazardous journey  the  adventurers reached the first of that collection of small interior lakes   whose banks are now so beautifully decorated with villages and farms   here  in the bosom of savage tribes  and exposed to every danger of field  and flood  supported only by his hopes  and by the presence of a stout  companion that hardships or danger could not easily subdue  the father  diligently sought his child     at length a people were found  who held a captive that answered the  description of the trader  we shall not dwell on the feelings with which  content approached the village that contained this little descendant of a  white race  he had not concealed his errand  and the sacred character  in  which he came  found pity and respect even among those barbarous tenants  of the wilderness  a deputation of the chiefs received him in the skirts  of their clearing  he was conducted to a wigwam  where a council fire was  lighted  and an interpreter opened the subject  by placing the amount of  the ransom offered  and the professions of peace with which the strangers  came  in the fairest light before his auditors  it is not usual for the  american savage to loosen his hold easily  on one naturalized in his  tribe  but the meek air and noble confidence of content touched the  latent qualities of those generous though fierce children of the woods   the girl was sent for  that she might stand in the presence of the elders  of the nation     no language can paint the sensation with which content first looked upon  this adopted daughter of the savages  the years and sex were in accordance  with his wishes  but  in place of the golden hair and azure eyes of the  cherub he had lost  there appeared a girl in whose jet black tresses and  equally dark organs of sight  he might better trace a descendant of the  french of the canadas  than one sprung from his own saxon lineage  the  father was not quick of mind in the ordinary occupations of life  but  nature was now big within him  there needed no second glance  to say how  cruelly his hopes had been deceived  a smothered groan struggled from his  chest  and then his self command returned with the imposing grandeur of  christian resignation  he arose  and  thanking the chiefs for their  indulgence  he made no secret of the mistake by which he had been led so  far on a fruitless errand  while speaking  the signs and gestures of  dudley gave him reason to believe  that his companion had something of  importance to communicate  in a private interview  the latter suggested  the expediency of concealing the truth  and of rescuing the child they had  in fact discovered from the hands of her barbarous masters  it was now too  late to practise a deception that might have availed for this object  had  the stern principles of content permitted the artifice  but  transferring  same portion of the interest which he felt for the fortunes of his own  offspring  to that of the unknown parent  who  like himself  most probably  mourned the uncertain fate of the girl before him  he tendered the ransom  intended for ruth  in behalf of the captive  it was rejected  disappointed  in both their objects  the adventurers were obliged to quit the village   with weary feet and still heavier hearts     if any who read these pages have ever felt the agony of suspense in a  matter involving the best of human affections  they will know how to  appreciate the sufferings of the mother  during the month that her  husband was absent on this holy errand  at times  hope brightened around  her heart  until the glow of pleasure was again mantling on her cheek and  playing in her eye  the first week of the adventure was one almost of  happiness  the hazards of the journey were nearly forgotten in its  anticipated results  and though occasional apprehensions quickened the  pulses of one whose system answered so fearfully to the movements of the  spirit  there was a predominance of hope in all her anticipations  she  again passed among her maidens with a mien in which joy was struggling  with the meekness of subdued habits  and her smiles once more began to  beam with renovated happiness  to his dying day  old mark heathcote never  forgot the sudden sensation that was created by the soft laugh that on  some unexpected occasion came to his ear from the lips of his son s wife   though years had elapsed between the moment when that unwonted sound was  heard  and the time at which the action of the tale now stands  he had  never heard it repeated  to heighten the feelings which were now  uppermost in the mind of ruth  when within a day s march of the village  to which he was going  content had found means to send the tidings of his  prospects of success  it was over all these renewed wishes that  disappointment was to throw its chill  and it was affections thus riveted  that were to be again blighted by the cruelest of all withering  influences   that of hope defeated     it was near the hour of the setting of the sun  when content and dudley  reached the deserted clearing on their return to the valley  their path  led through this opening on the mountain side  and there was one point   among the bushes  from which the buildings  that had already arisen from  the ashes of the burning  might be distinctly seen  until now  the  husband and father had believed himself equal to any effort that duty  might require  in the progress of this mournful service  but here he  paused  and communicated a wish to his companion that he would go ahead  and break the nature of the deception that had led them so far on a  fruitless mission  perhaps content was himself ignorant of all he wished   or to what unskilful hands he had confided a commission of more than  ordinary delicacy  he merely felt his own inability  and  with a weakness  that may find some apology in his feelings  he saw his companion depart   without instructions or indeed without any other guide than nature     though faith had betrayed no marked uneasiness during the absence of the  travellers  her quick eye was the first to discover the form of her  husband  as he came with a tired step across the fields  in the direction  of the dwellings  long ere dudley reached the house  every one of its  inmates had assembled in the piazza  this was no meeting of turbulent  delight  or of clamorous greetings  the adventurer drew near amid a  silence so oppressive  that it utterly disconcerted a studied project  by  which he had hoped to announce his tidings in a manner suited to the  occasion  his hand was on the gate of the little court  and still none  spoke  his foot was on the low step  and yet no voice bade him welcome   the looks of the little group were rather fixed on the features of ruth   than on the person of him who approached  her face was pallid as death   her eye contracted  but filled with the mental effort that sustained her   and her lip scarce trembled  as  in obedience to a feeling still stronger  than the one which had so long oppressed her  she exclaimed       eben dudley  where hast thou left my husband       the young captain was a foot weary  and he tarried in the second growth  of the hill  but so brave a walker cannot be far behind  we shall see him  soon  at the opening by the dead beech  and it is there that i recommend  the madam        it was thoughtful in heathcote  and like his usual kindness  to devise  this well meant caution   said ruth  across whose countenance a smile so  radiant passed  that it imparted the expression which is believed to  characterize the peculiar benignancy of angels   still it was unnecessary   for he should have known that we place our strength on the rock of ages   tell me  in what manner hath my precious one borne the exceeding weariness  of thy tangled route      the wandering glance of the messenger had gone from face to face  until it  became fastened on the countenance of his own wife  in a settled   unmeaning gaze      nay  faith hath demeaned well  both as my assistant and as thy partner   and thou mayest see that her comeliness is in no degree changed  and did  the babe falter in this weary passage  or did she retard thy movements by  her fretfulness  but i know thy nature  man  she hath been borne over many  long miles of mountain side and treacherous swamp  in thine own vigorous  arms  thou answerest not  dudley   exclaimed ruth  taking the alarm  and  laying a hand firmly on the shoulder of him she questioned  as  forcing  his half averted face to meet her eye  she seemed to read his soul     the muscles of the sun burnt and strong features of the borderer worked  involuntarily  his broad chest swelled to its utmost expansion  big  burning drops rolled out upon his brown cheeks  and then  taking the arm  of ruth in one of his own powerful hands  he compelled her to release her  hold  with a firm but respectful exercise of his strength  and  thrusting  the form of his own wife  without ceremony  aside  he passed through the  circle  and entered the dwelling  with the tread of a giant     the head of ruth dropped upon her bosom  the paleness again came over  her cheeks  and it was then that the inward look of the eye might first  be seen  which afterwards became so constant and so painful an  expression in her countenance  from that hour  to the time in which the  family of the wish ton wish is again brought immediately before the  reader  no further rumors were ever heard  to lessen or increase the  wasting regrets of her bosom           chapter xx            sir  he hath never fed of the dainties that are bred in a book  he    hath not eaten paper  as it were  he hath not drunk ink  his intellect    is not replenished  he is only an animal  only sensible in the duller    parts        love s labor lost        here cometh faith  to bring us tidings of the hamlet   said the husband  of the woman whose character we have so feebly sketched  as he took his  seat in the piazza  at the early hour and in the group already mentioned    the ensign hath been abroad in the hills  throughout the night  with a  chosen party of our people  and perchance she hath been sent with the  substance that they have gathered  concerning the unknown trail       the heavy footed dudley hath scarce mounted to the dividing ridge  where  report goeth the prints of moccasons were seen   observed a young man  who  in his person bore all the evidences of an active and healthful manhood    of what service is the scouting that faileth of the necessary distance  by the weariness of its leader       if thou believest  boy  that thy young foot is equal to contend with the  sinews of eben dudley  there may be occasion to show the magnitude of thy  error  ere the danger of this indian out breaking shall pass away  thou  art too stubborn of will  mark  to be yet trusted with the leading of  parties that may hold the safety of all who dwell in the wish ton wish  within their keeping      the young man looked displeased  but  fearful that his father might  observe and misinterpret his humor into a personal disrespect  he turned  away  permitting his frowning eye to rest  for an instant  on the timid  and stolen glance of a maiden  whose cheek was glowing like the eastern  sky  as she busied herself with the preparations of the table      what welcome news dost bring from the sign of the whip poor will    content asked of the woman  who had now come within the little gate of his  court   hast seen the ensign  since the party took the hill paths  or is  it some traveller who hath charged thee with matter for our ears       eye of man hath not seen the man since he girded himself with the sword  of office   returned faith  entering the piazza and nodding salutation to  those around her   and as for strangers  when the clock shall strike noon   it will be one month to the day that the last of them was housed within my  doors  but i complain not of the want of custom  as the ensign would never  quit the bar and his gossip  to go into the mountain lots  so long as  there was one to fill his ears with the marvels of the old countries  or  even to discourse of the home stirrings of the colonies themselves       thou speakest lightly  faith  of one who merits thy respect and  thy duty      the eye of the former studied the meek countenance of her from whom this  reproof came  with an intenseness and a melancholy that showed her  thoughts were on other matters  and then  as it suddenly recalled to what  had passed  she resumed       truly  what with duty to the man as a husband  and respect to him as an  officer of the colony madam heathcote  the task is not one of easy  bearing  if the king s representative had given the colors to my brother  reuben  and left the dudley with the halberd in his hand  the preferment  would have been ample for one of his qualities  and all the better for the  credit of the settlement       the governor distributed his favor according to the advice of men  competent to distinguish merit   said content   eben was foremost in the  bloody affair among the people of the plantations  where his manhood was  of good example to all in company  should he continue as faithful and as  valiant  thou mayest yet live to see thyself the consort of a captain       not for glory gained in this night s marching  for yonder cometh the man  with a sound body  and seemingly with the stomach of a caesar  ay  and  i ll answer for it  of a regiment too  it is no trifle that will satisfy  his appetite  after one of these  ha  pray heaven the fellow be not  harmed  truly  he hath our neighbor ergot in attendance       there is other than he too  for one cometh in the rear whose gait and air  are unknown to me  the trail hath been struck  and dudley leadeth a  captive  a savage  in his paint and cloak of skin  is taken      this assertion caused all to rise  for the excitement of an apprehended  inroad was still strong in the minds of those secluded people  not a  syllable more was uttered  until the scout and his companion were  before them     the quick glance of faith had scanned the person of her husband  and   resuming her spirits with the certainty that he was unharmed  she was the  first to greet him with words      how now  ensign dudley   said the woman  quite possibly vexed that she  had unguardedly betrayed a greater interest in his welfare than she might  always deem prudent   how now  ensign  hath the campaign ended with no  better trophy than this       the fellow is not a chief  nor  by his step and dull look  even a  warrior  but he was  nevertheless  a lurker nigh the settlements  and it  was thought prudent to bring him in   returned the husband  addressing  himself to content  while he answered the salutation of his wife with a  sufficiently brief nod   my own scouting hath brought nothing to light   but my brother ring hath fallen on the trail of him that is here present   and it is not a little that we are puzzled in probing  as the good doctor  ergot calleth it  into the meaning of his errand       of what tribe may the savage be       there hath been discussion among us  on that matter   returned dudley   with an oblique glance of the eye towards the physician   some have said  he is a narragansett  while others think he cometh of a stock still  further east       in giving that opinion  i spoke merely of his secondary or acquired  habits   interrupted ergot   for  having reference to his original  the  man is assuredly a white       a white   repeated all around him      beyond a cavil  as may be seen by divers particulars in his outward  conformation  viz  in the shape of the head  the muscles of the arms and  of the legs  the air and gait  besides sundry other signs  that are  familiar to men who have made the physical peculiarities of the two races  their study       one of which is this   continued dudley  throwing up the robe of the  captive  and giving his companions the ocular evidence which had so  satisfactorily removed all his own doubts   though the color of the skin  may not be proof positive  like that named by our neighbor ergot  it is  still something  in helping a man of little learning to make up an opinion  in such a matter       madam   exclaimed faith so suddenly as to cause her she addressed to  start   for the sake of heaven s mercy  let thy maidens bring soap and  water  that the face of this man may be cleansed of its paint       what foolishness is thy brain set upon   rejoined the ensign  who had  latterly affected some of that superior gravity which might be supposed to  belong to his official station   we are not now under the roof of the  whip poor will  wife of mine  but in the presence of those who need none  of thy suggestions to give proper forms to an examination of office      faith heeded no reproof  instead of waiting for others to perform that  which she had desired  she applied herself to the task  with a dexterity  that had been acquired by long practice  and a zeal that seemed awakened  by some extraordinary emotion  in a minute  the colors had disappeared  from the features of the captive  and  though deeply tanned by exposure to  an american sun and to sultry winds  his face was unequivocally that of  one who owed his origin to an european ancestry  the movements of the  eager woman were watched with curious interest by all present  and when  the short task was ended  a murmur of surprise broke simultaneously from  every lip      there is meaning in this masquerade   observed content  who had long and  intently studied the dull and ungainly countenance that was exposed to his  scrutiny by the operation   i have heard of christian men who have sold  themselves to gain  and who  forgetting religion and the love of their  race  have been known to league with the savage in order to pursue rapine  in the settlements  this wretch hath the subtlety of one of the french of  the canadas in his eye       away  away   cried faith  forcing herself in front of the speaker  and   by placing her two hands on the shaven crown of the prisoner  forming a  sort of shade to his features   away with all folly  about the frenchers  and wicked leagues  this is no plotting miscreant  but a stricken  innocent  whittal  my brother whittal  dost know me      the tears rolled down the cheeks of the wayward woman  as she gazed into  the face of her witless relative  whose eye lighted with one of its  occasional gleamings of intelligence  and who indulged in a low  vacant  laugh  ere he answered her earnest interrogatory      some speak like men from over sea   he said   and some speak like men of  the woods  is there such a thing as bear s meat  or a mouthful of hommony   in the wigwam      had the voice of one  long known to be in the grave  broken on the ears  of the family  it would scarcely have produced a deeper sensation  or  have quickened the blood more violently about their hearts  than this  sudden and utterly unexpected discovery of the character of their  captive  wonder and awe held them mute for a time  and then ruth was seen  standing before the restored wanderer her hands clasped in the attitude  of petition  her eye contracted and imploring  and her whole person  expressive of the suspense and excitement which had roused her  long latent emotions to agony      tell me   said a thrilling voice  that might have quickened the intellect  of one even duller than the man addressed   as thou hast pity in thy  heart  tell me  if my babe yet live        tis a good babe   returned the other  and then laughing again  in his  own vacant and unmeaning manner  he bent his eyes with a species of  stupid wonder on faith  in whose appearance there was far less change   than in the speaking but wasted countenance of her who stood immediately  before him      give leave  dearest madam   interposed the sister   i know the nature of  the boy  and could ever do more with him than any other      but this request was useless  the system of the mother  in its present  state of excitement  was unequal to further effort  sinking into the  watchful arms of content  she was borne away  and  for a minute  the  anxious interest of the handmaidens left none but the men on the piazza      whittal  my old playfellow  whittal ring   said the son of content   advancing with a humid eye to take the hand of the prisoner   hast  forgotten  man  the companion of thy early days  it is young mark  heathcote that speaks      the other looked up into his countenance  for a moment  with a reviving  recollection  but shaking his head  he drew back in marked displeasure   muttering loud enough to be heard       what a false liar is a pale face  here is one of the tall rogues  wishing  to pass for a loping boy      what more he uttered his auditors never knew  for he instantly changed his  language to some dialect of an indian tribe      the mind of the unhappy youth hath even been more blunted  by exposure  and the usages of a savage life  than by nature   said content  who with  most of the others had been recalled  by his interest in the examination   to the scene they had momentarily quitted   let the sister deal tenderly  with the lad  and  in heaven s time  shall we learn the truth      the deep feeling of the father clothed his words with authority  the  eager group gave place  and something like the solemnity of an official  examination succeeded to the irregular and hurried interrogatories  which  had first broken on the dull intellect of the recovered wanderer     the dependants took their stations  in a circle around the chair of the  puritan  by whose side was placed content  while faith induced her brother  to be seated on the step of the piazza  in a manner that all might hear   the attention of the brother  himself  was drawn from the formality of the  arrangement  by placing food in his hands      and now  whittal  i would know   commenced the ready woman  when a  deep silence denoted the attention of the auditors   i would know  if  thou rememberest the day i clad thee in garments of boughten cloth   from over sea  and how fond thou wast of being seen among the kine in  colors so gay      the young man looked up in her face  as if the tones of her voice gave him  pleasure  but  instead of making any reply  he preferred to munch the  bread with which she had endeavored to lure him back to their ancient  confidence      surely  boy  thou canst not so soon have forgotten the gift i bought   with the hard earnings of a wheel that turned at night  the tail of  yon peacock is not finer than thou then wast  but i will make thee  such another garment  that thou mayst go with the trainers to their  weekly muster      the youth dropped the robe of skin that covered the upper part of his  body  and making a forward gesture  with the gravity of an indian  he  answered       whittal is a warrior on his path  he has no time for the talk of  the women       now  brother  thou forgettest the manner in which i was wont to feed thy  hunger  as the frost pinched thee  in the cold mornings  and at the hour  when the kine needed thy care  else thou wouldst not call me woman       hast ever been on the trail of a pequot  know st how to whoop  among the men       what is an indian whoop  to the bleating of thy flocks  or the bellowing  of cattle in the bushes  thou rememberest the sound of the bells  as they  tinkled among the second growth of an evening      the ancient herdsman turned his head  and seemed to lend his attention  as  a dog listens to an approaching footstep  but the gleam of recollection  was quickly lost  in the next moment  he yielded to the more positive  and  possibly more urgent  demands of his appetite      then hast thou lost the use of ears  else thou wouldst not say that thou  forgettest the sound of the bells       didst ever hear a wolf howl   exclaimed the other   that s a sound for a  hunter  i saw the great chief strike the striped panther  when the boldest  warrior of the tribe grew white as a craven pale face at his leaps       talk not to me of your ravenous beasts and great chiefs  but rather  let us think of the days when we were young  and when thou hadst  delight in the sports of a christian childhood  hast forgotten   whittal  how our mother used to give us leave to pass the idle time in  games among the snow       nipset hath a mother in her wigwam  but he asketh no leave to go on the  hunt  he is a man the next snow  he will be a warrior       silly boy  this is some treachery of the savage by which he has bound thy  weakness with the fetters of his craftiness  thy mother  whittal  was a  woman of christian belief  and one of a white race  and a kind and  mourning mother was she over thy feeble mindedness  dost not remember   unthankful of heart  how she nursed thy sickly hours in boyhood  and how  she administered to all thy bodily wants  who was it that fed thee when  a hungered or who had compassion on thy waywardness  when others tired of  thy idle deeds  or grew impatient of thy weakness      the brother looked  for an instant  at the flushed features of the  speaker  as if glimmerings of some faintly distinguished scenes crossed  the visions of his mind  but the animal still predominated  and he  continued to feed his hunger      this exceedeth human endurance   exclaimed the excited faith   look into  this eye  weak one  and say if thou knowest her who supplied the place of  that mother whom thou refusest to remember  she who hath toiled for thy  comfort  and who hath never refused to listen to all thy plaints  and to  soften all thy sufferings  look at this eye  and speak  dost know me       certain   returned the other  laughing with a half intelligent expression  of recognition    tis a woman of the pale faces  and i warrant me  one  that will never be satisfied till she hath all the furs of the americas on  her back  and all the venison of the woods in her kitchen  didst ever hear  the tradition  how that wicked race got into the hunting grounds  and  robbed the warriors of the country      the disappointment of faith had made her too impatient to lend a pleased  attention to this tale  but  at that moment  a form appeared at her side   and by a quiet and commanding gesture directed her to humor the temper of  the wanderer     it was ruth  in whose pale cheek and anxious eye  all the intenseness of a  mother s longings might be traced  in its most touching aspect  though so  lately helpless and sinking beneath her emotions  the sacred feelings  which now sustained her seemed to supply the place of all other aid  and  as she glided past the listening circle  even content himself had not  believed it necessary to offer succor  or to interpose with remonstrance   her quiet  meaning gesture seemed to say   proceed  and show all  indulgence to the weakness of the young man   the rising discontent of  faith  was checked by habitual reverence  and she prepared to obey      and what say the silly traditions of which you speak   she added  ere the  current of his dull ideas had time to change its direction       tis spoken by the old men in the villages  and what is there said is  gospel true  you see all around you  land that is covered with hill and  valley  and which once bore wood  without the fear of the axe  and over  which game was spread with a bountiful hand  there are runners and hunters  in our tribe who have been on a straight path towards the setting sun   until their legs were weary and their eyes could not see the clouds that  hang over the salt lake  and yet they say   tis everywhere beautiful as  yonder green mountain  tall trees and shady woods rivers and lakes filled  with fish  and deer and beaver plentiful as the sands on the sea shore   all this land and water the great spirit gave to men of red skins  for  them he loved  since they spoke truth in their tribes  were true to their  friends  hated their enemies  and knew how to take scalps  now  a thousand  snows had come and melted  since this gift was made   continued whittal   who spoke with the air of one charged with the narration of a grave  tradition  though he probably did no more than relate what many  repetitions had rendered familiar to his inactive mind   and yet none but  red skins were seen to hunt the moose  or to go on the war path  then the  great spirit grew angry  he hid his face from his children  because they  quarrelled among themselves  big canoes came out of the rising sun  and  brought a hungry and wicked people into the land  at first  the strangers  spoke soft and complaining like women  they begged room for a few wigwams   and said if the warriors would give them ground to plant  they would ask  their god to look upon the red men  but when they grew strong  they forgot  their words and made liars of themselves  oh  they are wicked knaves  a  pale face is a panther  when a hungered  you can hear him whining in the  bushes like a strayed infant  but when you come within his leap  beware of  tooth and claw       this evil minded race  then  robbed the red warriors of their land       certain  they spoke like sick women  till they grew strong  and then they  out devilled the pequots themselves in wickedness  feeding the warriors  with their burning milk  and slaying with blazing inventions  that they  made out of the yellow meal       and the pequods  was their great warrior dead  before the coming of the  men from over sea       you are a woman that has never heard a tradition  or you would know  better  a pequot is a weak and crawling cub       and thou  thou art then a narragansett       don t i look like a man       i had mistaken thee for one of our nearer neighbors  the mohegan  pequods       the mohicans are basket makers for the yengeese  but the narragansett  goes leaping through the woods  like a wolf on the trail of the deer       all this is quite in reason  and now thou pointest to its justice  i  cannot fail but see it  but we have curiosity to know more of the great  tribe  hast ever heard of one of thy people  whittal  known as  miantonimoh   tis a chief of some renown      the witless youth had continued to eat  at intervals  but  on hearing this  question  he seemed suddenly to forget his appetite  for a moment he  looked down  and then he answered slowly and not without solemnity       a man cannot live for ever       what   said faith  motioning to her deeply interested auditors to  restrain their impatience   has he quitted his people  and thou lived  with him  whittal  ere he came to his end       he never looked on nipset  nor nipset on him       i know nought of this nipset  tell me of the great miantonimoh       dost need to hear twice  the sachem is gone to the far land  and nipset  will be a warrior when the next snow comes      disappointment threw a cloud on every countenance  and the beam of hope   which had been kindling in the eye of ruth  changed to the former painful  expression of deep inward suffering  but faith still managed to repress  all speech among those who listened  continuing the examination  after a  short delay that her vexation rendered unavoidable      i had thought that miantonimoh was still a warrior in his tribe   she  said   in what battle did he fall       mohican uncas did that wicked deed  the pale men gave him great riches to  murder the sachem       thou speakest of the father  but there was another miantonimoh  he who in  boyhood dwelt among the people of white blood      whittal listened attentively  and after seeming to rally his thoughts  he  shook his head  saying before he again began to eat       there never was but one of the name  and there never will be another  two  eagles do not build their nests in the same tree       thou sayest truly   continued faith  well knowing that to dispute the  information of her brother  was in effect to close his mouth   now tell  me of conanchet  the present narragansett sachem  he who hath leagued with  metacom  and hath of late been driven from his fastness near the sea  doth  he yet live      the expression of the brother s countenance underwent another change  in  place of the childish importance with which he had hitherto replied to the  questions of his sister  a look of overreaching cunning gathered about his  dull eye  the organ glanced slowly and cautiously around him  as if its  owner expected to detect some visible sign of those covert intentions he  so evidently distrusted  instead of answering  the wanderer continued his  meal  though less like one who had need of sustenance  than one resolved  to make no communications which might prove dangerous  this change was not  unobserved by faith  or by any of those who so intently watched the means  by which she had been endeavoring to thread the confused ideas of one so  dull  and yet who at need seemed so practised in savage artifice  she  prudently altered her manner of interrogating  by endeavoring to lead his  thoughts to other matters      i warrant me   continued the sister   that thou now beginnest to call to  mind the times when thou led st the cattle among the bushes  and how thou  wert wont to call on faith to give thee food  when a weary with threading  the woods in quest of the kine  hast ever been assailed by the  narragansetts thyself  whittal  when dwelling in the house of a  pale face      the brother ceased eating  again he appeared to muse as intently as was  possible  for one of his circumscribed intellects  but shaking his head in  the negative  he silently resumed the grateful office of mastication      what  hast come to be a warrior  and never known a scalp taken  or seen  a fire lighted in the roof of a wigwam      whittal laid down the food  and turned to his sister  his face was  teeming with a wild and fierce meaning  and he indulged in a low but  triumphant laugh  when this exhibition of satisfaction was over  he  consented to reply      certain   he said   we went on a path  in the night  against the lying  yengeese  and no burning of the woods ever scorched the  arth as we  blackened their fields  all their proud housen were turned into piles  of coals       and where and when did you this act of brave vengeance       they called the place after the bird of night as if an indian name could  save them from an indian massacre       ha   tis of the wish ton wish thou speakest but thou wast a sufferer  and  not an actor  brother in that heartless burning       thou liest like a wicked woman of the pale faces  as thou art  nipset was  only a boy on that path  but he went with his people  i tell thee  we  singed the very  arth with our brands  and not a head of them all ever  rose again from the ashes      notwithstanding her great self command  and the object that was constantly  before the mind of faith  she shuddered at the fierce pleasure with which  her brother pronounced the extent of the vengeance  that  in his imaginary  character  he believed he had taken on his enemies  still cautious not to  destroy an illusion which might aid her  in the so long defeated and  so anxiously desired discovery  the woman repressed her horror  and  continued       true  yet some were spared  surely the warriors carried prisoners back to  their village  thou didst not slay all       all       nay  thou speakest now of the miserables who were wrapt in the  blazing block  but  but some  without  might have fallen into thy  hands  ere the assailed sought shelter in the tower  surely  surely  thou didst not kill all      the hard breathing of ruth caught the ear of whittal  and for a moment he  turned to regard her countenance in dull wonder  but again shaking his  head  he answered in a low  positive tone   all   ay  to the screeching  women and crying babes       surely there is a child  i would say there is a woman  in thy tribe  of  fairer skin and of form different from most of thy people  was not such an  one led a captive from the burning of the wish ton wish       dost think the deer will live with the wolf  or hast ever found the  cowardly pigeon in the nest of the hawk       nay  thou art of different color thyself  whittal  and it well may be   thou art not alone      the youth regarded his sister a moment with marked displeasure  and then   on turning to eat  he muttered   there is as much fire in snow  as truth  in a lying yengeese       this examination must close   said content  with a heavy sigh   at  another hour  we may hope to push the matter to some more fortunate  result  but  yonder cometh one charged with especial service from the  towns below  as would seem by the fact that he disregardeth the holiness  of the day no less than by the earnest manner in which he is journeying      as the individual named was visible to all who chose to look in the  direction of the hamlet  his sudden appearance caused a general  interruption to the interest which had been so strongly awakened on a  subject that was familiar to every resident in the valley     the early hour  the gait at which the stranger urged his horse  the manner  in which he passed the open and inviting door of the whip poor will   proclaimed him a messenger  who probably bore some communication of  importance from the government of the colony to the younger heathcote  who  filled the highest station of official authority in that distant  settlement  observations to this purport had passed from mouth to mouth   and curiosity was actively alive  by the time the horseman rode into the  court  there he dismounted  and  covered with the dust of the road  he  presented himself  with the air of one who had passed the night in the  saddle  before the man he sought      i have orders for captain content heathcote   said the messenger   saluting all around him with the usual grave but studied courtesy of the  people to whom he belonged      he is here to receive and to obey   was the answer     the traveller wore a little of that mysteriousness that is so grateful to  certain minds  which  from inability to command respect in any other  manner  are fond of making secrets of matters that might as well be  revealed  in obedience to this feeling  he expressed a desire that his  communications might be made apart  content quietly motioned for him to  follow  leading the way into an inner apartment of the house  as a new  direction was given by this interruption  to the thoughts of the  spectators of the foregoing scene  we shall also take the opportunity to  digress  in order to lay before the reader some general facts that may be  necessary to the connexion of the subsequent parts of the legend           chapter xxi            be certain what you do  sir  lest your justice    prove violence        winter s tale       the designs of the celebrated metacom had been betrayed to the colonists   by the treachery of a subordinate warrior  named sausaman  the punishment  of this treason led to inquiries  which terminated in accusations against  the great sachem of the wampanoags  scorning to vindicate himself before  enemies that he hated  and perhaps distrusting their clemency  metacom no  longer endeavored to cloak his proceedings  but  throwing aside the  emblems of peace he openly appeared with an armed hand     the tragedy had commenced about a year before the period at which the tale  has now arrived  a scene  not unlike that detailed in the foregoing pages   took place  the brand  the knife  and the tomahawk  doing their work of  destruction  without pity and without remorse  but  unlike the inroad of  the wish ton wish  this expedition was immediately followed by others   until the whole of new england was engaged in the celebrated war  to which  we have before referred     the entire white population of the colonies of new england had shortly  before been estimated at one hundred and twenty thousand souls  of this  number  it was thought that sixteen thousand men were capable of bearing  arms  had time been given for the maturity of the plans of metacom  he  might have readily assembled bands of warriors who  aided by their  familiarity with the woods  and accustomed to the privations of such a  warfare  would have threatened serious danger to the growing strength of  the whites  but the ordinary and selfish feelings of man were as active   among these wild tribes  as they are known to be in more artificial  communities  the indefatigable metacom  like that indian hero of our own  times  tecumthe  had passed years in endeavoring to appease ancient  enmities and to lull jealousies  in order that all of red blood might  unite in crushing a foe that promised  should he be longer undisturbed in  his march to power  soon to be too formidable for their united efforts to  subdue  the premature explosion in some measure averted the danger  it  gave the english time to strike several severe blows against the tribe of  their great enemy  before his allies had determined to make common cause  in his design  the summer and autumn of      had been passed in active  hostilities between the english and wampanoags  without openly drawing any  other nation into the contest  some of the pequots  with their dependent  tribes  even took sides with the whites  and we read of the mohegans being  actively employed in harassing the sachem  on his well known retreat from  that neck of land  where he had been hemmed in by the english  with the  expectation that he might be starved into submission     the warfare of the first summer was  as might be expected  attended by  various degrees of success  fortune quite as often favoring the red men   in their desultory attempts at annoyance  as their more disciplined  enemies  instead of confining his operations to his own circumscribed and  easily environed districts  metacom had led his warriors to the distant  settlements on the connecticut  and it was during the operations of this  season  that several of the towns on that river were first assailed and  laid in ashes  active hostilities had in some measure ceased  between the  wampanoags and the english  with the cold weather  most of the troops  retiring to their homes  while the indians apparently paused to take  breath for their final effort     it was  however  previously to this cessation of activity  that the  commissioners of the united colonies  as they were called  met to devise  the means of a concerted resistance  unlike their former dangers from the  same quarter  it was manifest  by the manner in which a hostile feeling  was spreading around their whole frontier  that a leading spirit had given  as much of unity and design to the movements of the foe  as could probably  ever be created among a people so separated by distance and so divided in  communities  right or wrong  the colonists gravely decided that the war on  their part was just  great preparations were therefore made to carry it  on  the ensuing summer  in a manner more suited to their means  and to the  absolute necessities of their situation  it was in consequence of the  arrangements made for bringing a portion of the inhabitants of the colony  of connecticut into the field  that we find the principal characters of  our legend in the warlike guise in which they have just been re introduced  to the reader     although the narragansetts had not at first been openly implicated in the  attacks on the colonists  facts soon came to the knowledge of the latter   which left no doubt of the state of feeling in that nation  many of their  young men were discovered among the followers of metacom  and arms taken  from whites  who had been slain in the different encounters  were also  seen in their villages  one of the first measures of the commissioners   therefore  was to anticipate more serious opposition  by directing an  overwhelming force against this people  the party collected on that  occasion was probably the largest military body which the english  at  that early day  had ever assembled in their colonies  it consisted of a  thousand men  of whom no inconsiderable number was cavalry  a species of  troops that  as all subsequent experience has shown  is admirably adapted  to operations against so active and so subtle a foe     the attack was made in the depth of winter  and it proved fearfully  destructive to the assailed  the defence of conanchet  the young sachem of  the narragansetts  was every way worthy of his high character for courage  and mental resources  nor was the victory gained without serious loss to  the colonists  the native chief had collected his warriors  and taken post  on a small area of firm land  that was situated in the centre of a densely  wooded swamp  and the preparations for resistance betrayed a singular  familiarity with the military expedients of a white man  there had been a  palisadoed breast work  a species of redoubt  and a regular block house   to overcome  ere the colonists could penetrate into the fortified village  itself  the first attempts were unsuccessful  the indians having repulsed  their enemies with loss  but better arms and greater concert finally  prevailed  though not without a struggle that lasted for many hours  and  not until the defendants were  in truth  nearly surrounded     the events of that memorable day made a deep impression on the minds of  men who were rarely excited by any incidents of a great and moving  character  it was still the subject of earnest and not unfrequently of  melancholy discourse  around the fire sides of the colonists  nor was the  victory achieved without accompaniments which  however unavoidable they  might have been  had a tendency to raise doubts in the minds of  conscientious religionists concerning the lawfulness of their cause  it is  said that a village of six hundred cabins was burnt and that hundreds of  dead and wounded were consumed in the conflagration  a thousand warriors  were thought to have lost their lives in this affair  and it was believed  that the power of the nation was broken for ever  the sufferers among the  colonists themselves were numerous  and mourning came into a vast many  families  with the tidings of victory     in this expedition most of the men of the wish ton wish had been  conspicuous actors  under the orders of content  they had not escaped with  impunity  but it was confidently hoped that their courage was to meet its  reward in a long continuance of peace  which was the more desirable on  account of their remote and exposed situation     in the mean time  the narragansetts were far from being subdued   throughout the whole continuance of the inclement season  they had caused  alarms on the frontiers  and  in one or two instances their renowned  sachem had taken signal vengeance for the dire affair in which his people  had so heavily suffered  as the spring advanced  the inroads became still  more frequent  and the appearances of danger so far increased as to  require a new call on the colonists to arm  the messenger  introduced in  the last chapter  was charged with matter that had a reference to the  events of this war  and it was with an especial communication of great  urgency that he had now demanded his secret audience with the leader of  the military force of the valley      thou hast affairs of moment to deal with  captain heathcote   said the  hard riding traveller  when he found himself alone with content   the  orders of his honor are to spare neither whip nor spur until the chief men  of the borders shall be warned of the actual situation of the colony       hath aught of moving interest occurred  that his honor deemeth there is  necessity for unusual watchfulness  we had hoped that the prayers of the  pious were not in vain  and that a time of quiet was about to succeed to  that violence  of which  bounden by our social covenants  we have  unhappily been unwilling spectators  the bloody assault of pettyquamscott  hath exercised our minds severely  nay  it hath even raised doubts of the  lawfulness of some of our deeds       thou hast a commendable spirit of forgiveness captain heathcote  or thy  memory would extend to other scenes than those which bear relation to the  punishment of an enemy so remorseless  it is said on the river  that the  valley of wish ton wish hath been visited by the savage in its day  and  men speak freely of the wrongs suffered by its owners on that pitiless  occasion       the truth may not be denied  even that good should come thereof  it is  certain that much suffering was inflicted on me and on mine  by the  inroad of which you speak  nevertheless we have ever striven to consider  it as a merciful chastisement inflicted for manifold sins  rather than as  a subject that might be remembered  in order to stimulate passions that   in all reason as in all charity  should slumber as much as a weak nature  will allow       this is well  captain heathcote  and in exceeding conformity with the  most received doctrines   returned the stranger  slightly gaping  either  from want of rest the previous night  or from disinclination to so grave a  subject   but it hath little connexion with present duties  my charge  beareth especial concern with the further destruction of the indians   rather than to any inward searchings into the condition of our own mental  misgivings  concerning any right it may be thought proper to question   that hath a reference to the duty of self protection  there is no unworthy  dweller in the connecticut colony  sir  that hath endeavored more to  cultivate a tender conscience  than the wretched sinner who standeth  before you  for i have the exceeding happiness to sit under the  outpourings of a spirit that hath few mortal superiors in the matter of  precious gifts  i now speak of dr  calvin pope  a most worthy and  soul quieting divine  one who spareth not the goad when the conscience  needeth pricking  nor hesitateth to dispense consolation to him who seeth  his fallen estate  and one that never faileth to deal with charity  and  humbleness of spirit  and forbearance with the failings of friends  and  forgiveness of enemies  as the chiefest signs of a renovated moral  existence  and  therefore  there can be but little reason to distrust the  spiritual rightfulness of all that listen to the riches of his discourse   but when it cometh to be question of life or death  a matter of dominion  and possession of these fair lands  that the lord hath given  why  sir   then i say that  like the israelites dealing with the sinful occupants of  canaan  it behoveth us to be true to each other  and to look upon the  heathen with a distrustful eye       there may be reason in that thou utterest   observed content   sorrowfully   still it is lawful to mourn even the necessity which  conduceth to all this strife  i had hoped that they who direct the  councils of the colony might have resorted to less violent means of  persuasion  to lead the savage back to reason  than that which cometh from  the armed hand  of what nature is thy especial errand       of deep urgency  sir  as will be seen in the narration   returned the  other  dropping his voice like one habitually given to the dramatic part  of diplomacy  however unskilful he might have been in its more  intellectual accomplishments   thou wast in the pettyquamscott scourging   and need not be reminded of the manner in which the lord dealt with our  enemies on that favor dispensing day  but it may not be known to one so  remote from the stirring and daily transactions of christendom  in what  manner the savage hath taken the chastisement  the restless and still  unconquered conanchet hath deserted his towns and taken refuge in the open  woods  where it exceedeth the skill and usage of our civilized men of war   to discover  at all times the position and force of their enemies  the  consequences may be easily conjectured  the savage hath broken in upon   and laid waste  in whole or in part  firstly  lancaster  on the tenth    counting on his fingers   when many were led into captivity  secondly   marlborough  on the twentieth  on the thirteenth  ultimo  groton  warwick   on the seventeenth  and rehoboth  chelmsford  andover  weymouth  and  divers other places  have been greatly sufferers  between the latter  period and the day when i quitted the abode of his honor  pierce of  scituate  a stout warrior  and one practised in the wiles of this nature  of warfare  hath been cut off with a whole company of followers  and  wadsworth and brockleband  men known and esteemed for courage and skill   have left their bones in the woods  sleeping in common among their  luckless followers       these are truly tidings to cause us to mourn over the abandoned condition  of our nature   said content  in whose meek mind there was no affectation  of regrets on such a subject   it is not easy to see in what manner the  evil may be arrested without again going forth to battle       such is the opinion of his honor  and of all who sit with him in council   for we have sufficient knowledge of the proceedings of the enemy  to be  sure that the master spirit of wickedness  in the person of him called  philip  is raging up and down the whole extent of the borders  awakening  the tribes to what he calleth the necessity of resisting further  aggression  and stirring up their vengeance  by divers subtle expedients  of malicious cunning       and what manner of proceeding hath been ordered  in so urgent a strait   by the wisdom of our rulers       firstly  there is a fast ordained  that we come to the duty as men  purified by mental struggle and deep self examination  secondly  it is  recommended that the congregations deal with more than wonted severity  with all backsliders and evil doers  in order that the towns may not  fall under the divine displeasure  as happened to them that dwelt in the  devoted cities of canaan  thirdly  it is determined to lend our feeble  aid to the ordering of providence  by calling forth the allotted number  of the trained bands  and  fourthly  it is contemplated to counteract  the seeds of vengeance  by setting a labor earning price on the heads of  our enemies       i accord with the three first of these expedients  as the known and  lawful resorts of christian men   said content   but the latter seemeth a  measure that needeth to be entertained with great wariness of manner  and  some distrust of purpose       fear not  since all suiting and economical discretion is active in the  minds of our rulers  who have pondered sagaciously on so grave a policy   it is not intended to offer more than half the reward that is held forth  by our more wealthy and elder sister of the bay  and there is some acute  question about the necessity of bidding at all for any of tender years   and now  captain heathcote  with the good leave of so respectable a  subject  i will proceed to lay before you the details of the number and  the nature of the force that it is hoped you will lead in person in the  ensuing campaign      as the result of that which followed will be seen in the course of the  legend  it is not necessary to accompany the messenger any further in his  communication  we shall therefore leave him and content busied with the  matter of their conference  and proceed to give some account of the other  personages connected with our subject     when interrupted  as already related  by the arrival of the stranger   faith had endeavored  by a new expedient  to elicit some evidences of a  more just remembrance from the dull mind of her brother  accompanied by  most of the dependants of the family  she had led him to the summit of  that hill which was now crowned with the foliage of a young and thrifty  orchard  and  placing him at the foot of the ruin  she tried to excite a  train of recollections that should lead to deeper impressions  and   possibly  by their aid  to a discovery of the important circumstance that  all so much longed to have explained     the experiment produced no happy result  the place  and indeed the whole  valley  had undergone so great a change  that one more liberally gifted  might have hesitated to believe them those that have been described in  our earlier pages  this rapid alteration of objects  which elsewhere know  so little change in a long course of ages  is a fact familiar to all who  reside in the newer districts of the union  it is caused by the rapid  improvements that are made in the first stages of a settlement  to fell  the forest alone  is to give an entirely new aspect to the view  and it  is far from easy to see in a village and in cultivated fields  however  recent the existence of the one or imperfect the other  any traces of a  spot that a short time before was known is the haunt of the wolf or the  refuge of the deer     the features  and more particularly the eye of his sister  had stirred  long dormant recollections in the mind of whittal ring  and though these  glimpses of the past were detached and indistinct  they had sufficed to  quicken that ancient confidence which was partially exhibited in their  opening conference  but it exceeded his feeble powers to recall objects  that would appeal to no very lively sympathies  and which had themselves  undergone so material alterations  still  the witless youth did not look  on the ruin entirely without some stirrings of his nature  although the  sward around its base was lively in the brightest verdure of early  summer  and the delicious odor of the wild clover saluted his senses   still there was that in the blackened and ragged walls  the position of  the tower  and the view of the surrounding hills  shorn as so much of  them now were  that evidently spoke to his earliest impressions  he  looked at the spot  as a hound gazes at a master who has been so long  lost as even to deaden his instinct  and at times  as his companions  endeavored to aid his faint images  it would seem as if memory were  likely to triumph  and all those deceptive opinions  which habit and  indian wiles had drawn over his dull mind  were about to vanish before  the light of reality  but the allurements of a life in which there was so  much of the freedom of nature mingled with the fascinating pleasures of  the chase and of the woods  were not to be dispossessed so readily  when  faith artfully led him back to those animal enjoyments of which he had  been so fond in boyhood  the fantasy of her brother seemed most to waver   but whenever it became apparent that the dignity of a warrior  and all  the more recent and far more alluring delights of his later life  were to  be abandoned ere his being could return into its former existence  his  dull faculties obstinately refused to lend themselves to a change that   in his case  would have been little short of that attributed to the  transmigration of souls     after an hour of anxious  and frequently  on the part of faith  of angry  efforts to extract some evidences of his recollection of the condition of  life to which he had once belonged  the attempt for the moment was  abandoned  at times  it seemed as if the woman were about to prevail  he  often called himself whittal  but he continued to insist that he was also  nipset  a man of the narragansetts  who had a mother in his wigwam  and  who had reason to believe that he should be numbered among the warriors of  his tribe  ere the fall of another snow     in the mean time  a very different scene was passing at the place where  the first examination had been held  and which had been immediately  deserted by most of the spectators  on the sudden arrival of the  messenger  but a solitary individual was seated at the spacious board   which had been provided alike for those who owned and presided over the  estate  and for their dependants to the very meanest  the individual who  remained had thrown himself into a seat  less with the air of him who  consults the demands of appetite  than of one whose thoughts were so  engrossing as to render him indifferent to the situation or employment of  his more corporeal part  his head rested on his arms  the latter  effectually concealing the face  as they were spread over the plain but  exquisitely neat table of cherry wood  which  by being placed at the side  of one of less costly material  was intended to form the only distinction  between the guests  as  in more ancient times and in other countries  the  salt was known to mark the difference in rank among those who partook of  the same feast      mark   said a timid voice at his elbow   thou art weary with this  night watching  and with the scouting on the hills  dost not think of  taking food before seeking thy rest       i sleep not   returned the youth  raising his head  and gently pushing  aside the basin of simple food that was offered by one whose eye looked  feelingly on his flushed features  and whose suffused cheek perhaps  betrayed there was secret consciousness that the glance was kinder than  maiden diffidence should allow   i sleep not  martha  nor doth it seem to  me  that i shall ever sleep again       thou frightest me by this wild and unhappy eye  hast suffered aught in  the march on the mountains       dost think one of my years and strength unable to bear the weariness of a  few hours  watching in the forest  the body is well  but the mind endureth  grievously       and wilt not say what causeth this vexation  thou knowest  mark  that  there are none in this dwelling  nay  i am certain  i might add in this  valley  that do not wish thee happiness        tis kind to say it  good martha  but  thou never hadst a sister        tis true  i am all of my race  and yet to me it seemeth that no tie of  blood could have been nearer than the love i bore to her who is lost       nor mother  thou never knew st what  tis to reverence a parent       and is not thy mother mine   answered a voice that was deeply melancholy   and yet so soft that it caused the young man to gaze intently at his  companion  for a moment  ere he again spoke      true  true   he said hurriedly   thou must and dost love her who hath  nursed thy infancy  and brought thee  with care and tenderness  to so fair  and happy a womanhood   the eye of martha grew brighter  and the color of  her healthful cheek deepened  as mark unconsciously uttered this  commendation of her appearance  but as she shrunk  with female  sensitiveness  from his observation  the change was unnoticed  and he  continued   thou seest that my mother is drooping  hourly  under this  sorrow for our little ruth  and who can say what may be the end of a grief  that endureth so long        tis true that there hath been reason to fear much in her behalf  but  of  late  hope hath gotten the better of apprehension  thou dost not well   nay  i am not assured thou dost not evil  to permit this discontent with  providence  because thy mother yieldeth to a little more than her usual  mourning  on account of the unexpected return of one so nearly connected  with her that we have lost        tis not that  girl   tis not that       if thou refusest to say what  tis that giveth thee this pain  i can do  little more than pity       listen  and i will say  it is now many years  as thou knowest  since the  savage mohawk  or narragansett  pequot  or wampanoag  broke in upon our  settlement  and did his vengeance  we were then children  martha  and  tis  as a child  that i have thought of that merciless burning  our little ruth  was  like thyself  a blooming infant of some seven or eight years  and  i  know not how the folly hath beset me  but it hath been ever as one of that  innocence and age  that i have continued to think of my sister       surely thou knowest that time cannot stay  the greater therefore is the  reason that we should be industrious to improve         tis what our duty teacheth  i tell thee  martha  that at night  when  dreams come over me  as they sometimes will  and i see our ruth wandering  in the forest  it is as a playful  laughing child  such as we knew her   and even while waking  do i fancy my sister at my knee  as she was wont to  stand when listening to those idle tales with which we lightened our  childhood       but we had our birth in the same year and month  dost think of me too   mark  as one of that childish age       of thee  that cannot well be  do i not see that thou art grown into the  condition of a woman  that thy little tresses of brown have become the  jet black and flowing hair that becomes thy years  and that thou hast the  stature  and  i say it not in idleness of speech  martha  for thou knowest  my tongue is no vain flatterer  but do i not see that thou hast grown into  all the excellence of a most comely maiden  but  tis not thus  or rather   twas not thus  with her we mourn  for till this hour have i ever pictured  my sister the little innocent we sported with  that gloomy night she was  snatched from our arms by the cruelty of the savage       and what hath changed this pleasing image of our ruth   asked his  companion  half covering her face to conceal the still deeper glow of  female gratification which had been kindled by the words just heard   i  often think of her as thou hast described  nor do i now see why we may not  still believe her  if she yet live  all that we could desire to see       that cannot be  the delusion is gone  and in its place a frightful truth  has visited me  here is whittal ring  whom we lost a boy  thou seest he is  returned a man  and a savage  no  no  my sister is no longer the child i  loved to think her  but one grown into the estate of womanhood       thou thinkest of her unkindly  while thou thinkest of others far less  endowed by nature with too much indulgence  for thou rememberest  mark   she was ever of more pleasing aspect than any that we knew       i know not that  i say not that  i think not that  but be she what  hardships and exposure may have made her  still must ruth heathcote be far  too good for an indian wigwam  oh   tis horrible to believe that she is  the bond woman  the servitor  the wife of a savage      martha recoiled  and an entire minute passed  during which she made no  reply  it was evident that the revolting idea for the first time crossed  her mind  and all the natural feelings of gratified and maiden pride  vanished before the genuine and pure sympathies of a female bosom      this cannot be   she at length murmured   it can never be  our ruth  must still remember the lessons taught her in infancy  she knoweth she  is born of christian lineage  of reputable name  of exalted hope  of  glorious promise       thou seest by the manner of whittal  who is of greater age  how little of  that taught  can withstand the wily savage       but whittal faileth of nature s gifts  he hath ever been below the rest  of men in understanding       and yet to what degree of indian cunning hath he already attained       but mark   rejoined his companion  timidly  as if  while she felt all its  force  she only consented to urge the argument in tenderness to the  harassed feelings of the brother   we are of equal years  that which hath  happened to me  may well have been the fortune of our ruth       dost mean that being unespoused thyself  or that having  at thy years   inclinations that are free  my sister may have escaped the bitter curse of  being the wife of a narragansett  or what is not less frightful  the slave  of his humors       truly  i mean little else than the former       and not the latter   continued the young man  with a quickness that  showed some sudden revolution in his thoughts   but though with opinions  that are decided  and with kindness awakened in behalf of one favored   thou hesitatest  martha  it is not like that a girl left in the fetters of  savage life would so long pause to think  even here in the settlements   all are not difficult of judgment as thou      the long lashes vibrated above the dark eyes of the maiden  and  for an  instant  it seemed as if she had no intention to reply  but looking  timidly aside  she answered in a voice so low  that her companion scarcely  gathered the meaning of that she uttered      i know not how i may have earned this false character among my friends    she said   for to me it ever seemeth that what i feel and think is but too  easily known       then is the smart gallant from the hartford town  who cometh and goeth so  often between this distant settlement and his father s house  better  assured of his success than i had thought  he will not journey the long  road much oftener  alone       i have angered thee  mark  or thou wouldst not speak with so cold an eye   to one who hath ever lived with thee in kindness       i do not speak in anger  for  twould be both unreasonable and unmanly to  deny all of thy sex right of choice  but yet it doth seem right  that   when taste is suited and judgment appeased  there should be little motive  for withholding speech       and wouldst thou have a maiden  of my years  in haste to believe that she  was sought  when haply it may be  that he of whom you speak is in quest of  thy society and friendship  rather than of my favor       then might he spare much labor and some bodily suffering  unless he finds  great pleasure in the saddle  for i know not a youth in the connecticut  colony  for whom i have smaller esteem  others may see matter of approval  in him  but  to me  he is of bold speech  ungainly air  and great  disagreeableness of discourse       i am happy that at last we find ourselves of one mind  for that  thou  say st of the youth  is much as i have long considered him       thou  thou thinkest of the gallant thus  then why dost listen to his  suit  i had believed thee a girl too honest  martha  to affect such  niceties of deception  with this opinion of his character  why not refuse  his company       can a maiden speak too hastily       and if here  and ready to ask thy favor  the answer would be          no   said the girl  raising her eyes for an instant  and bashfully  meeting the eager look of her companion  though she uttered the  monosyllable firmly     mark seemed bewildered  an entirely new and a novel idea took possession  of his brain  the change was apparent by his altering countenance and a  cheek that glowed like flame  what he might have said  most of our  readers over fifteen may presume  but  at that moment  the voices of  those who had accompanied whittal to the ruin were heard on their return   and martha glided away so silently as to leave him for a moment ignorant  of her absence           chapter xxii            oh  when amid the throngs of men    the heart grows sick of hollow mirth     how willingly we turn us  then     away from this cold earth     and look into thy azure breast     for seats of innocence and rest        bryant s  skies       the day was the sabbath  this religious festival  which is even now  observed in most of the states of the union with a strictness that is  little heeded in the rest of christendom  was then reverenced with a  severity suited to the austere habits of the colonists  the circumstance  that one should journey on such a day  had attracted the observation of  all in the hamlet  but  as the stranger had been seen to ride towards the  dwelling of the heathcotes  and the times were known to teem with more  than ordinary interests to the province  it was believed that he found his  justification in some apology of necessity  still  none ventured forth to  inquire into the motive of this extraordinary visit  at the end of an  hour  the horseman was seen to depart as he had arrived  seemingly urged  on by the calls of some pressing emergency  he had in truth proceeded  further with his tidings  though the lawfulness of discharging even this  imperious duty on the sabbath had been gravely considered in the councils  of those who had sent him  happily they had found  or thought they had  found  in some of the narratives of the sacred volume  a sufficient  precedent to bid their messenger proceed     in the mean time  the unusual excitement  which had been so unexpectedly  awakened in the dwelling of the heathcotes  began to subside in that quiet  which is in so beautiful accordance with the sacred character of the day   the sun rose bright and cloudless above the hills  every vapor of the past  night melting before his genial warmth into the invisible element  the  valley then lay in that species of holy calm which conveys so sweet and so  forcible an appeal to the heart  the world presented a picture of the  glorious handywork of him who seems to invite the gratitude and adoration  of his creatures  to the mind yet untainted  there is exquisite loveliness  and even godlike repose in such a scene  the universal stillness permits  the softest natural sounds to be heard  and the buzz of the bee  or the  wing of the humming bird  reaches the ear like the loud notes of a general  anthem  this temporary repose is full of meaning  it should teach how much  of the beauty of this world s enjoyments  how much of its peace  and even  how much of the comeliness of nature itself  is dependent on the spirit by  which we are actuated  when man reposes  all around him seems anxious to  contribute to his rest  and when he abandons the contentions of grosser  interests  to elevate his spirit  all living things appear to unite in  worship  although this apparent sympathy of nature may be less true than  imaginative  its lesson is not destroyed  since it sufficiently shows that  what man chooses to consider good in this world is good  and that most of  its strife and deformities proceed from his own perversity     the tenants of the valley of the wish ton wish were little wont to disturb  the quiet of the sabbath  their error lay in the other extreme  since they  impaired the charities of life by endeavoring to raise man altogether  above the weakness of his nature  they substituted the revolting aspect of  a sublimated austerity  for that gracious though regulated exterior  by  which all in the body may best illustrate their hopes or exhibit their  gratitude  the peculiar air of those of whom we write was generated by the  error of the times and of the country  though something of its singularly  rigid character might have been derived from the precepts and example of  the individual who had the direction of the spiritual interests of the  parish  as this person will have further connexion with the matter of the  legend  he shall be more familiarly introduced in its pages     the reverend meek wolfe was  in spirit  a rare combination of the humblest  self abasement and of fierce spiritual denunciation  like so many others  of his sacred calling in the colony he inhabited  he was not only the  descendant of a line of priests  but it was his greatest earthly hope that  he should also become the progenitor of a race in whom the ministry was to  be perpetuated as severely as if the regulated formula of the mosaic  dispensation were still in existence  he had been educated in the infant  college of harvard  an institution that the emigrants from england had the  wisdom and enterprise to found  within the first five and twenty years of  their colonial residence  here this scion of so pious and orthodox a stock  had abundantly qualified himself for the intellectual warfare of his  future life  by regarding one set of opinions so steadily  as to leave  little reason to apprehend he would ever abandon the most trifling of the  outworks of his faith  no citadel ever presented a more hopeless curtain  to the besieger  than did the mind of this zealot to the efforts of  conviction  for on the side of his opponents  he contrived that every  avenue should be closed by a wall blank as indomitable obstinacy could  oppose  he appeared to think that all the minor conditions of argument and  reason had been disposed of by his ancestors  and that it only remained  for him to strengthen the many defences of his subject  and  now and then   to scatter by a fierce sortie the doctrinal skirmishers who might  occasionally approach his parish  there was a remarkable singleness of  mind in this religionist  which  while it in some measure rendered even  his bigotry respectable  greatly aided in clearing the knotty subject   with which he dealt  of much embarrassing matter  in his eyes  the strait  and narrow path would hold but few besides his own flock  he admitted some  fortuitous exceptions  in one or two of the nearest parishes  with whose  clergymen he was in the habit of exchanging pulpits  and perhaps  here and  there  in a saint of the other hemisphere  or of the more distant towns of  the colonies  the brightness of whose faith was something aided  in his  eyes  by distance  as this opake globe of ours is thought to appear a ball  of light to those who inhabit its satellite  in short  there was an  admixture of seeming charity with an exclusiveness of hope  an unweariness  of exertion with a coolness of exterior  a disregard of self with the most  complaisant security  and an uncomplaining submission to temporal evils  with the loftiest spiritual pretensions  that in some measure rendered him  a man as difficult to comprehend as to describe     at an early hour in the forenoon  a little bell  that was suspended in an  awkward belfry perched on the roof of the meeting house  began to summon  the congregation to the place of worship  the call was promptly obeyed   and ere the first notes had reached the echoes of the hills  the wide and  grassy street was covered with family groups  all taking the same  direction  foremost in each little party walked the austere father   perhaps bearing on his arm a suckled infant  or some child yet too young  to sustain its own weight  while at a decent distance followed the equally  grave matron  casting oblique and severe glances at the little troop  around her  in whom acquired habits had yet some conquests to obtain over  the lighter impulses of vanity  where there was no child to need support   or where the mother chose to assume the office of bearing her infant in  person  the man was seen to carry one of the heavy muskets of the day  and  when his arms were otherwise employed  the stoutest of his boys served in  the capacity of armor bearer  but in no instance was this needful  precaution neglected  the state of the province and the character of the  enemy requiring that vigilance should mingle even with their devotions   there was no loitering on the path  no light and worldly discourse by the  way  nor even any salutations  other than those grave and serious  recognitions by hat and eye  which usage tolerated as the utmost limit of  courtesy on the weekly festival     when the bell changed its tone  meek appeared from the gate of the  fortified house  where he resided  in quality of castellan  on account of  its public character  its additional security  and the circumstance that  his studious habits  permitted him to discharge the trust with less waste  of manual labor than it would cost the village were the responsible  office confided to one of more active habits  his consort followed  but  at even a greater distance than that taken by the wives of other men  as  if she felt the awful necessity of averting even the remotest possibility  of scandal from one of so sacred a profession  nine offspring of various  ages  and one female assistant  of years too tender to be a wife herself   composed the household of the divine  and it was a proof of the  salubrious air of the valley that all were present  since nothing but  illness was ever deemed a sufficient excuse for absence from the common  worship  as this little flock issued from the palisadoes  a female  in  whose pale cheek the effects of recent illness might yet be traced  held  open the gate for the entrance of reuben king  and a stout youth  who  bore the prolific consort of the former  with her bounteous gift  into  the citadel of the village  a place of refuge that nothing but the  undaunted resolution of the woman prevented her from occupying before   since more than half of the children of the valley had first seen the  light within the security of its defences     the family of meek preceded him into the temple  and when the feet of the  minister himself crossed its threshold  there was no human form visible  without its walls  the bell ceased its monotonous and mournful note  and  the tall  gaunt form of the divine moved through the narrow aisle to its  usual post  with the air of one who had already more than half rejected  the burthen of bodily encumbrance  a searching and stern glance was thrown  around  as if he possessed an instinctive power to detect all delinquents   and then seating himself  the deep stillness  that always preceded the  exercises  reigned in the place     when the divine next showed his austere countenance to his expecting  people  its meaning was expressive rather of some matter of worldly  import  than of that absence of carnal interest with which he usually  strove to draw near to his creator in prayer      captain content heathcote   he said with grave severity  after permitting  a short pause to awaken reverence   there has one ridden through this  valley on the lord s day  making thy habitation his halting place  hath  the traveller warranty for this disrespect of the sabbath  and canst thou  find sufficient reason in his motive  for permitting the stranger within  thy gates to neglect the solemn ordinance delivered on the mount       he rideth on especial commission   answered    content  who had respectfully arisen  when thus addressed by name   for  matter of grave interest to the well being of the colony is contained in  the subject of his errand       there is nought more deeply connected with the well being of man  whether  resident in this colony or in more lofty empires  than reverence to god s  declared will   returned meek  but half appeased by the apology   it would  have been expedient for one  who  in common  not only setteth so good an  example himself  but who is also charged with the mantle of authority  to  have looked with distrust into the pretences of a necessity that may be  only seeming       the motive shall be declared to the people  at a fitting moment  but it  hath seemed more wise to retain the substance of the horseman s errand   until worship hath been offered  without the alloy of temporal concerns       therein hast thou acted discreetly  for a divided mind giveth but little  joy above  i hope there is equal reason why all of thy household are not  with thee in the temple      notwithstanding the usual self command of content  he did not revert to  this subject without emotion  casting a subdued glance at the empty seat  where she whom he so much loved was wont to worship at his side  he said   in a voice that evidently struggled to maintain its customary  equanimity   there has been powerful interest awakened beneath my roof  this day  and it may be that the duty of the sabbath has been overlooked  by minds so exercised  if we have therein sinned  i hope he that looketh  kindly on the penitent will forgive  she of whom thou speakest  hath been  shaken by the violence of griefs renewed  though willing in spirit  a  feeble and sinking frame is not equal to support the fatigue of appearing  here  even though it be the house of god      this extraordinary exercise of pastoral authority was uninterrupted   even by the breathings of the congregation  any incident of an unusual  character had attraction for the inhabitants of a village so remote  but  here was deep  domestic interest  connected with breach of usage and  indeed of law and all heightened by that secret influence that leads us  to listen  with singular satisfaction  to those emotions in others   which it is believed to be natural to wish to conceal  not a syllable  that fell from the lips of the divine  or of content  not a deep tone of  severity in the former  nor a struggling accent of the latter  escaped  the dullest ear in that assembly  notwithstanding the grave and  regulated air that was common to all  it is needless to say there was  pleasure in the little interruption of this scene  which  however  was  far from being extraordinary in a community where it was not only  believed that spiritual authority might extend itself to the most  familiar practices  but where few domestic interests were deemed so  exclusive  or individual feelings considered so sacred  that a very  large proportion of the whole neighborhood might not claim a right to  participate largely in both  the reverend mr  wolfe was appeased by the  explanation  and after allowing a sufficient time to elapse  in order  that the minds of the congregation should recover their tone  he  proceeded with the regular services of the morning     it is needless to recount the well known manner of the religious exercises  of the puritans  enough of their forms and of their substance has been  transmitted to us  to render both manner and doctrine familiar to most of  our readers  we shall therefore confine our duty to a relation of such  portions of the ceremonies  if that which sedulously avoided every  appearance of form can thus be termed  as have an immediate connexion with  the incidents     the divine had gone through the short opening prayer  had read the passage  of holy writ  had given out the verses of the psalm  and had joined in the  strange nasal melody with which his flock endeavored to render it doubly  acceptable  and had ended his long and fervent wrestling of the spirit in  a colloquial petition of some forty minutes  duration  in which direct  allusion had been made not only to the subject of his recent examination   but to divers other familiar interests of his parishioners  and all  without any departure from the usual zeal on his own part  or of the  customary attention and grave decorum on that of his people  but when  for  the second time  he arose to read another song of worship and  thanksgiving  a form was seen in the centre or principal aisle  that  as  well by its attire and aspect  as by the unusual and irreverent tardiness  of its appearance  attracted general observation  interruptions of this  nature were unfrequent  and even the long practised and abstracted  minister paused  for an instant  ere he proceeded with the hymn  though  there was a suspicion current among the more instructed of his  parishioners  that the sonorous version was an effusion of his own muse     the intruder was whittal ring  the witless young man had strayed from the  abode of his sister  and found his way into that general receptacle  where  most of the village was congregated  during his former residence in the  valley  there had been no temple  and the edifice  its interior  arrangements  the faces of those it contained  and the business on which  they had assembled  appeared alike strangers to him  it was only when the  people lifted up their voices in the song of praise  that some glimmerings  of his ancient recollections were discoverable in his inactive  countenance  then  indeed  he betrayed a portion of the delight which  powerful sounds can quicken  even in beings of his unhappy mental  construction  as he was satisfied  however  to remain in a retired part of  the aisle  listening with dull admiration  even the grave ensign dudley   whose eye had once or twice seemed ominous of displeasure  saw no  necessity for interference     meek had chosen for his text  on that day  a passage from the book of  judges   and the children of israel did evil in the sight of the lord  and  the lord delivered them into the hands of midian seven years   with this  text the subtle minded divine dealt powerfully  entering largely into the  mysterious and allegorical allusions then so much in vogue  in whatever  manner he viewed the subject  he found reason to liken the suffering   bereaved and yet chosen dwellers of the colonies  to the race of the  hebrews  if they were not set apart and marked from all others of the  earth  in order that one mightier than man should spring from their loins   they were led into that distant wilderness  far from the temptations of  licentious luxury  or the worldly mindedness of those who built their  structure of faith on the sands of temporal honors  to preserve the word  in purity  as there appeared no reason on the part of the divine himself  to distrust this construction of the words he had quoted  so it was  evident that most of his listeners willingly lent their ears to so  soothing an argument     in reference to midian  the preacher was far less explicit  that the great  father of evil was in some way intended by this allusion  could not be  doubted  but in what manner the chosen inhabitants of those regions were  to feel his malign influence  was matter of more uncertainty  at times   the greedy ears of those who had long been wrought up into the impression  that visible manifestations of the anger or of the love of providence  were daily presented to their eyes  were flattered with the stern joy of  believing that the war which then raged around them was intended to put  their moral armor to the proof  and that out of the triumph of their  victories were to flow honor and security to the church  then came  ambiguous qualifications  which left it questionable whether a return of  the invisible powers  that had been known to be so busy in the provinces   were not the judgment intended  it is not to be supposed that meek himself  had the clearest mental intelligence on a point of this subtlety  for  there was something of misty hallucination in the manner in which he  treated it  as will be seen by his closing words      to imagine that azazel regardeth the long suffering and stedfastness of a  chosen people with a pleasant eye   he said   is to believe that the  marrow of righteousness can exist in the carrion of deceit  we have  already seen his envious spirit raging in many tragical instances  if  required to raise a warning beacon to your eyes  by which the presence of  this treacherous enemy might be known  i should say  in the words of one  learned and ingenious in this craftiness  that   when a person  having  full reason  doth knowingly and wittingly seek and obtain of the devil  or  any other god besides the true god jehovah  an ability to do or know  strange things  which he cannot by his own human abilities arrive unto    that then he may distrust his gifts and tremble for his soul  and  oh  my  brethren how many of ye cling at this very moment to those tragical  delusions  and worship the things of the world  instead of fattening on  the famine of the desert  which is the sustenance of them that would live  for ever  lift your eyes upward  my brethren        rather turn them to the earth   interrupted a deep  authoritative voice  from the body of the church   there is present need of all your faculties  to save life  and even to guard the tabernacle of the lord      religious exercises composed the recreation of the dwellers in that  distant settlement  when they met in companies to lighten the load of  life  prayer and songs of praise were among the usual indulgences of the  entertainment  to them  a sermon was like a gay scenic exhibition in other  and vainer communities  and none listened to the word with cold and  inattentive ears  in literal obedience to the command of the preacher  and  sympathizing with his own action  every eye in the congregation had been  turned towards the naked rafters of the roof  when the unknown tones of  him who spoke broke the momentary delusion  it is needless to say that  by  a common movement  they sought an explanation of this extraordinary  appeal  the divine became mute  equally with wonder and with indignation     a first glance was enough to assure all present  that new and important  interests were likely to be awakened  a stranger of grave aspect  and of a  calm but understanding eye  stood at the side of whittal ring  his attire  was of the simple guise and homely materials of the country  still he bore  about his person enough of the equipments of one familiar with the wars of  the eastern hemisphere  to strike the senses  his hand was armed with a  shining broadsword  such as were then used by the cavaliers of england   and at his back was slung the short carabine of one who battled in the  saddle  his mien was dignified and even commanding  and there was no  second look necessary to show that he was an intruder of a character  altogether different from the moping innocent at his side      why is one of an unknown countenance come to disturb the worship of the  temple   demanded meek  when astonishment permitted utterance   thrice  hath this holy day been profaned by the foot of the stranger  and well may  it be doubted whether we live not under an evil agency       arm  men of the wish ton wish  arm  and to your defences      a cry arose without  that seemed to circle the whole valley  and then a  thousand whoops rolled out of the arches of the forest  and appeared to  meet in one hostile din above the devoted hamlet  those were sounds that  had been too often heard  or too often described  not to be generally  understood  a scene of wild confusion followed     each man  on entering the church  had deposited his arms at the door   and thither most of the stout borderers were now seen hastening  to  resume their weapons  women gathered their children to their sides  and  the wails of horror and alarm were beginning to break through the  restraints of habit      peace   exclaimed the pastor  seemingly excited to a degree above  human emotion   ere we go forth  let there be a voice raised to our  heavenly father  the asking shall be as a thousand men of war battling  in our behalf      the commotion ceased as suddenly as if a mandate had been issued from  that place to which their petition was to be addressed  even the  stranger  who had regarded the preparations with a stern but anxious eye   bowed his head  and seemed to join in the prayer  with a devoted and  confiding heart      lord   said meek  stretching his meagre arms  with the palms of the hands  open  high above the heads of his flock   at thy bidding  we go forth with  thy aid  the gates of hell shall not prevail against us  with thy mercy   there is hope in heaven and on earth  it is for thy tabernacle that we  shed blood  it is for thy word that we contend battle in our behalf  king  of kings  send thy heavenly legions to our succor  that the song of  victory may be incense at thy altars  and a foul hearing to the ears of  the enemy  amen      there was a depth in the voice of the speaker  a supernatural calmness in  the tones  and so great a confidence in the support of the mighty ally  implored  that the words went to every heart  it was impossible that  nature should not be powerful within  but a high and exciting enthusiasm  began to lift the people far above its influence  thus awakened by an  appeal to feelings that had never slumbered  and stimulated by all the  moving interests of life  the men of the valley poured out of the temple  in defence of person and fire side  and  as they believed  of religion  and of god     there was pressing necessity  not only for this zeal  but for all the  physical energies of the stoutest of their numbers  the spectacle that met  the view  on issuing into the open air  was one that might have appalled  the hearts of warriors more practised  and have paralyzed the efforts of  men less susceptible to the impressions of a religious excitement     dark forms were leaping through the fields  on the hill sides  and all  adown the slopes that conducted to the valley  armed savages were seen  pouring madly forward  on their path of destruction and vengeance  behind  them  the brand and the knife had been already used  for the log tenement   the stacks and the out buildings of reuben ring  and of several others who  dwelt in the skirts of the settlement  were sending forth clouds of murky  smoke  in which forked and angry flames were already flashing fiercely   but danger most pressed still nearer  a long line of fierce warriors was  even in the meadows  and in no direction could the eye be turned  that it  did not meet with the appalling proof that the village was completely  surrounded by an overwhelming superiority of force      to the garrison   shouted some of the foremost of those who first saw the  nature and imminency of the danger  pressing forward themselves in the  direction of the fortified house   to the garrison  or we are lost       hold   exclaimed that voice which was so strange to the ears of most of  those who heard it  but which spoke in a manner that by its compass and  firmness commanded obedience   with this mad disorder  we are truly lost   let captain content heathcote come to my councils      notwithstanding the tumult and confusion which had now in truth begun to  rage fearfully around him  the quiet and self restrained individual to  whom the legal and perhaps moral right to command belonged  had lost none  of his customary composure  it was plain  by the look of powerful  amazement with which he had at first regarded the stranger  on his sudden  interruption of the service  and by the glances of secret intelligence and  of recognition they exchanged  that they had met before  but this was no  time for greetings or explanations  nor was that a scene in which to waste  the precious moments in useless contests about opinions      i am here   said he who was thus called for   ready to lead whither thy  prudence and experience shall point the way       speak to the people  and separate the combatants in three bodies of equal  strength  one shall press forward to the meadows  and beat back the  savage  ere he encircle the palisadoed house  the second shall proceed  with the feeble and tender  in their flight to its covers  and with the  third  but thou knowest that which i would do with the third hasten  or we  lose all by tardiness      it was perhaps fortunate that orders so necessary and so urgent were  given to one little accustomed to superfluity of speech  without offering  either commendation or dissent  content obeyed  accustomed to his  authority  and conscious of the critical situation of all that was dear   the men of the village yielded an obedience more prompt and effective than  it is usual to meet in soldiers who are not familiar with habits of  discipline  the fighting men were quickly separated in three bodies   consisting of rather more than a score of combatants in each  one   commanded by eben dudley  advanced at quick time towards the meadows in  the rear of the fortress  that the whooping body of savages  who were  already threatening to cut off the retreat of the women and children   should be checked  while another departed in a nearly opposite direction   taking the street of the hamlet  for the purpose of meeting those who  advanced by the southern entrance of the valley  the third and last of  these small but devoted bodies  remained stationary  in attendance for  more definite orders     at the moment when the first of these little divisions of force was ready  to move  the divine appeared in its front  with an air in which spiritual  reliance on the purposes of providence  and some show of temporal  determination  were singularly united  in one hand he bore a bible  which  he raised on high as the sacred standard of his followers  and in the  other he brandished a short broadsword  in a manner that proved there  might be danger in encountering its blade  the volume was open  and at  brief intervals the divine read  in high and excited voice  such passages  as accidentally met his eye  the leaves blowing about in a manner to  produce a rather remarkable admixture of doctrine and sentiment  but to  these trifling moral incongruities  both the pastor and his parishioners  were alike indifferent  their subtle mental exercises having given birth  to a tendency of aptly reconciling all seeming discrepancies  as well as  of accommodating the most abstruse doctrines to the more familiar  interests of life      israel and the philistines had put their battle in array  army against  army   commenced meek  as the troop he led began its advance  then   reading at short intervals  he continued   behold  i will do a thing in  israel  at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall  tingle     oh house of aaron  trust in the lord  he is thy help and thy  shield    deliver me  o lord  from the evil man preserve me from the  violent man     let burning coals fall upon them  let them be cast into  the fire  into deep pits  that they rise not again     let the wicked fall  into their own nets  whilst that i  withal  escape     therefore doth my  father love me  because i lay down my life  that i may take it  again     he that hateth me  hateth my father also     father  forgive  them  for they know not what they do     they have heard that it hath  been said  an eye for an eye  and a tooth for a tooth     for joshua drew  not his hand back  wherewith he stretched out the spear  until he had  utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of ai        thus far the words of  meek were intelligible to those who remained  but distance soon confounded  the syllables  then nought was audible but the yells of the enemy  the  tramp of the men who pressed in the rear of the priest  with a display of  military pomp as formidable as their limited means would allow  and those  clear high tones  which sounded in the ears and quickened the blood at the  hearts of his followers  as though they had been trumpet blasts  in a few  more minutes the little band was scattered behind the covers of the  fields  and the rattling of fire arms succeeded to the quaint and  characteristic manner of their march     while this movement was made in front the party ordered to cover the  village was not idle  commanded by a sturdy yeoman  who filled the office  of lieutenant  it advanced with less of religious display  but with equal  activity  in the direction of the south  and the sounds of contention were  quickly heard  proclaiming both the urgency of the measure and the warmth  of the conflict     in the mean time  equal decision  though tempered by some circumstances of  deep personal interest  was displayed by those who had been left in front  of the church  as soon as the band of meek had got to such a distance as  to promise security to those who followed  the stranger commanded the  children to be led towards the fortified house  this duty was performed by  the trembling mothers  who had been persuaded  with difficulty  to defer  it until cooler heads should pronounce that the proper moment had come  a  few of the women dispersed among the dwellings in quest of the infirm  while all the boys of proper age were actively employed in transporting  indispensable articles from the village  within the palisadoes  as these  several movements were simultaneous  but a very few minutes elapsed  between the time when the orders were issued and the moment when they were  accomplished      i had intended that thou shouldst have had the charge in the meadows    said the stranger to content  when nought remained to be performed  but  that which had been reserved for the last of the three little bands of  fighting men   but as the work proceedeth bravely in that quarter  we will  move in company  why doth this maiden tarry       truly i know not  unless it may be of fear  there is an opening for thy  passage into the fort  martha  with others of thy sex       i will follow the fighters that are about to march to the rescue of them  that remain in our habitation   said the girl  in a low but steady voice      and how know st thou that such is the service intended for those here  arrayed   demanded the stranger  with a little show of displeasure that  his military purposes should have been anticipated      i see it in the countenances of them that tarry   returned the other   gazing furtively towards mark who  posted in the little line  could with  difficulty brook a delay which threatened his father s house  and those  whom it held  with so much jeopardy      forward   cried the stranger   here is no leisure for dispute  let the  maiden take wisdom  and hasten to the fort  follow  men stout of heart  or  we come too late to the succor      martha waited until the party had advanced a few paces  and then  instead  of obeying the repeated mandate to consult her personal safety  she took  the direction of the armed band      i fear me that  twill exceed our strength   observed the stranger  who  marched in front at the side of content   to make good the dwelling  at so  great distance from further aid       and yet the visitation will be heavy  that shall drive us for a second  time to the fields for a resting place  in what manner didst get warning  of this inroad       the savages believed themselves concealed in the cunning place  where  thou know st that my eye had opportunity to overlook their artifices there  is a providence in our least seeming calculations  an imprisonment of  weary years hath its reward in this warning      content appeared to acquiesce  but the situation of affairs prevented the  discourse from becoming more minute     as they approached the dwelling of the heathcotes  better opportunity of  observing the condition of things  in and around the house  was of course  obtained  the position of the building would have rendered any attempt  on  the part of those in it  to gain the fort ere the arrival of assistance   desperately hazardous  since the meadows that lay between them were  already alive with the ferocious warriors of the enemy  but it was evident  that the puritan  whose infirmities kept him within doors  entertained no  such design  for it was shortly apparent that those within were closing  and barring the windows of the habitation  and that other provisions for  defence were in the course of active preparation  the feelings of  content  who knew that the house contained only his wife and father  with  one female assistant  were excited to agony  as the party he commanded  drew near on one side  at a distance about equal to that of a band of the  enemy  who were advancing diagonally from the woods  on the other  he saw  the efforts of those so dear to him  as they had recourse to the means of  security provided to repel the very danger which now threatened  and  to  his eyes  it appeared that the trembling hands of ruth had lost their  power  when haste and confusion more than once defeated the object of her  exertions      we must break and charge  or the savage will be too speedy   he said  in  tones that grew thick from breathing quicker than was wont for one of his  calm temperament   see  they enter the orchard  in another minute  they  will be masters of the dwelling      but his companion marched with a firmer step and looked with a cooler  eye  there was  in his gaze  the understanding of a man practised in  scenes of sudden danger  and in his mien the authority of one accustomed  to command      fear not   he answered   the art of old mark heathcote hath departed from  him  or he still knoweth how to make good his citadel against a first  onset  if we quit our order  the superiority of concert will be lost  and  being few in numbers  defeat will be certain  but with this front  and a  fitting steadiness  our march may not be repulsed  to thee  captain  content heathcote  it need not be told  that he who now counsels hath seen  the strife of savages ere this hour       i know it well  but dost not see my ruth  laboring at the ill fitted  shutter of the chamber  the woman will be slain  in her heedlessness  for   hark  there beginneth the volley of the enemy       no   tis he who led my troop in a far different warfare   exclaimed the  stranger  whose form grew more erect  and whose thoughtful and  deeply furrowed features assumed something like the stern pleasure which  kindles in the soldier as the sounds of contention increase    tis old  mark heathcote  true to his breeding and his name  he hath let off the  culverin upon the knaves  behold  they are already disposed to abandon  one who speaketh so boldly  and are breaking through the fences to the  left  that we may taste something of their quality  now  bold englishmen   strong of hand and stout of heart  you have training in your duty  and  you shall not be wanting in example  you have wives and children at hand   looking at your deeds  and there is one above  that taketh note of the  manner in which you serve in his cause  here is an opening for your  skill  scourge the cannibals with the hand of death  on  on to the onset   and to victory            chapter xxiii            hect               is this achilles      achil   i am achilles      hect   stand fair  i pray thee  let me look on thee       troilus and cressida       it may now be necessary to take a rapid glance at the situation of the  whole combat  which had begun to thicken in different parts of the valley   the party led by dudley  and exhorted by meek  had broken its order on  reaching the meadows behind the fort  and  seeking the covers of the  stumps and fences  it had thrown in its fire  with good effect  on the  irregular band that pressed into the fields  this decision quickly caused  a change in the manner of the advance  the indians took to covers  in  their turn  and the struggle assumed that desultory but dangerous  character  in which the steadiness and resources of the individual are put  to the severest trial  success appeared to vacillate  the white men at one  time widening the distance between them and their friends in the dwelling   and  at another  falling back as if disposed to seek the shelter of the  palisadoes  although numbers were greatly in favor of the indians  weapons  and skill supported the cause of their adversaries  it was the evident  wish of the former to break in upon the little band that opposed their  progress to the village  in and about which they saw that scene of hurried  exertion which has already been described  a spectacle but little likely  to cool the furious ardor of an indian onset  but the wary manner in which  dudley conducted his battle  rendered this an experiment of exceeding  hazard  however heavy of intellect the ensign might appear on other  occasions  the present was one every way adapted to draw out his best and  most manly qualities  of large and powerful stature  he felt  in moments  of strife  a degree of confidence in himself  that was commensurate with  the amount of physical force he wielded  to this hardy assurance was to be  added no trifling portion of the sort of enthusiasm that can be awakened  in the most sluggish bosoms  and which  like the anger of an even tempered  man  is only the more formidable from the usually quiet habits of the  individual  nor was this the first  by many  of ensign dudley s warlike  deeds  besides the desperate affair already related in these pages  he had  been engaged in divers hostile expeditions against the aborigines  and on  all occasions had he shown a cool head and a resolute mind     there was pressing necessity for both these essential qualities  in the  situation in which the ensign now found himself  by properly extending his  little force  and yet keeping it at the same time perfectly within  supporting distance  by emulating the caution of his foes in consulting  the covers  and by reserving a portion of his fire throughout the broken  and yet well ordered line  the savages were finally beaten back  from  stump to stump  from hillock to hillock  and fence to fence  until they  had fairly entered the margin of the forest  further the experienced eye  of the borderer saw he could not follow  many of his men were bleeding   and growing weaker as their wounds still flowed  the protection of the  trees gave the enemy too great an advantage for their position to be  forced  and destruction would have been the inevitable consequence of the  close struggle which must have followed a charge  in this stage of the  combat  dudley began to cast anxious and inquiring looks behind him  he  saw that support was not to be expected  and he also saw  with regret   that many of the women and children were still busy  transporting  necessaries from the village into the fort  falling back to a better line  of covers  and to a distance that materially lessened the danger of the  arrows  the weapons used by quite two thirds of his enemies  he awaited   in sullen silence  the proper moment to effect a further retreat     it was while the party of dudley stood thus at bay  that a fierce yell  rung in the arches of the forest  it was an exclamation of pleasure   uttered in the wild manner of those people  as if the tenants of the woods  were animated by some sudden and general impulse of joy  the crouching  yeomen regarded each other in uneasiness  but seeing no sign of wavering  in the steady mien of their leader  each man kept close  awaiting some  further exhibition of the devices of their foes  ere another minute had  passed  two warriors appeared at the margin of the wood  where they stood  apparently in contemplation of the different scenes that were acting in  various parts of the valley  more than one musket was levelled with intent  to injure them  but a sign from dudley prevented attempts that would most  probably have been frustrated by the never slumbering vigilance of a north  american indian     there was however something in the air and port of these two  individuals  that had its share in producing the forbearance of dudley   they were evidently both chiefs  and of far more than usual estimation   as was common with the military leaders of the indians  they were men  also of large and commanding stature  viewed at the distance from which  they were seen  one seemed a warrior who had reached the meridian of his  days  while the other had the lighter step and more flexible movement of  a much briefer existence  both were well armed  and  as was usual with  people of their origin on the war path  they were clad only in the  customary scanty covering of waist cloths and leggings  the former   however  were of scarlet  and the latter were rich in the fringes and  bright colors of indian ornaments  the elder of the two wore a gay belt  of wampum around his head  in the form of a turban  but the younger  appeared with a shaven crown  on which nothing but the customary  chivalrous scalp lock was visible     the consultation  like most of the incidents that have been just related   occupied but a very few minutes  the eldest of the chiefs issued some  orders  the mind of dudley was anxiously endeavoring to anticipate their  nature  when the two disappeared together  the ensign would now have been  left entirely to vague conjectures  had not the rapid execution of the  mandates that had been issued to the youngest of the indians  soon left  him in no doubt of their intentions  another loud and general shout drew  his attention towards the right  and when he had endeavored to strengthen  his position by calling three or four of the best marksmen to that end of  his little line  the youngest of the chiefs was seen bounding across the  meadow  leading a train of whooping followers to the covers that commanded  its opposite extremity  in short  the position of dudley was completely  turned  and the stumps and angles of the fences  which secreted his men   were likely to become of no further use  the emergency demanded decision   collecting his yeomen  ere the enemy had time to profit by his advantage   the ensign ordered a rapid retreat towards the fort  in this movement he  was favored by the formation of the ground  a circumstance that had been  well considered on the advance  and in a very few minutes  the party found  itself safely posted under the protection of a scattering fire from the  palisadoes  which immediately checked the pursuit of the whooping and  exulting foe  the wounded men  after a stern or rather sullen halt  that  was intended to exhibit the unconquerable determination of the whites   withdrew into the works for succor  leaving the command of dudley reduced  by nearly one half of its numbers  with this diminished force  however  he  promptly turned his attention towards the assistance of those who combated  at the opposite extremity of the village     allusion has already been made to the manner in which the houses of a new  settlement were clustered near each other  at the commencement of the  colonial establishments  in addition to the more obvious and sufficient  motive  which has given rise to the same inconvenient and unpicturesque  manner of building  over nine tenths of the continent of europe  there had  been found a religious inducement for the inconvenient custom  one of the  enactments of the puritans said  that  no man shall set his  dwelling house  above the distance of half a mile  or a mile at farthest   from the meeting of the congregation where the church doth usually  assemble for the worship of god    the support of the worship of god  in  church fellowship   was the reason alleged for this arbitrary provision of  the law  but it is quite probable that support against danger of a more  temporal character was another motive  there were those within the fort  who believed the smoking piles that were to be seen  here and there  in  the clearings on the hills  owed their destruction to a disregard of that  protection which was thought to be yielded to those who leaned with the  greatest confidence  even in the forms of earthly transactions  on the  sustaining power of an all seeing and all directing providence  among this  number was reuben ring  who submitted to the loss of his habitation  as to  a merited punishment for the light mindedness that had tempted him to  erect a dwelling at the utmost limits of the prescribed distance     as the party of dudley retreated  that sturdy yeoman stood at a window of  the chamber in which his prolific partner with her recent gift were safely  lodged  for in that moment of confusion  the husband was compelled to  discharge the double duty of sentinel and nurse  he had just fired his  piece and he had reason to think with success  on the enemies that pressed  too closely on the retiring party  and as he reloaded the gun  he turned a  melancholy eye on the pile of smoking embers  that now lay where his  humble but comfortable habitation had so lately stood      i fear me  abundance   he said  shaking his head with a sigh   that there  was error in the measurement between the meeting and the clearing  some  misgivings of the lawfulness of stretching the chain across the hollows   came over me at the time  but the pleasant knoll  where the dwelling  stood  was so healthful and commodious  that  if it were a sin  i hope it  is one that is forgiven  there doth not seem so much as the meanest of its  logs  that is not now melted into white ashes by the fire       raise me  husband   returned the wife  in the weak voice natural to her  feeble situation   raise me with thine arm  that i may look upon the place  where my babes first saw the light      her request was granted  and  for a minute  the woman gazed in mute grief  at the destruction of her comfortable home  then  as a fresh yell from the  foe rose on the air without  she trembled  and turned with a mother s care  towards the unconscious beings that slumbered at her side      thy brother hath been driven by the heathen to the foot of the  palisadoes   observed the other  after regarding his companion with  manly kindness for a moment   and he hath lessened his force by many  that are wounded      a short but eloquent pause succeeded  the woman turned her tearful face  upwards  and stretching out a bloodless hand  she answered       i know what thou wouldst do  it is not meet that sergeant ring should  be a woman tender  when the indian enemy is in his neighbor s fields  go  to thy duty  and that which is to be done  do manfully  and yet would i  have thee remember how many there are who lean upon thy life for a  father s care      the yeoman first cast a cautious look around him  for this the decent and  stern usages of the puritans exacted  and perceiving that the girl who  occasionally entered to tend the sick was not present  he stooped  and  impressing his lips on the cheek of his wife  he threw a yearning look at  his offspring  shouldered his musket  and descended to the court     when reuben ring joined the party of dudley  the latter had just issued an  order to march to the support of those who still stoutly defended the  southern entrance of the village  the labor of securing necessaries was  not yet ended  and it was on every account an object of the last  importance to make good the hamlet against the enemy  the task  however   was not as difficult as the force of the indians might  at first  have  given reason to believe  the conflict  by this time  had extended to the  party which was headed by content  and  in consequence  the indians were  compelled to contend with a divided force  the buildings themselves  with  the fences and out houses  were so many breast works  and it was plain  that the assailants acted with a caution and concert  that betrayed the  direction of some mind more highly gifted than those which ordinarily fall  to the lot of uncivilized men     the task of dudley was not so difficult as before  since the enemy ceased  to press upon his march  preferring to watch the movements of those who  held the fortified house  of whose numbers they were ignorant  and of  whose attacks they were evidently jealous  as soon as the reinforcement  reached the lieutenant who defended the village  he commanded the charge   and his men advanced with shouts and clamor  some singing spiritual songs   others lifting up their voice in prayer  while a few availed themselves of  the downright and perhaps equally effective means of raising sounds as  fearful as possible  the whole being backed by spirited and well directed  discharges of musketry  the effort was successful  in a few minutes the  enemy fled  leaving that side of the valley momentarily free from danger     pursuit would have been folly  after posting a few look outs in secret and  safe positions among the houses  the whole party returned  with an  intention of cutting off the enemy who still held the meadows near the  garrison  in this design  however  their intentions were frustrated  the  instant they were pressed  the indians gave way  evidently for the purpose  of gaining the protection of the woods  and when the whites returned to  their works  they were followed in a manner to show that they could make  no further movement without the hazard of a serious assault  in this  condition  the men in and about the fort were compelled to be inefficient  spectators of the scene that was taking place around the   heathcote house   as the dwelling of old mark was commonly called     the fortified building had been erected for the protection of the village  and its inhabitants  an object that its position rendered feasible  but it  could offer no aid to those who dwelt without the range of musketry  the  only piece of artillery belonging to the settlement  was the culverin  which had been discharged by the puritan  and which served for the moment  to check the advance of his enemies  but the exclamations of the stranger   and the appeal to his men  with which the last chapter closed   sufficiently proclaimed that the attack was diverted from the house  and  that work of a bloody character now offered itself to those he and his  companion led     the ground around the dwelling of the heathcotes admitted of closer and  more deadly conflict than that on which the other portions of the combat  had occurred  time had given size to the orchards  and wealth had  multiplied and rendered more secure the inclosures and out buildings  it  was in one of the former that the hostile parties met  and came to that  issue which the warlike stranger had foreseen     content  like dudley  caused his men to separate and they threw in their  fire with the same guarded reservation that had been practised by the  other party  success again attended the efforts of discipline  the whites  gradually beating back their enemies  until there was a probability of  forcing them entirely into the open ground in their rear  a success that  would have been tantamount to a victory  but at this flattering moment   yells were heard behind the leaping and whooping band  that was still seen  gliding through the openings of the smoke  resembling so many dark and  malignant spectres acting their evil rites  then  as a chief with a  turbaned head  terrific voice  and commanding stature  appeared in their  front  the whole of the wavering line received an onward impulse  the  yells redoubled  another warrior was seen brandishing a tomahawk on one  flank  and the whole of the deep phalanx came rushing in upon the whites   threatening to sweep them away  as the outbreaking torrent carries  desolation in its course      men to your square   shouted the stranger  disregarding cover and  life  together  in such a pressing emergency   to your square   christians and be firm      the command was repeated by content  and echoed from mouth to mouth  but  before those on the flanks could reach the centre  the shock had come  all  order being lost  the combat was hand to hand one party fighting fiercely  for victory  and the other knowing that they stood at the awful peril of  their lives  after the first discharge of the musket and the twang of the  bow  the struggle was maintained with knife and axe  the thrust of the  former  or the descent of the keen and glittering tomahawk  being answered  by sweeping and crushing blows of the musket s but  or by throttling  grasps of hands that were clenched in the death gripe  men fell on each  other in piles  and when the conqueror rose to shake off the bodies of  those who gasped at his feet  his frowning eye rested alike on friend and  enemy  the orchard rang with the yells of the indians  but the colonists  fought in mute despair  sullen resolution only gave way with life  and it  happened more than once  that fearful day  that the usual reeking token of  an indian triumph was swung before the stern and still conscious eyes of  the mangled victim from whose head it had been torn     in this frightful scene of slaughter and ferocity  the principal  personages of our legend were not idle  by a tacit but intelligent  understanding  the stranger with content and his son placed themselves  back to back  and struggled manfully against their luckless fortune  the  former showed himself no soldier of parade  for  knowing the uselessness  of orders when each one fought for life  he dealt out powerful blows in  silence  his example was nobly emulated by content  and young mark moved  limb and muscle with the vigorous activity of his age  a first onset of  the enemy was repelled  and for a moment there was a faint prospect of  escape  at the suggestion of the stranger  the three moved  in their  order  towards the dwelling  with the intention of trusting to their  personal activity when released from the throng  but at this luckless  instant  when hope was beginning to assume the air of probability  a chief  came stalking through the horrible melee  seeking on each side some victim  for his uplifted axe  a crowd of the inferior herd pressed at his heels   and a first glance told the assailed that the decisive moment had come     at the sight of so many of their hated enemies still living  and capable  of suffering  a common and triumphant shout burst from the lips of the  indians  their leader  like one superior to the more vulgar emotions of  his followers  alone approached in silence  as the band opened and divided  to encircle the victims  chance brought him  face to face  with mark  like  his foe  the indian warrior was still in the freshness and vigor of young  manhood  in stature  years and agility  the antagonists seemed equal  and   as the followers of the chief threw themselves on the stranger and  content  like men who knew their leader needed no aid  there was every  appearance of a fierce and doubtful struggle  but  while neither of the  combatants showed any desire to avoid the contest  neither was in haste to  give the commencing blow  a painter  or rather sculptor  would have seized  the attitudes of these young combatants for a rich exhibition of the power  of his art     mark  like most of his friends  had cast aside all superfluous vestments  ere he approached the scene of strife  the upper part of his body was  naked to the shirt  and even this had been torn asunder by the rude  encounters through which he had already passed  the whole of his full and  heaving chest was bare  exposing the white skin and blue veins of one  whose fathers had come from towards the rising sun  his swelling form  rested on a leg that seemed planted in defiance  while the other was  thrown in front  like a lever  to control the expected movements  his arms  were extended to the rear  the hands grasping the barrel of a musket   which threatened death to all who should come within its sweep  the head   covered with the short  curling  yellow hair of his saxon lineage  was a  little advanced above the left shoulder  and seemed placed in a manner to  preserve the equipoise of the whole frame  the brow was flushed  the lips  compressed and resolute  the veins of the neck and temples swollen nearly  to bursting  and the eyes contracted  but of a gaze that bespoke equally  the feelings of desperate determination and of entranced surprise     on the other hand  the indian warrior was a man still more likely to be  remarked  the habits of his people had brought him  as usual  into the  field  with naked limbs and nearly uncovered body  the position of his  frame was that of one prepared to leap  and it would have been a  comparison tolerated by the license of poetry  to have likened his  straight and agile form to the semblance of a crouching panther  the  projecting leg sustained the body  bending under its load more with the  free play of muscle and sinew than from any weight  while the slightly  stooping head was a little advanced beyond the perpendicular  one hand was  clenched on the helve of an axe  that lay in a line with the right thigh  while the other was placed  with a firm gripe  on the buck horn handle of  a knife  that was still sheathed at his girdle  the expression of the face  was earnest  severe  and perhaps a little fierce  and yet the whole was  tempered by the immovable and dignified calm of a chief of high qualities   the eye  however  was gazing and riveted  and  like that of the youth  whose life he threatened  it appeared singularly contracted with wonder     the momentary pause that succeeded the movement by which the two  antagonists threw themselves into these fine attitudes  was full of  meaning  neither spoke  neither permitted play of muscle  neither even  seemed to breathe  the delay was not like that of preparation  for each  stood ready for his deadly effort  nor would it have been possible to  trace in the compressed energy of the countenance of mark  or in the lofty  and more practised bearing of the front and eye of the indian  any thing  like wavering of purpose  an emotion foreign to the scene appeared to  possess them both  each active frame unconsciously accommodating itself to  the bloody business of the hour  while the inscrutable agency of the mind  held them  for a brief interval  in check     a yell of death from the mouth of a savage who was beaten to the very  feet of his chief by a blow of the stranger  and an encouraging shout  from the lips of the latter  broke the short trance  the knees of the  chief bent still lower  the head of the tomahawk was a little raised  the  blade of the knife was seen glittering from its sheath  and the but of  mark s musket had receded to the utmost tension of his sinews  when a  shriek and a yell  different from any before heard that day  sounded  near  at the same moment  the blows of both the combatants were  suspended  though by the agency of very different degrees of force  mark  felt the arms of one cast around his limbs  with a power sufficient to  embarrass  though not to subdue him  while the well known voice of  whittal ring sounded in his ears       murder the lying and hungry pale faces  they leave us no food but air  no  drink but water      on the other hand  when the chief turned in anger  to strike the daring  one who presumed to arrest his arm  he saw at his feet the kneeling  figure  the uplifted hands  and agonized features  of martha  averting the  blow that a follower already aimed at the life of the suppliant  he spoke  rapidly in his own language  and pointed to the struggling mark  the  nearest indians cast themselves on the already half captured youth  a  whoop brought a hundred more to the spot  and then a calm as sudden  and  almost as fearful  as the previous tumult  prevailed in the orchard  it  was succeeded by the long drawn  frightful  and yet meaning yell by which  the american warrior proclaims his victory     with the end of the tumult in the orchard  the sounds of strife ceased in  all the valley  though conscious of the success of their enemies  the men  in the fort saw the certainty of destruction  not only to themselves  but  to those feeble ones whom they should be compelled to leave without a  sufficient defence  were they to attempt a sortie to that distance from  their works  they were therefore compelled to remain passive and grave  spectators of an evil they had not the means to avert           chapter xxiv            were such things here  as we do speak about     or have we eaten of the insane root    that takes the reason prisoner        macbeth       an hour later presented a different scene  bands of the enemy  that in  civilized warfare would be called parties of observation  lingered in the  skirts of the forest nearest to the village  and the settlers still stood  to their arms  posted among the buildings  or maintaining their array at  the foot of the palisadoes  though the toil of securing the valuables  continued  it was evident that  as the first terrors of alarm had  disappeared  the owners of the hamlet began to regain some assurance in  their ability to make it good against their enemies  even the women were  now seen moving through its grassy street with greater seeming confidence   and there was a regularity in the air of the armed men  which denoted a  determination that was calculated to impose on their wild and  undisciplined assailants     but the dwelling  the out buildings  and all the implements of domestic  comfort  which had so lately contributed to the ease of the heathcotes   were completely in the possession of the indians  the open shutters and  doors  the scattered and half destroyed furniture  the air of devastation  and waste  and the general abandonment of all interest in the protection  of the property  proclaimed the licentious disorder of a successful  assault  still the work of destruction and plunder did not go on   although here and there might be seen some warrior  decorated  according  to the humors of his savage taste  with the personal effects of the  former inmates of the building  every hand had been checked  and the  furious tempers of the conquerors had been quieted  seemingly by the  agency of some unseen and extraordinary authority  the men  who so lately  had been moved by the fiercest passions of our nature  were suddenly  restrained if not appeased  and  instead of that exulting indulgence of  vengeance which commonly accompanies an indian triumph  the warriors  stalked about the buildings and through the adjacent grounds  in a  silence which  though gloomy and sullen  was marked by their  characteristic submission to events     the principal leaders of the inroad  and all the surviving sufferers by  the defeat  were assembled in the piazza of the dwelling  ruth  pale   sorrowing  and mourning for others rather than for herself  stood a little  apart  attended by martha and the young assistant  whose luckless fortune  it was to be found at her post  on this eventful day  content  the  stranger  and mark  were near  subdued and bound  the sole survivors of  all that band they had so recently led into the conflict  the gray hairs  and bodily infirmities of the puritan spared him the same degradation  the  only other being present  of european origin  was whittal ring  the  innocent stalked slowly among the prisoners  sometimes permitting ancient  recollections and sympathies to come over his dull intellect  but oftener  taunting the unfortunate with the injustice of their race  and with the  wrongs of his adopted people     the chiefs of the successful party stood in the centre  apparently engaged  in some grave deliberation  as they were few in number  it was evident  that the council only included men of the highest importance  chiefs of  inferior rank  but of great names in the limited renown of those simple  tribes  conversed in knots among the trees  or paced the court at a  respectful distance from the consultation of their superiors     the least practised eye could not mistake the person of him on whom the  greatest weight of authority had fallen  the turbaned warrior  already  introduced in these pages  occupied the centre of the group  in the calm  and dignified attitude of an indian who hearkens to or who utters advice   his musket was borne by one who stood in waiting  while the knife and axe  were returned to his girdle he had thrown a light blanket  or it might be  better termed a robe of scarlet cloth  over his left shoulder  whence it  gracefully fell in folds  leaving the whole of the right arm free  and  most of his ample chest exposed to view  from beneath this mantle  blood  fell slowly in drops  dying the floor on which he stood  the countenance  of this warrior was grave  though there was a quickness in the movements  of an ever restless eye  that denoted great mental activity  no less than  the disquiet of suspicion  one skilled in physiognomy might too have  thought  that a shade of suppressed discontent was struggling with the  self command of habits that had become part of the nature of the  individual     the two companions nearest this chief were  like himself  men past the  middle age  and of mien and expression that were similar  though less  strikingly marked  neither showing those signs of displeasure  which  occasionally shot from organs that  in spite of a mind so trained and so  despotic  could not always restrain their glittering brightness  one was  speaking  and by his glance  it was evident that the subject of his  discourse was the fourth and last of their number  who had placed himself  in a position that prevented his being an auditor of what was said     in the person of the latter chief  the reader will recognise the youth who  had confronted mark  and whose rapid movement on the flank of dudley had  first driven the colonists from the meadows  the eloquent expression of  limb  the tension of sinews  and the compression of muscles  as last  exhibited  were now gone  they had given place to the peculiar repose that  distinguishes the indian warrior in his moments of inaction  quite as much  as it marks the manner of one schooled in the forms of more polished life   with one hand he leaned lightly on a musket  while from the wrist of the  other  which hung loose at his side  depended  by a thong of deer s sinew   a tomahawk from which fell drops of human blood  his person bore no other  covering than that in which he had fought  and  unlike his more aged  companion in authority  his body had escaped without a wound     in form and in features  this young warrior might be deemed a model of  the excellence of indian manhood  the limbs were full  round  faultlessly  straight  and distinguished by an appearance of extreme activity  without  being equally remarkable for muscle  in the latter particular  in the  upright attitude  and in the distant and noble gaze which so often  elevated his front  there was a close affinity to the statue of the  pythian apollo  while in the full  though slightly effeminate chest   there was an equal resemblance to that look of animal indulgence  which  is to be traced in the severe representations of bacchus  this  resemblance however to a deity that is little apt to awaken lofty  sentiments in the spectator  was not displeasing  since it in some  measure relieved the sternness of an eye that penetrated like the glance  of the eagle  and that might otherwise have left an impression of too  little sympathy with the familiar weaknesses of humanity  still the young  chief was less to be remarked by this peculiar fullness of chest  the  fruit of intervals of inaction  constant indulgence of the first wants of  nature  and a total exemption from toil  than most of those  who either  counselled in secret near  or paced the grounds about the building  in  him  it was rather a point to be admired  than a blemish  for it seemed  to say  that notwithstanding the evidences of austerity which custom  and  perhaps character  as well as rank  had gathered in his air  there was a  heart beneath that might be touched by the charities of humanity  on the  present occasion  the glances of his roving eye  though searching and  full of meaning  were evidently weakened by an expression that betrayed a  strange and unwonted confusion of mind     the conference of the three was ended  and the warrior with a turbaned  head advanced towards his captives  with the step of a man whose mind had  come to a decision  as the dreaded chief drew near  whittal retired   stealing to the side of the younger warrior  in a manner that denoted  greater familiarity and perhaps greater confidence  a sudden thought  lighted the countenance of the latter  he led the innocent to the  extremity of the piazza  spoke low and earnestly  pointing to the forest   and when he saw that his messenger was already crossing the fields  at the  top of his speed  he moved  with calm dignity  into the centre of the  group  taking his station so near his friend  that the folds of the  scarlet blanket brushed his elbows until this movement  the silence was  not broken  when the great chief felt the passage of the other  he glanced  a look of hesitation at his friends  but resuming his former air of  composure  he spoke      man of many winters   he commenced  in an english that was quite  intelligible  while it betrayed a difficulty of speech we shall not  attempt imitating   why hath the great spirit made thy race like hungry  wolves   why hath a pale face the stomach of a buzzard  the throat of a  hound  and the heart of a deer  thou hast seen many meltings of the snow   thou rememberest the young tree a sapling  tell me  why is the mind of a  yengeese so big  that it must hold all that lies between the rising and  the setting sun  speak  for we would know the reason  why arms so long are  found on so little bodies      the events of that day had been of a nature to awaken all the latent  energies of the puritan  he had lifted up his spirit  with the morning   in the customary warmth with which he ever hailed the sabbath  the  excitement of the assault had found him sustained above most earthly  calamities  and while it quickened feelings that can never become extinct  in one who has been familiar with martial usages  it left him  stern in  his manhood  and exalted in his sentiments of submission and endurance   under such influences  he answered with an austerity that equalled the  gravity of the indian      the lord hath delivered us into the bonds of the heathen   he said    and yet his name shall be blessed beneath my roof  out of evil shall  come good  and from this triumph of the ignorant shall proceed an  everlasting victory      the chief gazed intently at the speaker  whose attenuated frame  venerable  face  and long locks  aided by the hectic of enthusiasm that played  beneath a glazed and deep set eye  imparted a character that seemed to  rise superior to human weakness  bending his head in superstitious  reverence  he turned gravely to those who  appearing to possess more of  the world in their natures  were more fitting subjects for the designs he  meditated      the mind of my father is strong  but his body is like a branch of the  scorched hemlock   was the pithy declaration with which he prefaced his  next remark   why is this   he continued  looking severely at the three  who had so lately been opposed to him in deadly contest   here are men  with skins like the blossom of the dog wood  and yet their hands are so  dark that i cannot see them       they have been blackened by toil  beneath a burning sun   returned  content  who knew how to discourse in the figurative language of the  people in whose power he found himself   we have labored  that our women  and children might eat       no  the blood of red men hath changed their color       we have taken up the hatchet  that the land which the great spirit hath  given might still be ours  and that our scalps might not be blown about in  the smoke of a wigwam  would a narragansett hide his arms  and tie up his  hands  with the war whoop ringing in his ears      when allusion was made to the ownership of the valley  the blood rushed  into the cheek of the warrior in such a flood  that it it deepened even  the natural swarthy hue  but  clenching the handle of his axe  convulsively  he continued to listen  like one accustomed to entire  self command      what a red man does may be seen   he answered  pointing with a grim smile  towards the orchard  exposing  by the movement of the blanket  as he  raised his arm  two of the reeking trophies of victory attached to his  belt   our ears are open very wide  we listen  to hear in what manner the  hunting grounds of the indian have become the plowed fields of the  yengeese  now let my wise men hearken  that they may grow more cunning  as  the snows settle on their heads  the pale men have a secret to make the  black seem white       narragansett          wampanoag   interrupted the chief  with the lofty air with which an  indian identifies himself with the glory of his people  then glancing a  milder look at the young warrior at his elbow  he added  hastily  and in  the tone of a courtier    tis very good  narragansett  or  wampanoag  wampanoag or narragansett  the red men are brothers and  friends  they have broken down the fences between their hunting grounds   and they have cleared the paths  between their villages  of briars  what  have you to say to the narragansett   he has not yet shut his ear       wampanoag  if such be thy tribe   resumed content   thou shalt hear that  which my conscience teacheth is language to be uttered  the god of an  englishman is the god of men of all ranks  and of all time   his listeners  shook their heads doubtingly  with the exception of the youngest chief   whose eye never varied its direction while the other spoke  each word  appearing to enter deep within the recesses of his mind   in defiance of  these signs of blasphemy  do i still proclaim the power of him i worship    content continued   my god is thy god  and he now looketh equally on the  deeds  and searcheth  with inscrutable knowledge  into  the hearts of  both  this earth is his footstool  yonder heaven his throne  i pretend not  to enter into his sacred mysteries  or to proclaim the reason why one half  of his fair work hath been so long left in that slough of ignorance and  heathenish abomination in which my fathers found it  why these hills never  before echoed the songs of praise or why the valleys have been so long  mute  these are truths hid in the secret designs of his sacred purpose   and they may not be known  until the last fulfilment  but a great and  righteous spirit hath led hither men  filled with the love of truth and  pregnant with the designs of a heavily burthened faith  inasmuch as their  longings are for things pure  while the consciousness of their  transgressions bends them in deep humility to the dust  thou bringest  against us the charge of coveting thy lands  and of bearing minds filled  with the corruption of riches this cometh of ignorance of that which hath  been abandoned  in order that the spirit of the godly might hold fast to  the truth  when the yengeese came into this wilderness  he left behind him  all that can delight the eye  please the senses  and feed the longing of  the human heart  in the country of his fathers  for fair as is the work of  the lord in other lands  there is none that is so excellent as that from  which these pilgrims in the wilderness have departed  in that favored  isle  the earth groaneth with the abundance of its products  the odors of  its sweet savors salute the nostrils  and the eye is never wearied in  gazing at its loveliness   no  the men of the pale faces have deserted  home  and all that sweeteneth life  that they might serve god  and not at  the instigations of craving minds  or of evil vanities      content paused  for as he grew warm with the spirit by which he was  animated  he had insensibly strayed from the closer points of his subject   his conquerors maintained the decorous gravity with which an indian always  listens to the speech of another  until he had ended  and then the great  chief  or wampanoag  as he had proclaimed himself to be  laid a finger  lightly on the shoulder of his prisoner  as he demanded       why have the people of the yengeese lost themselves on a blind path  if  the country they have left is pleasant  cannot their god hear then from  the wigwams of their fathers  see  if our trees are but bushes  leave them  to the red man he will find room beneath their branches to lie in the  shade  if our rivers are small  it is because the indians are little  if  the hills are low and the valleys narrow  the legs of my people are weary  with much hunting  and they will journey among them the easier  now what  the great spirit hath made for a red man  a red man should keep  they  whose skins are like the light of the morning should go back towards the  rising sun  out of which they have come to do us wrong      the chief spoke calmly  but it was like a man much accustomed to deal in  the subtleties of controversy  according to the fashion of the people to  whom he belonged      god hath otherwise decreed   said content   he hath led his servants  hither  that the incense of praise may arise from the wilderness       your spirit is a wicked spirit  your ears have been cheated  the counsel  that told your young men to come so far  was not spoken in the voice of  the manitou  it came from the tongue of one that loves to see game scarce   and the squaws hungry  go  you follow the mocker  or your hands would not  be so dark       i know not what injury may have been done the wampanoags  by men of  wicked minds  for some such there are  even in the dwellings of the  well disposed  but wrong to any hath never come from those that dwell  within my doors  for these lands  a price hath been paid  and what is now  seen of abundance in the valley  hath been wrought by much labor  thou art  a wampanoag  and dost know that the hunting grounds of thy tribe have been  held sacred by my people  are not the fences standing  which their hands  placed  that not even the hoof of colt should trample the corn  and when  was it known that the indian came for justice against the trespassing ox   and did not find it       the moose doth not taste the grass at the root  he liveth on the tree   he doth not stoop to feed on that which he treadeth under foot  does the  hawk look for the musketoe  his eye is too big  he can see a bird   go  when the deer have been killed the wampanoags will break down the  fence with their own hands  the arm of a hungry man is strong  a cunning  pale face hath made that fence  it shutteth out the colt  and it shutteth  in the indian but the mind of a warrior is too big  it will not be kept  at grass with the ox      a low but expressive murmur of satisfaction from the mouths of his grim  companions  succeeded the reply of the chief      the country of thy tribe is far distant   returned content   and i will  not lay untruth to my soul by presuming to say whether justice or  injustice hath been done them in the partition of the lands  but in this  valley hath wrong never been done to the red man  what indian hath asked  for food and not got it  if he hath been a thirst  the cider came at his  wish  if he hath been a cold  there was a seat by the hearth  and yet hath  there been reason why the hatchet should be in my hand  and why my foot  should be on the war path  for many seasons we lived on lands  which were  bought of both red and white man  in peace  but though the sun shone clear  so long  the clouds came at last  there was a dark night fell upon this  valley  wampanoag  and death and the brand entered my dwelling  together   our young men were killed  and    our spirits were sorely tried      content paused  for his voice became thick  and his eye had caught a  glimpse of the pale and drooping countenance of her who leaned on the arm  of the still excited and frowning mark for support  the young chief  listened with a charmed ear  as content had proceeded  his body was  inclined a little forward  and his whole attitude was that which men  unconsciously assume when intensely occupied in listening to sounds of the  deepest interest      but the sun rose again   said the great chief pointing at the evidences  of prosperity which were everywhere apparent in the settlement  casting at  the same time an uneasy and suspicious glance at his youngest companion    the morning was clear  though the night was so dark  the cunning of a  pale face knows how to make corn grow on a rock  the foolish indian eats  roots  when crops fail and is scarce       god ceased to be angry   returned content meekly  folding his arms in a  manner to show he wished to speak no more     the great chief was about to continue  when his younger associate laid a  finger on his naked shoulder  and  by a sign  indicated that he wished to  hold communication with him apart  the former met the request with  respect  though it might be discovered that he little liked the expression  of his companion s features  and that he yielded with reluctance  if not  with disgust  but the countenance of the youth was firm  and it would have  needed more than usual hardihood to refuse a request seconded by so steady  and so meaning an eye  the elder spoke to the warrior nearest his elbow   addressing him by the name of anna won  and then  by a gesture so natural  and so dignified that it might have graced the air of a courtier  he  announced his readiness to proceed  notwithstanding the habitual reverence  of the aborigines for age  the others gave way for the passage of the  young man  in a manner to proclaim that merit or birth  or both  had  united to purchase for him a personal distinction  which far exceeded that  shown  in common  to men of his years  the two chiefs left the piazza in  the noiseless manner of the moccasoned foot     the passage of these dignified warriors towards the grounds in the rear of  the dwelling  as it was characteristic of their habits  is worthy of being  mentioned  neither spoke  neither manifested any womanish impatience to  pry into the musings of the other s mind  and neither failed in those  slight but still sensible courtesies by which the path was rendered  commodious and the footing sure  they had reached the summit of the  elevation so often named  ere they believed themselves sufficiently  retired to indulge in a discourse which might otherwise have enlightened  profane ears  when beneath the shade of the fragrant orchard which grew on  the hill  the senior of the two stopped  and throwing about him one of  those quick  nearly imperceptible  and yet wary glances  by which an  indian understands his precise position  as it were by instinct  he  commenced the dialogue  the discourse was in the dialect of their race   but as it is not probable that many who read these pages would be much  enlightened were we to record it in the precise words in which it has been  transmitted to us  a translation into english  as freely as the subject  requires  and the geniuses of the two languages will admit  shall be  attempted      what would my brother have   commenced he with the turbaned head   uttering the guttural sounds in the low  soothing tones of friendship  and  even of affection   what troubles the great sachem of the narragansetts   his thoughts seem uneasy  i think there is more before his eye  than one  whose sight is getting dim can see  doth he behold the spirit of the brave  miantonimoh  who died  like a dog  beneath the blows of cowardly pequots  and false tongued yengeese  or does his heart swell  with longing  to see  the scalps of treacherous pale faces hanging at his belt  speak  my son   the hatchet hath long been buried in the path between our villages  and  thy words will enter the ears of friend       i do not see the spirit of my father   returned the young sachem   he is  afar off  in the hunting grounds of just warriors  my eyes are too weak to  look over so many mountains  and across so many rivers  he is chasing the  moose in grounds where there are no briars  he needeth not the sight of a  young man to tell him which way the trail leadeth  why should i look at  the place where the pequot and the pale face took his life  the fire which  scorched this hill hath blackened the spot  and i can no longer find the  marks of blood       my son is very wise  cunning beyond his winters  that which hath been  once revenged  is forgotten  he looks no further than six moons  he sees  the warriors of the yengeese coming into his village  murdering his old  women  and slaying the narragansett girls  killing his warriors from  behind  and lighting their fires with the bones of red men  i will now  stop my ears  for the groans of the slaughtered make my soul feel weak       wampanoag   answered the other  with a fierce flashing of his eagle eye   and laying his hand firmly on his breast   the night the snows were red  with the blood of my people  is here  my mind is dark  none of my race  have since looked upon the place where the lodges of the narragansetts  stood  and yet it hath never been hid from our sight  since that time have  we travelled in the woods  bearing on our backs all that is left but our  sorrow  that we carry in our hearts       why is my brother troubled  there are many scalps among his people  and  see  his own tomahawk is very red  let him quiet his anger till the night  cometh  and there will be a deeper stain on the axe  i know he is in a  hurry  but our councils say it is better to wait for darkness  since the  cunning of the pale faces is too strong for the hands of our young men       when was a narragansett slow to leap  after the whoop was given  or  unwilling to stay  when men of gray heads say  tis better  i like your  counsel  it is full of wisdom  yet an indian is but a man  can he fight  with the god of the yengeese  he is too weak  an indian is but a man   though his skin be red       i look into the clouds  at the trees  among the lodges   said the other   affecting to gaze curiously at the different objects he named   but i  cannot see the white manitou  the pale men were talking to him when we  raised the whoop in their fields  and yet he has not heard them  go  my  son has struck their warriors with a strong hand  has he forgotten to  count how many dead lie among the trees with the sweet smelling blossoms       metacom   returned he who has been called the sachem of the  narragansetts  stepping cautiously nearer to his friend  and speaking  lower  as if he feared an invisible auditor   thou hast put hate into the  bosoms of the red men  but canst thou make them more cunning than the  spirits  hate is very strong  but cunning hath a longer arm  see   he  added  raising the fingers of his two hands before the eyes of his  attentive companion   ten snows have come and melted  since there stood a  lodge of the pale faces on this hill  conanchet was then a boy  his hand  had struck nothing but deer  his heart was full of wishes  by day he  thought of pequot scalps  at night he heard the dying words of  miantonimoh  though slain by cowardly pequots and lying yengeese  his  father came with the night into his wigwam  to talk to his son   does the  child of so many great sachems grow big   would he say   is his arm  getting strong  his foot light  his eye quick  his heart valiant  will  conanchet be like his fathers   when will the young sachem of the  narragansetts become a man   why should i tell my brother of these visits   metacom hath often seen the long line of wampanoag chiefs  in his sleep   the brave sachems sometimes enter into the heart of their son      the lofty minded  though wily philip struck his hand heavily upon his  naked breast  as he answered       they are always here  metacom has no soul but the spirit of his fathers       when he was tired of silence  the murdered miantonimoh spoke aloud    continued conanchet  after permitting the customary courteous pause to  succeed the emphatic words of his companion   he bade his son arise  and  go among the yengeese  that he might return with scalps to hang in his  wigwam  for the eyes of the dead chief liked not to see the place so  empty  the voice of conanchet was then too feeble for the council fire  he  said nothing  he went alone  an evil spirit gave him into the hands of the  pale faces  he was a captive many moons  they shut him in a cage  like a  tamed panther  it was here  the news of his ill luck passed from the  mouths of the young men of the yengeese  to the hunters  and from the  hunters it came to the ears of the narragansetts  my people had lost their  sachem  and they came to seek him  metacom  the boy had felt the power of  the god of the yengeese  his mind began to grow weak  he thought less of  revenge  the spirit of his father came no more at night  there was much  talking with the unknown god  and the words of his enemies were kind  he  hunted with them  when he met the trail of his warriors in the woods  his  mind was troubled  for he knew their errand  still he saw his father s  spirit  and waited  the whoop was heard that night  many died  and the  narragansetts took scalps  thou seest this lodge of stone  over which fire  has passed  there was then a cunning place above  and in it the pale men  went to fight for their lives  but the fire kindled  and then there was no  hope  the soul of conanchet was moved at that sight  for there was much  honesty in them within  though their skins were so white  they had not  slain his father  but the flames would not be spoken to  and the place  became like the coals of a deserted council fire  all within were turned  to ashes  if the spirit of miantonimoh rejoiced  it was well  but the soul  of his son was very heavy  the weakness was on him  and he no longer  thought of boasting of his deeds at the war post       that fire scorched the stain of blood from the sachem s plain       it did  since that time i have not seen the marks of my father s blood   gray heads and boys were in that fire  and when the timbers fell   nothing was left but coals  yet do they  who were in the blazing lodge   stand there      the attentive metacom started  and glanced a hasty look at the ruin      does my son see spirits in the air   he asked hastily      no  they live  they are bound for the torments  in the white head  is he  who talked much with his god  the elder chief  who struck our young men so  hard  was then also a captive in this lodge  he who spoke  and she  who  seems even paler than her race  died that night  and yet are they now  here  even the brave youth  that was so hard to conquer  looks like a boy  that was in the fire  the yengeese deal with unknown gods  they are too  cunning for an indian      philip heard this strange tale  as a being educated in superstitious  legends would be apt to listen  and yet it was with a leaning to  incredulity  that was generated by his fierce and indomitable desire for  the destruction of the hated race  he had prevailed  in the councils of  his nation  over many similar signs of the supernatural agency that was  exercised in favor of his enemies  but never before had facts so imposing  come so directly and from so high a source before his mind  even the proud  resolution and far sighted wisdom of this sagacious chief were shaken by  such testimony  and there was a single moment when the idea of abandoning  a league that seemed desperate took possession of his brain  but true to  himself and his cause  second thoughts and a firmer purpose restored his  resolution  though they could not remove the perplexity of his doubts      what does conanchet wish   he said   twice have his warriors broke into  this valley  and twice have the tomahawks of his young men been redder  than the head of the woodpecker  the fire was not good fire  the tomahawk  will kill surer  had not the voice of my brother said to his young men    let the scalps of the prisoners alone   he could not now say  yet do they  now stand here        my mind is troubled  friend of my father  let them be questioned   artfully  that the truth be known      metacom mused an instant  then smiling  in a friendly manner  on his young  and much moved companion  he made a sign to a youth who was straying about  the fields  to approach  this young warrior was made the bearer of an  order to lead the captives to the hill  after which the two chiefs stalked  to and fro in silence  each brooding over what had passed  in a humor that  was suited to his particular character and more familiar feelings           chapter xxv          no wither d witch shall here be seen     no goblins lead their nightly crew     the female fays shall haunt the green     and dress thy grave with pearly dew       collins       it is rare indeed that the philosophy of a dignified indian is so far  disturbed  as to destroy the appearance of equanimity  when content and  the family of the heathcotes appeared on the hill  they found the chiefs  still pacing the orchard  with the outward composure of men unmoved  and  with the gravity that was suited to their rank  annawon  who had acted as  their conductor  caused the captives to be placed in a row  choosing the  foot of the ruin for their position  and then he patiently awaited the  moment when his superiors might be pleased to renew the examination  in  this habitual silence  there was nothing of the abject air of asiatic  deference  it proceeded from the habit of self command  which taught the  indian to repress all natural emotions  a very similar effect was produced  by the religious abasement of those whom fortune had now thrown into their  power  it would have been a curious study  for one interested in the  manners of the human species  to note the difference between the calm   physical  and perfect self possession of the wild tenants of the forest   and the ascetic  spiritually sustained  and yet meek submission to  providence  that was exhibited by most of the prisoners  we say of most   for there was an exception  the brow of young mark still retained its  frown  and the angry character of his eye was only lost  when by chance  it lighted on the drooping form and pallid features of his mother  there  was ample time for these several and peculiar qualities to be thus  silently exhibited  many minutes passing before either of the sachems  seemed inclined to re commence the conference  at length philip  or  metacom  as we shall indifferently call him  drew near and spoke      this earth is a good earth   he said   it is of many colors  to please  the eyes of him who made it  in one part it is dark  and as the worm  taketh the color of the leaf on which he crawls  there the hunters are  black  in another part it is white  and that is the part where pale men  were born  and where they should die  or they may miss the road which  leads to their happy hunting grounds  many just warriors  who have been  killed on distant war paths  still wander in the woods  because the trail  is hid  and their sight dim  it is not good to trust so much to the  cunning of        wretched and blind worshipper of apollyon   interrupted the puritan   we  are not of the idolatrous and foolish minded  it hath been accorded to us  to know the lord  to his chosen worshippers  all regions are alike  the  spirit can mount  equally  through snows and whirlwinds  the tempest and  the calm  from the lands of the sun  and the lands of frosts  from the  depths of the ocean  from fire  from the forest       he was interrupted  in his turn  at the word fire  the finger of metacom  fell meaningly on his shoulder  and when he had ceased  for until then no  indian would have spoken  the other gravely asked       and when a man of a pale skin hath gone up in the fire  can he again  walk upon earth  is the river between this clearing and the pleasant  fields of a yengeese so narrow  that the just men can step across it when  they please       this is the conceit of one wallowing in the slough of heathenish  abominations  child of ignorance  know that the barriers which separate  heaven from earth are impassable  for what purified being could endure the  wickedness of the flesh       this is a lie of the false pale faces   said the wily philip   it is told  that the indian might not learn their cunning  and become stronger than a  yengeese  my father  and those with him  were once burnt in this lodge   and now he standeth here  ready to take the tomahawk       to be angered at this blasphemy  would ill denote the pity that i feel    said mark  more excited at the charge of necromancy  than he was willing  to own   and yet to suffer so fatal an error to spread among these deluded  victims of satan  would be neglect of duty  thou hast heard some legend of  thy wild people  man of the wampanoags  which may heap double perdition on  thy soul  lest thou shouldst happily be rescued from the fangs of the  deceiver  it is true  that i and mine were in exceeding jeopardy in this  tower  and that to the eyes of men without we seemed melted with the heat  of the flames  but the lord put it into our spirits to seek refuge whither  fire could not come  the well was made the instrument of our safety  for  the fulfilment of his own inscrutable designs      notwithstanding the long practised and exceeding subtlety of the  listeners  they heard this simple explanation of that which they had  deemed a miracle  with a wonder that could not readily be concealed   delight at the excellence of the artifice was evidently the first and  common emotion of them both  nor would they yield implicit faith  until  assured  beyond a doubt  that what they heard was true  the little iron  door  which had permitted access to the well  for the ordinary domestic  purposes of the family  was still there  and it was only after each had  cast a look down the deep shaft  that he appeared satisfied of the  practicability of the deed  then a look of triumph gleamed in the swarthy  visage of philip  while the features of his associate expressed equally  his satisfaction and his regret  they walked apart  musing on what they  had just seen and heard  and when they spoke  it was again in the language  of their people      my son hath a tongue that cannot lie   observed metacom  in a soothing   flattering accent   what he hath seen  he tells  and what he tells  is  true  conanchet is not a boy  but a chief whose wisdom is gray  while his  limbs are young  now  why shall not his people take the scalps of these  yengeese  that they may never go any more into holes in the earth  like  cunning foxes       the sachem hath a very bloody mind   returned the young chief  quicker  than was common for men of his station   let the arms of the warriors  rest  till they meet the armed hands of the yengeese  or they will be too  tired to strike heavily  my young men have taken scalps  since the sun  came over the trees  and they are satisfied  why does metacom look so  hard  what does my father see       a dark spot in the middle of a white plain  the grass is not green  it is  red as blood  it is too dark for the blood of a pale face  it is the rich  blood of a great warrior  the rains cannot wash it out  it grows darker  every sun  the snows do not whiten it  it hath been there many winters   the birds scream as they fly over it  the wolf howls  the lizards creep  another way       thine eyes are getting old  fire hath blackened the place  and what thou  seest is coal       the fire was kindled in a well  it did not burn bright  what i see   is blood       wampanoag   rejoined conanchet  fiercely   i have scorched the spot with  the lodges of the yengeese  the grave of my father is covered with scalps  taken by the hand of his son  why does metacom look again  what does the  chief see       an indian town burning in the midst of the snow  the young men struck  from behind  the girls screaming  the children broiling on coals  and  the old men dying like dogs  it is the village of the cowardly  pequots  no  i see better  the yengeese are in the country of the great  narragansett  and the brave sachem is there  fighting  i shut my eyes   for smoke blinds them      conanchet heard this allusion to the recent and deplorable fate of the  principal establishment of his tribe  in sullen silence  for the desire of  revenge  which had been so fearfully awakened  seemed now to be  slumbering  if it were not entirely quelled by the agency of some  mysterious and potent feeling  he rolled his eyes gloomily  from the  apparently abstracted countenance of his artful companion  to those of the  captives  whose fate only awaited his judgment  since the band which had  that morning broken in upon the wish ton wish was  with but few  exceptions  composed of the surviving warriors of his own powerful nation   but  while his look was displeased  faculties that were schooled so  highly  could not easily be mistaken  in what passed  even in the most  cursory manner  before his sight      what sees my father  next   he asked  with an interest he could not  control  detecting another change in the features of metacom      one who is neither white nor red  a young woman  that boundeth like a  skipping fawn  who hath lived in a wigwam  doing nothing  who speaks with  two tongues  who holds her hands before the eyes of a great warrior  till  he is blind as the owl in the sun  i see her       metacom paused  for at that moment a being that singularly resembled this  description appeared before him  offering the reality of the imaginary  picture he was drawing with so much irony and art     the movement of the timid hare is scarce more hurried  or more undecided   than that of the creature who now suddenly presented herself to the  warriors  it was apparent  by the hesitating and half retreating step that  succeeded the light bound with which she came in view  that she dreaded to  advance  while she knew not how far it might be proper to retire  for the  first moment  she stood in a suspended and doubting posture  such as one  might suppose a creature of mist would assume ere it vanished  and then  meeting the eye of conanchet  the uplifted foot retouched the earth  and  her whole form sunk into the modest and shrinking attitude of an indian  girl  who stood in the presence of a sachem of her tribe  as this female  is to enact no mean part in that which follows  the reader may be thankful  for a more minute description of her person     the age of the stranger was under twenty  in form she rose above the usual  stature of an indian maid  though the proportions of her person were as  light and buoyant as at all comported with the fullness that properly  belonged to her years  the limbs  seen below the folds of a short kirtle  of bright scarlet cloth  were just and tapering  even to the nicest  proportions of classic beauty  and never did foot of higher instep  and  softer roundness  grace a feathered moccason  though the person  from the  neck to the knees  was hid by a tightly fitting vest of calico and the  short kirtle named  enough of the shape was visible to betray outlines  that had never been injured  either by the mistaken devices of art or by  the baneful effects of toil  the skin was only visible at the hands  face   and neck  its lustre having been a little dimmed by exposure  a rich  rosy  tint had usurped the natural brightness of a complexion that had once  been fair even to brilliancy  the eye was full  sweet  and of a blue that  emulated the sky of evening  the brows  soft and arched  the nose   straight  delicate  and slightly grecian  the forehead  fuller than that  which properly belonged to a girl of the narragansetts  but regular   delicate  and polished  and the hair  instead of dropping in long straight  tresses of jet black  broke out of the restraints of a band of beaded  wampum  in ringlets of golden yellow     the peculiarities that distinguished this female from the others of her  tribe  were not confined alone to the indelible marks of nature  her step  was more elastic  her gait more erect and graceful  her foot less inwardly  inclined  and her whole movements freer and more decided than those of a  race doomed from infancy to subjection and labor  though ornamented by  some of the prized inventions of the hated race to which she evidently  owed her birth  she had the wild and timid look of those with whom she had  grown into womanhood  her beauty would have been remarkable in any region  of the earth  while the play of muscle  the ingenuous beaming of the eye   and the freedom of limb and action  were such as seldom pass beyond the  years of childhood  among people who  in attempting to improve  so often  mar the works of nature     although the color of the eye was so very different from that which  generally belongs to one of indian origin  the manner of its quick and  searching glance  and of the half alarmed and yet understanding look with  which this extraordinary creature made herself mistress of the more  general character of the assemblage before which she had been summoned   was like the half instinctive knowledge of one accustomed to the constant  and keenest exercise of her faculties  pointing with a finger towards  whittal ring  who stood a little in the background  a low  sweet voice was  heard asking  in the language of the indians       why has conanchet sent for his woman from the woods      the young sachem made no reply  an ordinary spectator could not have  detected about him even a consciousness of the speaker s presence  on the  contrary  he maintained the lofty reserve of a chief engaged in affairs of  moment  however deeply his thoughts might have been troubled  it was not  easy to trace any evidence of the state of his mind in the calmness of  features that appeared habitually immovable  for a single treacherous  instant  only  was a glance of kindness shot towards the timid and  attentive girl  and then throwing the still bloody tomahawk into the  hollow of one arm  while the hand of the other firmly grasped its handle   he remained unchanged in feature  as he was rigid in limb  not so  with  philip  when the intruder first appeared  a dark and lowering gleam of  discontent gathered at his brow  it quickly changed to a look of sarcastic  and biting scorn      does my brother again wish to know what i see   he demanded  when  sufficient time had passed  after the unanswered question of the female   to show that his companion was not disposed to answer      what does the sachem of the wampanoags now behold   returned conanchet   proudly  unwilling to show that any circumstance had occurred to interrupt  the subject of their conference      a sight that his eyes will not believe  he sees a great tribe on the  war path  there are many braves  and a chief whose fathers came from the  clouds  their hands are in the air  they strike heavy blows  the arrow is  swift  and the bullet is not seen to enter  but it kills  blood runs from  the wounds that is of the color of water  now he does not see  but he  hears   tis the scalp whoop  and the warriors are very glad  the chiefs in  the happy hunting grounds are coming  with joy  to meet indians that are  killed  for they know the scalp whoop of their children      the expressive countenance of the young sachem involuntarily responded to  this description of the scene through which he had just passed  and it was  impossible for one so tutored  to prevent the blood from rushing faster to  a heart that ever beat strongly with the wishes of a warrior      what sees my father  next   he asked  triumph insensibly stealing into  the tones of his voice      a messenger  and then he hears  the moccasons of squaws       enough   metacom  the women of the narragansetts have no lodges  their  villages are in coals  and they follow the young men for food       i see no deer  the hunter will not find venison in a clearing of the  pale faces  but the corn is full of milk  conanchet is very hungry  he  hath sent for his woman  that he may eat      the fingers of that hand  which grasped the handle of the tomahawk   appeared to bury themselves in the wood  the glittering axe itself was  slightly raised  but the fierce gleaming of resentment subsided  as the  anger of the young sachem vanished  and a dignified calm again settled on  his countenance      go  wampanoag   he said  waving a hand proudly  as if determined to be no  longer harassed by the language of his wily associate   my young men will  raise the whoop  when they hear my voice  and they will kill deer for  their women  sachem  my mind is my own      philip answered to the look which accompanied these words  with one that  threatened vengeance  but smothering his anger  with his accustomed  wisdom  he left the hill  assuming an air that affected more of  commiseration than of resentment      why has conanchet sent for a woman from the woods   repeated the same  soft voice  nearer to the elbow of the young sachem  and which spoke with  less of the timidity of the sex  now that the troubled spirit of the  indians of those regions had disappeared      narra mattah  come near   returned the young chief  changing the deep and  proud tones in which he had addressed his restless and bold companion in  arms  to those which better suited the gentle ear for which his words were  intended   fear not  daughter of the morning  for those around us are of a  race used to see women at the council fires  now look  with an open  eye  is there anything among these trees that seemeth like an ancient  tradition  hast ever beheld such a valley  in thy dreams  have yonder  pale faces  whom the tomahawks of my young men spared  been led before  thee by the great spirit  in the dark night      the female listened  in deep attention  her gaze was wild and uncertain   and yet it was not absolutely without gleamings of a half reviving  intelligence  until that moment  she had been too much occupied in  conjecturing the subject of her visit  to regard the natural objects by  which she was surrounded  but with her attention thus directly turned upon  them  her organs of sight embraced each and all  with the discrimination  that is so remarkable in those whose faculties are quickened by danger and  necessity  passing from side to side  her swift glances ran over the  distant hamlet  with its little fort  the buildings in the near grounds   the soft and verdant fields  the fragrant orchard  beneath whose leafy  shades she stood  and the blackened tower  that rose in its centre  like  some gloomy memorial  placed there to remind the spectator not to trust  too fondly to the signs of peace and loveliness that reigned around   shaking back the ringlets that had blown about her temples  the wondering  female returned thoughtfully and in silence to her place       tis a village of the yengeese   she said  after a long and expressive  pause   a narragansett woman does not love to look at the lodges of the  hated race       listen   lies have never entered the ears of narra mattah  my tongue hath  spoken like the tongue of a chief  thou didst not come of the sumach  but  of the snow  this hand of thine is not like the hands of the women of my  tribe  it is little  for the great spirit did not make it for work  it is  of the color of the sky in the morning  for thy fathers were born near the  place where the sun rises  thy blood is like spring water  all this thou  knowest  for none have spoken false in thy ear  speak  dost thou never see  the wigwam of thy father  does not his voice whisper to thee  in the  language of his people      the female stood in the attitude which a sibyl might be supposed to  assume  while listening to the occult mandates of the mysterious oracle   every faculty entranced and attentive      why does conanchet ask these questions of his wife  he knows what she  knows  he sees what she sees  his mind is her mind  if the great spirit  made her skin of a different color  he made her heart the same   narra mattah will not listen to the lying language  she shuts her ears   for there is deceit in its sounds  she tries to forget it  one tongue can  say all she wishes to speak to conanchet  why should she look back in  dreams  when a great chief is her husband      the eye of the warrior  as he looked upon the ingenuous and confiding face  of the speaker  was kind to fondness  the firmness had passed away and in  its place was left the winning softness of affection  which  as it belongs  to nature  is seen  at times  in the expression of an indian s eye  as  strongly as it is ever known to sweeten the intercourse of a more polished  condition of life      girl   he said with emphasis  after a moment of thought  as if he would  recall her and himself to more important duties   this is a war path  all  on it are men  thou wast like the pigeon before its wing opens  when i  brought thee from the nest  still the winds of many winters had blown upon  thee  dost never think of the warmth and of the food of the lodge in which  thou hast past so many seasons       the wigwam of conanchet is warm  no woman of the tribe hath as many furs  as narra mattah       he is a great hunter  when they hear his moccason  the beavers lie down  to be killed  but the men of the pale faces hold the plow  does not  the  driven snow  think of those who fenced the wigwam of her father from the  cold  or of the manner in which the yengeese live      his youthful and attentive wife seemed to reflect  but raising her face   with an expression of content that could not be counterfeited  she shook  her head in the negative      does she never see a fire kindled among the lodges  or hear the whoops of  warriors as they break into a settlement       many fires have been kindled before her eyes  the ashes of the  narragansett town are not yet cold       does not narra mattah hear her father speaking to the god of the  yengeese  listen  he is asking favor for his child       the great spirit of the narragansett has ears for his people       but i hear a softer voice   tis a woman of the pale faces among her  children  cannot the daughter hear      narra mattah  or  the driven snow   laid her hand lightly on the arm of  the chief  and she looked wistfully and long into his face  without an  answer  the gaze seemed to deprecate the anger that might be awakened by  what she was about to reveal      chief of my people   she said  encouraged by his still calm and gentle  brow  to proceed   what a girl of the clearings sees in her dreams  shall  not be hid  it is not the lodges of her race  for the wigwam of her  husband is warmer  it is not the food and clothes of a cunning people  for  who is richer than the wife of a great chief  it is not her fathers  speaking to their spirit  for there is none stronger than manitou   narra mattah has forgotten all  she does not wish to think of things like  these  she knows how to hate a hungry and craving race  but she sees one  that the wives of the narragansetts do not see  she sees a woman with a  white skin  her eye looks softly on her child in her dreams  it is not an  eye  it is a tongue  it says  what does the wife of conanchet wish   is  she cold  here are furs  is she hungry  here is venison  is she tired  the  arms of the pale woman open  that an indian girl may sleep  when there is  silence in the lodges  when conanchet and his young men lie down  then  does this pale woman speak  sachem  she does not talk of the battles of  her people  nor of the scalps that her warriors have taken  nor of the  manner in which the pequots and mohicans fear her tribe  she does not tell  how a young narragansett should obey her husband  nor how the women must  keep food in the lodges for the hunters that are wearied  her tongue useth  strange words  it names a mighty and just spirit it telleth of peace  and  not of war  it soundeth as one talking from the clouds  it is like the  falling of the water among rocks  narra mattah loves to listen  for the  words seem to her like the wish ton wish  when he whistles in the woods      conanchet had fastened a look of deep and affectionate interest on the  wild and sweet countenance of the being who stood before him  she had  spoken in that attitude of earnest and natural eloquence that no art can  equal  and when she ceased  he laid a hand  in kind but melancholy  fondness  on the half inclined and motionless head  as he answered      this is the bird of night  singing to its young  the great spirit of  thy fathers is angry  that thou livest in the lodge of a narragansett   his sight is too cunning to be cheated  he knows that the moccason  and  the wampum  and the robe of fur are liars  he sees the color of the  skin beneath       conanchet  no   returned the female hurriedly  and with a decision her  timidity did not give reason to expect   he seeth farther than the skin   and knoweth the color of the mind  he hath forgotten that one of his girls  is missing       it is not so  the eagle of my people was taken into the lodges of the  pale faces  he was young  and they taught him to sing with another tongue   the colors of his feathers were changed  and they thought to cheat the  manitou  but when the door was open  he spread his wings and flew back to  his nest  it is not so  what hath been done is good and what will be done  is better  come  there is a straight path before us      thus saying  conanchet motioned to his wife to follow towards the group of  captives  the foregoing dialogue had occurred in a place where the two  parties were partially concealed from each other by the ruin  but as the  distance was so trifling  the sachem and his companion were soon  confronted with those he sought  leaving his wife a little without the  circle  conanchet advanced  and taking the unresisting and  half unconscious ruth by the arm  he led her forward  he placed the two  females in attitudes where each might look the other full in the face   strong emotion struggled in a countenance which  in spite of its fierce  mask of war paint  could not entirely conceal its workings      see   he said in english  looking earnestly from one to the other   the  good spirit is not ashamed of his work  what he hath done  he hath done   narragansett nor yengeese can alter it  this is the white bird that came  from the sea   he added  touching the shoulder of ruth lightly with a  finger   and this the young  that she warmed under her wing      then  folding his arms on his naked breast  he appeared to summon his  energy  lest  in the scene that he knew must follow  his manhood might be  betrayed into some act unworthy of his name     the captives were necessarily ignorant of the meaning of the scene which  they had just witnessed  so many strange and savage looking forms were  constantly passing and repassing before their eyes  that the arrival of  one  more or less  was not likely to be noted  until she heard conanchet  speak in her native tongue  ruth had lent no attention to the interview  between him and his wife  but the figurative language and no less  remarkable action of the narragansett  had the effect to arouse her  suddenly  and in the most exciting manner  from her melancholy     no child of tender age ever unexpectedly came before the eyes of ruth  heathcote  without painfully recalling the image of the cherub she had  lost  the playful voice of infancy never surprised her ear  without the  sound conveying a pang to the heart  nor could allusion  ever so remote   be made to persons or events that bore resemblance to the sad incidents  of her own life  without quickening the never dying pulses of maternal  love  no wonder  then  that when she found herself in the situation and  under the circumstances described  nature grew strong within her  and that  her mind caught glimpses  however dim and indistinct they might be  of a  truth that the reader has already anticipated  still  a certain and  intelligible clue was wanting  fancy had ever painted her child in the  innocence and infancy in which it had been torn from her arms  and here   while there was so much to correspond with reasonable expectation  there  was little to answer to the long and fondly cherished picture  the  delusion  if so holy and natural a feeling may thus be termed  had been  too deeply seated to be dispossessed at a glance  gazing long  earnestly   and with features that varied with every changing feeling  she held the  stranger at the length of her two arms  alike unwilling to release her  hold  or to admit her closer to a heart which might rightfully be the  property of another      who art thou   demanded the mother  in a voice that was tremulous with  the emotions of that sacred character   speak  mysterious and lovely  being  who art thou      narra mattah had turned a terrified and imploring look at the immovable  and calm form of the chief  as if she sought protection from him at whose  hands she had been accustomed to receive it  but a different sensation  took possession of her mind  when she heard sounds which had too often  soothed the ear of infancy  ever to be forgotten  struggling ceased  and  her pliant form assumed the attitude of intense and entranced attention   her head was bent aside  as if the ear were eager to drink in a repetition  of the tones  while her bewildered and delighted eye still sought the  countenance of her husband      vision of the woods   wilt thou not answer   continued ruth   if there  is reverence for the holy one of israel in thine heart  answer  that i may  know thee       hist  conanchet   murmured the wife  over whose features the glow of  pleased and wild surprise continued to deepen   come near  sachem  the  spirit that talketh to narra mattah in her dreams  is nigh       woman of the yengeese   said the husband advancing with dignity to the  spot   let the clouds blow from thy sight  wife of a narragansett  see  clearly  the manitou of your race speaks strong  he telleth a mother to  know her child      ruth could hesitate no longer  neither sound nor exclamation escaped her   but as she strained the yielding frame of her recovered daughter to her  heart  it appeared as if she strove to incorporate the two bodies into  one  a cry of pleasure and astonishment drew all around her  then came the  evidence of the power of nature when strongly awakened  age and youth  alike acknowledged its potency  and recent alarms were overlooked in the  pure joy of such a moment  the spirit of even the lofty minded conanchet  was shaken  raising the hand  at whose wrist still hung the bloody  tomahawk  he veiled his face  and  turning aside  that none might see the  weakness of so great a warrior  he wept           chapter xxvi            one sees more devils than vast hell can hold     that is  the madman          midsummer night s dream       on quitting the hill  philip had summoned his wampanoags  and  supported  by the obedient and fierce annawon  a savage that might  under better  auspices  have proved a worthy lieutenant to caesar  he left the fields of  wish ton wish  accustomed to see these sudden outbreakings of temper in  their leaders  the followers of conanchet  who would have preserved their  air of composure under far more trying circumstances  saw him depart   equally without question and without alarm  but when their own sachem  appeared on the ground which was still red with the blood of the  combatants  and made known his intention to abandon a conquest that seemed  more than half achieved  he was not heard without murmuring  the authority  of an indian chief is far from despotic  and though there is reason to  think it is often aided  if not generated  by the accidental causes of  birth and descent  it receives its main support in the personal qualities  of him who rules  happily for the narragansett leader  even his renowned  father  the hapless miantonimoh  had not purchased a higher name for  wisdom  or for daring  than that which had been fairly won by his still  youthful son  the savage humors and the rankling desire for vengeance in  the boldest of his subalterns  were made to quail before the menacing  glances of an eye that seldom threatened without performance  nor was  there one of them all  when challenged to come forth to brave the anger  or to oppose the eloquence of his chief  who did not shrink from a contest  which habitual respect had taught them to believe would be far too unequal  for success  within less than an hour after ruth had clasped her child to  her bosom the invaders had altogether disappeared  the dead of their party  were withdrawn and concealed  with all the usual care  in order that no  scalp of a warrior might be left in the hands of his enemies     it was not unusual for the indians to retire satisfied with the results of  their first blow  so much of their military success was dependent on  surprise  that it oftener happened the retreat commenced with its failure   than that victory was obtained by perseverance     so long as the battle raged  their courage was equal to all its dangers   but among people who made so great a merit of artifice  it is not at all  surprising that they seldom put more to the hazard than was justified by  the most severe discretion  when it was known  therefore  that the foe had  disappeared in the forest  the inhabitants of the village were more ready  to believe the movement was the result of their own manful resistance   than to seek motives that might not prove so soothing to their  self esteem  the retreat was thought to be quite in rule  and though  prudence forbade pursuit  able and well limbed scouts were sent on their  trail  as well to prevent a renewal of the surprise  as to enable the  forces of the colony to know the tribe of their enemies  and the direction  which they had taken     then came a scene of solemn ceremonies and of deep affliction  though the  parties led by dudley and the lieutenant had been so fortunate as to  escape with a few immaterial wounds  the soldiers headed by content  with  the exception of those already named  had fallen to a man  death had  struck  at a blow  twenty of the most efficient individuals  out of that  isolated and simple community  under circumstances in which victory was so  barren and so dearly bought  sorrow was a feeling far stronger than  rejoicing  exultation took the aspect of humility  and while men were  conscious of their well deserving  they were the more sensible of their  dependence on a power they could neither influence nor comprehend  the  characteristic opinions of the religionists became still more exalted  and  the close of the day was quite as remarkable for an exhibition of the  peculiarly exaggerated impressions of the colonists  as its opening had  been frightful in violence and blood     when one of the more active of the runners returned with the news that the  indians had retired through the forest with a broad trail  a sure sign  that they meditated no further concealment near the valley  and that they  had already been traced many miles on their retreat  the villagers  returned to their usual habitations  the dead were then distributed among  those who claimed the nearest right to the performance of the last duties  of affection  and it might have been truly said  that mourning had taken  up its abode in nearly every dwelling  the ties of blood were so general  in a society thus limited  and  where they failed  the charities of life  were so intimate and so natural  that not an individual of them all  escaped  without feeling that the events of the day had robbed him  for  ever  of some one on whom he was partially dependent for comfort or  happiness     as the day drew towards its close  the little bell again summoned the  congregation to the church  on this solemn occasion  but few of those who  still lived to hear its sounds were absent  the moment when meek arose for  prayer was one of general and intense feeling  the places so lately  occupied by those who had fallen were now empty  and they resembled so  many eloquent blanks in the description of what had passed  expressing far  more than any language could impart  the appeal of the divine was in his  usual strain of sublimated piety  mysterious insights into the hidden  purposes of providence being strangely blended with the more intelligible  wants and passions of man  while he gave heaven the glory of the victory   he spoke with a lofty and pretending humility of the instruments of its  power  and although seemingly willing to acknowledge that his people  abundantly deserved the heavy blow which had alighted on them  there was  an evident impatience of the agents by which it had been inflicted  the  principles of the sectarian were so singularly qualified by the feelings  of the borderer  that one subtle in argument would have found little  difficulty in detecting flaws in the reasoning of this zealot  but as so  much was obscured by metaphysical mists  and so much was left for the  generalities of doctrine  his hearers  without an exception  made such an  application of what he uttered  as apparently rendered every mind  satisfied     the sermon was as extemporaneous as the prayer  if any thing can come  extempore from a mind so drilled and fortified in opinion  it contained  much the same matter  delivered a little less in the form of an  apostrophe  the stricken congregation  while they were encouraged with the  belief that they were vessels set apart for some great and glorious end of  providence  were plainly told that they merited far heavier affliction  than this which had now befallen  and they were reminded that it was their  duty to desire even condemnation  that he who framed the heavens and the  earth might be glorified  then they heard comfortable conclusions  which  might reasonably teach them to expect  that though in the abstract such  were the obligations of the real christian  there was good reason to think  that all who listened to doctrines so pure would be remembered with an  especial favor     so useful a servant of the temple as meek wolfe did not forget the  practical application of his subject  it is true  that no visible emblem  of the cross was shown to excite his hearers  nor were they stimulated to  loosen blood hounds on the trail of their enemies  but the former was kept  sufficiently before the mind s eye by constant allusions to its merits   and the indians were pointed at as the instruments by which the great  father of evil hoped to prevent  the wilderness from blossoming like the  rose   and  yielding the sweet savors of godliness   philip and conanchet  were openly denounced  by name  some dark insinuations being made  that  the person of the former was no more than the favorite tenement of moloch   while the hearer was left to devise a suitable spirit for the government  of the physical powers of the other  from among any of the more evil  agencies that were named in the bible  any doubts of the lawfulness of the  contest  that might assail tender consciences  were brushed away by a bold  and decided hand  there was no attempt at justification  however  for all  difficulties of this nature were resolved by the imperative obligations of  duty  a few ingenious allusions to the manner in which the israelites  dispossessed the occupants of judea  were of great service in this  particular part of the subject  since it was not difficult to convince  men  who so strongly felt the impulses of religious excitement  that they  were stimulated rightfully  fortified by this advantage  mr  wolfe  manifested no desire to avoid the main question  he affirmed that if the  empire of the true faith could be established by no other means  a  circumstance which he assumed it was sufficiently apparent to all  understandings could not be done  he pronounced it the duty of young and  old  the weak and the strong  to unite in assisting to visit the former  possessors of the country with what he termed the wrath of an offended  deity  he spoke of the fearful slaughter of the preceding winter  in which  neither years nor sex had been spared  as a triumph of the righteous  cause  and as an encouragement to persevere  then  by a transition that  was not extraordinary in an age so remarkable for religious subtleties   meek returned to the more mild and obvious truths which pervade the  doctrines of him whose church he professed to uphold  his hearers were  admonished to observe lives of humility and charity  and were piously  dismissed  with his benediction  to their several homes     the congregation quitted the building with the feelings of men who thought  themselves favored by peculiar and extraordinary intelligences with the  author of all truth  while the army of mahomet itself was scarcely less  influenced by fanaticism than these blinded zealots  there was something  so grateful to human frailty in reconciling their resentments and their  temporal interests to their religious duties  that it should excite little  wonder when we add that most of them were fully prepared to become  ministers of vengeance in the hands of any bold leader  while the  inhabitants of the settlement were thus struggling between passions so  contradictory  the shades of evening gradually fell upon their village   and then came darkness  with the rapid strides with which it follows the  setting of the sun in a low latitude     some time before the shadows of the trees were getting the grotesque and  exaggerated forms which precede the last rays of the luminary  and while  the people were still listening to their pastor  a solitary individual was  placed on a giddy eyrie  whence he might note the movements of those who  dwelt in the hamlet  without being the subject of observation himself  a  short spur of the mountain projected into the valley  on the side nearest  to the dwelling of the heathcotes  a little tumbling brook  which the  melting of the snows and the occasionally heavy rains of the climate  periodically increased into a torrent  had worn a deep ravine in its rocky  bosom  time  and the constant action of water  aided by the driving storms  of winter and autumn  had converted many of the different faces of this  ravine into wild looking pictures of the residences of men  there was  however one spot  in particular  around which a closer inspection than  that which the distance of the houses in the settlement offered  might  have detected far more plausible signs of the agency of human hands  than  any that were afforded by the fancied resemblances of fantastic angles and  accidental formations     precisely at that point where a sweep of the mountain permitted the best  view of the valley  did the rocks assume the wildest  the most confused   and consequently the most favorable appearance for the construction of any  residence which it was desirable should escape the curious eyes of the  settlers  at the same time that it possessed the advantage of overlooking  their proceedings  a hermit would have chosen the place as a spot suited  to distant and calm observation of the world  while it was every way  adapted to solitary reflection and ascetic devotion  all who have  journeyed through the narrow and water worn vineyards and meadows which  are washed by the rhone  ere that river pours its tribute into the lake of  leman  have seen some such site  occupied by one who has devoted his life  to seclusion and the altar  overhanging the village of st  maurice  in the  canton of le valais  but there is an air of obtrusiveness in the swiss  hermits age that did not belong to the place of which we write  since the  one is perched upon its high and narrow ledge  as if to show the world in  what dangerous and circumscribed limits god may be worshipped  while the  other sought exemption from absolute solitude  while it courted secrecy  with the most jealous caution  a small hut had been erected against the  side of the rock  in a manner that presented an oblique angle  care had  been taken to surround it with such natural objects as left little reason  to apprehend that its real character could be known by any who did not  absolutely mount to the difficult shelf on which it stood  light entered  into this primitive and humble abode by a window that looked into the  ravine  and a low door opened on the side next the valley  the  construction was partly of stone and partly of logs  with a roof of bark  and a chimney of mud and sticks     one who  by his severe and gloomy brow  was a fit possessor of so secluded  a tenement  was  at the hour named  seated on a stone at the most salient  angle of the mountain  and at the place where the eye commanded the widest  and least obstructed view of the abodes of man in the distance  stones had  been rolled together in a manner to form a little breastwork in his front   so that  had there been any wandering gaze sweeping over the face of the  mountain  it was far from probable that it would have detected the  presence of a man whose whole form  with the exception of the superior  parts  was so effectually concealed     it would have been difficult to say  whether this secluded being had thus  placed himself in order to indulge in some habitual and fancied  communication with the little world of the valley  or whether  he sat at  his post in watchfulness  there was an appearance of each of these  occupations in his air  for at times his eye was melancholy and softened   as if his spirit found pleasure in the charities natural to the species   and at others  the brows contracted with sternness  while the lips became  more than usually compressed  like those of a man who threw himself on his  own innate resolution for support     the solitude of the place  the air of universal quiet which reigned above   the boundless leafy carpet over which the eye looked from that elevated  point  and the breathing stillness of the bosom of the woods  united to  give grandeur to the scene  the figure of the tenant of the ravine was as  immovable as any other object of the view  it seemed  in all but color and  expression  of stone  an elbow was leaning on the little screen in front   and the head was supported by a hand  at the distance of an arrow s  flight  the eye might readily have supposed it no more than another of the  accidental imitations which had been worn in the rock by the changes of  centuries  an hour passed  and scarce a limb had been changed  or a muscle  relieved  either contemplation  or the patient awaiting of some looked for  event  appeared to suspend the ordinary functions of life  at length  an  interruption occurred to this extraordinary inaction  a rustling  not  louder than that which would have been made by the leap of a squirrel  was  first heard in the bushes above  it was succeeded by a crackling of  branches  and then a fragment of a rock came bounding down the precipice   until it shot over the head of the still motionless hermit  and fell  with  a noise that drew a succession of echoes from the caverns of the place   into the ravine beneath     notwithstanding the suddenness of this interruption  and the extraordinary  fracas with which it was accompanied  he  who might be supposed to be most  affected by it  manifested none of the usual symptoms of fear or surprise   he listened intently  until the last sound had died away  but it was with  expectation rather than with alarm  arising slowly  he looked warily about  him  and then walking with a quick step along the ledge which led to his  hut  he disappeared through its door  in another minute  however  he was  again seen at his former post  a short carabine  such as was then used by  mounted warriors  lying across his knee  if doubt or perplexity beset the  mind of this individual  at so palpable a sign that the solitude he  courted was in danger of being interrupted  it was not of a nature  sufficiently strong to disturb the equanimity of his aspect  a second time  the branches rustled  and the sounds proceeded from a lower part of the  precipice as if the foot that caused the disturbance was in the act of  descending  though no one was visible the nature of the noise could no  longer be mistaken  it was evidently the tread of a human foot  for no  beast of a weight sufficient to produce so great an impression  would have  chosen to rove across a spot where the support of hands was nearly as  necessary as that of the other limbs      come forward   said he who in all but the accessories of dress and  hostile preparation might so well be termed a hermit   i am already here      the words were not given to the air  for one suddenly appeared on the  ledge at the side next the settlement  and within twenty feet of the  speaker  when glance met glance  the surprise which evidently took  possession of the intruder and of him who appeared to claim a better right  to be where they met  seemed mutual  the carabine of the latter  and a  musket carried by the former  fell into the dangerous line of aim at the  same instant  and an a moment they were thrown upwards again  as if a  common impulse controlled them  the resident signed to the other to draw  nigher  and  then every appearance of hostility disappeared in that sort  of familiarity which confidence begets      how is it   said the former to his guest  when both were calmly seated  behind the little screen of stones   that thou hast fallen upon this  secret place  the foot of stranger hath not often trod these rocks  and no  man before thee hath ever descended the precipice       a moccason is sure   returned the other with indian brevity   my father  hath a good eye  he can see very far from the door of his lodge       thou knowest that the men of my color speak often to their good spirit   and they do not love to ask his favor in the highways  this place is  sacred to his holy name      the intruder was the young sachem of the narragansetts  and he who   notwithstanding this plausible apology  so palpably sought secrecy rather  than solitude was the man that has often been introduced into these pages  under the shade of mystery  the instant recognition and the mutual  confidence require no further explanation  since enough has already been  developed in the course of the narrative  to show that they were no  strangers to each other  still the meeting had not taken place without  uneasiness on the one part  and great though admirably veiled surprise on  the other  as became his high station and lofty character  the bearing of  conanchet betrayed none of the littleness of a vulgar curiosity  he met  his ancient acquaintance with the calm dignity of his rank  and it would  have been difficult for the most inquiring eye to have detected a  wandering glance  a single prying look  or any other sign that he deemed  the place at all extraordinary for such an interview  he listened to the  little explanation of the other  with grave courtesy  and suffered a short  time to elapse before he made any reply      the manitou of the pale men   he then said  should be pleased with my  father  his words are often in the ears of the great spirit  the trees and  the rocks know them       like all of a sinful and fallen race   returned the stranger with the  severe air of the age   i have much need of my askings  but why dost thou  think that my voice is so often heard in this secret place      the finger of conanchet pointed to the worn rock at his feet  and his eye  glanced furtively at the beaten path which led between the spot and the  door of the lodge      a yengeese hath a hard heel  but it is softer than stone  the hoof of the  deer would pass many times  to leave such a trail       thou art quick of eye  narragansett  and yet thy judgment may be  deceived  my tongue is not the only one that speaketh to the god of  my people      the sachem bent his head slightly  in acquiescence  as if unwilling to  press the subject  but his companion was not so easily satisfied  for he  felt the consciousness of a fruitless attempt at deception goading him to  some plausible means of quieting the suspicions of the indian      that i am now alone  may be matter of pleasure or of accident   he added    thou knowest that this hath been a busy and a bloody day among the  pale men  and there are dead and dying in their lodges  one who hath no  wigwam of his own may have found time to worship by himself       the mind is very cunning   returned conanchet   it can hear when the ear  is deaf  it can see when the eye is shut  my father hath spoken to the  good spirit  with the rest of his tribe      as the chief concluded  he pointed significantly towards the distant  church  out of which the excited congregation we have described was  at that moment pouring into the green and little trodden street of  the hamlet  the other appeared to understand his meaning  and  at the  same instant  to feel the folly  as well as the uselessness  of  attempting any longer to mislead one that already knew so much of his  former mode of life      indian  thou sayest true   he rejoined gloomily  the mind seeth far  and  it seeth often in the bitterness of sorrow  my spirit was communing with  the spirits of those thou seest  when thy step was first heard  besides  thine own  the feet of man never mounted to this place  except it be of  those who minister to my bodily wants  thou sayest true  the mental sight  is keen  and far beyond those distant hills  on which the last rays of the  setting sun are now shining so gloriously  doth mine often bear me in  spirit  thou wast once my fellow lodger  youth  and much pleasure had i in  striving to open thy young mind to the truths of our race  and to teach  thee to speak with the tongue of a christian  but years have passed  away  hark  there cometh one up the path  hast thou dread of a yengeese      the calm mien with which conanchet had been listening  changed to a cold  smile  his hand had felt for the lock of the musket  some time before his  companion had betrayed any consciousness of the approaching footstep  but  until questioned  no change of countenance was visible      is my father afraid for his friend   he asked  pointing in the direction  of him who approached   is it an armed warrior       no  he cometh with the means of sustaining a burthen that must be borne   until it pleaseth him who knoweth what is good for all his creatures to  ease me of it  it may be the parent of her thou hast this day restored to  her friends  or it may be the brother  for  at times  i owe this kindness  to different members of that worthy family      a look of intelligence shot across the swarthy features of the chief  his  decision appeared taken  arising  he left his weapon at the feet of his  companion  and moved swiftly along the ledge  as if to meet the intruder   in another instant he returned  bearing a little bundle closely enveloped  in belts of richly beaded wampum  placing the latter gently by the side of  the old man  for time had changed the color of the solitary s hair to  gray  he said  in a low  quick voice  pointing with significance at what  he had done       the messenger will not go back with an empty hand  my father is wise  he  will say what is good      there was little time for further explanation  the door of the hut had  scarcely closed on conanchet  before mark heathcote appeared at the point  where the path bent around the angle of the precipice      thou knowest what hath passed  and wilt suffer me to depart with brief  discourse   said the young man  placing food at the feet of him he came to  seek   ha  what hast here   didst gain this in the fray of the morning       it is booty that i freely bestow  take it to the house of thy father  it  is left with that object  now tell me of the manner in which death hath  dealt with our people  for thou knowest that necessity drove me from among  them  so soon as liberty was granted      mark showed no disposition to gratify the other s wish  he gazed on the  bundle of conanchet  as if his eye had never before looked on a similar  object  and keenly contending passions were playing about a brow that  was seldom as tranquil as suited the self denying habits of the times  and country      it shall be done  narragansett   he said  speaking between his clenched  teeth   it shall be done   then turning on his heel  he stalked along the  giddy path with a rapidity of stride that kept the other in fearful  suspense for his safety  until his active form had disappeared     the recluse arose  and sought the occupant of his humble abode      come forth   he said  opening the narrow door for the passage of the  chief   the youth hath departed with thy burthen  and thou art now alone  with an ancient associate      conanchet reappeared at the summons  but it was with an eye less glowing  and a brow less stern than when he entered the little cabin  as he moved  slowly to the stone he had before occupied  his step was arrested for a  moment  and a look of melancholy regret seemed to be cast at the spot  where he had laid the bundle  conquering his feelings  however  in the  habitual self command of his people  he resumed his seat  with the air of  one that was grave by nature  while he appeared to exert no effort in  order to preserve the admirable equanimity of his features  a long and  thoughtful silence succeeded  and then the solitary spoke      we have made a friend of the narragansett chief   he said   and this  league with philip is broken       yengeese   returned the other   i am full of the blood of sachems       why should the indian and the white do each other this violence  the  earth is large  and there is place for men of all colors and of all  nations on its surface       my father hath found but little   said the other  bestowing such a  cautious glance at the narrow limits of his host  as at once betrayed  the sarcastic purport of his words  while it equally bespoke the  courtesy of his mind      a light minded and vain prince is seated on the throne of a once godly  nation  chief  and darkness has again come over a land which of late  shone with a clear and shining light  the just are made to flee from the  habitations of their infancy  and the temples of the elect are abandoned  to the abominations of idolatry  oh england  england  when will thy cup of  bitterness be full   when shall this judgment pass from thee  my spirit  groaneth over thy fall  yea  my inmost soul is saddened with the spectacle  of thy misery      conanchet was too delicate to regard the glazed eye and flushed forehead  of the speaker  but he listened in amazement and in ignorance  such  expressions had often met his ear before  and though his tender years had  probably prevented their producing much effect  now  that he again heard  them in his manhood  they conveyed no intelligible meaning to his mind   suddenly laying a finger on the knee of his companion  he said       the arm of my father was raised on the side of the yengeese  to day  yet  they give him no seat it their council fire       the sinful man  who ruleth in the island whence my people came  hath an  arm that is long as his mind is vain  though debarred from the councils of  this valley  chief  time hath been  when my voice was heard in councils  that struck heavily at the power of his race  these eyes have seen justice  done on him who gave existence to the double tongued instrument of belial   that now governeth a rich and glorious realm       my father hath taken the scalp of a great chief       i helped to take his head   returned the solitary  a ray of bitter  exultation gleaming through the habitual austerity of his brow      come   the eagle flies above the clouds  that he may move his wings  freely  the panther leaps longest on the widest plain  the biggest fish  swim in the deep water  my father cannot stretch himself between these  rocks  he is too big to lie down in a little wigwam  the woods are wide   let him change the color of his skin  and be a gray head at the  council fire of my nation  the warriors will listen to what he says  for  his hand hath done a strong deed       it may not be  it may not be  narragansett that which hath been generated  in the spirit  must abide  and it would be  easier for the blackamoor to  become white  or for the leopard to change his spots   than for one who  hath felt the power of the lord  to cast aside his gifts  but i meet thy  proffers of amity in a charitable and forgiving spirit  my mind is ever  with my people  yet is there place for other friendships  break then this  league with the evil minded and turbulent philip  and let the hatchet be  for ever buried in the path between thy village and the towns of the  yengeese       where is my village  there is a dark place near the islands on the shores  of the great lake  but i see no lodges       we will rebuild thy towns  and people them anew  let there be peace  between us       my mind is ever with my people   returned the indian  repeating the  other s words  with an emphasis that could not be mistaken     a long and melancholy pause succeeded  and when the conversation was  renewed  it had reference to those events which had taken place in the  fortunes of each  since the time when they were both tenants of the  block house that stood amid the ancient habitations of the heathcotes   each appeared too well to comprehend the character of the other  to  attempt any further efforts towards producing a change of purpose  and  darkness had gathered about the place  before they arose to enter the hut  of the solitary           chapter xxvii            sleep  thou hast been a grandsire  and begot    a father to me  and thou hast created    a mother and two brothers        cymbeline      the short twilight was already passed  when old mark heathcote ended the  evening prayer  the mixed character of the remarkable events of that day  had given birth to a feeling  which could find no other relief than that  which flowed from the usual zealous  confiding  and exalted outpouring of  the spirit  on the present occasion  he had even resorted to an  extraordinary  and  what one less devout might be tempted to think  a  supererogatory offering of thanksgiving and praise  after dismissing the  dependants of the establishment  supported by the arm of his son  he had  withdrawn into an inner apartment  and there  surrounded only by those who  had the nearest claims on his affections  the old man again raised his  voice to laud the being  who  in the midst of so much general grief  had  deigned to look upon his particular race with the eyes of remembrance and  of favor  he spoke of his recovered grand child by name  and he dealt with  the whole subject of her captivity among the heathen  and her restoration  to the foot of the altar  with the fervor of one who saw the wise decrees  of providence in the event  and with a tenderness of sentiment that age  was far from having extinguished  it was at the close of this private and  peculiar worship  that we return into the presence of the family     the spirit of reform had driven those  who so violently felt its  influence  into many usages that  to say the least  were quite as  ungracious to the imagination  as the customs they termed idolatrous were  obnoxious to the attacks of their own unaccommodating theories  the first  protestants had expelled so much from the service of the altar  that  little was left for the puritan to destroy  without incurring the risk of  leaving it naked of its loveliness  by a strange substitution of subtlety  for humility  it was thought pharisaical to bend the knee in public  lest  the great essential of spiritual worship might be supplanted by the more  attainable merit of formula  and while rigid aspects  and prescribed  deportments of a new character  were observed with all the zeal of  converts  ancient and even natural practices were condemned  chiefly  we  believe  from that necessity of innovation which appears to be an  unavoidable attendant of all plans of improvement  whether they are  successful or the reverse  but though the puritans refused to bow their  stubborn limbs when the eye of man was on them  even while asking boons  suited to their own sublimated opinions  it was permitted to assume in  private an attitude which was thought to admit of so gross an abuse   inasmuch as it infers a claim to a religious vitality  while in truth the  soul might only be slumbering in the security of mere moral pretension     on the present occasion  they who worshipped in secret had bent their  bodies to the humblest posture of devotion  when ruth heathcote arose from  her knees  it was with a hand clasped in that of the child whom her recent  devotion was well suited to make her think had been rescued from a  condition far more gloomy than that of the grave  she had used a gentle  violence to force the wondering being at her side to join  so far as  externals could go  in the prayer  and  now it was ended  she sought the  countenance of her daughter  in order to read the impression the scene had  produced  with all the solicitude of a christian  heightened by the  tenderest maternal love     narra mattah  as we shall continue to call her  in air  expression  and  attitude  resembled one who had a fancied existence in the delusion of  some exciting dream  her ear remembered sounds which had so often been  repeated in her infancy  and her memory recalled indistinct recollections  of most of the objects and usages that were so suddenly replaced before  her eyes  but the former now conveyed their meaning to a mind that had  gained its strength under a very different system of theology  and the  latter came too late to supplant usages that were rooted in her affections  by the aid of all those wild and seductive habits  that are known to  become nearly unconquerable in those who have long been subject to their  influence  she stood  therefore  in the centre of the grave   self restrained group of her nearest kin  like an alien to their blood   resembling some timid and but half tamed tenant of the air  that human art  had endeavored to domesticate  by placing it in the society of the more  tranquil and confiding inhabitants of the aviary     notwithstanding the strength of her affections  and her devotion to all  the natural duties of her station  ruth heathcote was not now to learn the  manner in which she was to subdue any violence in their exhibition  the  first indulgence of joy and gratitude was over  and in its place appeared  the never tiring  vigilant  engrossing  but regulated watchfulness  which  the events would naturally create  the doubts  misgivings  and even  fearful apprehensions  that beset her  were smothered in an appearance of  satisfaction  and something like gleamings of happiness were again seen  playing about a brow that had so long been clouded with an unobtrusive  but corroding care      and thou recallest thine infancy  my ruth   asked the mother  when the  respectful period of silence  which ever succeeded prayer in that family   was passed   thy thoughts have not been altogether strangers to us  but  nature hath had its place in thy heart  tell us  child  of thy wanderings  in the forest  and of the sufferings that one so tender must have  undergone among a barbarous people  there is pleasure in listening to all  thou hast seen and felt  now that we know there is an end to unhappiness      she spoke to an ear that was deaf to language like this  narra mattah  evidently understood her words  while their meaning was wrapped in an  obscurity that she neither wished to nor was capable of comprehending   keeping a gaze  in which pleasure and wonder were powerfully blended  on  that soft look of affection which beamed from her mother s eye  she felt  hurriedly among the folds of her dress  and drawing a belt that was gaily  ornamented after the most ingenious fashion of her adopted people  she  approached her half pleased  half distressed parent  and  with hands that  trembled equally with timidity and pleasure  she arranged it around her  person in a manner to show its richness to the best advantage  pleased  with her performance  the artless being eagerly sought approbation in eyes  that bespoke little else than regret  alarmed at an expression she could  not translate  the gaze of narra mattah wandered  as if it sought support  against some sensation to which she was a stranger  whittal ring had  stolen into the room  and missing the customary features of her own  cherished home  the looks of the startled creature rested on the  countenance of the witless wanderer  she pointed eagerly at the work of  her hands  appealing by an eloquent and artless gesture to the taste of  one who should know whether she had done well      bravely   returned whittal  approaching nearer to the subject of his  admiration    tis a brave belt  and none but the wife of a sachem could  make so rare a gift      the girl folded her arms meekly on her bosom  and again appeared satisfied  with herself and with the world      here is the hand of him visible who dealeth in all wickedness   said the  puritan   to corrupt the heart with vanities  and to mislead the  affections by luring them to the things of life  is the guile in which he  delighteth  a fallen nature lendeth but too ready aid  we must deal with  the child in fervor and watchfulness  or better that her bones were lying  by the side of those little ones of thy flock  who are already inheritors  of the promise      respect kept ruth silent  but  while she sorrowed over the ignorance of  her child  natural affection was strong at her heart  with the tact of a  woman and the tenderness of a mother  she both saw and felt that severity  was not the means to effect the improvement they desired  taking a seat  herself  she drew her child to her person  and  first imploring silence by  a glance at those around her  she proceeded  in a manner that was dictated  by the mysterious influence of nature  to fathom the depth of her  daughter s mind      come nearer  narra mattah   she said  using the name to which the other  would alone answer   thou art still in thy youth  my child  but it hath  pleased him whose will is law  to have made thee the witness of many  changes in this varying life  tell me if thou recallest the days of  infancy  and if thy thoughts ever returned to thy father s house  during  those weary years thou wast kept from our view      ruth used gentle force to draw her daughter nearer while speaking  and  the latter sunk into that posture from which she had just arisen   kneeling  as she had often done in infancy  at her mother s side  the  attitude was too full of tender recollections not to be grateful  and the  half alarmed being of the forest was suffered to retain it during most of  the dialogue that followed  but while she was thus obedient in person  by  the vacancy or rather wonder of an eye that was so eloquent to express all  the emotions and knowledge of which she was the mistress  narra mattah  plainly manifested that little more than the endearment of her mother s  words and manner was intelligible  ruth saw the meaning of her hesitation   and  smothering the pang it caused  she endeavored to adapt her language  to the habits of one so artless      even the gray heads of thy people were once young   she resumed   and  they remember the lodges of their fathers  does my daughter ever think of  the time when she played among the children of the pale faces      the attentive being at the knee of ruth listened greedily  her knowledge  of the language of her childhood had been sufficiently implanted before  her captivity  and it had been too often exercised by intercourse with the  whites  and more particularly with whittal ring  to leave her in any doubt  of the meaning of what she now heard  stealing a timid look over a  shoulder  she sought the countenance of martha  and  studying her  lineaments for near a minute with intense regard  she laughed aloud in the  contagious merriment of an indian girl      thou hast not forgotten us  that glance at her who was the companion of  thy infancy assures me  and we shall soon again possess our ruth in  affection  as we now possess her in the body  i will not speak to thee of  that fearful night when the violence of the savage robbed us of thy  presence  not of the bitter sorrow which beset us at thy loss  but there  is one who must still be known to thee  my child  he who sitteth above the  clouds  who holdeth the earth in the hollow of his hand  and who looketh  in mercy on all that journey on the path to which his own finger pointeth   hath he yet a place in thy thoughts  thou rememberest his holy name  and  still thinkest of his power      the listener bent her head aside  as if to catch the full meaning of what  she heard  the shadows of deep reverence passing over a face that had so  lately been smiling  after a pause  she audibly murmured the word       manitou       manitou  or jehovah  god  or king of kings  and lord of lords  it  mattereth little which term is used to express his power  thou knowest him  then  and hast never ceased to call upon his name       narra mattah is a woman  she is afraid to speak to the manitou aloud  he  knows the voices of the chiefs  and opens his ears when they ask help      the puritan groaned  but ruth succeeded in quelling her own anguish  lest  she should disturb the reviving confidence of her daughter      this may be the manitou of an indian   she said   but it is not the  christian s god  thou art of a race which worships differently  and it is  proper that thou shouldst call on the name of the deity of thy fathers   even the narragansett teacheth this truth  thy skin is white  and thy ears  should hearken to the traditions of the men of thy blood      the head of the daughter drooped at this allusion to her color as if she  would fain conceal the mortifying truth from every eye  but she had not  time for answer ere whittal ring drew near  and pointing to the burning  color of her cheeks  that were deepened as much with shame as with the  heats of an american sun  he said       the wife of the sachem hath begun to change  she will soon be like  nipset  all red  see   he added laying a finger on a part of his own arm  where the sun and the winds had not yet destroyed the original color   the  evil spirit poured water into his blood too  but it will come out again   as soon as he is so dark that the evil spirit will not know him  he will  go on the war path  and then the lying pale faces may dig up the bones of  their fathers  and move towards the sun rise  or his lodge will be lined  with hair of the color of a deer       and thou  my daughter  canst thou hear this threat against the people of  thy nation  of thy blood  of thy god  without a shudder      the eye of narra mattah seemed in doubt  still it regarded whittal with  its accustomed look of kindness  the innocent  full of his imaginary  glory  raised his hand in exultation  and by gestures that could not  easily be misunderstood  he indicated the manner in which he intended to  rob his victims of the usual trophy  while the youth was enacting the  disgusting but expressive pantomime  ruth watched the countenance of her  child in nearly breathless agony  she would have been relieved by a single  glance of disapprobation  by a solitary movement of a rebellious muscle   or by the smallest sign that the tender nature of one so lovely  and  otherwise so gentle  revolted at so unequivocal evidence of the barbarous  practices of her adopted people  but no empress of rome could have  witnessed the dying agonies of the hapless gladiator  no consort of a more  modern prince could read the bloody list of the victims of her husband s  triumph  nor any betrothed fair listen to the murderous deeds of him her  imagination had painted as a hero  with less indifference to human  suffering  than that with which the wife of the sachem of the  narragansetts looked on the mimic representation of those exploits which  had purchased for her husband a renown so highly prized  it was but too  apparent that the representation  rude and savage as it was  conveyed to  her mind nothing but pictures in which the chosen companion of a warrior  should rejoice  the varying features and answering eye too plainly  proclaimed the sympathy of one taught to exult in the success of the  combatant  and when whittal  excited by his own exertions  broke out into  an exhibition of a violence more ruthless even than common  he was openly  rewarded by another laugh  the soft  exquisitely feminine tones of this  involuntary burst of pleasure  sounded in the ears of ruth like a knell  over the moral beauty of her child  still subduing her feelings  she  passed a hand thoughtfully over her own pallid brow  and appeared to muse  long on the desolation of a mind that had once promised to be so pure     the colonists had not yet severed all those natural ties which bound them  to the eastern hemisphere  their legends  their pride  and in many  instances their memories  aided in keeping alive a feeling of amity  and  it might be added of faith  in favor of the land of their ancestors  with  some of their descendants  even to the present hour  the  beau ideal  of  excellence  in all that pertains to human qualities and human happiness   is connected with the images of the country from which they sprung   distance is known to cast a softening mist  equally over the moral and  physical vision  the blue outline of mountain which melts into its glowing  background of sky  is not more pleasing than the pictures which fancy  sometimes draws of less material things  but  as he draws near  the  disappointed traveller too often finds nakedness and deformity  where he  so fondly imagined beauty only was to be seen  no wonder then that the  dwellers of the simple provinces of new england blended recollections of  the country they still called home  with most of their poetical pictures  of life  they retained the language  the books  and most of the habits  of  the english  but different circumstances  divided interests  and peculiar  opinions  were gradually beginning to open those breaches which time has  since widened  and which promises soon to leave little in common between  the two people  except the same forms of speech and a common origin  it is  to be hoped that some charity may be blended with these ties     the singularly restrained habits of the religionists  throughout the whole  of the british provinces  were in marked opposition to the mere  embellishments of life  the arts were permitted only as they served its  most useful and obvious purposes  with them  music was confined to the  worship of god  and  for a long time after the original settlement  the  song was never known to lead the mind astray from what was conceived to be  the one great object of existence  no verse was sung  but such as blended  holy ideas with the pleasures of harmony  nor were the sounds of revelry  ever heard within their borders  still  words adapted to their particular  condition had come into use  and though poetry was neither a common nor a  brilliant property of the mind  among a people thus disciplined in ascetic  practices  it early exhibited its power in quaint versification  that was  always intended  though with a success it is almost pardonable to doubt   to redound to the glory of the deity  it was but a natural enlargement of  this pious practice  to adapt some of these spiritual songs to the  purposes of the nursery     when ruth heathcote passed her hand thoughtfully across her brow  it was  with a painful conviction that her dominion over the mind of her child  was sadly weakened  if not lost for ever  but the efforts of maternal love  are not easily repulsed  an idea flashed upon her brain  and she proceeded  to try the efficacy of the experiment it suggested  nature had endowed her  with a melodious voice  and an ear that taught her to regulate sounds in a  manner that seldom failed to touch the heart  she possessed the genius of  music  which is melody  unweakened by those exaggerated affectations with  which it is often encumbered by what is pretendingly called science   drawing her daughter nearer to her knee  she commenced one of the songs  then much used by the mothers of the colony  her voice scarcely rising  above the whispering of the evening air  in its first notes  but gradually  gaining  as she proceeded  the richness and compass that a strain so  simple required     at the first low breathing notes of this nursery song  narra mattah became  as motionless as if her rounded and unfettered form had been wrought in  marble  pleasure lighted her eyes  as strain succeeded strain  and ere the  second verse was ended  her look  her attitude  and every muscle of her  ingenuous features  were eloquent in the expression of delight  ruth did  not hazard the experiment without trembling for its result  emotion  imparted feeling to the music  and when  for the third time in the course  of her song  she addressed her child  the saw the soft blue eyes that  gazed wistfully on her face swimming in tears  encouraged by this  unequivocal evidence of success  nature grew still more powerful in its  efforts  and the closing verse was sung to an ear that nestled near her  heart  as it had often done during the early years of narra mattah while  listening to its melancholy melody     content was a quiet but an anxious witness of this touching evidence of a  reviving intelligence between his wife and child  he best understood the  look that beamed in the eyes of the former  while her arms were  with  extreme caution  folded around her who still leaned upon her bosom  as if  fearful one so timid might be frightened from her security by any sudden  or unaccustomed interruption  a minute passed in the deepest silence  even  whittal ring was lulled into quiet  and long and sorrowing years had  passed since ruth enjoyed moments of happiness so pure and unalloyed  the  stillness was broken by a heavy step in the outer room  a door was thrown  open by a hand more violent than common  and then young mark appeared  his  face flushed with exertion  his brow seemingly retaining the frown of  battle  and with a tread that betrayed a spirit goaded by some fierce and  unwelcome passion  the burthen of conanchet was on his arm  he laid it  upon a table  then pointing  in a manner that appeared to challenge  attention  he turned  and left the room as abruptly as he had entered     a cry of joy burst from the lips of narra mattah  the instant the beaded  belts caught her eye  the arms of ruth relaxed their hold in surprise  and  before amazement had time to give place to more connected ideas  the wild  being at her knee had flown to the table  returned  resumed her former  posture  opened the folds of the cloth  and was holding before the  bewildered gaze of her mother the patient features of an indian babe     it would exceed the powers of the unambitious pen we wield  to convey to  the reader a just idea of the mixed emotions that struggled for mastery in  the countenance of ruth  the innate and never dying sentiment of maternal  joy was opposed by all those feelings of pride  that prejudice could not  fail to implant even in the bosom of one so meek  there was no need to  tell the history of the parentage of the little suppliant  who already  looked up into her face  with that peculiar calm which renders his race so  remarkable  though its glance was weakened by infancy  the dark glittering  eye of conanchet was there  there were also to be seen the receding  forehead and the compressed lip of the father  but all these marks of his  origin were softened by touches of that beauty which had rendered the  infancy of her own child so remarkable      see   said narra mattah  raising the infant still nearer to the riveted  gaze of ruth    tis a sachem of the red men  the little eagle hath left  his nest too soon      ruth could not resist the appeal of her beloved  bending her head low  so  as entirely to conceal her own flushed face  she imprinted a kiss on the  forehead of the indian boy  but the jealous eye of the young mother was  not to be deceived  narra mattah detected the difference between the cold  salute and those fervent embraces she had herself received  and  disappointment produced a chill about her own heart  replacing the folds  of the cloth with quiet dignity  she arose from her knees  and withdrew in  sadness to a distant corner of the room  there she took a seat  and with a  glance that might almost be termed reproachful  she commenced a low indian  song to her infant      the wisdom of providence is in this  as in all its dispensations    whispered content over the shoulder of his nearly insensible partner    had we received her as she was lost  the favor might have exceeded  our deservings  our daughter is grieved that thou turnest a cold eye  on her babe      the appeal was sufficient for one whose affections had been wounded rather  than chilled  it recalled ruth to recollection  and it served at once to  dissipate the shades of regret that had been unconsciously permitted to  gather around her brow  the displeasure  or it would be more true to term  it sorrow  of the young mother was easily appeased  a smile on her infant  brought the blood back to her heart in a swift and tumultuous current  and  ruth  herself  soon forgot that she had any reason for regret  in the  innocent delight with which her own daughter now hastened to display the  physical excellence of the boy  from this scene of natural feeling   content was too quickly summoned by the intelligence that some one without  awaited his presence  on business of the last importance to the welfare of  the settlement           chapter xxviii            it will have blood  they say  blood    will have blood        macbeth       the visiters were dr  ergot  the reverend meek wolfe  ensign dudley  and  reuben ring  content found these four individuals seated in an outer room   in a grave and restrained manner  that would have done no discredit to the  self command of an indian council  he was saluted with those staid and  composed greetings which are still much used in the intercourse of the  people of the eastern states of this republic  and which have obtained for  them a reputation  where they are little known  of a want of the more  active charities of our nature  but that was peculiarly the age of  sublimated doctrines  of self mortification  and of severe moral  government  and most men believed it a merit to exhibit  on all  occasions  the dominion of the mind over the mere animal impulses  the  usage  which took its rise in exalted ideas of spiritual perfection  has  since grown into a habit  which  though weakened by the influence of the  age  still exists to a degree that often leads to an erroneous estimate of  character     at the entrance of the master of the house  there was some such decorous  silence as that which is known to precede the communications of the  aborigines  at length ensign dudley  in whom matter  most probably in  consequence of its bulk  bore more than an usual proportion to his less  material part  manifested some evidences of impatience that the divine  should proceed to business  thus admonished  or possibly conceiving that a  sufficient concession had been made to the dignity of man s nature  meek  opened his mouth to speak      captain content heathcote   he commenced  with that mystical involution  of his subject which practice had rendered nearly inseparable from all his  communications   captain content heathcote  this hath been a day of awful  visitations  and of gracious temporal gifts  the heathen hath been smitten  severely by the hand of the believer  and the believer hath been made to  pay the penalty of his want of faith  by the infliction of a savage  agency  azazel hath been loosened in our village  the legions of  wickedness have been suffered to go at large in our fields  and yet the  lord hath remembered his people  and hath borne them through a trial of  blood as perilous as was the passage of his chosen nation through the  billows of the red sea  there is cause of mourning  and cause of joy  in  this manifestation of his will  of sorrow that we have merited his anger   and of rejoicing that enough of redeeming grace hath been found to save  the gomorrah of our hearts  but i speak to one trained in spiritual  discipline  and schooled in the vicissitudes of the world  and further  discourse is not necessary to quicken his apprehension  we will therefore  turn to more instant and temporal exercises  have all of thy household  escaped unharmed throughout the strivings of this bloody day       we praise the lord that such hath been his pleasure   returned content    other than as sorrow hath assailed us through the mourning of friends the  blow hath fallen lightly on me and mine       thou hast had thy season  the parent ceaseth to chastise  while  former punishments are remembered  but here is sergeant ring  with  matter to communicate  that may still leave business for thy courage  and thy wisdom      content turned his quiet look upon the yeoman  and seemed to await his  speech  reuben ring  who was a man of many solid and valuable qualities   would most probably have been exercising the military functions of his  brother in law  at that very moment  had he been equally gifted with a  fluent discourse  but his feats lay rather in doing than in speaking  and  the tide of popularity had in consequence set less strongly in his favor  than might have happened had the reverse been the case  the present   however  was a moment when it was necessary to overcome his natural  reluctance to speak  and it was not long before he replied to the  inquiring glance of his commander s eye      the captain knows the manner in which we scourged the savages at the  southern end of the valley   the sturdy yeoman began   and it is not  necessary to deal with the particulars at length  there were  six and twenty red skins slain in the meadows  besides as many more that  left the ground in the arms of their friends  as for the people  we got a  few hurts  but each man came back on his own limbs       this is much as the matter hath been reported       then there was a party sent to brush the woods on the trail of the  indians   resumed reuben  without appearing to regard the interruption    the scouts broke off in pairs in the duty  and finally men got to  searching singly  of which number i was one  the two men of whom there is  question        of what men dost speak   demanded content      the two men of whom there is question   returned the other  continuing  the direct course of his own manner of relating events  without appealing  to see the necessity of connecting the threads of his communication   the  men of whom i have spoken to the minister and the ensign        proceed   said content  who understood his man      after one of these men was brought to his end i saw no reason for making  the day bloodier than it already was  the more especially as the lord had  caused it to begin with a merciful hand which shed its bounties on my own  dwelling  under such an opinion of right doing  the other was bound and  led into the clearings       thou hast made a captive      the lips of reuben scarce severed as he muttered a low assent  but the  ensign dudley took upon himself the duty of entering into further  explanations  which the point where his kinsman left the narrative enabled  him to do with sufficient intelligence      as the sergeant hath related   he said   one of the heathen fell  and the  other is now without  waiting a judgment in the matter of his fortune       i trust there is no wish to harm him   said content  glancing an eye  uneasily around at his companions   strife hath done enough in our  settlement this day  the sergeant hath a right to claim the scalp bounty   for the man that is slain  but for him that liveth  let there be mercy       mercy is a quality of heavenly origin   replied meek wolfe   and it  should not be perverted to defeat the purposes of heavenly wisdom  azazel  must not triumph  though the tribe of the narragansetts should be swept  with the besom of destruction  truly  we are an erring and a fallible  race  captain heathcote  and the greater  therefore  the necessity that we  submit  without rebellion  to the inward monitors that are implanted  by  grace  to teach us the road of our duty          i cannot consent to shed blood  now that the strife hath ceased   hastily  interrupted content   praised be providence  we are victors  and it is  time to lean to councils of charity       such are the deceptions of a short sighted wisdom   returned the divine   his dim  sunken eye shining with the promptings of an exaggerated and  subtle spirit   the end of all is good  and we may not  without mortal  danger  presume to doubt the suggestions of heavenly gifts  but there is  not question here concerning the execution of the captive  since he  proffereth to be of service in far greater things than any that can depend  on his life or death  the heathen rendered up his liberty with little  struggle  and hath propositions that may lead us to a profitable  conclusion of this day s trials       if he can aid in aught that shall shorten the perils and wantonness of  this ruthless war  he shall find none better disposed to listen than i       he professeth ability to do that service       then  of heaven s mercy  let him be brought forth  that we counsel on his  proposals      meek made a gesture to sergeant ring  who quitted the apartment for a  moment  and shortly after returned followed by his captive  the indian was  one of those dark and malignant looking savages that possess most of the  sinister properties of their condition  with few or none of the redeeming  qualities  his eye was lowering and distrustful  bespeaking equally  apprehension and revenge  his form of that middling degree of perfection  which leaves as little to admire as to condemn  and his attire such is  denoted him one who might be ranked among the warriors of a secondary  class  still  in the composure of his mien  the tranquillity of his step   and the self possession of all his movements  he displayed that high  bearing  his people rarely fail to exhibit  ere too much intercourse with  the whites begins to destroy their distinctive traits      here is the narragansett   said reuben ring  causing his prisoner to  appear in the centre of the room   he is no chief  as may be gathered from  his uncertain look       if he effect that of which there hath been question  his rank mattereth  little  we seek to stop the currents of blood that flow like running  water  in these devoted colonies       this will he do   rejoined the divine   or we shall hold him answerable  for breach of promise       and in what doth he profess to aid in stopping the work of death       by yielding the fierce philip  and his savage ally   the roving  conanchet  to the judgment  those chiefs destroyed  our temple may be  entered in peace  and the voice of thanksgiving shall again rise in our  bethel  without the profane interruption of savage shrieks      content started  and even recoiled a step  as he listened to the nature of  the proposed peace offering      and have we warranty for such a proceeding  should this man prove true    he asked  in a voice that sufficiently denoted his own doubts of the  propriety of such a measure      there is the law  the necessities of a suffering nature  and god s  glory  for our justification   drily returned the divine      this outsteppeth the discreet exercise of a delegated authority  i like  not to assume so great power  without written mandates for its execution       the objection hath raised a little difficulty in my own mind   observed  ensign dudley   and as it hath set thoughts at work  it is possible that  what i have to offer will meet the captain s good approbation      content knew that his ancient servitor was  though often uncouth in its  exhibition  at the bottom a man of humane heart  on the other hand  while  he scarce admitted the truth to himself  he had a secret dread of the  exaggerated sentiments of his spiritual guide  and he consequently  listened to the interruption of eben  with a gratification he scarcely  wished to conceal      speak openly   he said   when men counsel in a matter of this weight   each standeth on the surety of his proper gifts       then may this business be dispatched without the embarrassment the  captain seems to dread  we have an indian  who offers to lead a party  through the forests to the haunts of the bloody chiefs  therein bringing  affairs to the issue of manhood and discretion       and wherein do you propose any departure from the suggestions that have  already been made      ensign dudley had not risen to his present rank  without acquiring a  suitable portion of the reserve which is so often found to dignify  official sentiments  having ventured the opinion already placed  however  vaguely  before his hearers  he was patiently awaiting its effects on the  mind of his superior  when the latter  by his earnest and unsuspecting  countenance  no less than by the question just given  showed that he was  still in the dark as to the expedient the subaltern wished to suggest      i think there will be no necessity for making more captives   resumed  eben   since the one we have appears to create difficulties in our  councils  if there be any law in the colony  which says that men must  strike with a gentle hand in open battle  it is a law but little spoken of  in common discourse  and though no pretender to the wisdom of legislators   i will make bold to add  it is a law that may as well be forgotten until  this outbreaking of the savages shall be quelled       we deal with an enemy that never stays his hand at the cry of mercy    observed meek wolfe   and though charity be the fruit of christian  qualities  there is a duty greater than any which belongeth to earth  we  are no more than weak and feeble instruments in the hands of providence   and as such our minds should not be hardened to our inward promptings  if  evidence of better feeling could be found in the deeds of the heathen  we  might raise our hopes to the completion of things  but the powers of  darkness still rage in their hearts  and we are taught to believe that the  tree is known by its fruits      content signed to all to await his return  and left the room  in another  minute  he was seen leading his daughter into the centre of the circle   the half alarmed young woman clasped her swaddled boy to her bosom  as she  gazed timidly at the grave faces of the borderers  and her eye recoiled in  fear  when its hurried glance met the sunken  glazed  excited  and yet  equivocal looking organ of the reverend mr  wolfe      thou hast said that the savage never hearkens to the cry of mercy    resumed content   here is living evidence that thou hast spoken in error   the misfortune that early befell my family  is not unknown to any in this  settlement  thou seest in this trembling creature the daughter of our  love  her we have so long mourned  the wept of my household is again with  us  our hearts have been oppressed  they are now gladdened  god hath  returned our child      there was a deep  rich pathos in the tones of the father  that affected  most of his auditors  though each manifested his sensibilities in a manner  suited to his particular habits of mind  the nature of the divine was  touched  and all the energies of his severe principles were wanting to  sustain him above the manifestation of a weakness that he might have  believed derogatory to his spiritual exaltation of character  he therefore  sat mute  with hands folded on his knee  betraying the struggles of an  awakened sympathy only by a firmer compression of the interlocked fingers   and an occasional and involuntary movement of the stronger muscles of the  face  dudley suffered a smile of pleasure to lighten his broad  open  countenance  and the physician  who had hitherto been merely a listener   uttered a few low syllables of admiration of the physical perfection of  the being before him  with which there was mingled some evidence of  natural good feeling     reuben ring was the only individual who openly betrayed the whole degree  of the interest he took in the restoration of the lost female  the stout  yeoman arose  and  moving to the entranced narra mattah  he took the  infant into his large hands  and for a moment the honest borderer gazed  at the boy with a wistful and softened eye  then raising the diminutive  face of the infant to his own expanded and bold features  he touched its  cheek with his lips  and returned the babe to its mother  who witnessed  the whole proceeding in some such tribulation as the startled wren  exhibits when the foot of the urchin is seen to draw too near the nest  of its young      thou seest that the hand of the narragansett hath been stayed   said  content  when a deep silence had succeeded this little movement  and  speaking in a tone which betrayed hopes of victory      the ways of providence are mysterious   returned meek   wherein they  bring comfort to the heart  it is right that we exhibit gratitude  and  wherein they are charged with present affliction  it is meet to bow  with humbled spirits to their orderings  but the visitations on  families are merely       he paused  for at that moment a door opened  and a party entered bearing a  burthen  which they deposited  with decent and grave respect  on the  floor  in the very centre of the room  the unceremonious manner of the  entrance  the assured and the common gravity of their air  proclaimed that  the villagers felt their errand to be a sufficient apology for this  intrusion  had not the business of the past day naturally led to such a  belief  the manner and aspects of those who had borne the burthen would  have announced it to be a human body      i had believed that none fell in this day s strife  but those who met  their end near my own door   said content  after a long  respectful  and  sorrowing pause   remove the face cloth  that we may know on whom the blow  hath fallen      one of the young men obeyed  it was not easy to recognise  through the  mutilations of savage barbarity  the features of the sufferer  but a  second and steadier look showed the gory and still agonized countenance of  the individual who had  that morning  left the wish ton wish on the  message of the colonial authorities  even men as practised as those  present  in the horrible inventions of indian cruelty  turned sickening  away from a spectacle that war calculated to chill the blood of all who  had not become callous to human affliction  content made a sign to cover  the miserable remnants of mortality  and hid his face  with a shudder     it is not necessary to dwell on the scene that followed  meek wolfe  availed himself of this unexpected event  to press his plan on the  attention of the commanding officer of the settlement  who was certainly  far better disposed to listen to his proposals  than before this palpable  evidence of the ruthless character of their enemies was presented to his  view  still content listened with reluctance  nor was it without the  intention of exercising an ulterior discretion in the case  that he  finally consented to give orders for the departure of a body of men  with  the approach of the morning light  as much of the discourse was managed  with those half intelligible allusions that distinguished men of their  habits  it is probable that every individual present had his own  particular views of the subject  though it is certain  one and all  faithfully believed that he was solely influenced by a justifiable regard  to his temporal interest  which was in some degree rendered still more  praiseworthy by a reference to the service of his divine master     as the party returned  dudley lingered a moment  alone  with his former  master  the face of the honest meaning ensign was charged with more than  its usual significance  and he even paused a little  after all were beyond  hearing  ere he could muster resolution to propose the subject that was so  evidently uppermost in his mind      captain content heathcote   he at length commenced   evil or good comes  not alone in this life  thou hast found her that we sought with so much  pain and danger  but thou hast found with her more than a christian  gentleman can desire  i am a man of humble station  but i may make bold to  know what should be the feelings of a father  whose child is restored   replenished by such an over bountiful gift       speak plainer   said content  firmly      then i would say  that it may not be grateful to one who taketh his place  among the best in this colony  to have an offspring with an indian cross  of blood  and over whose birth no rite of christian marriage hath been  said  here is abundance  a woman of exceeding usefulness in a  newly settled region  hath made reuben a gift of three noble boys this  very morning  the accession is little known  and less discoursed of  in  that the good wife is accustomed to such liberality  and that the day hath  brought forth still greater events  now a child  more or less  to such a  woman  can neither raise question among the neighbors  nor make any  extraordinary difference to the household  my brother ring would be happy  to add the boy to his stock  and should there be any remarks concerning  the color of the younker  at a future day  it should give no reason of  surprise  had the whole four been born  on the day of such an inroad  red  as metacom himself       content heard his companion to the end  without interruption  his  countenance  for a single instant  as the meaning of the ensign became  unequivocal  reddened with a worldly feeling to which he had long been a  stranger  but the painful expression as quickly disappeared  and in its  place reigned the meek submission to providence that habitually  characterized his mien      that i have been troubled with this vain thought  i shall not deny   he  answered   but the lord hath given me strength to resist  it is his will  that one sprung of heathen lineage shall come beneath my roof  and let his  will be done  my child  and all that are hers  are welcome      ensign dudley pressed the point no further  and they separated           chapter xxix            tarry a little   there is something else        merchant of venice       we shift the scene  the reader will transport himself from the valley of  the wish ton wish  to the bosom of a deep and dark wood     it may be thought that such scenes have been too often described to need  any repetition  still  as it is possible that these pages may fall into  the hands of some who have never quitted the older members of the union   we shall endeavor to give them a faint impression concerning the  appearance of the place to which it has become our duty to transfer the  action of the tale     although it is certain that inanimate  like animate nature  has its  period  the existence of the tree has no fixed and common limit  the oak   the elm  and the linden  the quick growing sycamore and the tall pine  has  each its own laws for the government of its growth  its magnitude  and its  duration  by this provision of nature  the wilderness  in the midst of so  many successive changes  is always maintained at the point nearest to  perfection  since the accessions are so few and gradual as to preserve its  character     the american forest exhibits in the highest degree the grandeur of repose   as nature never does violence to its own laws  the soil throws out the  plant which it is best qualified to support  and the eye is not often  disappointed by a sickly vegetation  there ever seems a generous emulation  in the trees  which is not to be found among others or different  families  when left to pursue their quiet existence in the solitude of the  fields  each struggles towards the light  and an equality in bulk and a  similarity in form are thus produced  which scarce belong to their  distinctive characters  the effect may be easily imagined  the vaulted  arches beneath are filled with thousands of high  unbroken columns  which  sustain one vast and trembling canopy of leaves  a pleasing gloom and an  imposing silence have their interminable reign below  while an outer and  another atmosphere seems to rest on the cloud of foliage     while the light plays on the varying surface of the tree tops  one sombre  and little varied hue colors the earth  dead and moss covered logs  mounds  covered with decomposed vegetable substances  the graves of long past  generations of trees  cavities left by the fall of some uprooted trunk   dark fungi  that flourish around the decayed roots of those about to lose  their hold  with a few slender and delicate plants of a minor growth  and  which best succeed in the shade  form the accompaniments of the lower  scene  the whole is tempered  and in summer rendered grateful  by a  freshness which equals that of the subterranean vault  without possessing  any of its chilling dampness  in the midst of this gloomy solitude  the  foot of man is rarely heard  an occasional glimpse of the bounding deer or  trotting moose  is almost the only interruption on the earth itself  while  the heavy bear or leaping panther  is  at long intervals  met seated on  the branches of some venerable tree  there are moments  too  when troops  of hungry wolves are found hunting on the trail of the deer  but these are  seen rather as exceptions to the stillness of the place  than as  accessories that should properly be introduced into the picture  even the  birds are  in common  mute  or when they do break the silence  it is in a  discordance that suits the character of their wild abode     through such a scene two men were industriously journeying  on the day  which succeeded the inroad last described  they marched as wont  one after  the other  the younger and more active leading the way through the  monotony of the woods  as accurately and as unhesitatingly as the mariner  directs his course by the aid of the needle over the waste of waters  he  in front was light  agile  and seemingly unwearied  while the one who  followed was a man of heavy mould  whose step denoted less practice in the  exercise of the forest  and possibly some failing of natural vigor      thine eye  narragansett  is an unerring compass by which to steer  and  thy leg a never wearied steed   said the latter  casting the butt of his  musket on the end of a mouldering log  while he leaned on the barrel for  support   if thou movest on the war path with the same diligence as thou  usest in our errand of peace  well may the colonists dread thy enmity      the other turned  and without seeking aid from the gun which rested  against his shoulder  he pointed at the several objects he named  and  answered       my father is this aged sycamore  it leans against the young  oak  conanchet is a straight pine  there is great cunning in gray hairs    added the chief stepping lightly forward until a finger rested on the arm  of submission   can they tell the time when we shall lie under the moss  like a dead hemlock       that exceedeth the wisdom of man  it is enough  sachem  if when we fall   we may say with truth  that the land we shadowed is no poorer for our  growth  thy bones will lie in the earth where thy fathers trod  but mine  may whiten in the vault of some gloomy forest      the quiet of the indian s face was disturbed  the pupils of his dark eyes  contracted  his nostrils dilated  and his full chest heaved  and then all  reposed  like the sluggish ocean  after a vain effort to heave its waters  into some swelling wave  during a general calm      fire hath scorched the prints of my father s moccasons from the earth    he said  with a smile that was placid though bitter   and my eyes cannot  find them  i shall die under that shelter   pointing through an opening in  the foliage to the blue void   the falling leaves will cover my bones       then hath the lord given us a new bond of friendship  there is a  yew tree and a quiet church yard in a country afar  where generations of  my race sleep in their graves  the place is white with stones  that bear  the name of         submission suddenly ceased to speak  and when his eye was raised to that  of his companion  it was just in time to detect the manner in which the  curious interest of the latter changed suddenly to cold reserve  and to  note the high courtesy of the air with which the indian turned the  discourse      there is water beyond the little hill   he said   let my father drink and  grow stronger  that he may live to lie in the clearings      the other bowed  and they proceeded to the spot in silence  it would seem   by the length of time that was now lost in taking the required  refreshment  that the travellers had journeyed long and far  the  narragansett ate more sparingly  however  than his companion  for his mind  appeared to sustain a weight that was far more grievous than the fatigue  which had been endured by the body  still his composure was little  disturbed outwardly  for during the silent repast he maintained the air of  a dignified warrior  rather than that of a man whose air could be much  affected by inward sorrow  when nature was appeased  they both arose   and continued their route through the pathless forest     for an hour after quitting the spring  the progress of our two adventurers  was swift  and uninterrupted by any passing observation or momentary  pause  at the end of that time  however  the speed of conanchet began to  slacken  and his eye  instead of maintaining its steady and forward  direction  was seen to wander with some of the appearance of indecision      thou hast lost those secret signs by which we have so far threaded the  woods   observed his companion   one tree is like another  and i see no  difference in this wilderness of nature  but if thou art at fault  we may  truly despair of our object       here is the nest of the eagle   returned conanchet  pointing at the  object he named perched on the upper and whitened branches of a dead pine    and my father may see the council tree in this oak  but there are no  wampanoags       there are many eagles in this forest  nor is that oak one that may not  have its fellow  thine eye hath been deceived  sachem  and some false sign  hath led us astray      conanchet looked at his companion attentively  after a moment  he  quietly asked       did my father ever mistake his path  in going from his wigwam to the  place where he looked upon the house of his great spirit       the matter of that often travelled path was different  narragansett  my  foot had worn the rock with many passings  and the distance was a span   but we have journeyed through leagues of forest  and our route hath lain  across brook and hill  through brake and morass  where human vision hath  not been able to detect the smallest sign of the presence of man       my father is old   said the indian  respectfully   his eye is not as  quick as when he took the scalp of the great chief  or he would know the  print of a moccason  see   making his companion observe the mark of a  human foot that was barely discernible by the manner in which the dead  leaves had been displaced   his rock is worn  but it is harder than the  ground  he cannot tell by its signs who passed  or when       here is truly that which ingenuity may portray as the print of man s  foot  but it is alone  and may be some accident of the wind       let my father look on every side  he will see that a tribe hath passed       this may be true  though my vision is unequal to detect that thou wouldst  show  but if a tribe hath passed  let us follow      conanchet shook his head  and spread the fingers of his two hands in a  manner to describe the radii of a circle      hugh   he said  starting even while he was thus significantly answering  by gestures   a moccason comes      submission  who had so often and so recently been arrayed against the  savages  involuntarily sought the lock of his carbine  his look and action  were menacing  though his roving eye could see no object to excite alarm     not so conanchet  his quicker and more practised vision soon caught a  glimpse of the warrior who was approaching  occasionally concealed by the  trunks of trees  and whose tread on the dried leaves had first betrayed  his proximity  folding his arms on his naked bosom  the narragansett  chief awaited the coming of the other  in an attitude of calmness and  dignity  neither did he speak nor suffer a muscle to play  until a hand  was placed on one of his arms  and he who had drawn near said  in tones  of amity and respect       the young sachem hath come to look for his brother       wampanoag  i have followed the trail  that your ears may listen to the  talk of a pale face      the third person in this interview was metacom he shot a haughty and  fierce glance at the stranger  and then turned to his companion in arms   with recovered calmness  to reply      has conanchet counted his young men since they raised the whoop   he  asked  in the language of the aborigines   i saw many go into the fields   that never came back  let the white men die       wampanoag  he is led by the wampum of a sachem  i have not counted my  young men  but i know that they are strong enough to say that what their  chief hath promised shall be done       if the yengeese is a friend of my brother  he is welcome  the wigwam of  metacom is open  let him enter it      philip made a sign for the others to follow  and led the way to the place  he had named     the spot chosen by philip for his temporary encampment  was suited to such  a purpose  there was a thicket  denser than common  on one of its sides  a  steep and high rock protected and sheltered its rear  a swift and wide  brook dashed over fragments that had fallen  with time  from the precipice  in its front  and towards the setting sun  a whirlwind had opened a long  and melancholy glade through the forest  a few huts of brush leaned  against the base of the hill  and the scanty implements of their domestic  economy were scattered among the habitations of the savages  the whole  party did not number twenty  for  as has been said  the wampanoag had  acted latterly more by the agency of his allies  than with the materials  of his own proper force     the three were soon seated on a rock whose foot was washed by the rapid  current of the tumbling water  a few gloomy looking and fierce indians  watched the conference  in the back ground      my brother hath followed my trail  that my ears may hear  the words of a  yengeese   philip commenced  after a sufficient period had elapsed to  escape the imputation of curiosity   let him speak       i have come singly into the jaws of the lion  restless and remorseless  leader of the savages   returned the bold exile   that you may hear the  words of peace  why hath the son seen the acts of the english so  differently from the father  massassoit was a friend of the persecuted and  patient pilgrims who have sought rest and refuge in this bethel of the  faithful  but thou hast hardened thy heart to their prayers  and seekest  the blood of those who wish thee no wrong  doubtless thy nature is one of  pride and mistaken vanities  like that of all thy race  and it hath seemed  needful to the vain glory of thy name and nation to battle against men of  a different origin  but know there is one who is master of all here on  earth  as he is king of heaven  it is his pleasure that the sweet savor of  his worship should arise from the wilderness  his will is law  and they  that would withstand do but kick against the pricks  listen then to  peaceful counsels  that the land may be parcelled justly to meet the wants  of all  and the country be prepared for the incense of the altar      this exhortation was uttered in a deep and almost unearthly voice  and  with a degree of excitement that was probably increased by the intensity  with which the solitary had lately been brooding over his peculiar  opinions  and the terrible scenes in which he had so recently been an  actor  philip listened with the high courtesy of an indian prince   unintelligible as was the meaning of the speaker  his countenance betrayed  no gleaming of impatience  his lip no smile of ridicule  on the contrary   a noble and lofty gravity reigned in every feature  and ignorant as he was  of what the other wished to say  his attentive eye and bending head  expressed every wish to comprehend      my pale friend hath spoken very wisely   he said  when the other ceased  to speak   but he doth not see clearly in these woods  he sits too much in  the shade  his eye is better in a clearing  metacom is not a fierce beast   his claws are worn out  his legs are tired with travelling  he cannot jump  far  my pale friend wants to divide the land  why trouble the great spirit  to do his work twice  he gave the wampanoags their hunting grounds  and  places on the salt lake to catch their fish and clams  and he did not  forget his children the narragansetts  he put them in the midst of the  water  for he saw that they could swim  did he forget the yengeese  or did  he put them in a swamp  where they would turn into frogs and lizards       heathen  my voice shall never deny the bounties of my god  his hand hath  placed my fathers in a fertile land  rich in the good things of the world   fortunate in position  sea girt and impregnable  happy is he who can find  justification in dwelling within its borders      an empty gourd lay on the rock at the side of metacom  bending over the  stream  he filled it to the brim with water  and held the vessel before  the eyes of his companions      see   he said  pointing to the even surface of the fluid   so much hath  the great spirit said it shall hold  now   he added  filling the hollow  of the other hand from the brook  and casting its contents into the gourd    now my brother knows that some must come away  it is so with his country   there is no longer room in it for my pale friend       did i attempt to deceive thine ears with this tale  i should lay  falsehood to my soul  we are many  and sorry am i to say that some among  us are like unto them that were called  legion   but to say that there  is not still place for all to die where they are born  is to utter  damning untruth       the land of the yengeese is then good  very good   returned philip   but  their young men like one that is better       thy nature  wampanoag  is not equal to comprehend the motives which have  led us hither  and our discourse is getting vain       my brother conanchet is a sachem  the leaves that fall from the trees of  his country  in the season of frosts  blow into my hunting grounds  we are  neighbors and friends   slightly bending his head to the narragansett    when a wicked indian runs from the islands to the wigwams of my people   he is whipt and sent back  we keep the path between us open  only for  honest red men      philip spoke with a sneer  that his habitual loftiness of manner did not  conceal from his associate chief  though it was so slight as entirely to  escape the observation of him who was the subject of his sarcasm  the  former took the alarm  and for the first time during the dialogue did he  break silence      my pale father is a brave warrior   said the young sachem of the  narragansetts   his hand took the scalp of the great sagamore of  his people      the countenance of metacom changed instantly  in place of the ironical  scorn that was gathering about his lip  its expression became serious and  respectful  he gazed steadily at the hard and weather beaten features of  his guest  and it is probable that words of higher courtesy than any he  had yet used would have fallen from him  had not  at that moment  a signal  been given  by a young indian set to watch on the summit of the rock  that  one approached  both metacom and conanchet appeared to hear this cry with  some uneasiness  neither however arose  nor did either betray such  evidence of alarm as denoted a deeper interest in the interruption  than  the circumstances might very naturally create a warrior was shortly seen  entering the encampment  from the side of the forest which was known to  lie in the direction of the wish ton wish     the moment conanchet saw the person of the newly arrived man  his eye and  attitude resumed their former repose  though the look of metacom still  continued gloomy and distrustful  the difference in the manner of the  chiefs was not however sufficiently strong to be remarked by submission   who was about to resume the discourse  when the new comer moved past the  cluster of warriors in the encampment  and took his seat near them  on a  stone so low  that the water laved his feet  as usual there was no  greeting between the indians for some moments  the three appearing to  regard the arrival as a mere thing of course  but the uneasiness of  metacom prompted a communication sooner than common      mohtucket   he said  in the language of their tribe   hath lost the  trail of his friends  we thought the crows of the pale men were picking  his bones       there was no scalp at his belt  and mohtucket was ashamed to be seen  among the young men with an empty hand       he remembered that he had too often come back without striking a dead  enemy   returned metacom  about whose firm mouth lurked an expression of  ill concealed contempt   has he now touched a warrior      the indian  who was merely a man of the inferior class  held up the trophy  which hung at his girdle to the examination of his chief  metacom looked  at the disgusting object with the calmness and nearly with the interest   that a virtuoso would lavish on an antique memorial of some triumph of  former ages  his finger was thrust through a hole in the skin  and then   while he resumed his former position  he observed drily       a bullet hath hit the head  the arrow of mohtucket doth little harm       metacom hath never looked on his young man like a friend  since the  brother of mohtucket was killed      the glance that philip cast at his underling  though it was not unmingled  with suspicion  was one of princely and savage scorn  their white auditor  had not been able to understand the discourse  but the dissatisfaction and  uneasiness of the eyes of both were too obvious not to show that the  conference was far from being amicable      the sachem hath discontent with his young man   he observed   and from  this may he understand the nature of that which leadeth many to quit the  land of their fathers  beneath the rising sun  to come to this wilderness  in the west  if he will now listen  i will touch further on the business  of my errand  and deal more at large with the subject we have but so  lightly skimmed      philip manifested attention  he smiled on his guest  and even bowed his  assent to the proposal  still his keen eye seemed to read the soul of his  subordinate  through the veil of his gloomy visage  there was a play of  the fingers of his right hand  when the arm fell from its position across  his bosom to his thigh  as if they itched to grasp the knife whose  buck horn handle lay within a few inches of their reach  yet his air to  the white man was composed and dignified  the latter was again about to  speak  when the arches of the forest suddenly rung with the report of a  musket  all in and near the encampment sprung to their feet at the  well known sound  and yet all continued as motionless as if so many dark  but breathing statues had been planted there  the rustling of leaves was  heard  and then the body of the young indian  who had been posted on the  rock  rolled to the edge of the precipice  whence it fell  like a log  on  the yielding roof of one of the lodges beneath  a shout issued from the  forest behind  a volley roared among the trees  and glancing lead was  whistling through the air  and cutting twigs from the undergrowth on every  side  two more of the wampanoags were seen rolling on the earth  in the  death agony     the voice of annawon was heard in the encampment  and at the next instant  the place was deserted     during this startling and fearful moment  the four individuals near the  stream were inactive  conanchet and his christian friend stood to their  arms  but it was rather as men cling to the means of defence in moments of  great jeopardy  than with any intention of offensive hostilities  metacom  seemed undecided  accustomed to receive and inflict surprises  a warrior  so experienced could not be disconcerted  still he hesitated as to the  course he ought to take  but when annawon  who was nearer the scene   sounded the signal of retreat  he sprung towards the returned straggler   and with a single blow of his tomahawk brained the traitor  glances of  fierce revenge  and of inextinguishable though disappointed hatred  were  exchanged between the victim and his chief  as the former lay on the rock  gasping for breath  and then the latter turned in his tracks  and raised  the dripping weapon over the head of the white man      wampanoag  no   said conanchet  in a voice of thunder   our lives are  one      philip hesitated  fierce and dangerous passions were struggling in his  breast  but the habitual self command of the wily politician of those  woods prevailed  even in that scene of blood and alarm  he smiled on his  powerful and fearless young ally  then pointing to the deepest shades of  the forest  he bounded towards them with the activity of a deer           chapter xxx                     but  peace be with him     that life is better life  past fearing death     than that which lives to fear        measure for measure       courage is both a comparative and an improvable virtue  if the fear of  death be a weakness common to the race  it is one that is capable of being  diminished by frequent exposure  and even rendered extinct by reflection   it was therefore with sensibilities entirely changed from their natural  course  that the two individuals who were left alone by the retreat of  philip  saw the nature and the approach of the danger that now beset them   their position near the brook had so far protected them from the bullets  of the assailants  but it was equally obvious to both  that in a minute or  two the colonists would enter an encampment that was already deserted   each  in consequence  acted according to those opinions which had been  fostered by the habits of their respective lives     as conanchet had no act of vengeance  like that which metacom had  performed  immediately before his eyes  he had  at the first alarm   given all his faculties to the nature of the attack  the first minute  was sufficient to understand its character and the second enabled him  to decide      come   he said hastily  but with perfect self possession  pointing as he  spoke to the swift running stream at his feet   we will go with the water   let the marks of our trail run before      submission hesitated  there was something like haughty military pride in  the stern determination of his eye  which seemed reluctant to incur the  disgrace of a flight so unequivocal  and  as he might have believed  so  unworthy of his character      no  narragansett   he answered   flee for thy life  but leave me to reap  the harvest of my deeds  they can but leave my bones by the side of those  of this traitor at my feet      the mien of conanchet was neither excited nor displeased  he quietly drew  the corner of his light robe over a shoulder  and was about to resume his  seat on the stone from which he had but a minute before arisen  when his  companion again urged him to fly      the enemies of a chief must not say that he led his friend into a trap   and that when his leg was fast he ran away himself  like a lucky fox  if  my brother stays to be killed  conanchet will be found near him       heathen  heathen   returned the other  moved nearly to tears by the  loyalty of his guide   many a christian man might take lessons from thy  faith  lead on  i will follow  at the utmost of my speed      the narragansett sprung into the brook  and took its downward course  a  direction opposite to that which philip had chosen  there was wisdom in  this expedient  for though their pursuers might see that the water was  troubled  there was no certainty as to the direction of the fugitives   conanchet had foreseen this little advantage  and  with the instinctive  readiness of his people  he did not fail to make it of service  metacom  had been influenced by the course taken by his warriors  who had retired  under shelter of the rocks     ere the two fugitives had gone any great distance  they heard the shouts  of their enemies in the encampment  and soon after  scattering shot  announced that philip had already rallied his people to resistance  there  was an assurance of safety in the latter circumstance  which caused them  to relax their speed      my foot is not as active as in days that are past   said submission   we  will therefore recover strength while we may  lest we be yet taken at  emergency  narragansett  thou hast ever kept thy faith with me  and come  of what race or worship in what manner thou mayst  there is one to  remember it       my father looked with the eye of a friend on the indian boy  that was  kept like a young bear in a cage  he taught him to speak with the tongue  of a yengeese       we passed weary months together in our prison  chief  and apollyon must  have been strong in a heart  to resist the opportunity of friendship in  such a situation  but  even there  my confidence and care were repaid  for  without thy mysterious hints  gathered from signs thou hadst gleaned  thyself during the hunt  it would not have been in my power to warn my  friends that thy people contemplated an attack  the unhappy night of the  burning  narragansett  we have done many acts of kindness  each in his own  fashion  and i am ready to confess this last not to be the least of thy  favors  though of white blood and of christian origin  i can almost say  that my heart is indian       then die an indian s death   shouted a voice  within twenty feet of the  spot where they were wading down the stream     the menacing words were rather accompanied than seconded by a shot  and  submission fell  conanchet cast his musket into the water  and turned to  raise his companion      it was merely age dealing with the slippery stones of the brook   said  the latter  as he recovered his footing   that had well nigh been a fatal  discharge  but god  for his own purpose  hath still averted the blow      conanchet did hot speak  seizing his gun  which lay at the bottom of the  stream  he drew his friend after him to the shore  and plunged into the  thicket that lined its banks  here they were momentarily protected from  missiles  but the shouts that succeeded the discharge of the muskets  were  accompanied by yells that he knew to proceed from pequots and mohegans   tribes that were in deadly hostility to his own people  the hope of  concealing their trail from such pursuers was not to be indulged  and for  his companion to escape by flight he knew to be impossible  there was no  time to lose  in such emergencies  with an indian  thought takes the  character of instinct  the fugitives stood at the foot of a sapling  whose  top was completely concealed by masses of leaves  which belonged to the  under brush that clustered around its trunk  into this tree he assisted  submission to ascend  and then  without explaining his own views  he  instantly left the spot  rendering his own trail as broad and perceptible  as possible  by beating down the bushes as he passed     the expedient of the faithful narragansett was completely successful   before he had got a hundred yards from the place  he saw the foremost of  the hostile indians hunting like blood hounds on his footsteps  his  movement was slow  until he saw that  having his person in view  all of  the pursuers had passed the tree  then  the arrow parting from the bow was  scarce swifter than his flight     the pursuit now partook of all the exciting incidents and ingenious  expedients of an indian chase  conanchet was soon hunted from his cover   and obliged to trust his person in the more open parts of the forest   miles of hill and ravine  of plain  of rocks  of morass and stream  were  crossed  and still the trained warrior held on his way  unbroken in spirit  and scarce wearied in limb  the merit of a savage  in such an employment   rests more on his bottom than on his speed  the three or four colonists   who had been sent with the party of amicable indians to intercept those  who might attempt to escape down the stream  were early thrown out  and  the struggle was now entirely between the fugitive and men equally  practised in limb and ingenious in expedient     the pequots had a great advantage in their number  the frequent doublings  of the fugitive kept the chase within the circle of a mile  and as each of  his enemies tired  there were always fresh pursuers to take his plate  in  such a contest  the result could not be questionable  after more than two  hours of powerful exertion  the foot of conanchet began to fail  and his  speed very sensibly to flag  exhausted by efforts that had been nearly  supernatural  the breathless warrior cast his person prostrate on the  earth  and lay for several minutes as if he were dead     during this breathing time  his throbbing pulses grew more calm  his heart  beat less violently  and the circulation was gradually returning to the  tranquil flow of nature in a state of rest  it was at this moment  when  his energies were recruited by rest  that the chief heard the tread of the  moccasons on his trail  rising  he looked back on the course over which he  had just passed with so much pain  but a single warrior was in view  hope  for an instant regained the ascendency  and he raised his musket to fell  his approaching adversary  the aim was cool  long  and it would have been  fatal  had not the useless tick of the lock reminded him of the condition  of the gun  he cast the wet and unserviceable piece away  and grasped his  tomahawk  but a band of pequots rushed in to the rescue  rendering  resistance madness  perceiving the hopelessness of his situation  the  sachem of the narragansetts dropped his tomahawk  loosened his belt  and  advanced unarmed  with a noble resignation  to meet his foes  in the next  instant  he was their prisoner      bring me to your chief   said the captive  haughtily  when the common  herd into whose hands he had fallen would have questioned him on the  subject of his companions and of his own fate   my tongue is used to speak  with sachems      he was obeyed  and before an hour had passed  the renowned conanchet stood  confronted with his most deadly enemy     the place of meeting was the deserted encampment of the band of philip   here most of the pursuers had already assembled  including all of the  colonists who had been engaged in the expedition  the latter consisted  of meek wolfe  ensign dudley  sergeant ring  and a dozen private men of  the village     the result of the enterprise was  by this time  generally known  though  metacom  its principal object  had escaped  yet  when it was understood  that the sachem of the narragansetts had fallen into their hands  there  was not an individual of the party who did not think his personal risk  more than amply compensated  though the mohegans and pequots restrained  their exultation  lest the pride of their captive should be soothed by  such an evidence of his importance  the white men drew around the prisoner  with an interest and a joy they did not care to conceal  still  as he had  yielded to an indian there was an affectation of leaving the chief to the  clemency of his conquerors  perhaps some deeply pondered scheme of policy  had its influence in this act of seeming justice     when conanchet was placed in the centre of the curious circle  he found  himself immediately in presence of the principal chief of the tribe of the  mohegans  it was uncas  son of that uncas whose fortunes had also  prevailed  aided by the whites  in the conflict with his father  the  hapless but noble miantonimoh  fate had now decreed  that the same evil  star  which had governed the destinies of the ancestor  should extend its  influence to the second generation     the race of uncas  though weakened of its power  and shorn of much of its  peculiar grandeur  by a vicious alliance with the english  still retained  most of the fine qualities of savage heroism  he  who now stood forth to  receive his captive  was a warrior of middle age  of just proportions  of  a grave though fierce aspect  and of an eye and countenance that expressed  all those contradictory traits of character which render the savage  warrior almost as admirable as he is appalling  until this moment  the  rival chieftains had never met  except in the confusion of battle  for a  few minutes  neither spoke  each stood regarding the fine outlines  the  eagle eye  the proud bearing  and the severe gravity  of the other  in  secret admiration  but with a calmness so immovable  as entirely to  conceal the workings of his thoughts  at length  they began to assume  miens suited to the part each was to enact in the coming scene  the  countenance of uncas became ironical and exulting  while that of his  captive grew still more cold and unconcerned      my young men   said the former   have taken a fox skulking in the  bushes  his legs were very long  but he had no heart to use them      conanchet folded his arms on his bosom  and the glance of his quiet eye  seemed to tell his enemy  that devices so common were unworthy of them  both  the other either understood its meaning  or loftier feelings  prevailed  for he added  in a better taste       is conanchet tired of his life  that he comes among my young men       mohican   said the narragansett chief   he has been there before  if  uncas will count his warriors he will see that some are wanting       there are no traditions among the indians of the islands   said the  other  with an ironical glance at the chiefs near him   they have  never heard of miantonimoh  they do not know such a field as the  sachem s plain      the countenance of the prisoner changed  for a single instant  it appeared  to grow dark  as if a deep shadow were cast athwart it  and then every  feature rested  as before  in dignified repose  his conqueror watched the  play of his lineaments  and when he thought nature was getting the  ascendancy  exultation gleamed about his own fierce eye  but when the  self possession of the narragansett returned  he affected to think no more  of an effort that had been fruitless      if the men of the islands know little   he continued   it is not so with  the mohicans  there was once a great sachem among the narragansetts  he  was wiser than the beaver  swifter than the moose  and more cunning than  the red fox  but he could not see  into to morrow  foolish counsellors  told him to go upon the war path against the pequots and mohicans  he lost  his scalp  it hangs in the smoke of my wigwam  we shall see if it will  know the hair of its son  narragansett  here are wise men of the  pale faces  they will speak to you  if they offer a pipe  smoke  for  tobacco is not plenty with your tribe      uncas then turned away  leaving his prisoner to the interrogatories of his  white allies      here is the look of miantonimoh  sergeant ring   observed ensign dudley  to his wife s brother  after he had contemplated for a reasonable time the  features of the prisoner   i see the eye and the tread of the father  in  this young sachem  and more  sergeant ring  the chief favors the boy we  picked up in the fields some dozen years agone  and kept in the block for  the matter of many months  caged like a young panther  hast forgotten the  night  reuben  and the lad  and the block  a fiery oven is not hotter than  that pile was getting  before we dove into the earth  i never fail to  think of it  when the good minister is dealing powerfully with the  punishments of the wicked  and the furnaces of tophet      the silent yeoman comprehended the disconnected allusions of his  relative  nor was he slow in seeing the palpable resemblance between  their prisoner and the indian boy whose person had once been so familiar  to his eye  admiration and surprise were blended  in his honest face   with an expression that appeared to announce deep regret  as neither of  these individuals  however  was the principal personage of their party   each was fain to remain an attentive and an interested observer of that  which followed      worshipper of baal   commenced the sepulchral voice of the divine   it  has pleased the king of heaven and earth to protect his people  the  triumph of thy evil nature hath been short  and now cometh the judgment      these words were uttered to ears that affected deafness  in the presence  of his most deadly foe  and a captive  conanchet was not a man to suffer  his resolution to waver  he looked coldly and vacantly on the speaker   nor could the most suspicious or the most practised eye have detected in  his mien his knowledge of the english language  deceived by the stoicism  of the prisoner  meek muttered a few words  in which the narragansett was  strangely dealt by  denunciations and petitions in his favor being blended  in the quaint and exaggerated fashions of the times  and then he submitted  to the interference of those present  who were charged with the duty of  deciding on the fate of the indian     although eben dudley was the principal and the efficient military man in  this little expedition from the valley  he was accompanied by those whose  authority was predominant in all matters that did not strictly appertain  to the executive portion of the duty  commissioners  named by the  government of the colony  had come out with the party  clothed with power  to dispose of philip  should that dreaded chief  as was expected  fall  into the hands of the english  to these persons the fate of conanchet was  now referred     we shall not detain the narrative to dwell on the particulars of the  council  the question was gravely considered  and it was decided with a  deep and conscientious sense of the responsibility of those who acted as  judges  several hours were passed in deliberation  meek opening and  closing the deliberations by solemn prayers  the judgment was then  announced to uncas  by the divine himself      the wise men of my people have consulted together in the matter of this  narragansett   he said   and their spirits have wrestled powerfully with  the subject  in coming to their conclusion  if it wear the aspect of  time serving  let all remember  the providence of heaven hath so  interwoven the interests of man with its own good purposes  that to the  carnal eye they may outwardly seem to be inseparable  but that which is  here done is done in good faith to our ruling principle  which is good  faith to thee and to all others who support the altar in this wilderness   and herein is our decision  we commit the narragansett to thy justice   since it is evident that while he is at large  neither thou  who art a  feeble prop to the church in these regions  nor we  who are its humble and  unworthy servitors  are safe  take him  then  and deal with him according  to thy wisdom  we place limits to thy power  in only two things  it is not  meet that any born of humanity  and having human sensibilities  should  suffer more in the flesh than may be necessary to the ends of duty  we  therefore decree that thy captive shall not die by torture  and  for the  better security of this our charitable decision  two of our number shall  accompany thee and him to the place of execution  it being always  supposed  it is thy intention to inflict the pains of death  another  condition of this concession to a foreordered necessity  is  that a  christian minister may be at hand  in order that the sufferer may depart  with the prayers of one accustomed to lift his voice in petitions to the  footstool of the almighty      the mohegan chief heard this sentence with deep attention  when he found  he was to be denied the satisfaction of proving  or perhaps of overcoming   the resolution of his enemy  a deep cloud passed across his swarthy  visage  but the strength of his tribe had long been broken  and to resist  would have been as unprofitable as to repine would have been unseemly  the  conditions were therefore accepted  and preparations were accordingly made  among the indians to proceed to judgment     these people had few contradictory principles to appease  and no  subtleties to distract their decision  direct  fearless  and simple in all  their practices  they did little more than gather the voices of the  chiefs  and acquaint their captive with the result  they knew that  fortune had thrown an implacable enemy into their hands  and they believed  that self preservation demanded his life  to them it mattered little  whether he had arrows in his hands  or had yielded himself an unarmed  prisoner  he knew the risk he ran in submitting  and he had probably  consulted his own character  rather than their benefit  in throwing away  his arms  they therefore pronounced the judgment of death against their  captive merely respecting the decree of their white allies  which had  commanded them to spare the torture     so soon as this determination was known  the commissioners of the  colony hastened away from the spot with consciences that required some  aid from the stimulus of their subtle doctrines  in order to render  them quiet  they were  however  ingenious casuists  and as they hurried  along their return path  most of the party were satisfied that they had  rather manifested a merciful interposition  than exercised any act of  positive cruelty     during the two or three hours which had passed on these solemn and  usual preparations  conanchet was seated on a rock  a close but  apparently an unmoved spectator of all that passed  his eye was mild   and at times melancholy  but its brightness and its steadiness remained  unimpaired  when his sentence was announced  it exhibited no change   and he saw all the pale men depart  with the calmness he had maintained  throughout  it was only as uncas  attended by the body of his party and  the two white superintendents who had been left  approached  that his  spirit seemed to awaken      my people have said that there shall be no more wolves in the woods    said uncas   and they have commanded our young men to slay the hungriest  of them all       it is well   coldly returned the other     a gleaming of admiration  and perhaps of humanity  came over the grim  countenance of uncas  as he gazed at the repose which reigned in the firm  features of his victim  for an instant  his purpose wavered      the mohicans are a great tribe   he added   and the race of uncas is  getting few  we will paint our brother so that the lying narragansetts  shall not know him  and he will be a warrior on the main land      this relenting of his enemy had a corresponding effect on the generous   temper of conanchet  the lofty pride deserted his eye  and his look became  milder and more human  for a minute  intense thought brooded around his  brow  the firm muscles of his mouth played a little  though scarcely  enough to be seen  and then he spoke      mohican   he said   why should your young men be in a hurry  my scalp  will be the scalp of a great chief to morrow  they will not take two   should they strike their prisoner now       hath conanchet forgotten any thing  that he is not ready       sachem  he is always ready  but     he paused  and spoke in tones that  faltered    does a mohican live alone       how many suns doth the narragansett ask       one  when the shadow of that pine points towards the brook  conanchet  will be ready  he will then stand in the shade  with naked hands       go   said uncas  with dignity   i have heard the words of a sagamore      conanchet turned  and passing swiftly through the silent crowd  his person  was soon lost in the surrounding forest           chapter xxxi            therefore  lay bare your bosom        merchant of venice       the night that succeeded was wild and melancholy  the moon was nearly  full  but its place in the heavens was only seen  as the masses of vapor  which drove through the air occasionally opened  suffering short gleams of  fitful light to fall on the scene below  a south western wind rather  moaned than sighed through the forest  and there were moments when its  freshness increased  till every leaf seemed a tongue  and each low plant  appeared to be endowed with the gift of speech  with the exception of  these imposing and not unpleasing natural sounds  there was a solemn quiet  in and about the village of the wish ton wish  an hour before the moment  when we resume the action of the legend  the sun had settled into the  neighboring forest  and most of its simple and laborious inhabitants had  already sought their rest     the lights however still shone through many of the windows of the   heathcote house   as  in the language of the country  the dwelling of the  puritan was termed  there was the usual stirring industry in and about the  offices  and the ordinary calm was reigning in the superior parts of the  habitation  a solitary man was to be seen on its piazza  it was young mark  heathcote  who paced the long and narrow gallery  as if impatient of some  interruption to his wishes     the uneasiness of the young man was of short continuance  for  ere he had  been many minutes at his post  a door opened  and two light and timid  forms glided out of the house      thou hast not come alone  martha   said the youth  half displeased   i  told thee that the matter i had to say was for thine own ear       it is our ruth  thou knowest  mark  that she may not be left alone  for  we fear her return to the forest  she is like some ill tamed fawn  that  would be apt to leap away at the first well known sound from the woods   even now  i fear that we are too much asunder      fear nothing  my sister fondles her infant  and she thinketh not of  flight  thou seest i am here to intercept her  were such her intention   now speak with candor  martha  and say if thou meanest in sincerity that  the visits of the hartford gallant  were less to thy liking than most of  thy friends have believed       what i have said cannot be recalled       still it may be repented of       i do not number the dislike i may feel for the young man among my  failings  i am too happy  here  in this family  to wish to quit it   and now that our sister    there is one speaking to her at this  moment  mark       tis only the innocent   returned the young man  glancing his eye to the  other end of the piazza   they confer often together  whittal hath just  come in from the woods  whither he is much inclined to pass an hour or  two  each evening  thou wast saying that now we have our sister         i feel less desire to change my abode       then why not stay with us for ever  martha       hist   interrupted his companion  who  though conscious of what she was  about to listen to  shrunk  with the waywardness of human nature  from the  very declaration she most wished to hear   hist  there was a movement  ah   our ruth and whittal are fled       they seek some amusement for the babe  they are near the out buildings   then why not accept a right to remain for ever          it may not be  mark   cried the girl wresting her hand from his grasp    they are fled      mark reluctantly released his hold  and followed to the spot where his  sister had been sitting  she was  in truth  gone  though  some minutes  passed before even martha seriously believed that she had disappeared  without an intention of returning  the agitation of both rendered the  search ill directed and uncertain  and there was perhaps a secret  satisfaction in prolonging their interview even in this vague manner  that  prevented them for some time from giving the alarm  when that moment did  come  it was too late  the fields were examined  the orchards and  out houses thoroughly searched  without any traces of the fugitives  it  would have been useless to enter the forest in the darkness  and all that  could be done in reason  was to set a watch during the night  and to  prepare for a more active and intelligent pursuit in the morning     but  long before the sun arose  the small and melancholy party of the  fugitives threaded the woods at such a distance from the valley  as would  have rendered the plan of the family entirely nugatory  conanchet had led  the way over a thousand forest knolls  across water courses  and through  dark glens  followed by his silent partner  with an industry that would  have baffled the zeal of even those from whom they fled  whittal ring   bearing the infant on his back  trudged with unwearied step in the rear   hours had passed in this manner  and not a syllable had been uttered by  either of the three  once or twice  they had stopped at some spot where  water  limpid as the air  gushed from the rocks  and  drinking from the  hollows of their hands  the march had been resumed with the same  speechless industry as before     at length conanchet paused he studied the position of the sun  gravely   and took a long and anxious look at the signs of the forest  in order that  he might not be deceived in its quarter  to an unpractised eye  the arches  of the trees  the leaf covered path  and the mouldering logs  would have  seemed everywhere the same  but it was not easy to deceive one so trained  in the woods  satisfied equally with the progress he had made  and with  the hour the chief signed to his two companions to place themselves at his  side  and took a seat on a low shelf of rock  that thrust its naked head  out of the side of a hill     for many minutes  after all were seated  no one broke the silence  the eye  of narra mattah sought the countenance of her husband  as the eye of woman  seeks instruction from the expression of features that she has been taught  to revere  but still she spoke not  the innocent laid the patient babe at  the feet of its mother  and imitated her reserve      is the air of the woods pleasant to the honey suckle  after living in the  wigwam of her people   asked conanchet  breaking the long silence   can a  flower  which blossomed in the sun  like the shade       a woman of the narragansetts is happiest in the lodge of her husband      the eye of the chief met her confiding look with affection  and then it  fell  mild and full of kindness  on the features of the infant that lay at  their feet  there was a minute  during which an expression of utter  melancholy gathered about his brow      the spirit that made the earth   he continued   is very cunning  he has  known where to put the hemlock  and where the oak should grow  he has left  the moose and the deer to the indian hunter  and he has given the horse  and the ox to a pale face  each tribe hath its hunting grounds  and its  game  the narragansetts know the taste of a clam  while the mohawks eat  the berries of the mountains  thou hast seen the bright bow which shines  in the skies  narra mattah  and knowest how one color is mixed with  another  like paint on a warrior s face  the leaf of the hemlock is like  the leaf of the sumach  the ash  the chestnut  the chestnut  the linden   and the linden  the broad leaved tree which bears the red fruit  in the  clearing of the yengeese  but the tree of the red fruit is little like the  hemlock  conanchet is a tall and straight hemlock  and the father of  narra mattah is a tree of the clearing  that bears the red fruit  the  great spirit was angry when they grew together      the sensitive wife understood but too well the current of the chief s  thoughts  suppressing the pain she felt  however  she answered with the  readiness of a woman whose imagination was quickened by her affections      what conanchet hath said is true  but the yengeese have put the apple of  their own land on the thorn of our woods  and the fruit is good       it is like that boy   said the chief  pointing to his son   neither red  nor pale  no  narra mattah  what the great spirit hath commanded  even a  sachem must do       and doth conanchet say this fruit is not good   asked his wife  lifting  the smiling boy with a mother s joy before his eyes     the heart of the warrior was touched  bending his head  he kissed the  babe  with such fondness as parents less stern are wont to exhibit  for a  moment  he appeared to have satisfaction in gazing at the promise of the  child  but  as he raised his head  his eye caught a glimpse of the sun   and the whole expression of his countenance changed  motioning to his  wife to replace the infant on the earth  he turned to her with solemnity   and continued       let the tongue of narra mattah speak without fear  she hath been in the  lodges of her father  and hath tasted of their plenty  is her heart glad      the young wife paused  the question brought with it a sudden recollection  of all those reviving sensations  of that tender solicitude  and of those  soothing sympathies  of which she had so lately been the subject  but  these feelings soon vanished  for  without daring to lift her eyes to meet  the attentive and anxious gaze of the chief  she said firmly  though with  a voice that was subdued by diffidence       narra mattah is a wife       then will she listen to the words of her husband  conanchet is a  chief no longer  he is a prisoner of the mohicans  uncas waits for him  in the woods      notwithstanding the recent declaration of the young wife  she heard of  this calamity with little of the calmness of an indian woman  at first  it  seemed as if her senses refused to comprehend the meaning of the words   wonder  doubt  horror  and fearful certainty  each in its turn prevailed   for she was too well schooled in all the usages and opinions of the people  with whom she dwelt  not to understand the jeopardy in which her husband  was placed      the sachem of the narragansetts a prisoner  of mohican uncas   she  repeated in a low tone  as if the sound of her voice were necessary to  dispel some horrible illusion   no  uncas is not a warrior to strike  conanchet       hear my words   said the chief  touching the shoulder of his wife  as  one arouses a friend from his slumbers   there is a pale face in these  woods who is a burrowing fox  he hides his head from the yengeese  when  his people were on the trail  barking like hungry wolves  this man  trusted to a sagamore  it was a swift chase  and my father is getting  very old  he went up a young hickory  like a bear  and conanchet led off  the lying tribe  but he is not a moose  his legs cannot go like running  water  for ever       and why did the great narragansett give his life for a stranger       the man is a brave   returned the sachem  proudly   he took the scalp of  a sagamore      again narra mattah was silent  she brooded  in nearly stupid amazement  on  the frightful truth      the great spirit sees that the man and his wife are of different tribes    she at length ventured to rejoin   he wishes them to become the same  people  let conanchet quit the woods  and go into the clearings with the  mother of his boy  her white father will be glad  and mohican uncas will  not dare to follow       woman  i am a sachem and a warrior among my people      there was a severe and cold displeasure in the voice of conanchet  that  his companion had never before heard  he spoke in the manner of a chief to  his woman  rather than with that manly softness with which he had been  accustomed to address the scion of the pale faces  the words came over her  heart like a withering chill  and affliction kept her mute  the chief  himself sate a moment longer in a stern calmness  and then rising in  displeasure  he pointed to the sun  and beckoned to his companions to  proceed  in a time that appeared to the throbbing heart of her who  followed his swift footsteps  but a moment  they had turned a little  eminence  and  in another minute  they stood in the presence of a party  that evidently awaited their coming  this grave group consisted only of  uncas  two of his fiercest looking and most athletic warriors  the divine   and eben dudley     advancing rapidly to the spot where his enemy stood  conanchet took his  post at the foot of the fatal tree  pointing to the shadow  which had not  yet turned towards the east  he folded his arms on his naked bosom  and  assumed an air of haughty unconcern  these movements were made in the  midst of a profound stillness     disappointment  unwilling admiration  and distrust  all struggled through  the mask of practised composure  in the dark countenance of uncas  he  regarded his long hated and terrible foe  with an eye that seemed willing  to detect some lurking signs of weakness  it would not have been easy to  say whether he most felt respect  or regret  at the faith of the  narragansett  accompanied by his two grim warriors  the chief examined the  position of the shadow with critical minuteness  and when there no longer  existed a pretext for affecting to doubt the punctuality of their captive   a deep ejaculation of assent issued from the chest of each  like some wary  judge  whose justice is fettered by legal precedents  as if satisfied  there was no flaw in the proceedings  the mohegan then signed to the white  men to draw near      man of a wild and unreclaimed nature   commenced meek wolfe  in his usual  admonitory and ascetic tones   the hour of thy existence draws to its end   judgment hath had rule  thou hast been weighed in the balances  and art  found wanting  but christian charity is never weary  we may not resist the  ordinances of providence  but we may temper the blow to the offender  that  thou art here to die  is a mandate decreed in equity  and rendered awful  by mystery  but further  submission to the will of heaven doth not exact   heathen  thou hast a soul  and it is about to leave its earthly tenement  for the unknown world         until now  the captive had listened with the courtesy of a savage when  unexcited  he had even gazed at the quiet enthusiasm  and singularly  contradictory passions  that shone in the deep lines of the speaker s  face  with some such reverence as he might have manifested at an  exhibition of one of the pretended revelations of a prophet of his tribe   but when the divine came to touch upon his condition after death  his mind  received a clear  and to him an unerring  clue to the truth  laying a  finger suddenly on the shoulder of meek  he interrupted him  by saying       my father forgets that the skin of his son is red  the path to the happy  hunting grounds of just indians lies before him       heathen  in thy words hath the master spirit of delusion and sin uttered  his blasphemies       hist   did my father see that which stirred the bush       it was the viewless wind  idolatrous and idle minded infant  in the form  of adult man       and yet my father speaks to it   returned the indian  with the grave but  cutting sarcasm of his people   see   he added  haughtily  and even with  ferocity   the shadow hath passed the root of the tree  let the cunning  man of the pale faces stand aside  a sachem is ready to die      meek groaned audibly  and in real sorrow  for  notwithstanding the veil  which exalted theories and doctrinal subtleties had drawn before his  judgment  the charities of the man were grounded in truth  bowing to what  he believed to be a mysterious dispensation of the will of heaven  he  withdrew to a short distance  and  kneeling on a rock  his voice was  heard  during the remainder of the ceremonies lifting its tones in fervent  prayer for the soul of the condemned     the divine had no sooner quitted the place  than uncas motioned to dudley  to approach  though the nature of the borderer was essentially honest and  kind  he was  in opinions and prejudices  but a creature of the times  if  he had assented to the judgment which committed the captive to the mercy  of his implacable enemies  he had the merit of having suggested the  expedient that was to protect the sufferer from those refinements in  cruelty which the savages were known to be too ready to inflict  he had  even volunteered to be one of the agents to enforce his own expedient   though  in so doing  he had committed no little violence to his natural  inclinations  the reader will therefore judge of his conduct  in this  particular  with the degree of lenity that a right consideration of the  condition of the country and of the usages of the age may require there  was even a relenting and a yielding of purpose in the countenance of this  witness of the scene  that was favorable to the safety of the captive  as  he now spoke  his address was first to uncas      a happy fortune  mohegan  something aided by the power of the white men   hath put this narragansett into thy hands   he said   it is certain that  the commissioners of the colony have consented that thou shouldst exercise  thy will on his life  but there is a voice in the breast of every human  being  which should be stronger than the voice of revenge  and that is the  voice of mercy  it is not yet too late to hearken to it take the promise  of the narragansett for his faith  take more  take a hostage in this  child  which with its mother shall be guarded among the english  and let  the prisoner go       my brother asketh with a big mind   said uncas  drily      i know not how nor why it is i ask with this earnestness   resumed  dudley   but there are old recollections and former kindnesses  in the  face and manner of this indian  and here  too  is one  in the woman  that  i know is tied to some of our settlements  with a bond nearer than that of  common charity  mohegan  i will add a goodly gift of powder and of  muskets  if thou wilt listen to mercy  and take the faith of the  narragansett      uncas pointed with ironical coldness to his captive  as he said       let conanchet speak       thou nearest  narragansett  if the man i begin to suspect thee to be   thou knowest something of the usages of the whites  speak  wilt swear to  keep peace with the mohegans  and to bury the hatchet in the path between  your villages       the fire that burnt the lodges of my people turned the heart of conanchet  to stone   was the steady answer      then can i do no more than see the treaty respected   returned dudley  in  disappointment   thou hast thy nature  and it will have way  the lord have  mercy on thee  indian  and render thee such judgment as is meet for one of  savage opportunities      he made a gesture to uncas that he had done  and fell back a few paces  from the tree  his honest features expressing all his concern  while his  eye did not refuse to do its duty by closely watching each movement of the  adverse parties  at the same instant  the grim attendants of the mohegan  chief  in obedience to a sign  took their stations on each side of the  captive  they evidently waited for the last and fatal signal  to complete  their unrelenting purpose  at this grave moment there was a pause  as if  each of the principal actors pondered serious matter in his inmost mind      the narragansett hath not spoken to his woman   said uncas  secretly  hoping that his enemy might yet betray some unmanly weakness  in a moment  of so severe trial   she is near       i said my heart was stone   coldly returned the narragansett      see  the girl creepeth like a frightened fowl among the leaves  if my  brother conanchet will look  he will see his beloved      the countenance of conanchet grew dark  but it did not waver      we will go among the bushes  if the sachem is afraid to speak to his  woman with the eyes of a mohican on him  a warrior is not a curious girl   that he wishes to see the sorrow of a chief      conanchet felt  hurriedly  for some weapon that might strike his enemy to  the earth  and then a low murmuring sound at his elbow stole so softly on  his ear  as suddenly to divert the tempest of passion      will not a sachem look at his boy   demanded the suppliant   it is the  son of a great warrior  why is the face of his father so dark on him      narrah mattah had drawn near enough to her husband  to be within reach of  his hand  with extended arms she held the pledge of their former  happiness towards the chief  as if to beseech a last and kindly look of  recognition and love      will not the great narragansett look at his boy   she repeated  in a  voice that sounded like the lowest notes of some touching melody   why is  his face so dark  on a woman of his tribe      even the stern features of the mohegan sagamore showed that he was  touched  beckoning to his grim attendants to move behind the tree  he  turned and walked aside  with the noble air of a savage  when influenced  by his better feelings  then light shot into the clouded countenance of  conanchet  his eyes sought the face of his stricken and grieved consort   who mourned less for his danger than she grieved for his displeasure  he  received the boy from her hands  and studied his features long and  intently  beckoning to dudley  who alone gazed on the scene  he placed the  infant in his arms      see   he said  pointing to the child   it is a blossom of the clearings   it will not live in the shade      he then fastened a look on his trembling partner there was a husband s  love in the glance   flower of the open land   he said   the manitou of  thy race will place thee in the fields of thy fathers  the sun will shine  upon thee  and the winds from beyond the salt lake will blow the clouds  into the woods  a just and great chief cannot shut his ear to the good  spirit of his people  mine calls his son to hunt among the braves that  have gone on the long path  thine points another way  go  hear his voice   and obey  let thy mind be like a wide clearing  let all its shadows be  next the woods  let it forget the dream it dreamt among the trees   tis  the will of the manitou       conanchet asketh much of his wife  her son is only the soul of a woman       a woman of the pale faces  now let her seek her tribe  narra mattah  thy  people speak strange traditions  they say that one just man died for all  colors  i know not  conanchet is a child among the cunning  and a man with  the warriors  if this be true  he will look for his woman and boy in the  happy hunting grounds  and they will come to him  there is no hunter of  the yengeese that can kill so many deer  let narra mattah forget her chief  till that time  and then  when she calls him by name  let her speak  strong  for he will be very glad to hear her voice again  go  a sagamore  is about to start on a long journey  he takes leave of his wife with a  heavy spirit  she will put a little flower of two colors before her eyes   and be happy in its growth  now let her go  a sagamore is about to die      the attentive woman caught each slow and measured syllable  as one trained  in superstitious legends would listen to the words of an oracle  but   accustomed to obedience and bewildered with her grief  she hesitated no  longer  the head of narra mattah sunk on her bosom  as she left him  and  her face was buried in her robe  the step with which she passed uncas was  so light as to be inaudible  but when he saw her tottering form  turning  swiftly  he stretched an arm high in the air  the terrible mutes just  showed themselves from behind the tree  and vanished  conanchet started   and it seemed as if he were about to plunge forward  but  recovering  himself by a desperate effort  his body sunk back against the tree  and he  fell in the attitude of a chief seated in council  there was a smile of  fierce triumph on his face  and his lips evidently moved  uncas did not  breathe  as he bent forward to listen        mohican  i die before my heart is soft   uttered firmly  but with a  struggle  reached his ears  then came two long and heavy respirations  one  was the returning breath of uncas  and the other the dying sigh of the  last sachem of the broken and dispersed tribe of the narragansetts           chapter xxxii            each lonely scene shall thee restore     for thee the tear be duly shed     beloved till life could charm no more     and mourn d till pity s self be dead        collins       an hour later  and the principal actors in the foregoing scene had  disappeared  there remained only the widowed narra mattah  with dudley   the divine  and whittal ring     the body of conanchet still continued  where he had died  seated like a  chief in council  the daughter of content and ruth had stolen to its side   and she had taken her seat  in that species of dull woe  which so  frequently attends the first moments of any unexpected and overwhelming  affliction  she neither spoke  sobbed  nor sorrowed in anyway that grief  is wont to affect the human system  the mind seemed palsied  though a  withering sense of the blow was fearfully engraven on every lineament of  her eloquent face  the color had deserted her cheeks  the lips were  bloodless  while  at moments  they quivered convulsively  like the  tremulous movement of the sleeping infant  and  at long intervals  her  bosom heaved  as if the spirit within struggled heavily to escape from its  earthly prison  the child lay unheeded at her side  and whittal ring had  placed himself on the opposite side of the corpse     the two agents  appointed by the colony to witness the death of conanchet   stood near  gazing mournfully on the piteous spectacle  the instant the  spirit of the condemned man had fled  the prayers of the divine had  ceased  for he believed that then the soul had gone to judgment  but there  was more of human charity  and less of that exaggerated severity in his  aspect  than was ordinarily seated in the deep lines of his austere  countenance  now that the deed was done  and the excitement of his exalted  theories had given way to the more positive appearance of the result  he  might even have moments of harassing doubts concerning the lawfulness of  an act that he had hitherto veiled under the forms of a legal and  necessary execution of justice  the mind of eben dudley vacillated with  none of the subtleties of doctrine or of law  as there had been less  exaggeration in his original views of the necessity of the proceeding  so  was there more steadiness in his contemplation of its fulfilment   feelings  they might be termed emotions  of a different nature troubled  the breast of this resolute but justly disposed borderer      this hath been a melancholy visitation of necessity  and a severe  manifestation of the foreordering will   said the ensign  as he gazed at  the sad spectacle before him   father and son have both died  as it were   in my presence  and both have departed for the world of spirits  in a  manner to prove the inscrutableness of providence  but dost not see  here   in the face of her who looketh like a form of stone  traces of a  countenance that is familiar       thou hast allusion to the consort of captain content heathcote       truly  to her only  thou art not  reverend sir  of sufficient residence  at the wish ton wish  to remember that lady in her youthfulness  but to  me  the hour when the captain led his followers into the wilderness   seemeth but as a morning of the past season  i was then active in limb   and something idle in reflection and discourse  it was in that journey   that the woman who is now the mother of my children and i first made  acquaintance  i have seen many comely females in my time  but never did i  look on one so pleasant to the eye  as was the consort of the captain  until the night of the burning  thou hast often heard the loss she then  met  and  from that hour  her beauty hath been that of the october leaf  rather than its loveliness in the season of fertility  now look on the  face of this mourner  and say if there be not here such an image as the  water reflects from the overhanging bush  in verity  i could believe it  was the sorrowing eye and bereaved look of the mother herself       grief hath struck its blow heavily on this unoffending victim   uttered  meek  with great and subdued softness in his manner   the voice of  petition must be raised in her behalf  or          hist   there are some in the forest  i hear the rustling of leaves       the voice of him  who made the earth  whispereth in the winds  his breath  is the movement of nature       here are living men   but  happily  the meeting is friendly  and there  will be no further occasion for strife  the heart of a father is sure as  ready eye and swift foot      dudley suffered his musket to fall at his side  and both he and his  companion stood in attitudes of decent composure  to await the arrival of  those who approached  the party that drew near  arrived on the side of the  tree opposite to that on which the death of conanchet had occurred  the  enormous trunk and swelling roots of the pine concealed the group at its  feet  but the persons of meek and the ensign were soon observed  the  instant they were discovered  he who led the new comers bent his footsteps  in that direction      if  as thou hast supposed  the narragansett hath again led her thou hast  so long mourned into the forest   said submission  who acted as guide to  those who followed   here are we  at no great distance from the place of  his resort  it was near yon rock that he gave the meeting with the  bloody minded philip  and the place where i received the boon of an  useless and much afflicted life from his care  is within the bosom of that  thicket which borders the brook  this minister of the lord  and our stout  friend the ensign  may have further matter to tell us of his movements      the speaker had stopped within a short distance of the two he named  but  still on the side of the tree opposite to that where the body lay  he had  addressed his words to content  who also halted to await the arrival of  ruth  who came in the rear  supported by her son  and attended by faith  and the physician  all equipped like persons engaged in a search through  the forest  a mother s heart had sustained the feeble woman for many a  weary mile  but her steps had begun to drag  shortly before they so  happily fell upon the signs of human beings  near the spot where they now  met the two agents of the colony     notwithstanding the deep interest which belonged to the respective  pursuits of the individuals who composed these two parties  the interview  was opened with no lively signs of feeling on either side  to them a  journey in the forest possessed no novelties  and after traversing its  mazes for a day  the newly arrived encountered their friends  as men meet  on more beaten tracks  in countries where roads unavoidably lead them to  cross each other s paths  even the appearance of submission in front of  the travellers  elicited no marks of surprise in the unmoved features of  those who witnessed his approach  indeed  the mutual composure of on who  had so long concealed his person  and of those who had more than once seen  him in striking and mysterious situations  might well justify a belief  that the secret of his presence near the valley had not been confined to  the family of the heathcotes  this fact is rendered still more probable   by the recollection of the honesty of dudley  and of the professional  characters of the two others      we are on the trail of one fled  as the truant fawn seeketh again the  covers of the woods   said content   our hunt was uncertain  and it might  have been vain  so many feet have lately crossed the forest  were it not  that providence hath cast our route on that of our friend  here  who hath  had reason to know the probable situation of the indian camp  hast seen  aught of the sachem of the narragansetts  dudley  and where are those thou  led st against the subtle philip  that thou fell upon his party  we have  heard  though further than thy general success  we have yet to learn  the  wampanoag escaped thee       the wicked agencies that back him in his designs  profited the savage in  his extremity  else would his fate have been that which i fear a far  worthier spirit hath been doomed to suffer       of whom dost speak   but it mattereth not we seek our child  she  whom  thou hast known  and whom thou hast so lately seen  hath again left us  we  seek her in the camp of him who hath been to her  dudley  hast seen aught  of the narragansett sachem      the ensign looked at ruth  as he had once before been seen to gaze on the  sorrowing features of the woman  but he spoke not  meek folded his arms on  his breast  and seemed to pray inwardly  there was  however  one who broke  the silence  though his tones were low and menacing      it was a bloody deed   muttered the innocent   the lying mohican hath  struck a great chief  from behind  let him dig the prints of his moccason  from the earth  with his nails  like a burrowing fox  for there ll be one  on his trail  before he can hide his head  nipset will be a warrior the  next snow       there speaks my witless brother   exclaimed faith  rushing ahead  she  recoiled  covered her face with her hands  and sunk upon the ground  under  the violence of the surprise that followed     though time moved with his ordinary pace  it appeared to those who  witnessed the scene which succeeded  as if the emotions of many days were  collected within the brief compass of a few minutes  we shall not dwell on  the first harrowing and exciting moments of the appalling discovery     a short half hour served to make each person acquainted with all that it  was necessary to know  we shall therefore transfer the narrative to the  end of that period     the body of conanchet still rested against the tree  the eyes were open   and though glazed in death  there still remained about the brow  the  compressed lips  and the expansive nostrils  much of that lofty firmness  which had sustained him in the last trial of life  the arms were passive  at its sides  but one hand was clenched in the manner with which it had so  often grasped the tomahawk  while the other had lost its power in a vain  effort to seek the place in the girdle where the keen knife should have  been  these two movements had probably been involuntary  for  in all other  respects  the form was expressive of dignity and repose  at its side  the  imaginary nipset still held his place menacing discontent betraying itself  through the ordinary dull fatuity of his countenance     the others present were collected around the mother and her stricken  child  it would seem that all other feelings were  for the moment   absorbed in apprehensions for the latter  there was much reason to dread   that the recent shock had suddenly deranged some of that fearful machinery  which links the soul to the body  this dreaded effect  however  was more  to be apprehended by a general apathy and failing of the system  than by  any violent and intelligible symptom     the pulses still vibrated  but it was heavily  and like the irregular and  faltering evolutions of the mill  which the dying breeze is ceasing to  fan  the pallid countenance was fixed in its expression of anguish  color  there was none  even the lips resembling the unnatural character which is  given by images of wax  her limbs  like her features  were immovable  and  yet there was  at moments  a working of the latter  which would seem to  imply not only consciousness  but vivid and painful recollections of the  realities of her situation      this surpasseth my art   said doctor ergot  raising himself from a long  and silent examination of the pulse   there is a mystery in the  construction of the body  which human knowledge hath not yet unveiled  the  currents of existence are sometimes frozen in an incomprehensible manner   and this i conceive to be a case that would confound the most learned of  our art  even in the oldest countries of the earth  it hath been my  fortune to see many arrive and but few depart from this busy world  and  yet do i presume to foretell that here is one destined to quit its limits  ere the natural number of her days has been filled       let us address ourselves  in behalf of that which shall never die  to him  who hath ordered the event from the commencement of time   said meek   motioning to those around him to join in prayer     the divine then lifted up his voice  under the arches of the forest  in  an ardent  pious  and eloquent petition  when this solemn duty was  performed  attention was again bestowed on the sufferer  to the surprise  of all  it was found that the blood had revisited her face  and that her  radiant eyes were lighted with an expression of brightness and peace  she  even motioned to be raised  in order that those near her person might be  better seen      dost know us   asked the trembling ruth   look on thy friends   long mourned and much suffering daughter   tis she who sorrowed over thy  infant afflictions  who rejoiced in thy childish happiness  and who hath  so bitterly wept thy loss  that craveth the boon  in this awful moment   recall the lessons of youth  surely  surely  the god that bestowed thee in  mercy  though he hath led thee on a wonderful and inscrutable path  will  not desert thee at the end  think of thy early instruction  child of my  love  feeble of spirit as thou art  the seed may yet quicken  though it  hath been cast where the glory of the promise hath so long been hid       mother   said a low struggling voice in reply the word reached every ear   and it caused a general and breathless attention  the sound was soft and  low  perhaps infantile  but it was uttered without accent  and clearly      mother  why are we in the forest   continued the speaker   have any  robbed us of our home  that we dwell beneath the trees      ruth raised a hand imploringly  for none to interrupt the illusion      nature hath revived the recollections of her youth   she whispered   let  the spirit depart  if such be his holy will  in the blessedness of infant  innocence       why do mark and martha stay   continued the other   it is not safe  thou  knowest  mother  to wander far in the woods  the heathen may be out of  their towns  and one cannot say what evil chance might happen to the  indiscreet      a groan struggled from the chest of content  and the muscular hand of  dudley compressed itself on the shoulder of his wife  until the  breathlessly attentive woman withdrew  unconsciously  with pain      i ve said as much to mark  for he doth not always remember thy  warnings  mother  and those children do so love to wander together   but  mark is  in common  good  do not chide  if he stray too far  mother   thou wilt not chide      the youth turned his head  for even at that moment  the pride of young  manhood prompted him to conceal his weakness      hast prayed to day  my daughter   said ruth  struggling to be composed    thou shouldst not forget thy duty to his blessed name  even though we are  houseless in the woods       i will pray now  mother   said the creature of this mysterious  hallucination  struggling to bow her face into the lap of ruth  her wish  was indulged  and for a minute  the same low childish voice was heard  distinctly repeating the words of a prayer adapted to the earliest period  of life  feeble as were the sounds  none of their intonations escaped the  listeners  until near the close  when a species of holy calm seemed to  absorb the utterance  ruth raised the form of her child  and saw that the  features bore the placid look of a sleeping infant  life played upon them   as the flickering light lingers on the dying torch  her dove like eyes  looked up into the face of ruth  and the anguish of the mother was  alleviated by a smile of intelligence and love  the full and sweet organs  next rolled from face to face  recognition and pleasure accompanying each  change  on whittal they became perplexed and doubtful  but when they met  the fixed  frowning  and still commanding eye of the dead chief  their  wandering ceased for ever  there was a minute  during which  fear  doubt   wildness  and early recollections  struggled for the mastery  the hands of  narra mattah trembled  and she clung convulsively to the robe of ruth      mother   mother     whispered the agitated victim of so many conflicting  emotions   i will pray again  an evil spirit besets me      ruth felt the force of her grasp  and heard the breathing of a few words  of petition  after which the voice was mute  and the hands relaxed their  hold  when the face of the nearly insensible parent was withdrawn  to the  others the dead appeared to gaze at each other with a mysterious and  unearthly intelligence  the look of the narragansett was still  as in his  hour of pride  haughty  unyielding  and filled with defiance  while that  of the creature who had so long lived in his kindness was perplexed   timid  but not without a character of hope  a solemn calm succeeded  and  when meek raised his voice again in the forest  it was to ask the  omnipotent ruler of heaven and earth to sanctify his dispensation to those  who survived     the changes which have been wrought  on this continent  within a century  and a half  are very wonderful  cities have appeared where the wilderness  then covered the ground  and there is good reason to believe that a  flourishing town now stands on  or near  the spot where conanchet met his  death  but  notwithstanding so much activity has prevailed in the country   the valley of this legend remains but little altered  the hamlet has  increased to a village  the farms possess more of the air of cultivation   the dwellings are enlarged  and are somewhat more commodious  the  churches are increased to three  the garrisoned houses  and all other  signs of apprehension from violence  have long since disappeared  but  still the place is secluded  little known  and strongly impressed with the  marks of its original sylvan character     a descendant of mark and martha is  at this hour  the proprietor of the  estate on which so many of the moving incidents of our simple tale were  enacted  even the building which was the second habitation of his  ancestor  is in part standing  though additions and improvements have  greatly changed its form  the orchards  which in      were young and  thrifty  are now old and decaying  the trees have yielded their character  for excellence  to those varieties of the fruit which the soil and the  climate have since made known to the inhabitants  still they stand  for it  is known that fearful scenes occurred beneath their shades  and there is a  deep moral interest attached to their existence     the ruins of the block house  though much dilapidated and crumbling  are  also  visible  at their foot is the last abode of all the heathcotes who  have lived and died in that vicinity  for near two centuries  the graves  of those of later times are known by tablets of marble  but nearer to the  ruin are many  whose monuments  half concealed in the grass  are cut in  the common coarse free stone of the country     one  who took an interest in the recollection of days long gone  had  occasion a few years since to visit the spot  it was easy to trace the  births and deaths of generations  by the visible records on the more  pretending monuments of those interred within a hundred years  beyond that  period  research became difficult and painful  but his zeal was not to be  easily defeated     to every little mound  one only excepted  there was a stone  and on each  stone  illegible as it might be  there was an inscription  the  undistinguished grave  it was presumed  by its size and its position  was  that which contained the bones of those who fell in the night of the  burning  there was another  which bore  in deep letters  the name of the  puritan  his death occurred in       at its side there was an humble  stone  on which  with great difficulty  was traced the single word   submission   it was impossible to ascertain whether the date was       or        the same mystery remained about the death of this man  as had  clouded so much of his life  his real name  parentage  or character   further than they have been revealed in these pages  was never traced   there still remains  however  in the family of the heathcotes  an  orderly book of a troop of horse  which tradition says had some connexion  with his fortunes  affixed to this defaced and imperfect document  is a  fragment of some diary or journal  which has reference to the condemnation  of charles i  to the scaffold     the body of content lay near his infant children  and it would seem that  he still lived in the first quarter of the last century  there was an aged  man  lately in existence  who remembers to have seen him  a white headed  patriarch  reverend by his years  and respected for his meekness and  justice  he had passed nearly  or quite  half a century unmarried  this  melancholy fact was sufficiently shown by the date on the stone of the  nearest mound  the inscription denoted it to be the grave of  ruth   daughter of george harding of the colony of massachusetts bay  and wife of  capt  content heathcote   she died in the autumn of       with  as the  stone reveals   a spirit broken for the purposes of earth  by much family  affliction  though with hopes justified by the covenant and her faith in  the lord      the divine  who lately officiated  if he do not now officiate  in the  principal church of the village  is called the reverend meek lamb  though  claiming a descent from him who ministered in the temple at the period of  our tale  time and intermarriages have produced this change in the name   and happily some others in doctrinal interpretations of duty  when this  worthy servant of the church found the object which had led one born in  another state and claiming descent from a line of religionists who had  left the common country of their ancestors to worship in still another  manner  to take an interest in the fortunes of those who first inhabited  the valley  he found a pleasure in aiding the inquiries  the abodes of the  dudleys and rings were numerous in the village and its environs  he showed  a stone  surrounded by many others that bore these names  on which was  rudely carved   i am nipset  a narragansett  the next snow  i shall be a  warrior   there is a rumor  that though the hapless brother of faith  gradually returned to the ways of civilized life  he had frequent glimpses  of those seducing pleasures which he had once enjoyed in the freedom of  the woods     whilst wandering through these melancholy remains of former scenes  a  question was put to the divine concerning the place where conanchet was  interred  he readily offered to show it  the grave was on the hill  and  distinguished only by a head stone that the grass had concealed from  former search  it merely bore the words   the narragansett       and this at its side   asked the inquirer   here is one also   before unnoted      the divine bent in the grass  and scraped the moss from the humble  monument  he then pointed to a line  carved with more than usual care  the  inscription simply said

going to tell  all those concerned in it about whose feelings i am  careful  are gone where  thank god  there are no secrets  if they know  what i am doing  i know they do not mind  if they were alive to read as i  record  they might perhaps now and again look a little paler and wish the  leaf turned  but to see the things set down would not make them unhappy   they do not love secrecy  half the misery in the world comes from trying  to look  instead of trying to be  what one is not  i would that not god  only but all good men and women might see me through and through  they  would not be pleased with everything they saw  but then neither am i  and  i would have no coals of fire in my soul s pockets  but my very nature  would shudder at the thought of letting one person that loved a secret  see into it  such a one never sees things as they are  would not indeed  see what was there  but something shaped and coloured after his own  likeness  no one who loves and chooses a secret can be of the pure in  heart that shall see god     yet how shall i tell even who i am  which of us is other than a secret to  all but god  which of us can tell  with poorest approximation  what he or  she is  not to touch the mystery of life  that one who is not myself has  made me able to say  i   how little can any of us tell about even those  ancestors whose names we know  while yet the nature  and still more the  character  of hundreds of them  have shared in determining what  i  means  every time one of us utters the word  for myself  i remember neither  father nor mother  nor one of their fathers or mothers  how little then  can i say as to what i am  but i will tell as much as most of my readers   if ever i have any  will care to know     i come of a long yeoman line of the name of whichcote  in scotland the  whichcotes would have been called  lairds   in england they were not  called  squires   repeatedly had younger sons of it risen to rank and  honour  and in several generations would his property have entitled the  head of the family to rank as a squire  but at the time when i began to  be aware of existence  the family possessions had dwindled to one large  farm  on which i found myself  naturally  while some of the family had  risen  others had sunk in the social scale  and of the latter was miss  martha moon  far more to my life than can appear in my story  i should  imagine there are few families in england covering a larger range of  social difference than ours  but i begin to think the chief difficulty in  writing a book must be to keep out what does not belong to it     i may mention  however  my conviction  that i owe many special delights  to the gradual development of my race in certain special relations to the  natural ways of the world  that i was myself brought up in such  relations  appears not enough to account for the intensity of my pleasure  in things belonging to simplest life  in everything of the open air  in  animals of all kinds  in the economy of field and meadow and moor  i can  no more understand my delight in the sweet breath of a cow  than i can  explain the process by which  that day in the garden  but i must not  forestall  and will say rather  than i can account for the tears which   now i am an old woman  fill my eyes just as they used when i was a child   at sight of the year s first primrose  a harebell  much as i have always  loved harebells  never moved me that way  some will say the cause   whatever it be  lies in my nature  not in my ancestry  that  anyhow  it  must have come first to some one  and why not to me  i answer  everything  lies in everyone of us  but has to be brought to the surface  it grows a  little in one  more in that one s child  more in that child s child  and  so on and on  with curious breaks as of a river which every now and then  takes to an underground course  one thing i am sure of  that  however any  good thing came  i did not make it  i can only be glad and thankful that  in me it came to the surface  to tell me how beautiful must he be who  thought of it  and made it in me  then surely one is nearer  if not to  god himself  yet to the things god loves  in the country than amid ugly  houses  things that could not have been invented by god  though he made  the man that made them  it is not the fashionable only that love the  town and not the country  the men and women who live in dirt and  squalor  their counterparts in this and worse things far more than they  think  are afraid of loneliness  and hate god s lovely dark           chapter ii       miss martha moon     let me look back and see what first things i first remember     all about my uncle first  but i keep him to the last  next  all about  rover  the dog  though for roving  i hardly remember him away from my  side  alas  he did not live to come into the story  but i must mention  him here  for i shall not write another book  and  in the briefest  summary of my childhood  to make no allusion to him would be disloyalty   i almost believe that at one period  had i been set to say who i was  i  should have included rover as an essential part of myself  his tail was  my tail  his legs were my legs  his tongue was my tongue   so much more  did i  as we gambolled together  seem conscious of his joy than of my  own  surely  among other and greater mercies  i shall find him again  the  next person i see busy about the place  now here now there in the house   and seldom outside it  is miss martha moon  the house is large  built at  a time when the family was one of consequence  and there was always much  to be done in it  the largest room in it is now called the kitchen  but  was doubtless called the hall when first it was built  this was miss  martha moon s headquarters     she was my uncle s second cousin  and as he always called her martha  so  did i  without rebuke  every one else about the place called her miss  martha     of much greater worth and much more genuine refinement than tens of  thousands the world calls ladies  she never claimed the distinction   indeed she strongly objected to it  if you had said or implied she was  a lady  she would have shrunk as from a covert reflection on the quality  of her work  had she known certain of such as nowadays call themselves  lady helps  i could have understood her objection  i think  however  it  came from a stern adherence to the factness  if i may coin the word  of  things  she never called a lie a fib     when she was angry  she always held her tongue  she feared being unfair   she had indeed a rare power of silence  to this day i do not  know   but  am nevertheless sure that  by an instinct of understanding  she saw into  my uncle s trouble  and descried  more or less plainly  the secret of it   while yet she never even alluded to the existence of such a trouble  she  had a regard for woman s dignity as profound as silent  she was not of  those that prate or rave about their rights  forget their duties  and  care only for what they count their victories     she declared herself dead against marriage  one day  while yet hardly  more than a child  i said to her thoughtfully      i wonder why you hate gentlemen  martha       hate  em  what on earth makes you say such a wicked thing  orbie   she  answered   hate  em  the poor dears  i love  em  what did you ever see to  make you think i hated your uncle now       oh  of course  uncle   i returned  for my uncle was all the world to me    nobody could hate uncle       she d be a bad woman  anyhow  that did   rejoined martha   but did  anybody ever hate the person that couldn t do without her  orbie      my name  suggested by my uncle because my mother died at my birth  was a  curious one  i believe he made it himself   belorba  it was  and it means   fair orphan       i don t know  martha   i replied      well  you watch and see   she returned   do you think i would stay here  and work from morning to night if i hadn t some reason for it   oh  i  like work   she went on   i don t deny that  i should be miserable if i  didn t work  but i m not bound to this sort of work  i have money of my  own  and i m no beggar for house room  but rather than leave your uncle   poor man  i would do the work of a ploughman for him       then why don t you marry him  martha   i said  with innocent  impertinence      marry him  i wouldn t marry him for ten thousand pounds  child       why not  if you love him so much  i m sure he wouldn t mind       marry him   repeated miss martha  and stood looking at me as if here at  last was a creature she could  not  understand   marry the poor dear man   and make him miserable  i could love any man better than that  just you  open your eyes  my dear  and see what goes on about you  do you see so  many men made happy by their wives  i don t say it s all the wives   fault  poor things  but the fact s the same  there s the poor husbands  all the time trying hard to bear it  what with the babies  and the  headaches  and the rest of it  that s what it comes to  the husbands are  not happy  no  no  a woman can do better for a man than marry him       but mayn t it be the husband s fault  sometimes  martha       it may  but what better is it for that  what better is the wife for  knowing it  or how much happier the husband for not knowing it  as soon  as you come to weighing who s in fault  and counting how much  it s all  up with the marriage  there s no more comfort in life for either of them   women are sent into the world to make men happy  i was sent to your  uncle  and i m trying to do my duty  it s nothing to me what other women  think  i m here to serve your uncle  what comes of me  i don t care  so  long as i do my work  and don t keep him waiting that made me for it  you  may think it a small thing to make a man happy  i don t  god thought him  worth making  and he wouldn t be if he was miserable  i ve seen one woman  make ten men unhappy  i know my calling  orbie  nothing would make me  marry one of them  poor things       but if they all said as you do  martha       no doubt the world would come to an end  but it would go out singing   not crying  i don t see that would matter  there would be enough to make  each other happy in heaven  and the lord could make more as they were  wanted       uncle says it takes god a long time to make a man   i ventured to  remark     miss martha was silent for a moment  she did not see how my remark bore  on the matter in hand  but she had such respect for anything my uncle  said  that when she did not grasp it she held her peace      anyhow there s no fear of it for the present   she answered   you heard  the screed of banns last sunday      i thought you would have a better idea of miss martha moon from hearing  her talk  than from any talk about her  to hear one talk is better than  to see one  but i would not have you think she often spoke at such  length  she was in truth a woman of few words  never troubled or  troubling with any verbal catarrh  especially silent she was when any one  she loved was in distress  i have seen her stand moveless for moments   with a look that was the incarnation of essential motherhood  as if her  eyes were swallowing up sorrow  as if her soul was ready to be the  sacrifice for sin  then she would turn away with a droop of the eye lids  that seemed to say she saw what it was  but saw also how little she could  do for it  oh the depth of the love trouble in those eyes of hers     martha never set herself to teach me anything  but i could not know  martha without learning something of the genuine human heart  i gathered  from her by unconscious assimilation  possibly  a spiritual action  analogous to exosmose and endosmose  takes place between certain souls           chapter iii       my uncle     now i must tell you what my uncle was like     the first thing that struck you about him would have been  how tall and  thin he was  the next thing would have been  how he stooped  and the  next  how sad he looked  it scarcely seemed that martha moon had been  able to do much for him  yet doubtless she had done  and was doing  more  than either he or she knew  he had rather a small head on the top of his  long body  and when he stood straight up  which was not very often  it  seemed so far away  that some one said he took him for zacchaeus looking  down from the sycomore   i  never thought of analyzing his appearance   never thought of comparing him with any one else  to me he was the best  and most beautiful of men  the first man in all the world  nor did i  change my mind about him ever  i only came to want another to think of  him as i did     his features were in fine proportion  though perhaps too delicate   perhaps they were a little too small to be properly beautiful  when first  i saw a likeness of the poet shelley  i called out  my uncle   and  immediately began to see differences  he wore a small but long moustache   brushed away from his mouth  and over it his eyes looked large  they were  of a clear gray  and very gentle  i know from the testimony of others   that i was right in imagining him a really learned man  that small head  of his contained more and better than many a larger head of greater note   he was constantly reading  that is  when not thinking  or giving me the  lessons which make me now thank him for half my conscious soul     reading or writing or thinking  he made me always welcome to share his  room with him  but he seldom took me out walking  he was by no means  regular in his habits  regarded neither times nor seasons  went and came  like a bird  his hour for going out was unknown to himself  was seldom  two days together the same  he would rise up suddenly  even in the middle  of a lesson  he always called it  a lesson together   and without a word  walk from the room and the house  i had soon observed that in gloomy  weather he went out often  in the sunshine seldom     the house had a large garden  of a very old fashioned sort  such a place  for the charm of both glory and gloom as i have never seen elsewhere  i  have had other eyes opened within me to deeper beauties than i saw in  that garden then  my remembrance of it is none the less of an enchanted  ground  but my uncle never walked in it  when he walked  it was always  out on the moor he went  and what time he would return no one ever knew   his meals were uninteresting to him  no concern to any one but martha   who never uttered a word of impatience  and seldom a word of anxiety  at  whatever hour of the day he went  it was almost always night when he came  home  often late night  in the house he much preferred his own room to  any other     this room  not so large as the kitchen hall  but quite as long  seems to  me  when i look back  my earliest surrounding  it was the centre from  which my roving fancies issued as from their source  and the end of their  journey to which as to their home they returned  it was a curious place   were you to see first the inside of the house and then the outside  you  would find yourself at a loss to conjecture where within it could be  situated such a room  it was not  however  contained in what  to a  cursory glance  passed for the habitable house  and a stranger would not  easily have found the entrance to it     both its nature and situation were in keeping with certain peculiarities  of my uncle s mental being  he was given to curious inquiries  he would  set out to solve now one now another historical point as odd as  uninteresting to any but a mind capable of starting such a question  to  determine it  he would search book after book  as if it were a live  thing  in whose memory must remain  darkly stored  thousands of facts   requiring only to be recollected  amongst them might nestle the thing he  sought  and he would dig for it as in a mine that went branching through  the hardened dust of ages  i fancy he read any old book whatever of  english history with the haunting sense that next moment he might come  upon the trace of certain of his own ancestors of whom he specially  desired to enlarge his knowledge  whether he started any new thing in  mathematics i cannot tell  but he would sit absorbed  every day and all  day long  for weeks  over his slate  suddenly throw it down  walk out for  the rest of the day  and leave his calculus  or whatever it was  for  months  he read shakespeare as with a microscope  propounding and  answering the most curious little questions  it seemed to me sometimes  i  confess  that he missed a plain point from his eyes being so sharp that  they looked through it without seeing it  having focused themselves  beyond it     a specimen of the kind of question he would ask and answer himself   occurs to me as i write  for he put it to me once as we read together      why   he said   did margaret  in  much ado about nothing   try to  persuade hero to wear her other rabato      and the answer was      because she feared her mistress would find out that she had been wearing  it  namely  the night before  when she personated her      and here i may put down a remark i heard him make in reference to a  theory which itself must seem nothing less than idiotic to any one who  knows shakespeare as my uncle knew him  the remark was this  that whoever  sought to enhance the fame of lord st  alban s  he was careful to use the  real title  by attributing to him the works of shakespeare  must either  be a man of weak intellect  of great ignorance  or of low moral  perception  for he cast on the memory of a man already more to be pitied  than any  a weight of obloquy such as it were hard to believe anyone  capable of deserving  a being with shakespeare s love of human nature   and bacon s insight into essential truth  guilty of the moral and social  atrocities into which his lordship s eagerness after money for scientific  research betrayed him  would be a monster as grotesque as abominable     i record the remark the rather that it shows my uncle could look at  things in a large way as well as hunt with a knife edge  at the same  time  devoutly as i honour him  i cannot but count him intended for  thinkings of larger scope than such as then seemed characteristic of him   i imagine his early history had affected his faculties  and influenced  the mode of their working  how indeed could it have been otherwise           chapter iv       my uncle s room  and my uncle in it     at right angles to the long  black and white house  stood a building  behind it  of possibly earlier date  but uncertain intent  it had been  used for many things before my uncle s time  once as part of a small  brewery  my uncle was positive that  whether built for the purpose or  not  it had been used as a chapel  and that the house was originally the  out lying cell of some convent  the signs on which he founded this  conclusion  i was never able to appreciate  to me  as containing my  uncle s study  the wonder house of my childhood  it was far more  interesting than any history could have made it  it had very thick walls   two low stories  and a high roof  entering it from the court behind the  house  every portion of it would seem to an ordinary beholder quite  accounted for  but it might have suggested itself to a more comprehending  observer  that a considerable space must lie between the roof and the low  ceiling of the first floor  which was taken up with the servants  rooms   of the ground floor  part was used as a dairy  part as a woodhouse  part  for certain vegetables  while part stored the turf dug for fuel from the  neighbouring moor     between this building and the house was a smaller and lower erection  a  mere out house  it also was strongly built  however  and the roof  in  perfect condition  seemed newer than the walls  it had been raised and  strengthened when used by my uncle to contain a passage leading from the  house to the roof of the building just described  in which he was  fashioning for himself the retreat which he rightly called his study  for  few must be the rooms more continuously thought and read in during one  lifetime than this     i have now to tell how it was reached from the house  you could hardly  have found the way to it  even had you set yourself seriously to the  task  without having in you a good share of the constructive faculty  the  whole was my uncle s contrivance  but might well have been supposed to  belong to the troubled times when a good hiding place would have added to  the value of any home     there was a large recess in the kitchen  of which the hearth  raised a  foot or so above the flagged floor  had filled the whole  a huge chimney  in fact  built out from the wall  at some later time an oblong space had  been cut out of the hearth to a level with the floor  and in it an iron  grate constructed for the more convenient burning of coal  hence the  remnant of the raised hearth looked like wide hobs to the grate  the  recess as a chimney corner was thereby spoiled  for coal makes a very  different kind of smoke from the aromatic product of wood or peat     right and left within the recess  were two common  unpainted doors  with  latches  if you opened either  you found an ordinary shallow cupboard   that on the right filled with shelves and crockery  that on the left with  brooms and other household implements     but if  in the frame of the door to the left  you pressed what looked  like the head of a large nail  not its door only but the whole cupboard  turned inward on unseen hinges  and revealed an ascending stair  which  was the approach to my uncle s room  at the head of the stair you went  through the wall of the house to the passage under the roof of the  out house  at the end of which a few more steps led up to the door of the  study  by that door you entered the roof of the more ancient building   lighted almost entirely from above  there was no indication outside of  the existence of this floor  except one tiny window  with vaguely pointed  arch  almost in the very top of the gable  here lay my nest  this was the  bower of my bliss     its walls rose but about three feet from the floor ere the slope of the  roof began  so that there was a considerable portion of the room in which  my tall uncle could not stand upright  there was width enough  notwithstanding  in which four as tall as he might have walked abreast up  and down a length of at least five and thirty feet     not merely the low walls  but the slopes of the roof were filled with  books as high as the narrow level portion of the ceiling  on the slopes  the bookshelves had of course to be peculiar  my uncle had contrived  and  partly himself made them  with the assistance of a carpenter he had known  all his life  they were individually fixed to the rafters  each  projecting over that beneath it  to get at the highest  he had to stand  on a few steps  to reach the lowest  he had to stoop at a right angle   the place was almost a tunnel of books     by setting a chair on an ancient chest that stood against the gable  and  a footstool on the chair  i could mount high enough to get into the deep  embrasure of the little window  whence alone to gain a glimpse of the  lower world  while from the floor i could see heaven through six  skylights  deep framed in books  as far back as i can remember  it was my  care to see that the inside of their glass was always bright  so that sun  and moon and stars might look in     the books were mostly in old and dingy bindings  but there were a few to  attract the eyes of a child  especially some annuals  in red skil  or  embossed leather  or  most bewitching of all  in paper  protected by a  tight case of the same  from which  with the help of a ribbon  you drew  out the precious little green volume  with its gilt edges and lovely  engravings  one of which in particular i remember  a castle in the  distance  a wood  a ghastly man at the head of a rearing horse  and a  white  mist like  fleeting ghost  the cause of the consternation  these  books had a large share in the witchery of the chamber     at the end of the room  near the gable window  but under one of the  skylights  was a table of white deal  without cover  at which my uncle  generally sat  sometimes writing  oftener leaning over a book   occasionally  however  he would occupy a large old fashioned easy chair   under the slope of the roof  in the same end of the room  sitting silent   neither writing nor reading  his eyes fixed straight before him  but  plainly upon nothing  they looked as if sights were going out of them  rather than coming in at them  when he sat thus  i would sit gazing at  him  oh how i loved him  loved every line of his gentle  troubled  countenance  i do not remember the time when i did not know that his face  was troubled  it gave the last finishing tenderness to my love for him   it was from no meddlesome curiosity that i sat watching him  from no  longing to learn what he was thinking about  or what pictures were going  and coming before the eyes of his mind  but from such a longing to  comfort him as amounted to pain  i think it was the desire to be near  him  in spirit  i mean  for i could be near him in the body any time  except when he was out on one of his lonely walks or rides  that made me  attend so closely to my studies  he taught me everything  and i yearned  to please him  but without this other half conscious yearning i do not  believe i should ever have made the progress he praised  i took indeed a  true delight in learning  but i would not so often have shut the book i  was enjoying to the full and taken up another  but for the sight or the  thought of my uncle s countenance     i think he never once sat down in the chair i have mentioned without  sooner or later rising hurriedly  and going out on one of his solitary  rambles     when we were having our lessons together  as he phrased it  we sat at the  table side by side  and he taught me as if we were two children finding  out together what it all meant  those lessons had  i think  the largest  share in the charm of the place  yet when  as not unfrequently  my uncle  would  in the middle of one of them  rise abruptly and leave me without a  word  to go  i knew  far away from the house  i was neither dismayed nor  uneasy  i had got used to the thing before i could wonder what it meant   i would just go back to the book i had been reading  or to any other that  attracted me  he never required the preparation of any lessons  it was of  no use to climb to the window in the hope of catching sight of him  for  thence was nothing to be seen immediately below but the tops of high  trees and a corner of the yard into which the cow houses opened  and my  uncle was never there  he neither understood nor cared about farming  his  elder brother  my father  had been bred to carry on the yeoman line of  the family  and my uncle was trained to the medical profession  my father  dying rather suddenly  my uncle  who was abroad at the time  and had not  begun to practise  returned to take his place  but never paid practical  attention to the farming any more than to his profession  he gave the  land in charge to a bailiff  and at once settled down  martha told me   into what we now saw him  she seemed to imply that grief at my father s  death was the cause of his depression  but i soon came to the conclusion  that it lasted too long to be so accounted for  gradually i grew  aware  so gradually that at length i seemed to have known it from the  first  that the soul of my uncle was harassed with an undying trouble   that some worm lay among the very roots of his life  what change could  ever dispel such a sadness as i often saw in that chair  now and then he  would sit there for hours  an open book in his hand perhaps  at which he  cast never a glance  all unaware of the eyes of the small maiden fixed  upon him  with a whole world of sympathy behind them  i suspect  however   as i believe i have said  that martha moon  in her silence  had pierced  the heart of the mystery  though she  knew  nothing     one practical lesson given me now and then in varying form by my uncle  i  at length  one day  suddenly and involuntarily associated with the  darkness that haunted him  in substance it was this   never  my little  one  hide anything from those that love you  never let anything that  makes itself a nest in your heart  grow into a secret  for then at once  it will begin to eat a hole in it   he would so often say the kind of  thing  that i seemed to know when it was coming  but i had heard it as a  thing of course  never realizing its truth  and listening to it only  because he whom i loved said it     i see with my mind s eye the fine small head and large eyes so far above  me  as we sit beside each other at the deal table  he looked down on me  like a bird of prey  his hair  gray  martha told me  before he was  thirty  was tufted out a little  like ruffled feathers  on each side  but  the eyes were not those of an eagle  they were a dove s eyes      a secret  little one  is a mole that burrows   said my uncle     the moment of insight was come  a voice seemed suddenly to say within me    he has a secret  it is biting his heart   my affection  my devotion  my  sacred concern for him  as suddenly swelled to twice their size  it was  as if a god were in pain  and i could not help him  i had no desire to  learn his secret  i only yearned heart and soul to comfort him  before  long  i had a secret myself for half a day  ever after  i shared so in  the trouble of his secret  that i seemed myself to possess or rather to  be possessed by one  such a secret that i did not myself know it     but in truth i had a secret then  for the moment i knew that he had a  secret  his secret  the outward fact of its existence  i mean  was my  secret  and besides this secret of his  i had then a secret of my own   for i knew that my uncle had a secret  and he did not know that i knew   therewith came  of course  the question  ought i to tell him  at once  by  the instinct of love  i saw that to tell him would put him in a great  difficulty  he might wish me never to let any one else know of it  and  how could he say so when he had been constantly warning me to let nothing  grow to a secret in my heart  as to telling martha moon  much as i loved  her  much as i knew she loved my uncle  and sure as i was that anything  concerning him was as sacred to her as to me  i dared not commit such a  breach of confidence as even to think in her presence that my uncle had a  secret  from that hour i had recurrent fits of a morbid terror at the  very idea of a secret  as if a secret were in itself a treacherous   poisonous guest  that ate away the life of its host     but to return  my half day secret came in this wise           chapter v       my first secret     i was one morning with my uncle in his room  lessons were over  and i was  reading a marvellous story in one of my favourite annuals  my uncle had  so taught me from infancy the right handling of books  that he would have  trusted me with the most valuable in his possession  i do not know how  old i was  but that is no matter  man or woman is aged according to the  development of the conscience  looking up  i saw him stooping over an  open drawer in a cabinet behind the door  i sat on the great chest under  the gable window  and was away from him the whole length of the room  he  had never told me not to look at him  had never seemed to object to the  presence of my eyes on anything he did  and as a matter of course i sat  observing him  partly because i had never seen any portion of that  cabinet open  he turned towards the sky light near him  and held up  between him and it a small something  of which i could just see that it  was red  and shone in the light  then he turned hurriedly  threw it in  the drawer  and went straight out  leaving the drawer open  i knew i had  lost his company for the day     the moment he was gone  the phantasm of the pretty thing he had been  looking at so intently  came back to me  somehow i seemed to understand  that i had no right to know what it was  seeing my uncle had not shown it  me  at the same time i had no law to guide me  he had never said i was  not to look at this or that in the room  if he had  even if the cabinet  had not been mentioned  i do not think i should have offended  but that  does not make the fault less  for which is the more guilty  the man who  knows there is a law against doing a certain thing and does it  or the  man who feels an authority in the depth of his nature forbidding the  thing  and yet does it  surely the latter is greatly the more guilty     i rose  and went to the cabinet  but when the contents of the drawer  began to show themselves as i drew near   i closed my lids  and kept them  close   until i had seated myself on the floor  with my back to the  cabinet  and the drawer projecting over my head like the shelf of a  bracket over its supporting figure  i could touch it with the top of my  head by straightening my back  how long i sat there motionless  i cannot  say  but it seems in retrospect at least a week  such a multitude of  thinkings went through my mind  the logical discussion of a thing that  has to be done  a thing awaiting action and not decision  the experiment   that is  whether the duty or the temptation has the more to say for  itself  is one of the straight roads to the pit  similarly  there are  multitudes who lose their lives pondering what they ought to believe   while something lies at their door waiting to be done  and rendering it  impossible for him who makes it wait  ever to know what to believe  only  a pure heart can understand  and a pure heart is one that sends out ready  hands  i knew perfectly well what i ought to do  namely  to shut that  drawer with the back of my head  then get up and do something  and forget  the shining stone i had seen betwixt my uncle s finger and thumb  yet  there i sat debating whether i was not at liberty to do in my uncle s  room what he had not told me not to do     i will not weary my reader with any further description of the evil path  by which i arrived at the evil act  to myself it is pain even now to tell  that i got on my feet  saw a blaze of shining things  banged to the  drawer  and knew that eve had eaten the apple  the eyes of my  consciousness were opened to the evil in me  through the evil done by me   evil seemed now a part of myself  so that nevermore should i get rid of  it  it may be easy for one regarding it from afar  through the telescope  only of a book  to exclaim   such a little thing   but it was i who did  it  and not another  it was i  and only i  who could know what i had  done  and it was not a little thing  that peep into my uncle s drawer  lies in my soul the type of sin  never have i done anything wrong with  such a clear assurance that i was doing wrong  as when i did the thing i  had taken most pains to reason out as right     like one stunned by an electric shock  i had neither feeling nor care  left for anything  i walked to the end of the long room  as far as i  could go from the scene of my crime  and sat down on the great chest   with my coffin  the cabinet  facing me in the distance  the first thing   i think  that i grew conscious of  was dreariness  there was nothing  interesting anywhere  what should i do  there was nothing to do  nothing  to think about  not a book worth reading  story was suddenly dried up at  its fountain  life was a plain without water brooks  if the sky was not   a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours   it was nothing better  than a canopy of gray and blue  by degrees my thought settled on what i  had done  and in a moment i realized it as it was  a vile thing  and i  had lost my life for it  this is the nearest i can come to the expression  of what i felt  i was simply in despair  i had done wrong  and the world  had closed in upon me  the sky had come down and was crushing me  the lid  of my coffin was closed  i should come no more out     but deliverance came speedily  and in how lovely a way  into my thought   not into the room  came my uncle  present to my deepest consciousness  he  stood tall  loving  beautiful  sad  i read no rebuke in his countenance   only sorrow that i had sinned  and sympathy with my suffering because of  my sin  then first i knew that i had  wronged  him in looking into his  drawer  then first i saw it was his being that made the thing i had done  an evil thing  if the drawer had been nobody s  there would have been no  wrong in looking into it  and what made it so very bad was that my uncle  was so good to me     with the discovery came a rush of gladsome relief  strange to say  with  the clearer perception of the greatness of the wrong i had done  came the  gladness of redemption  it was almost a pure joy to find that it was  against my uncle  my own uncle  that i had sinned  that joy was the first  gleam through a darkness that had seemed settled on my soul for ever  but  a brighter followed  for thus spake the truth within me   the thing is in  your uncle s hands  he is the lord of the wrong you have done  it is to  him it makes you a debtor   he loves you  and will forgive you  of course  he will  he cannot make undone what is done  but he will comfort you  and  find some way of setting things right  there must be some way  i cannot  be doomed to be a contemptible child to all eternity  it is so easy to go  wrong  and so hard to get right  he must help me      i sat the rest of the day alone in that solitary room  away from martha  and rover and everybody  i would that even now in my old age i waited for  god as then i waited for my uncle  if only he would come  that i might  pour out the story of my fall  for i had sinned after the similitude of  adam s transgression   only i was worse  for neither serpent nor wife had  tempted me     at tea time martha came to find me  i would not go with her  she would  bring me my tea  she said  i would not have any tea  with a look like  that she sometimes cast on my uncle  she left me  dear martha  she had  the lovely gift of leaving alone  that evening there was no tea in the  house  martha did not have any     with the conceit peculiar to repentance and humiliation  i took a curious  satisfaction in being hard on myself  i could have taken my meal  tolerably well  with the new hope in my uncle as my saviour  came comfort  enough for the natural process of getting hungry  and desiring food  but  with common  indeed vulgar foolishness  my own righteousness in taking  vengeance on my fault was a satisfaction to me  i did not then see the  presumption of the sinner s taking vengeance on her own fault  did not  see that i had no right to do that  for how should a thing defiled  punish  with all my great joy in the discovery that the fault was against  my uncle  i forgot that therefore i was in his jurisdiction  that he only  had to deal with it  he alone could punish  as he alone could forgive it     it was the end of august  and the night stole swiftly upon the day  it  began to grow very dusk  but i would not stir  i and the cabinet kept  each other dismal company while the gloom deepened into night  nor did  the night part us  for i and the cabinet filled all the darkness  had my  uncle remained the whole night away  i believe i should have sat till he  came  but  happily both for my mental suffering and my bodily endurance   he returned sooner than many a time  i heard the house door open  i knew  he would come to the study before going to his bedroom  and my heart gave  a bound of awe filled eagerness  i knew also that martha never spoke to  him when he returned from one of his late rambles  and that he would not  know i was there  long before she died martha knew how grateful he was  for her delicate consideration  martha moon was not one of this world s  ladies  but there is a country where the social question is not   is she  a lady   but   how much of a woman is she   martha s name must  i think   stand well up in the book of life     my uncle  then  approached his room without knowing there was a live  kernel to the dark that filled it  i hearkened to every nearer step as he  came up the stair  along the corridor  and up the short final ascent to  the door of the study  i had crept from my place to the middle of the  room  and  without a thought of consequences  stood waiting the arrival  through the dark  of my deliverer from the dark  i did not know that many  a man who would face a battery calmly  will spring a yard aside if a  yelping cur dart at him     my uncle opened the door  and closed it behind him  his lamp and matches  stood ready on his table  it was my part to see they were there  with a  sigh  which seemed to seek me in the darkness and find me  he came  forward through it  i caught him round the legs  and clung to him  he  gave a great gasp and a smothered cry  staggered  and nearly fell      my god   he murmured      uncle  uncle   i cried  in greater terror than he   it s only orbie   it s only your little one       oh  it s only my little one  is it   he rejoined  at once recovering his  equanimity  and not for a moment losing the temper so ready  like nervous  cat  to spring from most of us when startled     he caught me up in his arms  and held me to his heart  i could feel it  beat against my little person      uncle  uncle   i cried again   don t  don t       did i hurt you  my little one   he said  and relaxing his embrace  held  me more gently  but did not set me down      no  no   i answered   but i ve got a secret  and you mustn t kiss me  till it is gone  i wish there was a swine to send it into       give it to me  little one  i will treat it better than a swine would       but it mustn t be treated  uncle  it might come again       there is no fear of that  my child  as soon as a secret is told  it is  dead  it is a secret no longer       will it be dead  uncle   i returned     but it will be there  all the  same  when it is dead  an ugly thing  it will only put off its cloak  and  show itself       all secrets are not ugly things when their cloaks are off  the cloak may  be the ugly thing  and nothing else      he stood in the dark  holding me in his arms  but the clouds had cleared  off a little  and though there was no moon  i could see the dim blue of  the sky lights  and a little shine from the gray of his hair      but mine is an ugly thing   i said   and i hate it  please let me put it  out of my mouth  perhaps then it will go dead       out with it  little one       put me down  please   i returned     he walked to the old chest under the gable window  seated himself on it   and set me down beside him  i slipped from the chest  and knelt on the  floor at his feet  a little way in front of him  i did not touch him  and  all was again quite dark about us     i told him my story from beginning to end  along with a great part of my  meditations while hesitating to do the deed  i felt very choky  but  forced my way through  talking with a throat that did not seem my own   and sending out a voice i seemed never to have heard before  the moment i  ceased  a sound like a sob came out of the darkness  was it possible my  big uncle was crying  then indeed there was no hope for me  he was  horrified at my wickedness  and very sorry to have to give me up  i  howled like a wild beast      please  uncle  will you kill me   i cried  through a riot of sobs that  came from me like potatoes from a sack      yes  yes  i will kill you  my darling   he answered     this way  this  way   and stretching out his arms he found me in the dark  drew me to  him  and covered my face with kisses      now   he resumed   i ve killed you alive again  and the ugly secret is  dead  and will never come to life any more  and i think  besides  we have  killed the hen that lays the egg secrets      he rose with me in his arms  set me down on the chest  lighted his lamp   and carried it to the cabinet  then he returned  and taking me by the  hand  led me to it  opened wide the drawer of offence  lifted me  and  held me so that i could see well into it  the light flashed in a hundred  glories of colour from a multitude of cut but unset stones that lay loose  in it  i soon learned that most of them were of small money value  but  their beauty was none the less entrancing  there were stones of price  among them  however  and these were the first he taught me  because they  were the most beautiful  my fault had opened a new source of delight  my  stone lesson was now one of the great pleasures of the week  in after  years i saw in it the richness of god not content with setting right what  is wrong  but making from it a gain  he will not have his children the  worse for the wrong they have done  we shall lose nothing by it  he is  our father  for the hurting sand grain  he gives his oyster a pearl      there   said my uncle   you may look at them as often as you please   only mind you put every one back as soon as you have satisfied your eyes  with it  you must not put one in your pocket  or carry it about in your  hand      then he set me down  saying      now you must go to bed  and dream about the pretty things  i will tell  you a lot of stories about them afterward      we had a way of calling any kind of statement  a story      i never cared to ask how it was that  seeing all the same i had done the  wrong thing  the whole weight of it was gone from me  so utterly was it  gone  that i did not even inquire whether i ought so to let it pass from  me  it was nowhere  in the fire of my uncle s love to me and mine to him   the thing vanished  it was annihilated  should i not be a creature  unworthy of life  if  now in my old age  i  who had such an uncle in my  childhood  did not with my very life believe in god     i have wondered whether  if my father had lived to bring me up instead of  my uncle  i should have been very different  but the useless speculation  has only driven me to believe that the relations on the surface of life  are but the symbols of far deeper ties  which may exist without those  correspondent external ones  at the same time  now that  being old  i  naturally think of the coming change  i feel that  when i see my father   i shall have a different feeling for him just because he is my father   although my uncle did all the fatherly toward me  but we need not trouble  ourselves about our hearts  and all their varying hues and shades of  feeling  truth is at the root of all existence  therefore everything must  come right if only we are obedient to the truth  and right is the deepest  satisfaction of every creature as well as of god  i wait in confidence   if things be not as we think  they will both arouse and satisfy a better   think   making us glad they are not as we expected           chapter vi       i lose myself     i have one incident more to relate ere my narrative begins to flow from a  quite clear memory     i was by no means a small bookworm  neither spent all my time in the  enchanted ground of my uncle s study  it is true i loved the house  and  often felt like a burrowing animal that would rather not leave its hole   but occasionally even at such times would suddenly wake the passion for  the open air  i must get into it or die  i was well known in the  farmyard  not to the men only  but to the animals also  in the absence of  human playfellows  they did much to keep me from selfishness  but far  beyond it i took no unfrequent flight  always alone  neither martha nor  my uncle ever seemed to think i needed looking after  and i am not aware  that i should have gained anything by it  i speak for myself  i have no  theories about the bringing up of children  i went where and when i  pleased  as little challenged as my uncle himself  like him  i took now  and then a long ramble over the moor  fearing nothing  and knowing  nothing to fear  i went sometimes where it seemed as if human foot could  never have trod before  so wild and waste was the prospect  so unknown it  somehow looked  the house was built on the more sloping side of a high  hollow just within the moor  which stretched wide away from the very edge  of the farm  if you climbed the slope  following a certain rough country  road  at the top of it you saw on the one side the farm  in all the  colours and shades of its outspread  well tilled fields  on the other  side  the heath  if you went another way  through the garden  through the  belt of shrubs and pines that encircled it  and through the wilderness  behind that  you were at once upon the heath  if then you went as far as  the highest point in sight  wading through the heather  among the rocks  and great stones which in childhood i never doubted grew also  you saw  before you nothing but a wide  wild level  whose horizon was here and  there broken by low hills  but the seeming level was far from flat or  smooth  as i found on the day of the adventure i am about to relate  i  wonder i had never lost myself before  i suppose then first my legs were  able to wander beyond the ground with which my eyes were familiar     it had rained all the morning and afternoon  when our last lesson was  over  my uncle went out  and i betook myself to the barn  where i amused  myself in the straw  by this time rover must have gone back to his maker   for i remember as with me a large  respectable dog of the old fashioned  mastiff type  who endured me with a patience that amounted almost to  friendliness  but never followed me about  when i grew hungry  i went  into the house to have my afternoon meal  it was called tea  but i knew  nothing about tea  while in milk i was a connoisseur  i could tell  perfectly to which of the cows i was indebted for the milk i happened at  any time to be drinking  miss martha never allowed the milks of the  different cows to be mingled     just as my meal was over  the sun shone with sudden brilliance into my  very eyes  the storm was breaking up  and vanishing in the west  i threw  down my spoon  and ran  hatless as usual  from the house  the sun was on  the edge of the hollow  i made straight for him  the bracken was so wet  that my legs almost seemed walking through a brook  and my body through a  thick rain  in a moment i was sopping  but to be wet was of no  consequence to me  not for many years was i able to believe that damp  could hurt     when i reached the top  the sun was yet some distance above the horizon   and i had gone a good way toward him before he went down  as he sank he  sent up a wind  which blew a sense of coming dark  the wind of the sunset  brings me  ever since  a foreboding of tears  it seems to say   your day  is done  the hour of your darkness is at hand   it grew cold  and a  feeling of threat filled the air  all about the grave of the buried sun   the clouds were angry with dusky yellow and splashes of gold  they  lowered tumulous and menacing  then  lo  they had lost courage  their  bulk melted off in fierce vapour  gold and gray  and the sharp outcry of  their shape was gone  as i recall the airy scene  that horizon looks like  the void between a cataclysm and the moving afresh of the spirit of god  upon the face of the waters  i went on and on  i do not know why   something enticed me  or i was plunged in some meditation  then  absorbing  now forgotten  not necessarily worthless  i am jealous of  moods that can be forgotten  but such may leave traces in the character   i wandered on  what ups and downs there were  how uneven was the surface  of the moor  the feet learned what the eyes had not seen     all at once i woke to the fact that mountains hemmed me in  they looked  mountains  though they were but hills  what had become of home  where was  it  the light lingering in the west might surely have shown me the  direction of it  but i remember no west  nothing but a deep hollow and  dark hills  i was lost     i was not exactly frightened at first  i knew no cause of dread  i had  never seen a tramp even  i had no sense of the inimical  i knew nothing  of the danger from cold and exposure  but awe of the fading light and  coming darkness awoke in me  i began to be frightened  and fear is like  other live things  once started  it grows  then first i thought with  dismay  which became terror  of the slimy bogs and the deep pools in  them  but just as my heart was dying within me  i looked to the  hills  with no hope that from them would come my aid  and there  on the  edge of the sky  lifted against it  in a dip between two of the hills   was the form of a lady on horseback  i could see the skirt of her habit  flying out against the clouds as she rode  had she been a few feet lower   so as to come between me and the side of the hill instead of the sky  i  should not have seen her  neither should i if she had been a few hundred  yards further off  i shrieked at the thought that she did not see me  and  i could not make her hear me  she started  turned  seemed to look whence  the cry could have come  but kept on her way  then i shrieked in earnest   and began to run wildly toward her  i think she saw me  that my quicker  change of place detached my shape sufficiently to make it discernible   she pulled up  and sat like a statue  waiting me  i kept on calling as i  ran  to assure her i was doing my utmost  for i feared she might grow  impatient and leave me  but at last it was slowly indeed i staggered up  to her  spent  my foot caught  and as i fell  i clasped the leg of her  horse  i had no fear of animals more than of human beings  he was  startled  and rearing drew his leg from my arms  but he took care not to  come down on me  i rose to my feet  and stood panting     what the lady said  or what i answered  i cannot recall  the next thing i  remember is stumbling along by her side  for she made her horse walk that  i might keep up with her  she talked a little  but i do not remember what  she said  it is all a dream now  a far off one  it must have been like a  dream at the time  i was so exhausted  i remember a voice descending now  and then  as if from the clouds  a cold musical voice  with something in  it that made me not want to hear it  i remember her saying that we were  near her house  and would soon be there  i think she had found out from  me where i lived     all the time i never saw her face  it was too dark  i do not think she  once spoke kindly to me  she said i had no business to be out alone  she  wondered at my father and mother  i think i was too tired to tell her i  had no father or mother  when i did speak  she indicated neither by sound  nor movement that she heard or heeded what i said  she sat up above me in  the dark  unpleasant  and all but unseen  a riddle which the troubled  child stumbling along by her horse s side did not want solved  had there  been anything to call light  i should have run away from her  vague  doubts of witches and ogresses crossed my mind  but i said to myself the  stories about them were not true  and kept on as best i could     before we reached the house  we had left the heath  and were moving along  lanes  the horse seemed to walk with more confidence  and it was harder  for me to keep up with him  i was so tired that i could not feel my legs   i stumbled often  and once the horse trod on my foot  i fell  he went on   i had to run limping after him  at last we stopped  i could see nothing   the lady gave a musical cry  a voice and footsteps made answer  and  presently came the sound of a gate on its hinges  a long dark piece of  road followed  i knew we were among trees  for i heard the wind in them  over our heads  then i saw lights in windows  and presently we stopped at  the door of a great house  i remember nothing more of that night           chapter vii       the mirror     i woke the next morning in a strange bed  and for a long time could not  think how i came to be there  a maid appeared  and told me it was time to  get up  greatly to my dislike  she would insist on dressing me  my  clothes looked very miserable  i remember  in consequence of what they  had gone through the night before  she was kind to me  and asked me a  great many questions  but paid no heed to my answers  a treatment to  which i had not been used  i think she must have been the lady s maid   when i was ready  she took me to the housekeeper s room  where i had  bread and milk for breakfast  several servants  men and women  came and  went  and i thought they all looked at me strangely  i concluded they had  no little girls in that house  assuredly there was small favour for  children in it  in some houses the child is as a stranger  in others he  rules  neither such house is in the kingdom of heaven  i must have looked  a forlorn creature as i sat  or perched rather  on the old horsehair sofa  in that dingy room  nobody said more than a word or so to me  i wondered  what was going to be done with me  but i had long been able to wait for  what would come  at length  after  as it seemed  hours of weary waiting   during which my heart grew sick with longing after my uncle  i was   without a word of explanation  led through long passages into a room  which appeared enormous  there i was again left a long while  this time  alone  it was all white and gold  and had its walls nearly covered with  great mirrors from floor to ceiling  which  while it was indeed of great  size  was the cause of its looking so immeasurably large  but it was some  time before i discovered this  for i was not accustomed to mirrors   except the small one on my little dressing table  and one still less on  martha s  i had scarcely seen a mirror  and was not prepared for those  sheets of glass in narrow gold frames     i went about  looking at one thing and another  but handling nothing  my  late secret had cured me of that  weary at last  i dropped upon a low  chair  and would probably have soon fallen asleep  had not the door  opened  and some one come in  i could not see the door without turning   and was too tired and sleepy to move  i sat still  staring  hardly  conscious  into the mirror in front of me  all at once i descried in it  my uncle  but only to see him grow white as death  and turn away  reeling  as if he would fall  the sight so bewildered me that  instead of rushing  to embrace him  i sat frozen  he clapped his hands to his eyes  steadied  himself  stood for a moment rigid  then came straight toward me  but  to  my added astonishment  he gave me no greeting  or showed any sign of joy  at having found me  never before had he seen me for the first time any  day  without giving me a kiss  never before  it seemed to me  had he  spoken to me without a smile  i had been lost and was found  and he was  not glad  the strange reception fell on me like a numbing spell  i had  nothing to say  no impulse to move  no part in the present world  he  caught me up in his arms  hid his face upon me  knocked his shoulder  heavily against the door post as he went from the room  walked straight  through the hall  and out of the house  i think no one saw us as we went   i am sure neither of us saw any one  with long strides he walked down the  avenue  never turning his head  not until we were on the moor  out of  sight of the house  did he stop  then he set me down  and then first we  discovered that he had left his hat behind  for all his carrying of me   and going so fast  and i must have been rather heavy  his face had no  colour in it      shall i run and get it  uncle   i said  as i saw him raise his hand to  his head and find no hat there to be taken off   i should be back in a  minute      it was the first word spoken between us   no  my little one   he  answered  wiping his forehead  his voice sounded far away  like that of  one speaking in a dream   i can t let you out of my sight  i ve been  wandering the moor all night looking for you      with that he caught me up again  and pressing his face to mine  walked  with me thus  for a long quarter of a mile  i should think  oh how safe i  felt   and how happy   happy beyond smiling  i loved him before  but i  never knew before what it was to lose him and find him again      tell me   he said at length     i told him all  and he did not speak a word until my tale was finished      were you very frightened   he then asked   when you found you had lost  your way  and darkness was coming       i was frightened  or i would not have gone to the lady  but i wish i had  staid on the moor for you to find me  i knew you would soon be out  looking for me  until she came i comforted myself with thinking that  perhaps even then you were on the moor  and i might see you any moment       what else did you think of       i thought that god was out on the moor  and if you were not there  he  would keep me company       ah   said my uncle  as if thinking to himself   she but needs him the  more when i am with her       yes  of course   i answered   i need him then for you as well as for  myself       that is very true  my child   shall i tell you one thing i thought of  while looking for you       please  uncle       i thought how jesus  father and mother must have felt when they were  looking for him       and they needn t have been so unhappy if they had thought who he  was  need they       certainly not  and i needn t have been so unhappy if i had thought who  you were  but i was terribly frightened  and there i was wrong       who am i  uncle       another little one of the same father as he       why were you frightened  uncle       i was afraid of your being frightened       i hardly had time to be frightened before the lady came       yes  you see i needn t have been so unhappy      my uncle always treated me as if i could understand him perfectly  this  came  i see now  from the essential childlikeness of his nature  and from  no educational theory      sometimes   he went on   i look all around me to see if jesus is out  anywhere  but i have never seen him yet       we shall see him one day  shan t we   i said  craning round to look into  his eyes  which were my earthly paradise  nor are they a whit less dear  to me  nay  they are dearer  that he has been in god s somewhere  that  is  the heavenly paradise  for many a year      i think so   he answered  with a sigh that seemed to swell like a  sea wave against me  as i sat on his arm     i hope so  i live but for  that  and for one thing more      there are some  i fancy  who would blame him for not being sure  and  bring text after text to prove that he ought to have been sure  but oh  those text people  they look to me  not like the clay sparrows that jesus  made fly  but like bird skins in a glass case  stuffed with texts  the  doubt of a man like my uncle must be a far better thing than their  assurance      would you have been frightened if you had met him on the moor last  night  little one   he asked  after a pause      oh  no  uncle   i returned   i should have thought it was you till i  came nearer  and then i should have known who it was  he wouldn t like a  big girl like me to be frightened at him  would he       indeed not    answered my uncle fervently  but again his words brought  with them a great sigh  and he said no more     when we reached home  he gave me up to martha  and went out again  nor  returned before i was in bed  but he came to my room  and waked me with a  kiss  which sent me faster asleep than before           chapter viii       thanatos and zoe    i think it must have been soon after this that my uncle bought himself a  horse  i know something of horses now  that is  if much riding and much  love suffice to give a knowledge of them  and the horse which was a glory  and a wonder to me then  is a glory and a wonder to me still  he was  large  big boned  and powerful  with less beauty but more grandeur than a  thoroughbred  and full of a fiery gentleness  he was the very horse for  sir philip sidney     one day  after he had had him for several months  and had let no one  saddle him but himself  therefore knew him perfectly  and knew that the  horse knew his master  i happened to be in the yard as he mounted  the  moment he was in the saddle  he bent down to me  and held out his hand      come with me  little one   he said     almost ere i knew  i was in the saddle before him  i grasped his hand   instinctively caught with my foot at his  and was astride the pommel  i  will not say i sat very comfortably  but the memory of that day s delight  will never leave me  not  through all the secular to be   there must be a  god to the world that could give any such delight as fell then to the  share of one little girl  i think my uncle must soon after have got  another saddle  for i have no recollection of any more discomfort  i  remember only the delight of the motion of the horse under me     for  after this  i rode with him often  and he taught me to ride as  surely not many have been taught  when he saw me so at home in my seat as  to require no support  he made me change my position  and go behind him   there i sat sideways on a cloth  like a lady of old time on a pillion   when i had got used to this  my uncle made me stand on the horse s broad  back  holding on by his shoulders  and it was wonderful how soon  and how  unconsciously  i accommodated myself to every motion of the strength that  bore me  learning to keep my place by pure balance like a rope dancer  i  had soon quite forgotten to hold by my uncle  and without the least  support rode as comfortably  and with as much confidence  as any rider in  a circus  though with a far less easy pace under me  when my uncle found  me capable of this  he was much pleased  though a little nervous at  times     able now to ride his big horse any way  he brought me one afternoon the  loveliest of shetland ponies  not very small  with the ordinary human  distrust in good  i could hardly believe she was meant for me  she was a  dappled gray  like the twilight of a morning after rain  my uncle said   he called her zoe  which means life  his own horse he called thanatos   which means death  such as understood it  thought it a terrible name to  give a horse  for most people are so afraid of death that they regard his  very name with awe     my uncle had a riding habit made for me  and after a week found i could  give him no more trouble with my horsewomanship  at once i was at home on  my new friend s back  with vistas of delight innumerable opening around  me  and from that day my uncle seldom rode without me  when he went  wandering  it was almost always on foot  and then  as before  he was  always alone  the idea of offering to accompany him on such an occasion   had never occurred to me     but one stormy autumn afternoon  most of my memories seem of the  autumn  my uncle looked worse than usual when he went out  and i felt  i  think for the first time  a vague uneasiness about him  perhaps i had  been thinking of him more  perhaps i had begun to wonder what the secret  could be that made him so often seem unhappy  anyhow this evening the  desire awoke to be with him in his trouble whatever it was  there was no  curiosity in the feeling  i think  only the desire to serve him as i had  never served him yet  i had been  as long as i could remember  always at  his beck or lightest call  now i wanted to come when needed without being  called  was it impossible a girl should do anything for a man in his  trouble  he  a great man  had helped a little girl out of the deepest  despair  could the little girl do nothing for the great man  that the big  people should do everything  did not seem fair  he had told me once that  the world was held together by what every one could do that the others  could not do  there must be something i could do that he could not do     the rain was coming down on the roof like the steady tramp of distant  squadrons  i was in the study  therefore near the tiles  and that was how  the rain always sounded upon them  tramp  tramp  tramp  came the whole  army of things  riding  riding  to befall my uncle and me  tramp  tramp   came the troops of the future  to take the citadel of the present  i was  not afraid of them  neither sought to imagine myself afraid  i had no  picture in my mind of any evil that could assail me  a little grove of  black poplars under the gable window  kept swaying their expostulations   and moaning their entreaties  the great rushing blasts of the wind  through their rooted resistance  made the music of the band that  accompanied the march of the unknown  i sat and listened  with the vague  conviction that something was being done somewhere  it could not be that  only the wind and the trees and the rain were in all that wailing and  marching  the powers of life and death must somewhere be at work  then  rose before me the face of my uncle  as he walked from the room  haloed  in a sorrowful stillness  if only i could be with him  if only i knew  where to seek him  wishing  wishing  i sat and listened to the rain and  the wind     suddenly i found myself on my feet  making for the door  i would not have  ventured alone upon the moor in such a night  but i should have zoe with  me  who knew all the ways of it  had doubtless been used to bogs in her  own country  and her mother before her  like a small elephant  she would  put out her little foot  and tap  and sound  to see if the surface would  bear her  if the questionable spot was what it looked to her mistress  or  what she herself doubted it  when she had once made up her mind in the  negative  no foolish attempt of mine could overpersuade her  could make  her trust our weight on it a hair s breadth  in a bog the greenest spots  are the most dangerous  and zoe knew it  the matted roots might be afloat  on a fathomless depth of water  backed by my uncle  she soon taught me to  be as much afraid of those green spots as she was herself  i had learned  to trust her thoroughly     i took my way to the stable  with a hug and a kiss to martha as i passed  her in the kitchen  i got the cowboy to saddle zoe  fearing i might not  persuade one of the big men on such a night  and i was not quite able  myself to tighten the girths properly  she had not been out all day  and  when i mounted  she danced at the prospect of a gallop     i took with me the little lantern i went about the place with when  there was no moon  and with this alight in my hand  we darted off at a  tight reined gallop into the wet blowing night  what i was going for i  did not know  beyond being with my uncle  so far was i from any fear   that  but for my shadowy uneasiness about him  i should have been filled  full of the wild joy of battle with the elements  the first part of the  way  i had to cling to the saddle  not otherwise could i keep my seat  against the wind  which blew so fiercely on me sideways  that it  threatened to blow me out of it     i had not gone far before the saddle began to turn round with me  i was  slipping to the ground  i pulled up  dismounted  undid the girths with  difficulty  set the saddle straight  then pulled at every strap with all  my might  it was to no purpose  i could not get another hole out of one  of them  i mounted and set off again  but the moment a stronger blast  came  the saddle began to turn  then i thought of something to try   dismounting once more  i got up on the off side  the wind now pushed me  on to the saddle  freeing it from my leverage  while i had  besides  the  use of my legs against the wind  so that we got on bravely  my zoe and i   but  alas  my lantern was out  and it was impossible to light it again   so that i had now no arrow to shoot at random for my uncle s eye  before  long we reached a tolerable cart track  which led across the waste to a  village  and the wind being now behind us  i resumed the more comfortable  seat in the saddle     we were going at a good speed  and had ridden  as i judged  about three  miles  when there came a great flash of lightning  not like any flash i  had ever seen before  it was neither the reflection of lightning below  the horizon  nor the sudden zigzagged blade  the very idea of force  without weight  it was the burst of a ball headed torrent of fire from a  dark cloud  like water sudden from a mountain s heart  which went rushing  down a rugged channel  as if the cloud were indeed a mountain  and the  fire one of its cataracts  its endurance was momentary  but its moments  might have been counted  for it lasted appreciably longer than an  ordinary flash  revealing to my eyes what remains on my mind clear as the  picture of some neighbouring tree on the skin of one slain by lightning   the torrent tumbled down the cloud and vanished  but left with me the  vision of a man  plainly my uncle  a few hundred yards from me  on a  gigantic gray horse  which reared high with fright  but for its size i  could have testified before a magistrate  that i had not only seen that  horse in the stable as my pony was being saddled  but had stroked and  kissed him on the nose  i conceived at once that his apparent size was an  illusion caused by the suddenness and keenness of the light  and that my  uncle had come home before i had well reached the moor  and had ridden  out after me  with a wild cry of delight  i turned at once to leave the  road and join him  but the thunder that moment burst with a terrific  bellow  and swallowed my cry  the same instant  however  came through it  from the other side the voice of my uncle only a few yards away      stay  little one   he shouted   stay where you are  i will be with you  in a moment      i obeyed  as ever and always without a thought i obeyed the slightest  word of my uncle  zoe and i stood as if never yet parted from chaos and  the dark  for zoe too loved his voice  the wind rose suddenly from a lull  to a great roar  emptying a huge cloudful of rain upon us  so that i  heard no sound of my uncle s approach  but presently out of the dark an  arm was around me  and my head was lying on my uncle s bosom  then the  dark and the rain seemed the natural elements for love and confidence      but  uncle   i murmured  full of wonder which had had no time to take  shape   how is it      he answered in a whisper that seemed to dread the ear of the wind  lest  it should hear him       you saw  did you       i saw you upon death away there in the middle of the lightning  i was  going to you  i don t know what to think      my uncle and i often called the horse by his english name      neither do i   he returned  with a strange half voice  as if he were  choking   it must have been  i don t know what  there is a deep bog away  just there  it must be a lake by now       yes  uncle  i might have remembered  but how was i to think of that when  i saw you there  on dear old death too  he s the last of horses to get  into a bog  he knows his own weight too well       but why did you come out on such a night  what possessed you  little  one  in such a storm  i begin to be afraid what next you may do       i never do anything  now  that i think you would mind me doing   i  answered   but if you will write out a little book of  mays  and   maynots   i will learn it by heart       no  no   he returned   we are not going back to the tables of the law   you have a better law written in your heart  my child  i will trust to  that   but tell me why you came out on such a night  and as dark as  pitch       just because it was such a night  uncle  and you were out in it   i  answered   ain t i your own little girl  i hope you ain t sorry i came   uncle  i am glad  and i shouldn t like ever to be glad at what made you  sorry       what are you glad of       that i came  because i ve found you  i came to look for you       why did you come to night more than any other night       because i wanted so much to see you  i thought i might be of use to  you       you are always of use to me  but why did you think of it just to night       i don t know   i am older than i was last night   i replied     he seemed to understand me  and asked me no more questions     all the time  we had been standing still in the storm  he took zoe s head  and turned it toward home  the dear creature set out with slow leisurely  step  heedless apparently of storm and stable  she knew who was by her  side  and he must set the pace     as we went my uncle seemed lost in thought  and no wonder  for how could  the sight we had seen be accounted for  or what might it indicate     many were the strange tales i had read  and my conviction was that the  vision belonged to the inexplicable  it grew upon me that i had seen my  uncle s double  that he should see his own double would not in itself  have much surprised me  or  indeed  that i should see it  but i had never  read of another person seeing a double at the same time with the person  doubled  during the next few days i sought hard for some possible  explanation of what had occurred  but could find nothing parallel to it  within the scope of my knowledge  i tried  fata morgana  mirage   parhelion   and whatever i had learned of recognized illusion  but in  vain sought satisfaction  or anything pointing in the direction of  satisfaction  i was compelled to leave the thing alone  my uncle kept  silence about it  but seemed to brood more than usual  i think he too was  convinced that it must have another explanation than present science  would afford him  once i ventured to ask if he had come to any  conclusion  with a sad smile  he answered      i am waiting  little one  there is much we have to wait for  where would  be the good of having your mind made up wrong  it only stands in the way  of getting it made up right      by degrees the thing went into the distance  and i ceased even  speculating upon it  but one little fact i may mention ere i leave  it  that  just as i was reaching a state of quiet mental prorogation  i  suddenly remembered that  the moment after the flash  my zoe  startled as  she was  gave out a low whinny  i remembered the quiver of it under me   she too must have seen her master s double           chapter ix       the garden     i remember nothing more to disturb the even flow of my life till i was  nearly seventeen  many pleasant things had come and gone  many pleasant  things kept coming and going  i had studied tolerably well  at least my  uncle showed himself pleased with the progress i had made and was making   i know even yet a good deal more than would be required for one of these  modern degrees feminine  i had besides read more of the older literature  of my country than any one i have met except my uncle  i had also this  advantage over most students  that my knowledge was gained without the  slightest prick of the spur of emulation  purely in following the same  delight in myself that shone radiant in the eyes of my uncle as he read  with me  i had this advantage also over many  that  perhaps from  impression of the higher mind  i saw and learned a thing not merely as a  fact whose glory lay in the mystery of its undeveloped harmonics  but as  the harbinger of an unknown advent  for as long as i can remember  my  heart was given to expectation  was tuned to long waiting  i constantly  felt  felt without thinking  that something was coming  i feel it now   were i young i dared not say so  how could i  compassed about with so  great a cloud of witnesses to the common place  do i not see their  superior smile  as  with voices sweetly acidulous  they quote in reply       love is well on the way   he ll be here to day     or  at latest  the end of the week   too soon you will find him   and the sorrow behind him    you will not go out to seek      would they not tell me that such expectation was but the shadow of the  cloud called love  hanging no bigger than a man s hand on the far  horizon  but fraught with storm for mind and soul  which  when it  withdrew  would carry with it the glow and the glory and the hope of  life  being at best but the mirage of an unattainable paradise  therefore  direst of deceptions  little do such suspect that their own behaviour has  withered their faith  and their unbelief dried up their life  they can  now no more believe in what they once felt  than a cloud can believe in  the rainbow it once bore on its bosom  but i am old  therefore dare to  say that i expect more and better and higher and lovelier things than i  have ever had  i am not going home to god to say   father  i have  imagined more beautiful things than thou art able to make true  they were  so good that thou thyself art either not good enough to will them  or not  strong enough to make them  thou couldst but make thy creature dream of  them  because thou canst but dream of them thyself   nay  nay  in the  faith of him to whom the father shows all things he does  i expect  lovelier gifts than i ever have been  ever shall be able to dream of  asleep  or imagine awake     i was now approaching the verge of woman hood  what lay beyond it i could  ill descry  though surely a vague power of undeveloped prophecy dwells in  every created thing  even in the bird ere he chips his shell     should i dare  or could i endure to write of what lies now to my hand  if  i did not believe that not our worst but our best moments  not our low  but our lofty moods  not our times logical and scientific  but our times  instinctive and imaginative  are those in which we perceive the truth  in  them we behold it with a beholding which is one with believing  and           though nothing can bring back the hour       of splendour in the grass  of glory in the flower      could not wordsworth  and cannot we  call up the vision of that hour  and  has not its memory almost  or even altogether  the potency of its  presence  is not the very thought of any certain flower enough to make me  believe in that flower  believe it to mean all it ever seemed to mean   that  these  eyes may never more rest upon it with the old delight  means  little  and matters nothing  i have other eyes  and shall have yet  others  if i thought  as so many have degraded themselves to think  that  the glory of things in the morning of love was a glamour cast upon the  world  no outshine of indwelling radiance  should i care to breathe one  day more the air of this or of any world  nay  nay  but there dwells in  everything the father hath made  the fire of the burning bush  as at home  in his son dwelt the glory that  set free  broke out from him on the  mount of his transfiguration  the happy making vision of things that  floods the gaze of the youth  when first he lives in the marvel of  loving  and being loved by  a woman  is the true vision  and the more  likely to be the true one  that  when he gives way to selfishness  he  loses faith in the vision  and sinks back into the commonplace unfaith of  the beggarly world  a disappointed  sneering worshipper of power and  money  with this remnant of the light yet in him  that he grumbles at the  gloom its departure has left behind  he confesses by his soreness that  the illusion ought to have been true  he seldom confesses that he loved  himself more than the woman  and so lost her  he lays the blame on god   on the woman  on the soullessness of the universe  anywhere but on the  one being in which he is interested enough to be sure it exists  his own  precious  greedy  vulgar self  would i dare to write of love  if i did  not believe it a true  that is  an eternal thing     it was a summer of exceptional splendour in which my eyes were opened to   the glory of the sum of things   it was not so hot of the sun as summers  i have known  but there were so many gentle and loving winds about  with  never point or knife edge in them  that it seemed all the housework of  the universe was being done by ladies  then the way the odours went and  came on those sweet winds  and the way the twilight fell asleep into the  dark  and the way the sun rushed up in the morning  as if he cried  like  a boy   here i am  the father has sent me  isn t it jolly   i saw more  sun rises that year than any year before or since  and the grass was so  thick and soft  there must be grass in heaven  and the roses  both wild  and tame  that grew together in the wilderness   i think you would like  to hear about the wilderness     when i grew to notice  and think  and put things together  i began to  wonder how the wilderness came there  i could understand that the  solemn garden  with its great yew hedges and alleys  and its oddly cut  box trees  was a survival of the stately old gardens haunted by ruffs and  farthingales  but the wilderness looked so much younger that i was  perplexed with it  especially as i saw nothing like it anywhere else  i  asked my uncle about it  and he explained that it was indeed after an old  fashion  but that he had himself made the wilderness  mostly with his own  hands  when he was young  this surprised me  for i had never seen him  touch a spade  and hardly ever saw him in the garden  when i did  i  always felt as if something was going to happen  he said he had in it  tried to copy the wilderness laid out by lord st  alban s in his essays   i found the volume  and soon came upon the essay  on gardens  the passage  concerning the wilderness  gave me  and still gives me so much delight   that i will transplant it like a rose bush into this wilderness of mine   hoping it will give like pleasure to my reader      for the heath  which was the third part of our plot  i wish it to be  framed  as much as may be  to a natural wildness  trees i would have none  in it  but some thickets  made only of sweetbriar  and honnysuckle  and  some wild vine amongst  and the ground set with violets  strawberries   and primroses  for these are sweet  and prosper in the shade  and these  to be in the heath  here and there not in any order  i like also little  heapes  in the nature of mole hills  such as are in wild heaths  to be  set  some with wild thyme  some with pincks  some with germander  that  gives a good flower to the eye  some with periwinkle  some with violets   some with strawberries  some with couslips  some with daisies  some with  red roses  some with lilium convallium  some with sweet williams red   some with beares foot  and the like low flowers  being withall sweet and  sightly  part of which heapes  to be with standards  of little bushes   prickt upon their top  and part without  the standards to be roses   juniper  holly  beareberries  but here and there  because of the smell of  their blossom   red currans  gooseberries  rosemary  bayes  sweetbriar   and such like  but these standards  to be kept with cutting  that they  grow not out of course      just such  in all but the gooseberries and currants  was the wilderness  of our garden  you came on it by a sudden labyrinthine twist at the end  of a narrow alley of yew  and a sudden door in the high wall  my uncle  said he liked well to see roses in the kitchen garden  but not  gooseberries in the flower garden  especially a wild flower garden   wherein lies the difference  i never quite made out  but i feel a  difference  my main delight in the wilderness was to see the roses among  the heather  particularly the wild roses  when i was grown up  the  wilderness always affected me like one of blake s  or one of beddoes s  yet wilder lyrics  to make it  my uncle had taken in a part of the heath   which came close up to the garden  leaving plenty of the heather and  ling  the protecting fence enclosed a good bit of the heath just as it  was  so that the wilderness melted away into the heath  and into the wide  moor  the fence  though contrived so as to be difficult to cross  being  so low that one had to look for it     everywhere the inner garden was surrounded with brick walls  and hedges  of yew within them  but immediately behind the house  the wall to the  lane was not very high           chapter x       once more a secret     one day in june i had gone into the garden about one o clock  whether  with or without object i forget  i had just seen my uncle start for  wittenage  hearing a horse s hoofs in the lane that ran along the outside  of the wall  i looked up  the same moment the horse stopped  and the face  of his rider appeared over the wall  between two stems of yew  and two  great flowers of purple lilac  in shape like two perfect bunches of  swarming bees  it was the face of a youth of eighteen  and beautiful with  a right manly beauty     the moment i looked on this face  i fell into a sort of trance  that is   i entered for a moment some condition of existence beyond the ramparts of  what commonly we call life  love at first sight it was that initiated the  strange experience  but understand me  real as what immediately followed  was to the consciousness  there was no actual fact in it     i stood gazing  my eyes seemed drawn  and drawing my person toward the  vision  isolate over the garden wall was the face  the rest of the man  and all the horse were hidden behind it  betwixt the yew stems and the  two great lilac flowers  how heart and brain are yet filled with the old  scent of them   my face  my mouth  my lips met his  i grew blind as with  all my heart i kissed him  then came a flash of icy terror  and a shudder  which it frights me even now to recall  instantly i knew that but a  moment had passed  and that i had not moved an inch from the spot where  first my eyes met his     but my eyes yet rested on his  i could not draw them away  i could not  free myself  helplessness was growing agony  his voice broke the spell   he lifted his hunting cap  and begged me to tell him the way to the next  village  my self possession returned  and the joy of its restoration  drove from me any lingering embarrassment  i went forward  and without a  faltering tone  i believe  gave him detailed directions  he told me  afterwards that  himself in a state of bewildered surprise  he thought me  the coolest young person he had ever had the fortune to meet  why should  one be pleased to know that she looked quite different from what she  felt  there is something wrong there  surely  i acknowledge the something  wrong  but do not understand it  he lifted his cap again  and rode away     i stood still at the foot of the lilac tree  and  from a vapour   condensed  not to a stone  but to a world  in which a new flora was about  to be developed  if no new spiritual sense was awakened in me  at least i  was aware of a new consciousness  i had never been to myself what i was  now     terror again seized me  the face might once more look over the wall  and  find me where it had left me  i turned  and went slowly away from the  house  gravitating to the darkest part of the garden      what has come to me   i said   that i seek the darkness  is this another  secret  am i in the grasp of a new enemy      and with that came the whirlwind of perplexity  must i go the first  moment i knew i could find him  and tell my uncle what had happened  and  how i felt  or must i have  and hold  and cherish in silent heart  a  thing so wondrous  so precious  so absorbing  had i not deliberately  promised  of my own will and at my own instance  never again to have a  secret from him  was this a secret  was it not a secret     the storm was up  and went on  the wonder is that  in the fire of the  new torment  i did not come to loathe the very thought of the young  man  which would have delivered me  if not from the necessity of  confession  yet from the main difficulty in confessing     i said to myself that the old secret was of a wrong done to my uncle   that what had made me miserable then was a bad secret  the perception of  this difference gave me comfort for a time  but not for long  the fact  remained  that i knew something concerning myself which my best friend  did not know  it was  and i could not prevent it from being  a barrier  between us     yet what was it i was concealing from him  what had i to tell him  how  was i to represent a thing of which i knew neither the name nor the  nature  a thing i could not describe  could i confess what i did not  understand  the thing might be what  in the tales i had read  was called  love  but i did not know that it was  it might be something new  peculiar  to myself  something for which there was no word in the language  how was  i to tell  i saw plainly that  if i tried to convey my new experience  i  should not get beyond the statement that i had a new experience  it did  not occur to me that the thing might be so well known  that a mere hint  of the feelings concerned  would enable any older person to classify the  consciousness  i said to myself i should merely perplex my uncle  and in  truth i believe that love  in every mind in which it arises  will vary in  colour and form  will always partake of that mind s individual isolation  in difference  this  however  is nothing to the present point     comfort myself as i might  that the impossible was required of no one   and granted that the thing was impossible  it was none the less a cause  of misery  a present disaster  i was aware  and soon my uncle would be  aware  of an impenetrable something separating us  i felt that we had  already begun to grow strange to each other  and the feeling lay like  death at my heart     our lessons together were still going on  that i was no longer a child  had made only the difference that progress must make  and i had no  thought that they would not thus go on always  they were never for a  moment irksome to me  i might be tired by them  but never of them  we  were regularly at work together by seven  and after half an hour for  breakfast  resumed work  at half past eleven our lessons were over  but  although the day was then clear of the imperative  much the greater part  of it was in general passed in each other s company  we might not speak a  word  but we would be hours together in the study  we might not speak a  word  but we would be hours together on horseback     for this day  then  our lessons were over  and my uncle was from home   this was an indisputable relief  yet the fact that it was so  pained me  keenly  for i recognized in it the first of the schism  how i got through  the day  i cannot tell  i was in a dream  not all a dream of delight   haunted with the face i had seen  and living in the new consciousness it  had waked in me  i spent most of it in the garden  now in the glooms of  the yew walks  and now in the smiling wilderness  it was odd  however   that  although i was not  expected  to be in my uncle s room at any time  but that of lessons  all the morning i had a feeling as if i ought to be  there  while yet glad that my uncle was not there     it was late before he returned  and i went to bed  perhaps i retired so  soon that i might not have to look into his eyes  usually  i sat now  until he came home  i was long in getting to sleep  and then i dreamed  i  thought i was out in the storm  and the flash came which revealed the  horse and his rider  but they were both different  the horse in the dream  was black as coal  as if carved out of the night itself  and the man  upon him was the beautiful stranger whose horse i had not seen for the  garden wall  the darkness fell  and the voice of my uncle called to me  i  waited for him in the storm with a troubled heart  for i knew he had not  seen that vision  and i could no more tell him of it  than could  christabel tell her father what she had seen after she lay down  i woke   but my waking was no relief           chapter xi       the mole burrows     i slept again after my dream  and do not know whether he came into my  room as he generally did when he had not said good night to me  of course  i woke unhappy  and the morning world had lost something of its natural  glow  its lovely freshness  it was not this time a thing new born of the  creating word  i dawdled with my dressing  the face kept coming  and  brought me no peace  yet brought me something for which it seemed worth  while even to lose my peace  but i did not know then  and do not yet know  what the loss of peace actually means  i only know that it must be  something far more terrible than anything i have ever known  i remained  so far true to my uncle  however  that not even for what the face seemed  to promise me  would i have consented to cause him trouble  for what i  saw in the face  i would do anything  i thought  except that     i went to him at the usual hour  determined that nothing should distract  me from my work  that he should perceive no difference in me  i was not  at the moment awake to the fact that here again were love and deception  hand in hand  but another love than mine was there  my uncle loved me  immeasurably more than i yet loved that heavenly vision  true love is  keen sighted as the eagle  and my uncle s love was love true  therefore  he saw what i sought to hide  it is only the shadow of love  generally a  grotesque  ugly thing  like so many other shadows  that is blind either  to the troubles or the faults of the shadow it seems to love  the moment  our eyes met  i saw that he saw something in mine that was not there when  last we parted  but he said nothing  and we sat down to our lessons   every now and then as they proceeded  however  i felt rather than saw his  eyes rest on me for a moment  questioning  i had never known them rest on  me so before  plainly he was aware of some change  and could there be  anything different in the relation of two who so long had loved each  other  without something being less well and good than before  nor was it  indeed wonderful he should see a difference  for  with all the might of  my resolve to do even better than usual  i would now and then find myself  unconscious of what either of us had last been saying  the face had come  yet again  and driven everything from its presence  i grew angry  not  with the youth  but with his face  for appearing so often when i did not  invite it  once i caught myself on the verge of crying out   can t you  wait  i will come presently   and my uncle looked up as if i had spoken   perhaps he had as good as heard the words  he possessed what almost  seemed a supernatural faculty of divining the thought of another  not  i  was sure  by any effort to perceive it  but by involuntary intuition  he  uttered no inquiring word  but a light sigh escaped him  which all but  made me burst into tears  i was on one side of a widening gulf  and he on  the other     our lessons ended  he rose immediately and left the room  five minutes  passed  and then came the clatter of his horse s feet on the stones of  the yard  a moment more  and i heard him ride away at a quick trot  i  burst into tears where i still sat beside my uncle s empty chair  i was  weary like one in a dream searching in vain for a spot whereupon to set  down her heart breaking burden  there was no one but my uncle to whom i  could tell any trouble  and the trouble i could not have told him had  hitherto been unimaginable  from this my reader may judge what a trouble  it was that i could not tell him my trouble  i was a traitor to my only  friend  had i begun to love him less  had i begun to turn away from him   i dared not believe it  that would have been to give eternity to my  misery  but it might be that at heart i was a bad  treacherous girl  i  had again a secret from him  i was not  with  him     i went into the garden  the day was sultry and oppressive  coolness or  comfort was nowhere  i sought the shadow of the live yew walls  there was  shelter in the shadow  but it oppressed the lungs while it comforted the  eyes  not a breath of wind breathed  the atmosphere seemed to have lost  its life giving  i went out into the wilderness  there the air was filled  and heaped with the odours of the heavenly plants that crowded its humble  floor  but they gave me no welcome  between two bushes that flamed out  roses  i lay down  and the heather and the rose trees closed above me  my  mind was in such a confusion of pain and pleasure  not without a hope of  deliverance somewhere in its clouded sky  that i could think no more  and  fell asleep     i imagine that  had i never again seen the young man  i should not have  suffered  i think that  by slow natural degrees  his phantasmal presence  would have ceased to haunt me  and gradually i should have returned to my  former condition  i do not mean i should have forgotten him  but neither  should i have been troubled when i thought of him  i know i should never  have regretted having seen him  in that  i had nothing to blame myself  for  and should have felt  not that a glory had passed away from the  earth  but that i had had a vision of bliss  what it was  i should not  have had the power to recall  but it would have left with me the faith  that i had beheld something too ethereal for my memory to store  i should  have consoled myself both with the dream  and with the conviction that i  should not dream it again  the peaceful sense of recovered nearness to my  uncle would have been far more precious than the dream  the sudden fire  of transfiguration that had for a moment flamed out of the all  and  straightway withdrawn  would have become a memory only  but none the less  would that enlargement of the child way of seeing things have remained  with me  i do not think that would ever have left me  it is the care of  the prudent wise that bleaches the grass  and is as the fumes of sulphur  to the red rose of life     outwearied with inward conflict  i slept a dreamless sleep         chapter xii       a letter     a cool soft breeze went through the curtains of my couch  and i awoke   the blooms of the peasant briars and the court roses were waving together  over my head  the sigh of the wind had breathed itself out over the far  heath  and ere it died in my fairy forest of lowly plants and bushes  had  found and fanned the cheeks that lay down hot and athirst for air  it  gave me new life  and i rose refreshed  something fluttered to the  ground  i thought it was a leaf from a white rose above me  but i looked   at my feet lay a piece of paper  i took it up  it had been folded very  hastily  and had no address  but who could have a better right to unfold  it than i  it might be nothing  it might be a letter  should i open it   should i not rather seize the opportunity of setting things right between  my heart and my uncle by taking it to him unopened  only  if it were  indeed  i dared hardly even in thought complete the supposition  might it  not be a wrong to the youth  might not the paper contain a confidence   might it not be the messenger of a heart that trusted me before even it  knew my name  would i inaugurate our acquaintance with an act of  treachery  or at least distrust  right or wrong  thus my heart reasoned   and to its reasoning i gave heed   it will   i said   be time enough to  resolve  when i know concerning what   this  i now see  was juggling  for  the question was whether i should be open with my uncle or not   it might  be   i said to myself   that  the moment i knew the contents of the  paper  i should reproach myself that i had not read it at once   i sat  down on a bush of heather  and unfolded it  this is what i found  written  with a pencil        i am the man to whom you talked so kindly over your garden wall  yesterday  i fear you may think me presuming and impertinent  presuming i  may be  but impertinent  surely not  if i were  would not my heart tell  me so  seeing it is all on your side      my name is john day  i do not yet know yours  i have not dared to  inquire after it  lest i should hear of some impassable gulf between us   the fear of such a gulf haunts me  i can think of nothing but the face i  saw over the wall through the clusters of lilac  the wall seems to keep  rising and rising  as if it would hide you for ever      is it wrong to think thus of you without your leave  if one may not love  the loveliest  then is the world but a fly trap hung in the great heaven   to catch and ruin souls      if i am writing nonsense  i cannot tell whether i am or not  it is  because my wits wander with my eyes to gaze at you through the leaves of  the wild white rose under which you are asleep  loveliest of faces  may  no gentlest wind of thought ripple thy perfect calm  until i have said  what i must  and laid it where she will find it      i live at rising  the manor house over the heath  i am the son of lady  cairnedge by a former marriage  i am twenty years of age  and have just  ended my last term at oxford  may i come and see you  if you will not see  me  why then did you walk into my quiet house  and turn everything upside  down  i shall come to night  in the dusk  and wait in the heather   outside the fence  if you come  thank god  if you do not  i shall believe  you could not  and come again and again and again  till hope is dead  but  i warn you i am a terrible hoper      it would startle  perhaps offend you  to wake and see me  but i cannot  bear to leave you asleep  something might come too near you  i will write  until you move  and then make haste to go      my heart swells with words too shy to go out  surely a will has brought  us together  i believe in fate  never in chance      when we see each other again  will the wall be down between us  or shall  i know it will part us all our mortal lives  longer than that it cannot   if you say to me   i must not see you  but i will think of you   not one  shall ever know i have other than a light heart  even now i begin the  endeavour to be such that  when we meet at last  as meet we must  you  shall not say   is this the man  alas  who dared to love me       i love you as one might love a woman angel who  at the merest breath  going to fashion a word unfit  would spread her wings and soar  do not  i  pray you  fear to let me come  there are things that must be done in  faith  else they never have being  let this be one of them   you stir      as i came to these last words  hurriedly written  i heard behind me  over  the height  the quick gallop of a horse  and knew the piece of firm turf  he was crossing  the same moment i was there in spirit  and the  imagination was almost vision  i saw him speeding away   to come again    said my heart  solemn with gladness     rising manor was the house to which the lady took me that dread night  when first i knew what it was to be alone in darkness and silence and  space  was that lady his mother  had she rescued me for her son  i was  not willing to believe it  though i had never actually seen her  the way  was mostly dark  and during the latter portion of it  i was much too  weary to look up where she sat on her great horse  i had never to my  knowledge heard who lived at rising  i was not born inquisitive  and  there were miles between us     i sat still  without impulse to move a finger  i lived essentially  now i  knew what had come to me  it was no merely idiosyncratic experience  for  the youth had the same  it was love  how otherwise could we thus be drawn  together from both sides  verily it seemed also good enough to be that  wondrous thing ever on the lips of poets and tale weaving magicians  was  it not far beyond any notion of it their words had given me     but my uncle  there lay bitterness  was i indeed false to him  that now  the thought of him was a pain  had i begun a new life apart from him  to  tell him would perhaps check the terrible separation  but how was i to  tell him  for the first time i knew that i had no mother  would mr  day s  mother be my mother too  and help me  but from no woman save my own  mother  hardly even from her  would i ask mediation with the uncle i had  loved and trusted all my life and with my whole heart  i had never known  father or mother  save as he had been father and mother and everybody to  me  what was i to do  gladly would i have hurried to some desert place   and there waited for the light i needed  that i was no longer in any  uncertainty as to the word that described my condition  did not  i found   make it easy to use the word   perhaps   i argued  struggling in the  toils of my new liberty   my uncle knows nothing of this kind of love   and would be unable to understand me  suppose i confessed to him what i  felt toward a man i had spoken to but once  and then only to tell him the  way to dumbleton  would he not think me out of my mind      at length i bethought me that  so long as i did not know what to do  i  was not required to do anything  i must wait till i did know what to do   but with the thought came suffering enough to be the wages of any sin  that  so far as i knew  i had ever committed  for the conviction awoke  that already the love that had hitherto been the chief joy of my being   had begun to pale and fade  was it possible i was ceasing to love my  uncle  what could any love be worth if mine should fail my uncle  love  itself must be a mockery  and life but a ceaseless sliding down to the  death of indifference  even if i never ceased to love him  it was just as  bad to love him less  had he not been everything to me   and this man   what had he ever done for me  doubtless we are to love even our enemies   but are we to love them as tenderly as we love our friends  or are we to  love the friend of yesterday  of whom we know nothing though we may  believe everything  as we love those who have taken all the trouble to  make true men and women of us   what can be the matter with my soul   i  said   can that soul be right made  in which one love begins to wither  the moment another begins to grow  if i be so made  i cannot help being  worthless      it was then first  i think  that i received a notion  anything like a  true notion  that is  of my need of a god  whence afterward i came to  see the one need of the whole race  of course  not being able to make  ourselves  it needed a god to make us  but that making were a small thing  indeed  if he left us so unfinished that we could come to nothing  right   if he left us so that we could think or do or be nothing  right   if our souls were created so puny  for instance  that there was  not room in them to love as they could not help loving  without ceasing  to love where they were bound by every obligation to love right heartily   and more and more deeply  but had i not been growing all the time i had  been in the world  there must then be the possibility of growing still   if there was not room in me  there must be room in god for me to become  larger  the room in god must be made room in me  god had not done making  me  in fact  and i sorely needed him to go on making me  i sorely needed  to be made out  what if this new joy and this new terror had come  had  been sent  in order to make me grow  at least the doors were open  i  could go out and forsake myself  if a living power had caused me  and  certainly i did not cause myself  then that living power knew all about  me  knew every smallness that distressed me  where should i find him  he  could not be so far that the misery of one of his own children could not  reach him  i turned my face into the grass  and prayed as i had never  prayed before  i had always gone to church  and made the responses  attentively  while i knew that was not praying  and tried to pray better  than that  but now i was really asking from god something i sorely  wanted   father in heaven   i said   i am so miserable  please  help me      i rose  went into the house  and up to the study  took a sock i was  knitting for my uncle  and sat down to wait what would come  i could  think no more  i could only wait           chapter xiii       old love and new     while i waited  as nearly a log  under the weariness of spiritual unrest   as a girl could well be  the door opened  very seldom did that door open  to any one but my uncle or myself  he would let no one but me touch his  books  or even dust the room  i jumped from the chest where i sat     it was only martha moon      how you startled me  martha   i cried      no wonder  child   she answered   i come with bad news  your uncle has  had a fall  he is laid up at wittenage with a broken right arm      i burst into tears      oh  martha   i cried   i must go to him       he has sent for me   she answered quietly      dick is putting the horse to the phaeton       he doesn t want me  then   i said  but it seemed a voice not my own that  shrieked the words     the punishment of my sin was upon me  never would he have sent for martha  and not me  i thought  had he not seen that i had gone wrong again  and  was no more to be trusted      my dear   said martha   which of us two ought to be the better nurse   you never saw your uncle ill  i ve nursed him at death s door       then you don t think he is angry with me  martha   i said  humbled  before myself      was he ever angry with you  orbie  what is there to be angry about  i  never saw him even displeased with you      i had not realized that my uncle was suffering  only that he was  disabled  now the fact flashed upon me  and with it the perception that i  had been thinking only of myself  i was fast ceasing to care for him  and  then  horrible to tell  a flash of joy went through me  that he would not  be home that day  and therefore i  could  not tell him anything     the moment martha left me i threw myself on the floor of the desert room   i was in utter misery      gladly would i bear every pang of his pain   i said to myself   yet i  have not asked one question about his accident  he must be in danger  or  he would not have sent for martha instead of me      how had the thing happened  i wondered  had death fallen with  him  perhaps on him  he was such a horseman  i could not think he  had been thrown  besides  death was a good horse who loved his  master  dearly  i was sure  and would never have thrown him or let him  fall  a great gush of the old love poured from the fountain in my heart   sympathy with the horse had unsealed it  i sprang from the floor  and ran  down to entreat martha to take me with her  if my uncle did not want me   i could return with dick  but she was gone  even the sound of her wheels  was gone  i had lain on the floor longer than i knew     i went back to the study a little relieved  i understood now that i was  not glad he was disabled  that i was anything but glad he was suffering   that i had only been glad for an instant that the crisis of my perplexity  was postponed  in the meantime i should see john day  who would help me  to understand what i ought to do     very strange were my feelings that afternoon in the lonely house  i had  always felt it lonely when martha  never when my uncle was out  yet when  my uncle was in  i was mostly with him  and seldom more than a few  minutes at a time with martha  our feelings are odd creatures  now that  both were away  there was neither time nor space in my heart for feeling  the house desolate  while the world outside was rich as a treasure house  of mighty kings  the moment i was a little more comfortable with myself   my thoughts went in a flock to the face that looked over the garden wall   to the man that watched me while i slept  the man that wrote that lovely  letter  inside was old penny with her broom  she took advantage of every  absence to sweep or scour or dust  outside was john day  and the roses of  the wilderness  he was waiting the hour to come to me  wondering how i  would receive him     slowly went the afternoon  i had fallen in love at first sight  it is  true  not therefore was i eager to meet my lover  i was only more than  willing to see him  it was as sweet  or nearly as sweet  to dream of his  coming  as to have him before me  so long as i knew he was indeed coming   i was just a little anxious lest i should not find him altogether so  beautiful as i was imagining him  that he was good  i never doubted   could i otherwise have fallen in love with him  and his letter was so  straightforward  so manly     the afternoon was cloudy  and the twilight came the sooner  from the  realms of the dark  where all the birds of night build their nests   lining them with their own sooty down  the sweet odorous filmy dusk of  the summer  haunted with wings of noiseless bats  began at length to come  flickering earthward  in a snow infinitesimal of fluffiest gray and  black  i crept out into the garden  it was dark as wintry night among  the yews  but i could have gone any time through every alley of them  blind folded  an owl cried and i started  for my soul was sunk in its own  love dawn  there came a sudden sense of light as i opened the door into  the wilderness  but light how thin and pale  and how full of expectation   the earth and the vast air  up to the great vault  seemed to throb and  heave with life  or was it that my spirit lay an open thoroughfare to  the life of the all  with the scent of the roses and the humbler  sweet odoured inhabitants of the wilderness  with the sound of the brook  that ran through it  flowing from the heath and down the hill  with the  silent starbeams  and the insects that make all the little noises they  can  with the thoughts that went out of me  and returned possessed of the  earth   with all these  and the sense of thought eternal  the universe  was full as it could hold  i stood in the doorway of the wall  and looked  out on the wild  suddenly  by some strange reaction  it seemed out of  creation s doors  out in the illimitable  given up to the bare  to the  space that had no walls  a shiver ran through me  i turned back among the  yews  it was early  i would wait yet a while  if he were already there   he too would enjoy the calm of a lovely little wait     a small wind came searching about  and found  and caressed me  i turned  to it  it played with my hair  and cooled my face  after a while  i left  the alley  passed out  closed the door behind me  and went straying  through the broken ground of the wilderness  among the low bushes   meandering  as if with some frolicsome brook for a companion  a brook of  capricious windings  but still coming nearer to the fence that parted the  wilderness from the heath  my eyes bent down  partly to avoid the  hillocks and bushes  and partly from shyness of the moment when first i  should see him who was in my heart and somewhere near  softly the moon  rose  round and full  there was still so much light in the sky that she  made no sudden change  and for a moment i did not feel her presence or  look up  in front of me  the high ground of the moor sank into a hollow   deeply indenting the horizon line  the moon was rising just in the gap   and when i did look up  the lower edge of her disc was just clear of the  earth  and the head of a man looking over the fence was in the middle of  the great moon  it was like the head of a saint in a missal  girt with a  halo of solid gold  i could not see the face  for the halo hid it  as  such attributions are apt to do  but it must be he  and strengthened by  the heavenly vision  i went toward him  walking less carefully than  before  however  i caught my foot  stumbled  and fell  there came a rush  through the bushes  he was by my side  lifted me like a child  and held  me in his arms  neither was i more frightened than a child caught up in  the arms of any well known friend  i had been bred in faith and not  mistrust  but indeed my head had struck the ground with such force  that   had i been inclined  i could scarcely have resisted  though why should i  have resisted  being where i would be  does not philosophy tell us that  growth and development  cause and effect  are all  and that the days and  years are of no account  and does not more than philosophy tell us that  truth is everything      my darling  are you hurt   murmured the voice whose echoes seemed to  have haunted me for centuries      a little   i answered   i shall be all right in a minute   i did not  add   put me down  please   for i did not want to be put down directly  i  could not have stood if he had put me down  i grew faint     life came back  and i felt myself growing heavy in his arms      i think i can stand now   i said   please put me down      he obeyed immediately      i ve nearly broken your arms   i said  ashamed of having become a burden  to him the moment we met      i could run with you to the top of the hill   he answered      i don t think you could   i returned  perhaps i leaned a little toward  him  i do not know  he put his arm round me      you are not able to stand   he said   shall we sit a moment            chapter xiv       mother and uncle     i was glad enough to sink on a clump of white clover  he stretched  himself on the heather  a little way from me  silence followed  he was  giving me time to recover myself  as soon  therefore  as i was able  it  was my part to speak      where is your horse   i asked  the first word is generally one hardly  worth saying      i left him at a little farmhouse  about a mile from here  i was afraid  to bring him farther  lest my mother should learn where i had been  she  takes pains to know       then will she not find out       i don t know       will she not ask you where you were       perhaps  there s no knowing       you will tell her  of course  if she does       i think not       oughtn t you       no       you are sure       yes       you don t mean you will tell her a story       certainly not       what will you do then       i will tell her that i will not tell her       would that be right      through the dusk i could see the light of his smile as he answered      i think so  i shall not tell her       but   i began     he interrupted me     my heart was sinking within me  not only had i wanted him to help me to  tell my uncle  but i shuddered at the idea of having with any man a  secret from his mother      it must look strange to you   he said   but you do not know my mother       i think i do know your mother   i rejoined   she saved my poor little  life once   i am not sure it was your mother  but i think it was       how was that   he said  much surprised   when was it       many years ago  i cannot tell how many   i answered   but i remember all  about it well enough  i cannot have been more than eight  i imagine       could she have been at the manor then   he said  putting the question to  himself  not me   how was it  tell me   he went on  rising to his feet   and looking at me with almost a frightened expression     i told him the incident  and he heard me in absolute silence  when i had  done        it  was  my mother   he broke out   i don t know one other woman who  would have let a child walk like that  any other would have taken you up   or put you on the horse and walked beside you       a gentleman would  i know   i replied   but it would not be so easy for  a lady        she  could have done either well enough  she s as strong as a horse  herself  and rides like an amazon  but i am not in the least surprised   it was just like her  you poor little darling  it nearly makes me cry to  think of the tiny feet going tramp  tramp  all that horrible way  and  she high up on her big horse  she always rides the biggest horse she can  get   and then never to say a word to you after she brought you home  or  see you the next morning       mr  day   i returned   i would not have told you  had i known it would  give you occasion to speak so naughtily of your mother  you make me  unhappy      he was silent  i thought he was ashamed of himself  and was sorry for  him  but my sympathy was wasted  he broke into a murmuring laugh of  merriment      when is a mother not a mother   he said     do you give it up   when  she s a north wind  when she s a roman emperor  when she s an iceberg   when she s a brass tiger   there  that ll do  good bye  mother  for the  present  i mayn t know much  as she s always telling me  but i do know  that a noun is not a thing  nor a name a person      i would have expostulated      for love s sake  dearest   he pleaded   we will not dispute where only  one of us knows  i will tell you all some day  soon  i hope  very soon  i  am angry now   poor little tramping child      i saw i had been behaving presumptuously  i had wanted to argue while yet  in absolute ignorance of the thing in hand  had not my uncle taught me  the folly of reasoning from the ideal where i knew nothing of the actual   the ideal must be our guide how to treat the actual  but the actual must  be there to treat  one thing more i saw  that there could be no likeness  between his mother and my uncle      will you tell me something about yourself  then   i said      that would not be interesting   he objected      then why are you here   i returned      can any person without a history be interesting       yes   he answered   a person that was going to have a history might be  interesting       could a person with a history that was not worth telling  be  interesting  but i know yours will interest me in the hearing  therefore  it ought to interest you in the telling      i see   he rejoined  with his merry laugh   i shall have to be careful   my lady will at once pounce upon the weak points of my logic       i am no logician   i answered   i only know when i don t know a thing   my uncle has taught me that wisdom lies in that       yours must be a very unusual kind of uncle   he returned      if god had made many men like my uncle  i think the world wouldn t be  the same place       i wonder why he didn t   he said thoughtfully      i have wondered much  and cannot tell   i replied      what if it wouldn t be good for the world to have many good men in it  before it was ready to treat them properly   he suggested     the words let me know that at least he could think  hitherto my uncle had  seemed to me the only man that thought  but i had seen very few men      perhaps that is it   i answered   i will think about it   were you  brought up at rising  have you been there all the time  were you there  that night  i should surely have known had you been in the house      he looked at me with a grateful smile      i was not brought up there   he answered   rising is mine  however  at  least it will be when i come of age  it was left me some ten years ago by  a great aunt my father s property will be mine too  of course  my  mother s is in ireland  she ought to be there  not here  but she likes my  estates better than her own  and makes the most of being my guardian       you would not have her there if she is happier here       all who have land  ought to live on it  or else give it to those who  will  what makes it theirs  if their only connection with it is the money  it brings them  if i let my horse run wild over the country  how could i  claim him  and refuse to pay his damages       i don t quite understand you       i only mean there is no bond where both ends are not tied  my mother has  no sense of obligation  so far as ever i have been able to see  but do  not be afraid  i would as soon take a wife to the house she was in  as i  would ask her to creep with me into the den of a hyena      it was too dreadful  i rose  he sprang to his feet      you must excuse me  sir   i said   with one who can speak so of his  mother  i am where i ought not to be       you have a right to know what my mother is   he answered  coldly  i  thought   and i should not be a true man if i spoke of her otherwise than  truly      he would pretend nothing to please me  i saw that i was again in the  wrong  was i so ill read as to imagine that a mother must of necessity be  a good woman  was he to speak of his mother as he did not believe of her   or be unfit for my company  would untruth be a bond between us      i beg your pardon   i said   i was wrong  but you can hardly wonder i  should be shocked to hear a son speak so of his mother  and to one all  but a stranger       what   he returned  with a look of surprise   do you think of me so  i  feel as if i had known you all my life  and before it      i felt ashamed  and was silent  if he was such a stranger  why was i  there alone with him      you must not think i speak so to any one   he went on   of those who  know my mother  not one has a right to demand of me anything concerning  her  but how could i ask you to see me  and hide from you the truth about  her  prudence would tell you to have nothing to do with the son of such a  woman  could i be a true man  true to you  and hold my tongue about her   i should be a liar of the worst sort      he felt far too strongly  it was plain  to heed a world of commonplaces      forgive me   i said   may i sit down again      he held out his hand  i took it  and reseated myself on the  clover hillock  he laid himself again beside me  and after a little  silence began to relate what occurred to him of his external history   while all the time i was watching for hints as to how he had come to be  the man he was  it was clear he did not find it easy to talk about  himself  but soon i no longer doubted whether i ought to have met him   and loved him a great deal more by the time he had done     i then told him in return what my life had hitherto been  how i knew  nothing of father or mother  how my uncle had been everything to me  how  he had taught me all i knew  had helped me to love what was good and hate  what was evil  had enabled me to value good books  and turn away from  foolish ones  in short  i made him feel that all his mother had not been  to him  my uncle had been to me  and that it would take a long time to  make me as much indebted to a husband as already i was to my uncle  then  i put the question      what would you think of me if i had a secret from an uncle like that       if i had an uncle like that   he answered   i would sooner cut my throat  than keep anything from him       i have not told him   i said   what happened to day  or yesterday       but you will tell him       the first moment i can  but i hope you understand it is hard to do  my  love for my uncle makes it hard  it has the look of turning away from him  to love another      with that i burst out crying  i could not help it  he let me cry  and did  not interfere  i was grateful for that  when at length i raised my head   he spoke      it has that look   he said   but i trust it is only a look  anyhow  he  knows that such things must be  and the more of a good man and a  gentleman he is  the less will he be pained that we should love one  another       i am sure of that   i replied   i am only afraid that he may never have  been in love himself  and does not know how it feels  and may think i  have forsaken him for you       are you with him  always        no  i am sometimes a good deal alone  i can be alone as much as i like   he always gives me perfect liberty  but i never before wanted to be alone  when i could be with him       but he  could  live without you       yes  indeed   i cried   he would be a poor creature that could not live  without another      he said nothing  and i added   he often goes out alone  sometimes in the  darkest nights       then be sure he knows what love is   but  if you would rather  i will  tell him       i could not have any one  even you  tell my uncle about me       you are right  when will you tell him       i cannot be sure  i would go to him to morrow  but i am afraid they will  not let me until he has got a little over this accident   i answered  and  told him what had happened   it is dreadful to think how he must have  suffered   i said   and how much more i should have thought about it but  for you  it tears my heart  why wasn t it made bigger       perhaps that is just what is now being done with it   he answered      i hope it may be   i returned     but it is time i went in       shall i not see you again to morrow evening   he asked      no   i answered   i must not see you again till i have told my uncle  everything       you do not mean for weeks and weeks  till he is well enough to come  home  how  am  i to live till then       as i shall have to live  but i hope it will be but for a few days at  most  only  then  it will depend on what my uncle thinks of the thing       will he decide for you what you are to do       yes  i think so  perhaps if he were    i was on the point of saying    like your mother   but i stopped in time  or hardly  for i think he saw  what i just saved myself from  it was but the other morning i made the  discovery that  all our life together  john has never once pressed me to  complete a sentence i broke off     he looked so sorrowful that i was driven to add something      i don t think there is much good   i said   in resolving what you will  or will not do  before the occasion appears  for it may have something in  it you never reckoned on  all i can say is  i will try to do what is  right  i cannot promise anything without knowing what my uncle thinks      we rose  he took me in his arms for just an instant  and we parted with  the understanding that i was to write to him as soon as i had spoken with  my uncle           chapter xv       the time between     i now felt quite able to confess to my uncle both what i had thought and  what i had done  true  i had much more to confess than when my trouble  first awoke  but the growth in the matter of the confession had been such  a growth in definiteness as well  as to make its utterance  though more  weighty  yet much easier  if i might be in doubt about revealing my  thoughts  i could be in none about revealing my actions  and i found it  was much less appalling to make known my feelings  when i had the words  of john day to confess as well     i may here be allowed to remark  how much easier an action is when  demanded  than it seems while in the contingent future  how much  easier when the thing is before you in its reality  and not as a mere  thought spectre  the thing itself  and the idea of it  are two such  different grounds upon which to come either to a decision or to action     one thing more  when a woman wants to do the right  i do not mean  wants  to coax the right to side with her  she will  somehow  be led up to it     my uncle was very feverish and troubled the first night  and had a good  deal of delirium  during which his care and anxiety seemed all about me   martha had to assure him every other moment that i was well  and in no  danger of any sort  he would be silent for a time  and then again show  himself tormented with forebodings about me  in the morning  however  he  was better  only he looked sadder than usual  she thought he was  for  some cause or other  in reality anxious about me  so much i gathered from  martha s letter  by no means scholarly  but graphic enough     it gave me much pain  my uncle was miserable about me  he had plainly  seen  he knew and felt that something had come between us  alas  it was  no fancy of his brain troubled soul  whether i was in fault or not  there  was that something  it troubled the unity that had hitherto seemed a  thing essential and indivisible     dared i go to him without a summons  i knew martha would call me the  moment the doctor allowed her  it would not be right to go without that  call  what i had to tell might justify far more anxiety than the sight of  me would counteract  if i said nothing  the keen eye of his love would  assure itself of the something hid in my silence  and he would not see  that i was but waiting his improvement to tell him everything  i resolved  therefore to remain where i was     the next two days were perhaps the most uncomfortable ever i spent  a  secret one desires to turn out of doors at the first opportunity  is not  a pleasant companion  i do not say i was unhappy  still less that once i  wished i had not seen john day  but oh  how i longed to love him openly   how i longed for my uncle s sanction  without which our love could not be  perfected  then john s mother was by no means a gladsome thought  except  that he must be a good man indeed  who was good in spite of being unable  to love  respect  or trust his mother  the true notion of heaven  is to  be with everybody one loves  to him the presence of his mother  such as  she was  that is  would destroy any heaven  what a painful but salutary  shock it will be to those whose existence is such a glorifying of  themselves that they imagine their presence necessary to all about them   when they learn that their disappearance from the world sent a thrill of  relief through the hearts of those nearest them  to learn how little  they were prized  will one day prove a strong medicine for souls  self absorbed      there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed            chapter xvi       fault and no fault     the next day i kept the house till the evening  and then went walking in  the garden in the twilight  between the dark alleys and the open  wilderness i flitted and wandered  alternating gloom and gleam outside  me  even as they chased one another within me     in the wilderness i looked up  and there was john  he stood outside the  fence  just as i had seen him the night before  only now there was no  aureole about his head  the moon had not yet reached the horizon     my first feeling was anger  he had broken our agreement  i did not  reflect that there was such a thing as breaking a law  or even a promise   and being blameless  he leaped the fence  and clearing every bush like a  deer  came straight toward me  it was no use trying to escape him  i  turned my back  and stood  he stopped close behind me  a yard or two  away      will you not speak to me   he said   it is not my fault i am come       whose fault then  pray   i rejoined  with difficulty keeping my  position   is it mine       my mother s   he answered     i turned and looked him in the eyes  through the dusk saw that he was  troubled  ran to him  and put my arms about him      she has been spying   he said  as soon as he could speak   she will part  us at any risk  if she can  she is having us watched this very moment   most likely  she may be watching us herself  she is a terrible woman when  she is for or against anything  literally  i do not know what she would  not do to get her own way  she lives for her own way  the loss of it  would be to her as the loss of her soul  she will lose it this time  though  she will fail this time  if she never did before       well   i returned  nowise inclined to take her part   i hope she will  fail  what does she say       she says she would rather go to her grave than see me your husband       why       your family seems objectionable to her       what is there against it       nothing that i know       what is there against my uncle  is there anything against martha moon    i was indignant at the idea of a whisper against either      what have  i  done   i went on   we are all of the family i know  what  is it       i don t think she has had time to invent anything yet  but she pretends  there is something  and says if i don t give you up  if i don t swear  never to look at you again  she will tell it       what did you answer her       i said no power on earth should make me give you up  whatever she knew   she could know nothing against  you   and i was as ready to go to my  grave as she was   mother   i said   you may tell my determination by  your own  whether i marry her or not  you and i part company the day i  come of age  and if you speak word or do deed against one of her family   my lawyer shall look strictly into your accounts as my guardian   you see  i knew where to touch her       it is dreadful you should have to speak like that to your mother       it is  but you would feel to her just as i do if you knew all  though  you wouldn t speak so roughly  i know       can you guess what she has in her mind       not in the least  she will pretend anything  it is enough that she is  determined to part us  how  she cares nothing  so she succeed       but she cannot       it rests with you       how with me       it will be war to the knife between her and me  if she succeed  it must  be with you  i will do anything to foil her except lie       what if she should make you see it your duty to give me up       what if there were no difference between right and wrong  we re as good  as married       yes  of course  but i cannot quite promise  you know  until i hear what  my uncle will say       if your uncle is half so good a man as you have made me think him  he  will do what he can on our side  he loves what is fair  and what can be  fairer than that those who love each other should marry      i knew my uncle would not willingly interfere with my happiness  and for  myself  i should never marry another than john day  that was a thing of  course  had he not kissed me  but the best of lovers had been parted  and  that which had been might be again  though i could not see how  it  was   good  nevertheless  to hear john talk  it was the right way for a lover  to talk  still  he had no supremacy over what was to be      some would say it cannot be so great a matter to us  when we have known  each other such a little while   i remarked      the true time is the long time   he replied   would it be a sign that  our love was strong  that it took a great while to come to anything  the  strongest things       there he stopped  and i saw why  strongest things are not generally of  quickest growth  but there was the eucalyptus  and was not st  paul as  good a christian as any of them  i said nothing  however  there was  indeed no rule in the matter      you must allow it possible   i said   that we may not be married       i will not   he answered   it is true my mother may get me brought in as  incapable of managing my own affairs  but        what mother would do such a wicked thing   i cried       my  mother   he answered      oh       she  would        i can t believe it       i am sure of it      i held my peace  i could not help a sense of dismay at finding myself so  near such a woman  i knew of bad women  but only in books  it would  appear they were in other places as well      we must be on our guard   he said      against what       i don t know  whatever she may do       we can t do anything till she begins       she has begun       how   i asked incredulous      leander is lame   he answered      i am so sorry       i am so angry       is it possible i understand you       quite   she  did it       how do you know       i can no more prove it than i can doubt it  i cannot inquire into my  mother s proceedings  i leave that sort of thing to her  let her spy on  me as she will  i am not going to spy on her       of course not  but if you have no proof  how can you state the thing as  a fact       i have what is proof enough for saying it to my own soul       but you have spoken of it to me       you are my better soul  if you are not  then i have done wrong in saying  it to you      i hastened to tell him i had only made him say what i hoped he  meant  only i wasn t his  better  soul  he wanted me then to promise that  i would marry him in spite of any and every thing  i promised that i  would never marry any one but him  i could not say more  i said  not  knowing what my uncle might think  but so much it was only fair to say   for i had gone so far as to let him know distinctly that i loved him  and  what sort would that love be that could regard it as possible  at any  distance of time  to marry another  or what sort of woman could she be  that would shrink from such a pledge  the mischief lies in promises made  without forecasting thought  i knew what i was about  i saw forward and  backward and all around me  a solitary education opens eyes that  in the  midst of companions and engagements  are apt to remain shut  knowledge of  the world is no safeguard to man or woman  in the knowledge and love of  truth  lies our only safety     with that promise he had to be  and was content           chapter xvii       the summons     next morning the post brought me the following letter from my uncle   whoever of my readers may care to enter into my feelings as i read  must  imagine them for herself  i will not attempt to describe them  the letter  was not easy to read  as it was written in bed  and with his left hand      my little one   i think i know more than you imagine  i think the secret  flew into your heart of itself  you did not take it up and put it there   i think you tried to drive it out  and it would not go  the same fate  that clips the thread of life  had clipped its wings that it could fly no  more  did my little one think i had not a heart big enough to hold her  secret  i wish it had not been so  it has made her suffer  i pray my  little one to be sure that i am all on her side  that my will is to do  and contrive the best for her that lies in my power  should i be unable  to do what she would like  she must yet believe me true to her as to my  god  less than whom only i love her   less  because god is so much  bigger  that so much more love will hang upon him  i love you  dear  more  than any other creature except one  and that one is not in this world  be  sure that  whatever it may cost me  i will be to you what your own  perfected soul will approve  not to do my best for you  would be to be  false  not to god only  but to your father as well  whom i loved and love  dearly  come to me  my child  and tell me all  i know you have done  nothing wrong  nothing to be ashamed of  some things are so difficult to  tell  that it needs help to make way for them  i will help you  i am  better  come to me at once  and we will break the creature s shell  together  and see what it is like  the shy thing   your uncle      i was so eager to go to him  that it was with difficulty i finished his  letter before starting  death had been sent home  and was in the stable   sorely missing his master  i called dick  and told him to get ready to  ride with me to wittenage  he must take thanatos  and be at the door with  zoe in twenty minutes     we started  as we left the gate  i caught sight of john coming from the  other direction  his eyes on the ground  lost in meditation  i stopped   he looked up  saw me  and was at my side in two moments      i have heard from my uncle   i said   he wants me  i am going to him       if only i had my horse   he answered      why shouldn t you take thanatos   i rejoined      no   he answered  after a moment s hesitation      it would be an impertinence  i will walk  and perhaps see you there   it s only sixteen miles  i think   what a splendid creature he is       he s getting into years now   i replied   but he has been in the stable  several days  and i am doubtful whether dick will feel quite at home on  him       then your uncle would rather i rode him  he knows i am no tailor   said  john      how   i asked      i don t mean he knows who i am  but he saw me a fortnight ago  in one of  our fields  giving leander  who is but three  a lesson or two  he stopped  and looked on for a good many minutes  and said a kind word about my  handling of the horse  he will remember  i am sure       how glad i am he knows something of you  if you don t mind being seen  with me  then  there is no reason why you should not give me your  escort      dick was not sorry to dismount  and we rode away together     i was glad of this for one definite reason  as well as many indefinite  i  wanted john to see my letter  and know what cause i had to love my uncle   i forgot for the moment my resolution not to meet him again before  telling my uncle everything  somehow he seemed to be going with me to  receive my uncle s approval     he read the letter  old death carrying him all the time as gently as he  carried myself  i often rode him now  and returned it with the tears in  his eyes  for a moment or two he did not speak  then he said in a very  solemn way      i see  i oughtn t to have a chance if he be against me  i understand now  why i could not get you to promise   all right  the lord have mercy upon  me       that he will  he is always having mercy upon us   i answered  loving  john and my uncle and god more than ever  i loved john for this  especially  at the moment  that his nature remained uninjured toward  others by his distrust of her who should have had the first claim on his  confidence  i said to myself that  if a man had a bad mother and yet was  a good man  there could be no limit to the goodness he must come to  that  he was a man after my uncle s own heart  i had no longer the least doubt   nor was it a small thing to me that he rode beautifully  never seeming to  heed his horse  and yet in constant touch with him     we reached the town  and the inn where my uncle was lying  on the road we  had arranged where he would be waiting me to hear what came next  he went  to see the horses put up  and i ran to find martha  she met me on the  stair  and went straight to my uncle to tell him i was come  returned  almost immediately  and led me to his room     i was shocked to see how pale and ill he looked  i feared  and was right  in fearing  that anxiety about myself had not a little to do with his  condition  his face brightened when he saw me  but his eyes gazed into  mine with a searching inquiry  his face brightened yet more when he found  his eager look answered by the smile which my perfect satisfaction  inspired  i knelt by the bedside  afraid to touch him lest i should hurt  his arm     slowly he laid his left hand on my head  and i knew he blessed me  silently  for a minute or two he lay still      now tell me all about it   he said at length  turning his patient blue  eyes on mine  i began at once  and if i did not tell him all  i let it be  plain there was more of the sort behind  concerning which he might  question me  when i had ended      is that everything   he asked  with a smile so like all he had ever been  to me  that my whole heart seemed to go out to meet it      yes  uncle   i answered   i think i may say so  except that i have not  dwelt upon my feelings  love  they say  is shy  and i fancy you will  pardon me that portion       willingly  my child  more is quite unnecessary       then you know all about it  uncle   i ventured   i was afraid you might  not understand me  could any one  do you think  that had not had the same  experience      he made me no answer  i looked up  he was ghastly white  his head had  fallen back against the bed  i started up  hardly smothering a shriek      what is it  uncle   i gasped   shall i fetch martha       no  my child   he answered   i shall be better in a moment  i am subject  to little attacks of the heart  but they do not mean much  give me some  of that medicine on the table      in a few minutes his colour began to return  and the smile which was  forced at first  gradually brightened until it was genuine      i will tell you the whole story one day   he said     whether in this  world  i am doubtful  but  when  is nothing  or  where   with eternity  before us       yes  uncle   i answered vaguely  as i knelt again by the bedside      a person   he said  after a while  slowly  and with hesitating effort    may look and feel a much better person at one time than at another   upon occasion  he is so happy  or perhaps so well pleased with himself   that the good in him comes all to the surface       would he be the better or the worse man if it did not  uncle   i asked      you must not get me into a metaphysical discussion  little one   he  answered   we have something more important on our hands  i want you to  note that  when a person is happy  he may look lovable  whereas  things  going as he does not like  another  and very unfinished phase of his  character may appear       surely everybody must know that  uncle       then you can hardly expect me to be confident that your new friend would  appear as lovable if he were unhappy       i have seen you  uncle  look as if nothing would ever make you smile  again  but i knew you loved me all the time       did you  my darling  then you were right  i dare not require of any man  that he should be as good tempered in trouble as out of it  though he  must come to that at last  but a man must be  just   whatever mood he is  in       that is what i always knew you to be  uncle  i never waited for a change  in your looks  to tell you anything i wanted to tell you   i know you   uncle   i added  with a glow of still triumph      thank you  little one   he returned  half playfully  yet gravely   all i  want to say comes to this   he resumed after a pause   that when a man is  in love  you see only the best of him  or something better than he really  is  much good may be in a man  for god made him  and the man yet not be  good  for he has done nothing  since his making  to make himself  before  you can say you know a man  you must have seen him in a few at least of  his opposite moods  therefore you cannot wonder that i should desire a  fuller assurance of this young man  than your testimony  founded on an  acquaintance of three or four days  can give me       let me tell you  then  something that happened to day   i answered    when first i asked him to come with me this morning  it was a temptation  to him of course  not knowing when we might see each other again  but he  hadn t his own horse  and said it would be an impertinence to ride  yours       i hope you did not come alone       oh  no  i had set out with dick  but john came after all       then his refusal to ride my horse does not come to much  it is a small  thing to have good impulses  if temptation is too much for them       but i haven t done telling you  uncle       i am hasty  little one  i beg your pardon       i have to tell you what made him give in to riding your horse  i  confessed i was a little anxious lest death  who had not been exercised  for some days  should be too much for dick  john said then he thought he  might venture  for you had once spoken very kindly to him of the way he  handled his own horse       oh  that s the young fellow  is it   cried my uncle  in a tone that  could not be taken for other than one of pleasure   that s the fellow  is  it   he repeated   h m       i hope you liked the look of him  uncle   i said      the boy is a gentleman anyhow   he answered    you may think whether i  was pleased   i never saw man carry himself better horseward   he added  with a smile      then you won t object to his riding death home again       not in the least   he replied   the man can ride       and may i go with him   that is  if you do not want me   i wish i could  stay with you       rather than ride home with him       yes  indeed  if it were to be of use to you       the only way you can be of use to me  is to ride home with mr  day  and  not see him again until i have had a little talk with him  tyranny may be  a sense of duty  you know  little one       tyranny  uncle   i cried  as i laid my cheek to his hand  which was very  cold   you could not make me think you a tyrant       i should not like you to think me one  darling  still less would i like  to deserve it  whether you thought me one or not  but i could not be a  tyrant to you if i would  you may defy me when you please       that would be to poison my own soul   i answered      you must understand   he continued   that i have no authority over you   if you were going to marry mr  day to morrow  i should have no right to  interfere  i am but a make shift father to you  not a legal guardian       don t cast me off  uncle   i cried   you  know  i belong to you as much  as if you were my very own father  i am sure my father will say so when  we see him  he will never come between you and me      he gave a great sigh  and his face grew so intense that i felt as if i  had no right to look on it      it is one of the deepest hopes of my existence   he said   to give you  back to him the best of daughters  be good  my darling  be good  even if  you die of sorrow because of it      the intensity had faded to a deep sadness  and there came a silence      would you like me to go now  uncle   i asked      i wish i could see mr  day at once   he returned   but i am so far from  strong  that i fear both weakness and injustice  tell him i want very  much to see him  and will let him know as soon as i am able       thank you  uncle  he will be so glad  of course he can t feel as i do   but he does feel that to do anything you did not like  would be just  horrid       and you will not see him again  little one  after he has taken you home   till i have had some talk with him       of course i will not  uncle      i bade him good bye  had a few moments  conference with martha  and found  john at the place appointed           chapter xviii       john sees something     as we rode  i told him everything  it did not seem in the least strange  that i should be so close to one of whom a few days before i had never  heard  it seemed as if all my life i had been waiting for him  and now he  was come  and everything was only as it should be  we were very quiet in  our gladness  some slight anxiety about my uncle s decision  and the  certain foreboding of trouble on the part of his mother  stilled us both   sending the delight of having found each other a little deeper and out of  the way of the practical and reasoning     we did not urge our horses to their speed  but i felt that  for my  uncle s sake  i must not prolong the journey  forcing the last farthing  of bliss from his generosity  while yet he was uncertain of his duty  the  moon was rising just as we reached my home  and i was glad  john would  have to walk miles to reach his  for he absolutely refused to take death  on  saying he did not know what might happen to him  as we stopped at the  gate i bethought myself that neither of us had eaten since we left in the  afternoon  i dismounted  and leaving him with the horses  got what i  could find for him  and then roused dick  who was asleep  john confessed  that  now i had made him think of it  he was hungry enough to eat  anything less than an ox  we parted merrily  but when next we met  each  confessed it had not been without a presentiment of impending danger  for  my part  notwithstanding the position i had presumed to take with john  when first he spoke of his mother  i was now as distrustful as he  and  more afraid of her     much the nearest way between the two houses lay across the heath  john  walked along  eating the supper i had given him  and now and then casting  a glance round the horizon  he had got about half way  when  looking up   he thought he saw  dim in the ghosty light of the moon  a speck upon the  track before him  he said to himself it could hardly be any one on the  moor at such a time of the night  and went on with his supper  looking up  again after an interval  he saw that the object was much larger  but  hardly less vague  because of a light fog which had in the meantime  risen  by and by  however  as they drew nearer to each other  a strange  thrill of recognition went through him  on the way before him  which was  little better than a footpath  and slowly approaching  came what  certainly could be neither the horse that had carried him that day  nor  his double  but what was so like him in colour  size  and bone  while so  unlike him in muscle and bearing  that he might have been he  worn but  for his skin to a skeleton  straight down upon john he came  spectral  through the fog  as if he were asleep  and saw nothing in his way  john  stepped aside to let him pass  and then first looked in the face of his  rider  with a shock of fear that struck him in the middle of the body   making him gasp and choke  he saw before him  so plainly that  but  for the impossibility  he could have sworn to him in any court of  justice  the man whom he knew to be at that moment confined to his bed   twenty miles away  with a broken arm  sole other human being within sight  or sound in that still moonlight  on that desolate moor  the horseman  never lifted his head  never raised his eyes to look at him  john stood  stunned  he hardly doubted he saw an apparition  when at length he roused  himself  and looked in the direction in which it went  it had all but  vanished in the thickening white mist     he found the rest of his way home almost mechanically  and went straight  to bed  but for a long time could not sleep     for what might not the apparition portend  mr  whichcote lay hurt by a  fall from his horse  and he had met his very image on the back of just  such a horse  only turned to a skeleton  was he bearing him away to the  tomb     then he remembered that the horse s name was death           chapter xix       john is taken ill     in the middle of the night he woke with a start  ill enough to feel that  he was going to be worse  his head throbbed  the room seemed turning  round with him  and when it settled  he saw strange shapes in it  a  few rays of the sinking moon had got in between the curtains of one  of the windows  and had waked up everything  the furniture looked  odd  unpleasantly odd  something unnatural  or at least unearthly  must  be near him  the room was an old fashioned one  in thorough keeping with  the age of the house  the very haunt for a ghost  but he had heard of no  ghost in that room  he got up to get himself some water  and drew the  curtains aside  he could have been in no thraldom to an apprehensive  imagination  for what man  with a brooding terror couched in him  would   in the middle of the night  let in the moon  to such a passion  she is  worse than the deepest darkness  especially when going down  as she was  then  with the weary look she gets by the time her work is about over   and she has long been forsaken of the poor mortals for whom she has so  often to be up and shining all night  he poured himself some water and  drank it  but thought it did not taste nice  then he turned to the  window  and looked out     the house was in a large park  its few trees served mainly to show how  wide the unbroken spaces of grass  before the house  motionless as a  statue  stood a great gray horse with hanging neck  his shadow stretched  in mighty grotesque behind him  and on his back the very effigy of my  uncle  motionless too as marble  the horse stood sidewise to the house   but the face of his rider was turned toward it  as if scanning its  windows in the dying glitter of the moon  john thought he heard a cry  somewhere  and went to his door  but  listening hard  heard nothing  when  he looked again from the window  the apparition seemed fainter  and  farther away  though neither horse nor rider had changed posture  he  rubbed his eyes to see more plainly  could no longer distinguish the  appearance  and went back to bed  in the morning he was in a high  fever  unconscious save of restless discomfort and undefined trouble     he learned afterward from the housekeeper  that his mother herself nursed  him  but he would take neither food nor medicine from her hand  no doctor  was sent for  john thought  and i cannot but think  that the water in his  bottle had to do with the sudden illness  his mother may have merely  wished to prevent him from coming to me  but  for the time at least  the  conviction had got possession of him  that she was attempting his life   he may have argued in semi conscious moments  that she would not scruple  to take again what she was capable of imagining she had given  her  attentions  however  may have arisen from alarm at seeing him worse than  she had intended to make him  and desire to counteract what she had done     for several days he was prostrate with extreme exhaustion  necessarily  i  knew nothing of this  neither was i  notwithstanding my more than doubt  of his mother  in any immediate dread of what she might do  the cessation  of his visits could  of course  cause me no anxiety  seeing it was  thoroughly understood between us that we were not at liberty to meet           chapter xx       a strange visit     on the fifth night after that on which he left me to walk home  i was  roused  about two o clock  by a sharp sound as of sudden hail against my  window  ceasing as soon as it began  wondering what it was  for hail it  could hardly be  i sprang from the bed  pulled aside the curtain  and  looked out  there was light enough in the moon to show me a man looking  up at the window  and love enough in my heart to tell me who he was  how  he knew the window mine  i have always forgotten to ask him  i would have  drawn back  for it vexed me sorely to think him too weak to hold to our  agreement  but the face i looked down upon was so ghastly and deathlike   that i perceived at once his coming must have its justification  i did  not speak  for i would not have any in the house hear  but  putting on my  shoes and a big cloak  i went softly down the stair  opened the door  noiselessly  and ran to the other side of the house  there stood john   with his eyes fixed on my window  as i turned the corner i could see  by  their weary flashing  that either something terrible had happened  or he  was very ill  he stood motionless  unaware of my approach      what is it   i said under my breath  putting a hand on his shoulder     he did not turn his head or answer me  but grew yet whiter  gasped  and  seemed ready to fall  i put my arm round him  and his head sank on the  top of mine     whatever might be the matter  the first thing was to get him into  the house  and make him lie down  i moved a little  holding him fast   and mechanically he followed his support  so that  although with  some difficulty  i soon got him round the house  and into the great  hall kitchen  our usual sitting room  there was fire there that would  only want rousing  and  warm as was the night  i felt him very cold  i  let him sink on the wide sofa  covered him with my cloak  and ran to  rouse old penny  the aged sleep lightly  and she was up in an instant   i told her that a gentleman i knew had come to the house  either  sleep walking or delirious  and she must come and help me with him  she  struck a light  and followed me to the kitchen     john lay with his eyes closed  in a dead faint  we got him to swallow  some brandy  and presently he came to himself a little  then we put him  in my warm bed  and covered him with blankets  in a minute or so he was  fast asleep  he had not spoken a word  i left penny to watch him  and  went and dressed myself  thinking hard  the result was  that  having  enjoined penny to let no one near him   whoever  it might be  i went to  the stable  saddled zoe  and set off for wittenage     it was sixteen miles of a ride  the moon went down  and the last of my  journey was very dark  for the night was cloudy  but we arrived in  safety  just as the dawn was promising to come as soon as it could  no  one in the town seemed up  or thinking of getting up  i had learned a  lesson from john  however  and i knew martha s window  which happily  looked on the street  i got off zoe  who was tired enough to stand still   for she was getting old and i had not spared her  and proceeded to search  for a stone small enough to throw at the window  the scared face of  martha showed itself almost immediately      it s me   i cried  no louder than she could just hear   it s me  martha   come down and let me in      without a word of reply  she left the window  and after some fumbling  with the lock  opened the door  and came out to me  looking gray with  scare  but none the less with all her wits to her hand      how is my uncle  martha   i said      much better   she answered      then i must see him at once       he s fast asleep  child  it would be a world s pity to wake him       it would be a worse pity not   i returned      very well  must be must   she answered     i made zoe fast to the lamp post  the night was warm  and hot as she was   she would take no hurt  then i followed martha up the stair     but my uncle was awake  he had heard a little of our motions and  whisperings  and lay in expectation of something      i thought i should hear from you soon   he said   i wrote to mr  day on  thursday  but have had no reply  what has happened  nothing serious  i  hope       i hardly know  uncle  john day is lying at our house  unable to move or  speak      my uncle started up as if to spring from his bed  but fell back again  with a groan      don t be alarmed  uncle   i said   he is  i hope  safe for the moment   with penny to watch him  but i am very anxious dr  southwell should see  him       how did it come about  little one       there has been no accident that i know of  but i scarcely know more than  you   i replied  and told him all that had taken place within my ken     he lay silent a moment  thinking      i can t say i like his lying there with only penny to protect him   he  said   he must have come seeking refuge  i don t like the thing at all   he is in some danger we do not know       i will go back at once  uncle   i replied  and rose from the bedside   where i had seated myself a little tired      you must  if we cannot do better  but i think we can  martha shall go   and you will stay with me  run at once and wake dr  southwell  ask him to  come directly      i ran all the way  it was not far  and pulled the doctor s night bell  he  answered it himself  i gave him my uncle s message  and he was at the inn  a few minutes after me  my uncle told him what had happened  and begged  him to go and see the patient  carrying martha with him in his gig     the doctor said he would start at once  my uncle begged him to give  strictest orders that no one was to see mr  day  whoever it might be   martha heard  and grew like a colonel of dragoons ordered to charge with  his regiment     in less than half an hour they started  at a pace that delighted me     when zoe was put up and attended to  and i was alone with my uncle  i got  him some breakfast to make up for the loss of his sleep  he told me it  was better than sleep to have me near him     what i went through that night and the following day  i need not recount   whoever has loved one in danger and out of her reach  will know what it  was like  the doctor did not make his appearance until five o clock   having seen several patients on his way back  the young man  he reported   was certainly in for a fever of some kind   he could not yet pronounce  which  he would see him again on the morrow  he said  and by that time it  would have declared itself  some one in the neighbourhood must watch the  case  it was impossible for him to give it sufficient attention  my uncle  told him he was now quite equal to the task himself  and we would all go  together the next day  my delight at the proposal was almost equalled by  my satisfaction that the doctor made no objection to it     for joy i scarcely slept that night  i was going to nurse john  but i was  anxious about my uncle  he assured me  however  that in one day more he  would in any case have insisted on returning  if it had not been for a  little lingering fever  he said  he would have gone much sooner      that was because of me  uncle   i answered with contrition      perhaps   he replied   but i had a blow on the head  you know       there is one good thing   i said   you will know john the sooner from  seeing him ill  but perhaps you will count that only a mood  uncle  and  not to be trusted      he smiled  i think he was not  very  anxious about the result of a nearer  acquaintance with john day  i believe he had some faith in my spiritual  instinct     uncle went with the doctor in his brougham  and i rode zoe  the back of  the house came first in sight  and i saw the window blinds of my room  still down  the doctor had pronounced it the fittest for the invalid  and  would not have him moved to the guest chamber penny had prepared for him     in the only room i had ever occupied as my own  i nursed john for a space  of three weeks     from the moment he saw me  he began to improve  my uncle noted this  and  i fancy liked john the better for it  nor did he fail to note the  gentleness and gratitude of the invalid           chapter xxi       a foiled attempt     the morning after my uncle s return  came a messenger from rising with  his lady s compliments  asking if mr  whichcote could tell her anything  of her son  he had left the house unseen  during a feverish attack  and  as she could get no tidings of him  she was in great anxiety  she had  accidentally heard that he had made mr  whichcote s acquaintance  and  therefore took the liberty of extending to him the inquiry she had  already made everywhere else among his friends  my uncle wrote in answer   that her son had come to his house in a high fever  that he had been  under medical care ever since  and that he hoped in a day or two he might  be able to return  if he expressed a desire to see his mother  he would  immediately let her know  but in the meantime it was imperative he should  be kept quiet     from this letter  lady cairnedge might surmise that her relations  with her son were at least suspected  within two hours came another  message  that she would send a close carriage to bring him home the next  day  then indeed were my uncle and i glad that we had come  for though  martha would certainly have defended the citadel to her utmost  she might  have been sorely put to it if his mother proceeded to carry him away by  force  my uncle  in reply  begged her not to give herself the useless  trouble of sending to fetch him  in the state he was in at present  it  would be tantamount to murder to remove him  and he would not be a party  to it     when i yielded my place in the sick room to martha and went to bed  my  heart was not only at ease for the night  but i feared nothing for the  next day with my uncle on my side  or rather on john s side     we were just rising from our early dinner  for we were old fashioned  people  when up drove a grand carriage  with two strong footmen behind   and a servant in plain clothes on the box by the coachman  it pulled up  at the door  and the man on the box got down and rang the bell  while his  fellows behind got down also  and stood together a little way behind him   my uncle at once went to the hall  but no more than in time  for there  was penny already on her way to open the door  he opened it himself  and  stood on the threshold      if you please  sir   said the man  not without arrogance   we re come to  take mr  day home       tell your mistress   returned my uncle   that mr  day has expressed no  desire to return  and is much too unwell to be informed of her ladyship s  wish       begging your pardon  sir   said the man   we have her ladyship s orders  to bring him  we ll take every possible care of him  the carriage is an  extra easy one  and i ll sit inside with the young gentleman myself  if  he ain t right in his head  he ll never know nothink till he comes to  himself in his own bed      my uncle had let the man talk  but his anger was fast rising      i cannot let him go  i would not send a beggar to the hospital in the  state he is in       but  indeed  sir  you must  we have our orders       if you fancy i will dismiss a guest of mine at the order of any human  being  were it the queen s own majesty   said my uncle  i heard the  words  and with my mind s eyes saw the blue flash of his as he said  them   you will find yourself mistaken       i m sorry   said the man quietly   but i have my orders  let me pass   please  it is my business to find the young gentleman  and take him home   no one can have the right to keep him against his mother s will   especially when he s not in a fit state to judge for himself       happily i am in a fit state to judge for him   said my uncle  coldly      i dare not go back without him  let me pass   he returned  raising his  voice a little  and approaching the door as if he would force his way     i ought to have mentioned that  as my uncle went to the door  he took  from a rack in the hall a whip with a bamboo stock  which he generally  carried when he rode  his answer to the man was a smart  though  left handed blow with the stock across his face  they were too near for  the thong  he staggered back  and stood holding his hand to his face  his  fellow servants  who  during the colloquy  had looked on with  gentlemanlike imperturbability  made a simultaneous step forward  my  uncle sent the thong with a hiss about their ears  they sprang toward him  in a fury  but halted immediately and recoiled  he had drawn a small  swordlike weapon  which i did not know to be there  from the stock of the  whip  he gave one swift glance behind him  i was in the hall at his back      shut the door  orba   he cried     i shut him out  and ran to a window in the little drawing room  which  commanded the door  never had i seen him look as now  his pale face pale  no longer  but flushed with anger  neither  indeed  until that moment had  i ever seen the  natural  look of anger  the expression of  pure  anger   there was nothing mean or ugly in it  not an atom of hate  but how his  eyes blazed      go back   he cried  in a voice far more stern than loud   if one of you  set foot on the lowest step  and i will run him through      the men saw he meant it  they saw the closed door  and my uncle with his  back to it  they turned and spoke to each other  the coachman sat  immovable on his box  they mounted  and he drove away     i ran and opened the door  my uncle came in with a smile  he went up the  stair  and i followed him to the room where the invalid lay  we were both  anxious to learn if he had been disturbed     he was leaning on his elbow  listening  he looked a good deal more like  himself      i knew you would defend me  sir   he said  with a respectful confidence  which could not but please my uncle      you did not want to go home  did you   he asked with a smile      i should have thrown myself out of the carriage   answered john     that  is  if they had got me into it  but  please  tell me  sir   he went on    how it is i find myself in your house  i have been puzzling over it all  the morning  i have no recollection of coming       you understand  i fancy   rejoined my uncle   that one of the family has  a notion she can take better care of you than anybody else  is not that  enough to account for it       hardly  sir  belorba cannot have gone and rescued me from my mother       how do you know that  belorba is a terrible creature when she is roused   but you have talked enough  shut your eyes  and don t trouble yourself to  recollect  as you get stronger  it will all come back to you  then you  will be able to tell us  instead of asking us to tell you      he left us together  i quieted john by reading to him  and absolutely  declining to talk      you are a captive  the castle is enchanted  speak a single word   i  said   and you will find yourself in the dungeon of your own room      he looked at me an instant  closed his eyes  and in a few minutes was  fast asleep  he slept for two hours  and when he woke was quite himself   he was very weak  but the fever was gone  and we had now only to feed him  up  and keep him quiet           chapter xxii       john recalls and remembers     what a weight was off my heart  it seemed as if nothing more could go  wrong  but  though john was plainly happy  he was not quite comfortable   he worried himself with trying to remember how he had come to us  the  last thing he could definitely recall before finding himself with us  was  his mother looking at him through a night that seemed made of blackness  so solid that he marvelled she could move in it  she brought him  something to drink  but he fancied it blood  and would not touch it  he  remembered now that there was a red tumbler in his room  he could recall  nothing after  except a cold wind  and a sense of utter weariness but  absolute compulsion  he must keep on and on till he found the gate of  heaven  to which he seemed only for ever coming nearer  his conclusion  was  that he knew what he was about every individual moment  but had no  memory  each thing he did was immediately forgotten  while the knowledge  of what he had to do next remained with him  it was  he thought  a mental  condition analogous with walking  in which every step is a frustrated  fall  i set this down here  because  when i told my uncle what john had  been saying  myself not sure that i perceived what he meant  he declared  the boy a philosopher of the finest grain  but he warned me not to  encourage his talking  and especially not to ask him to explain  there  was nothing  he said  worse for a weak brain  than to set a strong will  to work it     i tried to obey him  but it grew harder as the days went on  there were  not many of them  however  he recovered rapidly  when at length my uncle  talked not only to but with him  i regarded it as a virtual withdrawal of  his prohibition  and after that spoke to john of whatever came into his  or my head     it was then he told me all he could remember since the moment he left me  with his supper in his hand  a great part of his recollection was the  vision of my uncle on the moor  and afterward in the park  we did not  know what to make of it  i should at once have concluded it caused by  prelusive illness  but for my remembrance of what both my uncle and  myself had seen  so long before  in the thunderstorm  while john  willing  enough to attribute its recurrence to that cause  found it impossible to  concede that he was anything but well when crossing the moor  i thought   however  that excitement  fatigue  and lack of food  might have something  to do with it  and with his illness too  while  if he was in a state to  see anything phantasmal  what shape more likely to appear than that of my  uncle     he would not hear of my mentioning the thing to my uncle  i would for my  own part have gone to him with it immediately  but could not with john s  prayer in my ears  i resolved  however  to gain his consent if i could     he had by this time as great a respect for my uncle as i had myself  but  could not feel at home with him as i did  whether the vision was only a  vision  or indeed my uncle s double  whatever a double may be  the tale  of it could hardly be an agreeable one to him  and naturally john shrank  from the risk of causing him the least annoyance     the question of course came up  what he was to do when able to leave us   he had spoken very plainly to my uncle concerning his relations with his  mother  had told him indeed that he could not help suspecting he owed his  illness to her     i was nearly always present when they talked  but remember in especial a  part of what passed on one occasion      i believe i understand my mother   said john     but only after much  thinking  i loved her when a child  and if she had not left me for the  sake of liberty and influence  that at least is how i account for her  doing so  i might at this moment be struggling for personal freedom   instead of having that over       there are women   returned my uncle   some of them of the most admired   who are slaves to a demoniacal love of power  the very pleasure of their  consciousness consists in the knowledge that they have power  not power  to do things  but power to make other people do things  it is an  insanity  but a devilishly immoral and hateful insanity   i do not say  the lady in question is one of such  for i do not know her  i only say i  have known such a one      john replied that certainly the love of power was his mother s special  weakness  she was spoiled when a child  he had been told  had her every  wish regarded  her every whim respected  this ruinous treatment sprang   he said  from the self same ambition  in another form  on the part of  her mother  the longing  namely  to secure her child s supreme  affection  with the natural consequence that they came to hate one  another  his father and she had been married but fifteen months  when he  died of a fall  following the hounds  within six months she was engaged   but the engagement was broken off  and she went abroad  leaving him  behind her  she married lord cairnedge in venice  and returned to england  when john was nearly four  and seemed to have lost all memory of her  his  stepfather was good to him  but died when he was about eight  his mother  was very severe  her object plainly was to plant her authority so in his  very nature  that he should never think of disputing her will      but   said john   she killed my love  and so i grew able to cast off her  yoke       the world would fare worse  i fancy   remarked my uncle   if violent  women bore patient children  the evil would become irremediable  the  children might not be ruined  but they would bring no discipline to the  mother       her servants   continued john   obey her implicitly  except when they  are sure she will never know  she treats them so imperiously  that they  admire her  and are proud to have such a mistress  but she is convinced  at last  i believe  that she will never get me to do as she pleases  and  therefore hates me so heartily  that she can hardly keep her ladylike  hands off me  i do not think i have been unreasonable  i have not found  it difficult to obey others that were set over me  but when i found  almost her every requirement part of a system for reducing me to a  slavish obedience  i began to lay down lines of my own  i resolved to do  at once whatever she asked me  whether pleasant to me or not  so long as  i saw no reason why it should not be done  then i was surprised to find  how seldom i had to make a stand against her wishes  at the same time   the mode in which she conveyed her pleasure  was invariably such as to  make a pretty strong effort of the will necessary for compliance with it   but the effort to overcome the difficulty caused by her manner  helped to  develop in me the strength to resist where it was not right to yield  by  far the most serious difference we had yet had  arose about six months  ago  when she insisted i should make myself agreeable to a certain lady   whom i by no means disliked  she had planned our marriage  i believe  as  one of her parallels in the siege of the lady s noble father  then a  widower of a year  i told her i would not lay myself out to please any  lady  except i wanted to marry her   and why  pray  should you not marry  her   she returned  i answered that i did not love her  and would not  marry until i saw the woman i could not be happy without  and she  accepted me  she went into a terrible passion  but i found myself quite  unmoved by it  it is a wonderful heartener to know yourself not merely  standing up for a right  but for the right to do the right thing   you  wouldn t surely have me marry a woman i didn t care a straw for   i said    quench my soul   she cried  i have often wondered where she learned the  oath   what would that matter  she wouldn t care a straw for you in a  month     why should i marry her then     because your mother wishes it    she replied  and turned to march from the room as if that settled the  thing  but i could not leave it so  the sooner she understood the better    mother   i cried   i will not marry the lady  i will not pay her the  least attention that could be mistaken to mean the possibility of it    she turned upon me  i have just respect enough left for her  not to say  what her face suggested to me  she was pale as a corpse  her very lips  were colourless  her eyes  but i will not go on   your father all over    she snarled  yes  snarled  with an inarticulate cry of fiercest loathing   and turned again and went  if i do not quite think my mother   at  present   would murder me  i do think she would do anything short of  murder to gain her ends with me  but do not be afraid  i am sufficiently  afraid to be on my guard      my father was a rich man  and left my mother more than enough  there was  no occasion for her to marry again  except she loved  and i am sure she  did not love lord cairnedge  i wish  for my sake  not for his  he were  alive now  but the moment  i am one and twenty  i shall be my own master   and hope  sir  you will not count me unworthy to be the more belorba s  servant  one thing i am determined upon  my mother shall not cross my  threshold but at my wife s invitation  and i shall never ask my wife to  invite her  she is too dangerous      we had another altercation about miss miles  an hour or two before i  first saw orba  they were far from worthy feelings that possessed me up  to the moment when i caught sight of her over the wall  it was a leap out  of hell into paradise  the glimpse of such a face  without shadow of  scheme or plan or selfish end  was salvation to me  i thank god      perhaps i ought not to let those words about myself stand  but he said  them     he had talked too long  he fell back in his chair  and the tears began to  gather in his eyes  my uncle rose  put his arm about me  and led me to  the study      let him rest a bit  little one   he said as we entered   it is long  since we had a good talk      he seated himself in his think chair  a name which  when a child  i had  given it  and i slid to the floor at his feet      i cannot help thinking  little one   he began   that you are going to be  a happy woman  i do believe that is a man to be trusted  as for the  mother  there is no occasion to think of her  beyond being on your guard  against her  you will have no trouble with her after you are married       i cannot help fearing she will do us a mischief  uncle   i returned      sir philip sidney says   since a man is bound no further to himself than  to do wisely  chance is only to trouble them that stand upon chance    that is  we are responsible only for our actions  not for their results   trust first in god  then in john day       i was sure you would like him  uncle   i cried  with a flutter of loving  triumph      i was nearly as sure myself  such confidence had i in the instinct of my  little one  i think that i  of the two of us  may  in this instance   claim the greater faith       you are always before me  uncle   i said   i only follow where you lead   but what do you think the woman will do next       i don t think  it is no use  we shall hear of her before long  if all  mothers were like her  the world would hardly be saved       it would not be worth saving  uncle       whatever can be saved  must be worth saving  my child       yes  uncle  i shouldn t have said that   i replied           chapter xxiii       letter and answer     we did hear of her before long  the next morning a letter was handed to  my uncle as we sat at breakfast  he looked hard at the address  changed  countenance  and frowned very dark  but i could not read the frown  then  his face cleared a little  he opened  read  and handed the letter to me     lady cairnedge hoped mr  whichcote would excuse one who had so lately  come to the neighbourhood  that  until an hour ago  she knew nothing of  the position and character of the gentleman in whose house her son had   in a momentary  but  alas  not unusual aberration  sought shelter  and  found generous hospitality  she apologized heartily for the unceremonious  way in which she had sent for him  in her anxiety to have him home  if  possible  before he should realize his awkward position in the house of a  stranger  she had been inconsiderate  she left it to the judgment of his  kind host whether she should herself come to fetch him  or send her  carriage with the medical man who usually attended him  in either case  her servants must accompany the carriage  as he would probably object to  being removed  he might  however  be perfectly manageable  for he was   when himself  the gentlest creature in the world     i was in a rage  i looked up  expecting to see my uncle as indignant with  the diabolical woman as i was myself  but he seemed sunk in reverie  his  body present  his spirit far away  a pang shot through my heart  could  the wicked device have told already      may i ask  uncle   i said  and tried hard to keep my voice steady   how  you mean to answer this vile epistle      he looked up with a wan smile  such as might have broke from lazarus when  he found himself again in his body      i will take it to the young man   he answered      please  let us go at once then  uncle  i cannot sit still      he rose  and we went together to john s room     he was much better  sitting up in bed  and eating the breakfast penny had  carried him      i have just had a letter from your mother  day   said my uncle      indeed   returned john dryly      will you read it  and tell me what answer you would like me to return       hardly like her usual writing  though there s her own strange s    remarked john as he looked at it      does she always make an s like that   asked my uncle  with something  peculiar in his tone  i thought      always  like a snake just going to strike      my uncle s face grew ghastly pale  he almost snatched the letter from  john s hand  looked at it  gave it back to him  and  to our dismay  left  the room      what can be the matter  john   i said  my heart sinking within me      go to him   said john     i dared not  i had often seen him  like  that before walking out into the  night  but there was something in his face now which i had not seen there  before  it looked as if some terrible suspicion were suddenly confirmed      you see what my mother is after   said john   you have now to believe   her   that i am subject to fits of insanity  or to believe  me   that  there is nothing she will not do to get her way       her object is clear   i replied   but if she thinks to fool my uncle   she will find herself mistaken       she hopes to fool both you and your uncle   he rejoined   the only wise  thing i could do  she will handle so as to convince any expert of my  madness  i mean  my coming to you  my reasons will go for nothing  less  than no thing  with any one she chooses to bewitch  she will look at me  with an anxious love no doctor could doubt  no one can know  you  do not  know that i am not mad  or at least subject to attacks of madness       oh  john  don t frighten me   i cried      there  you are not sure about it      it seemed cruel of him to tease me so  but i saw presently why he did it   he thought his mother s letter had waked a doubt in my uncle  and he  wanted me not to be vexed with my uncle  even if he deserted him and went  over to his mother s side      i love your uncle   he said   i know he is a true man  i  will  not be  angry with him if my mother do mislead him  the time will come when he  will know the truth  it must appear at last  i shall have to fight her  alone  that s all  the worst is  if he thinks with my mother i shall have  to go at once   if only somebody would sell my horse for me      i guessed that his mother kept him short of money  and remembered with  gladness that i was not quite penniless at the moment      in the meantime  you must keep as quiet as you can  john   i said    where is the good of planning upon an  if   to trust is to get ready   uncle says  trust is better than foresight      john required little such persuading  and indeed something very different  was in my uncle s mind from what john feared     presently i caught a glimpse of him riding out of the yard  i ran to a  window from which i could see the edge of the moor  and saw him cross it  at an uphill gallop     he was gone about four hours  and on his return went straight to his own  room  not until nine o clock did i go to him  and then he came with me to  supper     he looked worn  but was kind and genial as usual  after supper he sent  for dick  and told him to ride to rising  the first thing in the morning   with a letter he would find on the hall table     the letter he read to us before we parted for the night  it was all we  could have wished  he wrote that he must not have any one in his house  interfered with  so long as a man was his guest  he was his servant  her  ladyship had  however  a perfect right to see her son  and would be  welcome  only the decision as to his going or remaining must rest with  the young man himself  if he chose to accompany his mother  well and  good  though he should be sorry to lose him  if he declined to return  with her  he and his house continued at his service           chapter xxiv       hand to hand     we looked for lady cairnedge all the next day  john was up by noon  and  ready to receive her in the drawing room  he would not see her in his  bedroom  but the hours passed  and she did not come     in the evening  however  when the twilight was thickening  and already  all was dark in the alleys of the garden  her carriage drove quietly  up  with a startling scramble of arrest at the door  the same servants  were outside  and a very handsome dame within  as she descended  i saw  that she was tall  and  if rather stout  not stouter than suited her age  and style  her face was pale  but she seemed in perfect health  when i  saw her closer  i found her features the most regular i had ever seen   had the soul within it filled the mould of that face  it would have been  beautiful  as it was  it was only handsome  to me repulsive  the moment i  saw it  i knew myself in the presence of a masked battery     my uncle had insisted that she should be received where we usually sat   and had given penny orders to show her into the hall kitchen     i was alone there  preparing something for john  we were not expecting  her  for it seemed now too late to look for her  my uncle was in the  study  and martha somewhere about the house  my heart sank as i turned  from the window  and sank yet lower when she appeared in the doorway of  the kitchen  but as i advanced  i caught sight of my uncle  and went  boldly to meet the enemy  he had come down his stair  and had just  stepped into a clear blaze of light  which that moment burst from the  wood i had some time ago laid damp upon the fire  the next instant i saw  the lady s countenance ghastly with terror  looking beyond me  i turned   but saw nothing  save that my uncle had disappeared  when i faced her  again  only a shadow of her fright remained  i offered her my hand  for  she was john s mother  but she did not take it  she stood scanning me  from head to foot      i am lady cairnedge   she said   where is my son      i turned yet again  my uncle had not come back  i was not prepared to  take his part  i was bewildered  a dead silence fell  for the first time  in my life  my uncle seemed to have deserted me  and at the moment when  most i needed him  i turned once more to the lady  and said  hardly  knowing what      you wish to see mr  day      she answered me with a cold stare      i will go and tell him you are here   i faltered  and passing her  i  sped along the passage to the drawing room      john   i cried  bursting in   she s come  do you still mean to see her   are you able  uncle       there i stopped  for his eyes were stern  and not looking at me  but at  something behind me  one moment i thought his fever had returned  but  following his gaze i looked round   there stood lady cairnedge  john was  face to face with his mother  and my uncle was not there to defend him      are you ready   she said  nor pretended greeting  she seemed slightly  discomposed  and in haste     i was by this time well aware of my lover s determination of character   but i was not prepared for the tone in which he addressed the icy woman  calling herself his mother      i am ready to listen   he answered      john   she returned  with mingled severity and sharpness   let us have  no masquerading  you are perfectly fit to come home  and you must come at  once  the carriage is at the door       you are quite right  mother   answered john calmly   i  am  fit to go  home with you  but rising does not quite agree with me  i dread such  another attack  and do not mean to go      the drawing room had a rectangular bay window  one of whose three sides  commanded the door  the opposite side looked into a little grove of  larches  lady cairnedge had already realized the position of the room   she darted to the window  and saw her carriage but a few yards away     she would have thrown up the sash  but found she could not  she twisted  her handkerchief round her gloved hand  and dashed it through a pane      men   she cried  in a loud  commanding voice   come at once      the moment she went to the window  i sprang to the door  locked it  put  the key in my pocket  and set my back to the door     i heard the men thundering at the hall door  lady cairnedge turned as if  she would herself go and open to them  but seeing me  she understood what  i had done  and went back to the window      come here  come to me here  to the window   she cried     john had been watching with a calm  determined look  he came and stood  between us      john   i said   leave your mother to me       she will kill you   he answered      you might kill her   i replied     i darted to the chimney  where a clear fire was burning  caught up the  poker  and thrust it between the bars      that s for you   i whispered   they will not touch you with that in your  hand  never mind me  if your mother move hand or foot to help them  it  will be my turn      he gave me a smile and a nod  and his eyes lightened  i saw that he  trusted me  and i felt fearless as a bull dog     in the meantime  she had spoken to her servants  and was now trying to  open the window  which had a peculiar catch  i saw that john could defend  himself much better at the window than in the room  i went softly behind  his mother  put my hands round her neck  and clasping them in front   pulled her backward with all my strength  we fell on the floor together   i under of course  but clutching as if all my soul were in my fingers   neither should she meddle with john  nor should he lay hand on her  i did  not mind much what i did to her myself      to the window  john   i cried   and break their heads      he snatched the poker from the fire  and the next moment i heard a  crashing of glass  but of course i could not see what was going on  mine  was no grand way of fighting  but what was dignity where john was in  danger  for the moment i had the advantage  but  while determined to hold  on to the last  i feared she would get the better of me  for she was much  bigger and stronger  and crushed and kicked  and dug her elbows into me   struggling like a mad woman     all at once the tug of her hands on mine ceased  she gave a great shriek   and i felt a shudder go through her  then she lay still  i relaxed my  hold cautiously  for i feared a trick  she did not move  horror seized  me  i thought i had killed her  i writhed from under her to see  as i did  so  i caught sight of the pale face of my uncle  looking in at that part  of the window next the larch grove  immediately i remembered lady  cairnedge s terror in the kitchen  and knew that the cause of it  and of  her present cry  must be the same  to wit  the sight of my uncle  i had  not hurt her  i was not yet on my feet when my uncle left the window   flew to the other side of it  and fell upon the men with a stick so  furiously that he drove them to the carriage  the horses took fright  and  went prancing about  rearing and jibbing  at the call of the coachman   two of the men flew to their heads  i saw no more of their assailant     john  who had not got a fair blow at one of his besiegers  left the  window  and came to me where i was trying to restore his mother  the  third man  the butler  came back to the window  put his hand through   undid the catch  and flung the sash wide  john caught up the poker from  the floor  and darted to it      set foot within the window  parker   he cried   and i will break your  head      the man did not believe he would hurt him  and put foot and head through  the window     now john had honestly threatened  but to perform he found harder than he  had thought  it is one thing to raise a poker  and another to strike a  head with it  the window was narrow  and the whole man was not yet in the  room  when john raised his weapon  but he could not bring the horrid  poker down upon the dumb blind back of the stooping man s head  he threw  it from him  and casting his eyes about  spied a huge family bible on a  side table  he sprang to it  and caught it up  just in time  the man had  got one foot firm on the floor  and was slowly drawing in the other  when  down came the bible on his head  with all the force john could add to its  weight  the butler tumbled senseless on the floor      here  orbie   cried john   help me to bundle him out before he comes to  himself  take what you would have   he said  as between us we shoved him  out on the gravel     i fetched smelling salts and brandy  and everything i could think  of  fetched martha too  and between us we got her on the sofa  but lady  cairnedge lay motionless  she breathed indeed  but did not open her eyes   john stood ready to do anything for her  but his countenance revealed  little compassion  whatever the cause of his mother s swoon  he had never  seen her in one before  he was certain it had to do with some bad passage  in her life  he said so to me that same evening   but what could the  sight of my uncle have to do with it   i asked   probably he knows  something  or she thinks he does   he answered      wouldn t it be better to put her to bed  and send for the doctor  john    i suggested at last     perhaps the sound of my voice calling her son by his christian name   stung her proud ear  for the same moment she sat up  passed her hands  over her eyes  and cast a scared gaze about the room      where am i  is it gone   she murmured  looking ghastly     no one answered her      call parker   she said  feebly  yet imperiously     still no one spoke     she kept glancing sideways at the window  where nothing was to be seen  but the gathering night  in a few moments she rose and walked straight  from the room  erect  but white as a corpse  i followed  passed her  and  opened the hall door  there stood the carriage  waiting  as if nothing  unusual had happened  parker seated in the rumble  with one of the  footmen beside him  the other man stood by the carriage door  he opened  it immediately  her ladyship stepped in  and dropped on the seat  the  carriage rolled away     i went back to john      i must leave you  darling   he said   i cannot subject you to the risk  of such another outrage  i fear sometimes my mother may be what she would  have you think me  i ought to have said  i hope she is  it would be the  only possible excuse for her behaviour  the natural end of loving one s  own way  is to go mad  if you don t get it  you go mad  if you do get it   you go madder  that s all the difference   i must go      i tried to expostulate with him  but it was of no use      where will you go   i said   you cannot go home       i would at once   he answered   if i could take the reins in my own  hands  but i will go to london  and see the family lawyer  he will tell  me what i had better do       you have no money   i said      how do you know that   he returned with a smile   have you been  searching my pockets       john   i cried     he broke into a merry laugh      your uncle will lend me a five pound note   he said      he will lend you as much as you want  but i don t think he s in the  house   i answered   i have two myself  though  i ll run and fetch them      i bounded away to get the notes  it was like having a common purse  already  to lend john ten pounds  but i had no intention of letting him  leave the house the same day he was first out of his room after such an  illness  that was  if i could help it     my uncle had given me the use of a drawer in that same cabinet in which  were the precious stones  and there  partly  i think  from the pride of  sharing the cabinet with my uncle  i had long kept everything i counted  precious  i should have kept zoe there if she had not been alive and too  big           chapter xxv       a very strange thing     the moment i opened the door of the study  i saw my uncle  in his  think chair  his head against the back of it  his face turned to the  ceiling  i ran to his side and dropped on my knees  thinking he was dead   he opened his eyes and looked at me  but with such a wan  woe begone  countenance  that i burst into a passion of tears      what is it  uncle dear   i gasped and sobbed      nothing very new  little one   he answered      it is something terrible  uncle   i cried   or you would not look like  that  did those horrid men hurt you  you did give it them well  you came  down on them like the angel on the assyrians       i don t know what you re talking about  little one   he returned   what  men       the men that came with john s mother to carry him off  if it hadn t been  for my beautiful uncle  they would have done it too  how i wondered what  had become of you  i was almost in despair  i thought you had left us to  ourselves  and you only waiting  like god  for the right moment      he sat up  and stared at me  bewildered      i had forgotten all about john   he said      as to what you think i did  i know nothing about it  i haven t been out  of this room since i saw  that spectre in the kitchen       john s mother  you mean  uncle       ah  she s john s mother  is she  yes  i thought as much  and it was more  than my poor brain could stand  it was too terrible   my little one  this  is death to you and me      my heart sank within me  one thought only went through my head  that   come what might  i would no more give up john  than if i were already  married to him in the church      but why  what is it  uncle   i said  hardly able to get the words out      i will tell you another time   he answered  and rising  went to the  door      john is going to london   i said  following him      is he   he returned listlessly      he wants to see his lawyer  and try to get things on a footing of some  sort between his mother and him       that is very proper   he replied  with his hand on the lock      but you don t think it would be safe for him to travel to night  do you   uncle  so soon after his illness   i asked      no  i cannot say i do  it would not be safe  he is welcome to stop till  to morrow       will you not tell him so  uncle  he is bent on going       i would rather not see him  there is no occasion  it will be a great  relief to me when he is able  quite able  i mean  to go home to his  mother  or where it may suit him best      it was indeed like death to hear my uncle talk so differently about john   what had he done to be treated in this way  taken up and made a friend  of  and then cast off without reason given  my dear uncle was not at all  like himself  to say he forgot our trouble and danger  and never came  near us in our sore peril  when we owed our deliverance to him  and now  to speak like this concerning john  something was terribly wrong with  him  i dared hardly think what it could be     i stood speechless     my uncle opened the door  and went down the steps  the sound of his feet  along the corridor and down the stair to the kitchen  died away in my  ears  my life seemed to go ebbing with it  i was stranded on a desert  shore  and he in whom i had trusted was leaving me there     i came to myself a little  got the two five pound notes  and returned to  john     when i reached the door of the room  i found my heart in my throat  and  my brains upside down  what was i to say to him  how could i let him go  away so late  and how could i let him stay where his departure would be a  relief  even i would have him gone from where he was not wanted  i saw   however  that my uncle must not have john s death at his door  that i  must persuade him to stay the night  i went in  and gave him the notes   but begged him  for my love  to go to bed  in the morning  i said  i  would drive him to the station     he yielded with difficulty  but with how little suspicion that all the  time i wished him gone  i went to bed only to lie listening for my  uncle s return  it was long past midnight ere he came     in the morning i sent penny to order the phaeton  and then ran to my  uncle s room  in the hope he would want to see john before he left  i was  not sure he had realized that he was going     he was neither in his bed room nor in the study  i went to the stable   dick was putting the horse to the phaeton  he told me he had heard his  master  two hours before  saddle thanatos  and ride away  this made me  yet more anxious about him  he did not often ride out early  seldom  indeed after coming home late  things seemed to threaten complication     john looked so much better  and was so eager after the projected  interview with his lawyer  that i felt comforted concerning him  i did  not tell him what my uncle had said the night before  it would  i felt   be wrong to mention what my uncle might wish forgotten  and as i did not  know what he meant  it could serve no end  we parted at the station very  much as if we had been married half a century  and i returned home to  brood over the strange things that had happened  but before long i found  myself in a weltering swamp of futile speculation  and turned my thoughts  perforce into other channels  lest i should lose the power of thinking   and be drowned in reverie  my uncle had taught me that reverie is phaeton  in the chariot of apollo     the weary hours passed  and my uncle did not come  i had never before  been really uneasy at his longest absence  but now i was far more anxious  about him than about john  alas  through me fresh trouble had befallen my  uncle as well as john  when the night came  i went to bed  for i was very  tired  i must keep myself strong  for something unfriendly was on its  way  and i must be able to meet it  i knew well i should not sleep until  i heard the sounds of his arrival  those came about one o clock  and in a  moment i was dreaming     in my dream i was still awake  and still watching for my uncle s return   i heard the sound of death s hoofs  not on the stones of the yard  but on  the gravel before the house  and coming round the house till under my  window  there he stopped  and i heard my uncle call to me to come down   he wanted me  in my dream i was a child  i sprang out of bed  ran from  the house on my bare feet  jumped into his down stretched arms  and was  in a moment seated in front of him  death gave a great plunge  and went  off like the wind  cleared the gate in a flying stride  and rushed up  the hill to the heath  the wind was blowing behind us furiously  i could  hear it roaring  but did not feel it  for it could not overtake us  we  out stripped and kept ahead of it  if for a moment we slackened speed  it  fell upon us raging     we came at length to the pool near the heart of the heath  and i wondered  that  at the speed we were making  we had been such a time in reaching  it  it was the dismalest spot  with its crumbling peaty banks  and its  water brown as tea  tradition declared it had no bottom  went down into  nowhere      here   said my uncle  bringing his horse to a sudden halt   we had a  terrible battle once  death and i  with the worm that lives in this hole   you know what worm it is  do you not      i had heard of the worm  and any time i happened  in galloping about the  heath  to find myself near the pool  the thought would always come back  with a fresh shudder  what if the legend were a true one  and the worm  was down there biding his time  but anything more about the worm i had  never heard      no  uncle   i answered   i don t know what worm it is       ah   he answered  with a sigh   if you do not take the more care  little  one  you will some day learn  not what the worm is called  but what it  is  the worm that lives there  is the worm that never dies      i gave a shriek  i had never heard of the horrible creature before  so it  seemed in my dream  to think of its being so near us  and never dying   was too terrible      don t be frightened  little one   he said  pressing me closer to his  bosom   death and i killed it  come with me to the other side  and you  will see it lying there  stiff and stark       but  uncle   i said   how can it be dead  how can you have killed it  if  it never dies       ah  that is the mystery   he returned      but come and see  it was a terrible fight  i never had such a fight  or  dear old death either  but she s dead now  it was worth living for  to  make away with such a monster      we rode round the pool  cautiously because of the crumbling banks  to see  the worm lie dead  on and on we rode  i began to think we must have  ridden many times round the hole      i wonder where it can be  uncle   i said at length      we shall come to it very soon   he answered      but   i said   mayn t we have ridden past it without seeing it      he laughed a loud and terrible laugh      when once you have seen it  little one   he replied   you too will laugh  at the notion of having ridden past it without seeing it  the worm that  never dies is hardly a thing to escape notice      we rode on and on  all at once my uncle threw up his hands  dropping the  reins  and with a fearful cry covered his face      it is gone  i have not killed it  no  i have not  it is here  it is  here   he cried  pressing his hand to his heart   it is here  and it was  here all the time i thought it dead  what will become of me  i am lost   lost      at the word  old death gave a scream  and laying himself out  flew with  all the might of his swift limbs to get away from the place  but the  wind  which was behind us as we came  now stormed in our faces  and  presently i saw we should never reach home  for  with all death s fierce  endeavour  we moved but an inch or two in the minute  and that with a  killing struggle      little one   said my uncle   if you don t get down we shall all be lost   i feel the worm rising  it is your weight that keeps poor death from  making any progress      i turned my head  leaning past my uncle  so as to see behind him  a long  neck  surmounted by a head of indescribable horror  was slowly rising  straight up out of the middle of the pool  it should not catch them  i  slid down by my uncle s leg  the moment i touched the ground and let go   away went death  and in an instant was out of sight  i was not afraid  my  heart was lifted up with the thought that i was going to die for my uncle  and old death  the red worm was on the bank  it was crawling toward me  i  went to meet it  it sprang from the ground  threw itself upon me  and  twisted itself about me  it was a human embrace  the embrace of some one  unknown that loved me     i awoke and left the dream  but the dream never left me           chapter xxvi       the evil draws nigher     i rose early  and went to my uncle s room  he was awake  but complained  of headache  i took him a cup of tea  and at his request left him     about noon martha brought me a letter where i sat alone in the  drawing room  i carried it to my uncle  he took it with a trembling hand   read it  and fell back with his eyes closed  i ran for brandy      don t be frightened  little one   he called after me   i don t want  anything       won t you tell me what is the matter  uncle   i said  returning   is it  necessary i should be kept ignorant       not at all  my little one       don t you think  uncle   i dared to continue  forgetting in my love all  difference of years   that  whatever it be that troubles us  it must be  better those who love us should know it  is there some good in a secret  after all       none  my darling   he answered   the thing that made me talk to you so  against secrets when you were a child  was  that i had one myself  one  that was  and is  eating the heart out of me  but that woman shall not  know and you be ignorant  i will not have a secret with  her    leave me  now  please  little one      i rose at once      may i take the letter with me  uncle   i asked     he rubbed his forehead with a still trembling hand  the trembling of that  beloved hand filled me with such a divine sense of pity  that for the  first time i seemed to know god  causing in me that consciousness  the  whole human mother was roused in me for my uncle  i would die  i would  kill to save him  the worm was welcome to swallow me  my very being was a  well of loving pity  pouring itself out over that trembling hand     he took up the letter  gave it to me  and turned his face away with a  groan  i left the room in strange exaltation  the exaltation of merest  love     i went to the study  and there read the hateful letter     here it is  having transcribed it  i shall destroy it      sir   for one who persists in coming between a woman and her son  who  will blame the mother if she cast aside forbearance  i would have spared  you as hitherto  i will spare you no longer  you little thought when you  crossed me who i was  the one in the world in whose power you lay  i  would perish ever lastingly rather than permit one of my blood to marry  one of yours  my words are strong  you are welcome to call them  unladylike  but you shall not doubt what i mean  you know perfectly that   if i denounce you as a murderer  i can prove what i say  and as to my  silence for so many years  i am able thoroughly to account for it  i  shall give you no further warning  you know where my son is  if he is not  in my house within two days  i shall have you arrested   i have made up  my mind       lucretia cairnedge      rising manor  july                whoever be the father  she s the mother of lies   i exclaimed    my  uncle  the best and gentlest of men  a murderer      i laughed aloud in my indignation and wrath     but  though the woman was a liar  she must have something to say with a  show of truth  how else would she dare intimidation with such a man  how  else could her threat have so wrought upon my uncle  what did she know   or imagine she knew  what could be the something on which she founded her  lie   that my uncle was going to tell me  nor did i dread hearing his  story  no revelation would lower him in my eyes  of that i was confident   but i little thought how long it would be before it came  or what a  terrible tale it would prove     i ran down the stair with the vile paper in my hand      the wicked woman   i cried   if she  be  john s mother  i don t care   she s a devil and a liar       hush  hush  little one   said my uncle  with a smile in which the  sadness seemed to intensify the sweetness   you do not  know  anything  against her  you do not  know  she is a liar       there are things  uncle  one knows without knowing       what if i said she told no lie       i should say she was a liar although she told no lie  my uncle is not  what she threatens to say he is       but men have repented  and grown so different you would not know them   how can you tell it has not been so with me  i may have been a bad man  once  and grown better       i know you are trying to prepare me for what you think will be a shock   uncle   i answered   but i want no preparing  out with your worst  i defy  you      ah me  confident  but i had not to repent of my confidence     my uncle gave a great sigh  he looked as if there was nothing for him now  but tell all  evidently he shrank from the task     he put his hand over his eyes  and said slowly        you belong to a world  little one  of which you know next to nothing   more than satan have fallen as lightning from heaven      he lay silent so long that i was constrained to speak again      well  uncle dear   i said   are you not going to tell me       i cannot   he answered     there was absolute silence for  i should think  about twenty minutes  i  could not and would not urge him to speak  what right had i to rouse a  killing effort  he was not bound to tell  me  anything  but i mourned the  impossibility of doing my best for him  poor as that best might be      do not think  my darling   he said at last  and laid his hand on my head  as i knelt beside him   that i have the least difficulty in trusting you   it is only in telling you  i would trust you with my eternal soul  you  can see well enough there is something terrible to tell  for would i not  otherwise laugh to scorn the threat of that bad woman  no one on the  earth has so little right to say what she knows of me  yet i do share a  secret with her which feels as if it would burst my heart  i wish it  would  that would open the one way out of all my trouble  believe me   little one  if any ever needed god  i need him  i need the pardon that  goes hand in hand with righteous judgment  the pardon of him who alone  can make lawful excuse       may god be your judge  uncle  and neither man nor woman       i do not think  you  would altogether condemn me  little one  much as i  loathe myself  terribly as i deserve condemnation       condemn you  uncle  i want to know all  just to show you that nothing  can make the least difference  if you were as bad as that bad woman says   you should find there was one of your own blood who knew what love meant   but i know you are good  uncle  whatever you may have done       little one  you comfort me   sighed my uncle   i cannot tell you this  thing  for when i had told it  i should want to kill myself more than  ever  but neither can i bear that you should not know it  i will  not   have a secret with that woman  i have always intended to tell you  everything  i have the whole fearful story set down for your eyes  and  those of any you may wish to see it  i cannot speak the words into your  ears  the paper i will give you now  but you will not open it until i  give you leave       certainly not  uncle       if i should die before you have read it  i permit and desire you to read  it  i know your loyalty so well  that i believe you would not look at it  even after my death  if i had not given you permission  there are those  who treat the dead as if they had no more rights of any kind   get away  to hades   they say   you are nothing now   but you will not behave so to  your uncle  little one  when the time comes for you to read my story   remember that i  now   in preparation for the knowledge that will give  you  ask you to pardon me  then  for all the pain it will cause you and  your husband  john being that husband  i have tried to do my best for  you  orbie  how much better i might have done had i had a clear  conscience  god only knows  it may be that i was the tenderer uncle that  i could not be a better one      he hid his face in his hands  and burst into a tempest of weeping     it was terrible to see the man to whom i had all my life looked with a  reverence that prepared me for knowing the great father  weeping like a  bitterly repentant and self abhorrent child  it seemed sacrilege to be  present  i felt as if my eyes  only for seeing him thus  deserved the  ravens to pick them out     i could not contain myself  i rose and threw my arms about him  got close  to him as a child to her mother  and  as soon as the passion of my love  would let me  sobbed out      uncle  darling uncle  i love you more than ever  i did not know before  that i could love so much  i could  kill  that woman with my own hands  i  wish i had killed her when i pulled her down that day  it is right to  kill poisonous creatures  she is worse than any snake      he smiled a sad little smile  and shook his head  then first i seemed to  understand a little  a dull flash went through me     i stood up  drew back  and gazed at him  my eyes fixed themselves on his   i stared into them  he had ceased to weep  and lay regarding me with calm  response      you don t mean  uncle          yes  little one  i do  that woman was the cause of the action for which  she threatens to denounce me as a murderer  i do not say she intended to  bring it about  but none the less was she the consciously wicked and  wilful cause of it   and you will marry her son  and be her daughter   he  added  with a groan as of one in unutterable despair     i sprang back from him  my very proximity was a pollution to him while he  believed such a thing of me      never  uncle  never   i cried   how can you think so ill of one who  loves you as i do  i will denounce  her   she will be hanged  and we  shall be at peace       and john   said my uncle      john must look after himself   i answered fiercely   because he chooses  to have such a mother  am i to bring her a hair s breadth nearer to my  uncle  not for any man that ever was born  john must discard his mother   or he and i are as we were  a mother  she is a hyena  a shark  a monster   uncle  she is a  devil    i don t care  it is true  and what is true is  the right thing to say  i will go to her  and tell her to her face what  she is      i turned and made for the door  my heart felt as big as the biggest  man s      if she kill you  little one   said my uncle quietly   i shall be left  with nobody to take care of me      i burst into fresh tears  i saw that i was a fool  and could do nothing      poor john   to have such a mother   i sobbed  then in a rage of  rebellion i cried   i don t believe she  is  his mother  is it possible  now  uncle  does it stand to reason  that such a pestilence of a woman  should ever have borne such a child as my john  i don t  i can t  i won t  believe it       i am afraid there are mysteries in the world quite as hard to explain    replied my uncle      i confess  if i had known who was his mother  i should have been far  from ready to yield my consent to your engagement       what does it matter   i said   of course i shall not marry him       not marry him  child   returned my uncle   what are you thinking of  is  the poor fellow to suffer for  as well as by the sins of his mother       if you think  uncle  that i will bring you into any kind of relation  with that horrible woman  if the worst of it were only that you would  have to see her once because she was my husband s mother  you are  mistaken  she to threaten you if you did not send back her son  as if  john were a horse you had stolen  you have been the angel of god about me  all the days of my life  but even to please you  i cannot consent to  despise myself  besides  you know what she threatens       she shall not hurt me  i will take care of myself for your sakes  your  life shall not be clouded by scandal about your uncle       how are you to prevent it  uncle dear  fulfil her threat or not  she  would be sure to talk       when she sees it can serve no purpose  she will hardly risk reprisals       she will certainly not risk them when she finds we have said good bye       but how would that serve me  little one  what  would you heap on your  uncle s conscience  already overburdened  the misery of keeping two  lovely lovers apart  i will tell you what i have resolved upon  i will  have no more secrets from you  orba  oh  how i thank you  dearest  for  not casting me off      again i threw myself on my knees by his bed      uncle   i cried  my heart ready to break with the effort to show itself    if i did not now love you more than ever  i should deserve to be cast  out  and trodden under foot   what do you think of doing       i shall leave the country  not to return while the woman lives       i m ready  uncle   i said  springing to my feet     at least i shall be  in a few minutes       but hear me out  little one   he rejoined  with a smile of genuine  pleasure   you don t know half my plan yet  how am i to live abroad  if  my property go to rack and ruin  listen  and don t say anything till i  have done  i have no time to lose  i must get up at once   as soon as i  am on board at dover for paris  you and john must get yourselves married  the first possible moment  and settle down here  to make the best of the  farm you can  and send me what you can spare  i shall not want much  and  john will have his own soon  i know you will be good to martha       john may take the farm if he will  it would be immeasurably better than  living with his mother  for me  i am going with my uncle  why  uncle  i  should be miserable in john s very arms and you out of the country for  our sakes  is there to be nobody in the world but husbands  forsooth  i  should love john ever so much more away with you and my duty  than if i  had him with me  and you a wanderer  how happy i shall be  thinking of  john  and taking care of you      he let me run on  when i stopped at length       in any case   he said with a smile   we cannot do much till i am  dressed            chapter xxvii       an encounter     i left my uncle s room  and went to my own  to make what preparation i  could for going abroad with him  i got out my biggest box  and put in all  my best things  and all the trifles i thought i could not do without   then  as there was room  i put in things i could do without  which yet  would be useful  still there was room  the content would shake about on  the continent  so i began to put in things i should like to have  but  which were neither necessary nor useful  before i had got these in  the  box was more than full  and some of them had to be taken out again  in  choosing which were to go and which to be left  i lost time  but i did  not know anything about the trains  and expected to be ready before my  uncle  who would call me when he thought fit     my thoughts also hindered my hands  very likely i should never marry  john  i would not heed that  he would be mine all the same  but to  promise that i would not marry him  because it suited such a mother s  plans to marry him to some one else  that i would not do to save my life   i would have done it to save my uncle s  but our exile would render it  unnecessary     at last i was ready  and went to find my uncle  reproaching myself that i  had been so long away from him  besides  i ought to have been helping him  to pack  for neither he nor his arm was quite strong yet  with a heartful  of apology  i sought his room  he was not there  neither was he in the  study  i went all over the house  and then to the stable  but he was  nowhere  neither had anyone seen him  and death was gone too     the truth burst upon me  i was to see him no more while that terrible  woman lived  no one was to know whither he had gone  he had given himself  for my happiness  vain intention  i should never be happy  to be in  paradise without him  would not be to be in heaven     john was in london  i could do nothing  i threw myself on my uncle s bed   and lay lost in despair  even if john were with me  and we found him   what could we do  i knew it now as impossible for him to separate us that  he might be unmolested  as it was for us to accept the sacrifice of his  life that we might be happy  i knew that john s way would be to leave  everything and go with me and my uncle  only we could not live upon  nothing  least of all in a strange land  martha  to be sure  could manage  well enough with the bailiff  but john could not burden my uncle  and  could not lay his hands on his own  in the mean time my uncle was gone we  knew not whither  i was like one lost on the dark mountains   if only  john would come to take part in my despair     with a sudden agony  i reproached myself that i had made no attempt to  overtake my uncle  it was true i did not know  for nobody could tell me   in what direction he had gone  but zoe s instinct might have sufficed  where mine was useless  zoe might have followed and found thanatos  it  was hopeless now     but i could no longer be still  i got zoe  and fled to the moor  all the  rest of the day i rode hither and thither  nor saw a single soul on its  wide expanse  the very life seemed to have gone out of it  when most we  take comfort in loneliness  it is because there is some one behind it     the sun was set and the twilight deepening toward night when i turned to  ride home  i had eaten nothing since breakfast  and though not hungry   was thoroughly tired  through the great dark hush  where was no sound of  water  though here and there  like lurking live thing  it lay about me  i  rode slowly back  my fasting and the dusk made everything in turn take a  shape that was not its own  i seemed to be haunted by things unknown  i  have sometimes thought whether the spirits that love solitary places  may  not delight in appropriating  for embodiment momentary and partial  such  a present shape as may happen to fit one of their passing moods  whether  it is always the  mere  gnarled  crone like hawthorn  or misshapen rock   that  between the wanderer and the pale sky  suddenly appals him with the  sense of  another   the hawthorn  the rock  the dead pine  is indeed  there  but is it alone there     some such thought was  i remember  in my mind  when  about halfway from  home  i grew aware of something a little way in front that rose between  me and a dark part of the sky  it seemed a figure on a huge horse  my  first thought  very naturally  was of my uncle  the next  of the great  gray horse and his rider that john and i had both seen on the moor  i  confess to a little awe at the thought of the latter  but i am somehow  made so as to be capable of awe without terror  and of the latter i felt  nothing  the composite figure drew nearer  it was a woman on horseback   immediately i recalled the adventure of my childhood  and then remembered  that john had said his mother always rode the biggest horse she could  find  could that shape  towering in the half dark before me  be indeed my  deadly enemy  she who  my uncle had warned me  would kill me if she had  the chance  a fear far other than ghostly invaded me  and for a moment i  hesitated whether to ride on  or turn and make for some covert  until she  should have passed from between me and my home  i hope it was something  better than pride that made me hold on my way  if the wicked  i thought   flee when no man pursueth  it ill becomes the righteous to flee before  the wicked  by this time it was all but dark night  and i had a vague  hope of passing unquestioned  there had been a good deal of rain  and we  were in a very marshy part of the heath  so that i did not care to leave  the track  but  just ere we met  the lady turned her great animal right  across the way  and there made him stand      ah   thought i   what could zoe do in a race with that terrible horse      he seemed made of the darkness  and rose like the figurehead of a frigate  above a yacht      show me the way to rising   said his rider     the hard bell voice was unmistakable      when you come where the track forks   i began     she interrupted me      how can i distinguish in the dark   she returned angrily   go on before   and show me the way      now i had good reason for thinking she knew the way perfectly well  and  still better reason for declining to go on in front of her      you must excuse me   i said   for it is time i were at home  but if you  will turn and ride on in front of me  i will show you a better  though  rather longer way to rising       go on  or i will ride you down   she cried  turning her horse s head  toward me  and making her whip hiss through the air     the sound of it so startled zoe  that she sprang aside  and was off the  road a few yards before i could pull her up  then i saw the woman urging  her horse to follow  i knew the danger she was in  and  though tempted to  be silent  called to her with a loud warning      mind what you are doing  lady cairnedge   i cried   the ground here will  not carry the weight of a horse like yours      but as i spoke he gave in  and sprang across the ditch at the way side   there  however  he stood      you think to escape me   she answered  in a low  yet clear voice  with a  cat like growl in it      you make a mistake       your ladyship will make a worse mistake if you follow me here   i  replied     her only rejoinder was a cut with her whip to her horse  which had stood  motionless since taking his unwilling jump  i spoke to zoe  she bounded  off like a fawn  i pulled her up  and looked back     lady cairnedge continued urging her horse  i heard and saw her whipping  him furiously  she had lost her temper     i warned her once more  but she persisted      then you must take the consequences   i said  and zoe and i made for the  road  but at a point nearer home     had she not been in a passion  she would have seen that her better way  was to return to the road  and intercept us  but her anger blinded her  both to that and to the danger of the spot she was in     we had not gone far when we heard behind us the soft plunging and sucking  of the big hoofs through the boggy ground  i looked over my shoulder   there was the huge bulk  like wordsworth s peak  towering betwixt us and  the stars      go  zoe   i shrieked     she bounded away  the next moment  a cry came from the horse behind us   and i heard the woman say  good god   i stopped  and peered through the  dark  i saw something  but it was no higher above the ground than myself   terror seized me  i turned and rode back      my stupid animal has bogged himself   said lady cairnedge quietly     deep in the dark watery peat  as thick as porridge  her horse gave a  fruitless plunge or two  and sank lower      for god s sake   i cried   get off  your weight is sinking the poor  animal  you will smother him       it will serve him right   she said venomously  and gave the helpless  creature a cut across the ears      you will go down with him  if you do not make haste   i insisted     another moment and she stood erect on the back of the slowly sinking  horse      come and give me your hand   she cried      you want to smother me with him  i think i will not   i answered   you  can get on the solid well enough  i will ride home and bring help for  your horse  poor fellow  stay by him  talk to him  and keep him as quiet  as you can  if he go on struggling  nothing will save him      she replied with a contemptuous laugh     i got to the road as quickly as possible  and galloped home as fast as  zoe could touch and lift  ere i reached the stable yard  i shouted so as  to bring out all the men  when i told them a lady had her horse fast in  the bog  they bustled and coiled ropes  put collars and chains on four  draught horses  lighted several lanterns  and set out with me  i knew the  spot perfectly  no moment was lost either in getting ready  or in  reaching the place     neither the lady nor her horse was to be seen     a great horror wrapt me round  i felt a murderess  she might have failed  to spring to the bank of the hole for lack of the hand she had asked me  to reach out  or her habit might have been entangled  so that she fell  short  and went to the bottom  to be found  one day  hardly changed  by  the side of her peat embalmed steed   no ill fitting fate for her  but a  ghastly thing to have a hand in     she might  however  be on her way to rising on foot  i told two of the  men to mount a pair of the horses  and go with me on the chance of  rendering her assistance     we took the way to rising  and had gone about two miles  when we saw her   through the starlight  walking steadily along the track  i rode up to  her  and offered her one of the cart horses  i would not have trusted my  zoe with her any more than with an american lion that lives upon horses   she declined the proffer with quiet scorn  i offered her one or both men  to see her home  but the way in which she refused their service  made  them glad they had not to go with her  we had no choice  therefore turned  and left her to get home as she might     not until we were on the way back  did it occur to me that i had not  asked martha whether she knew anything about my uncle s departure  she  was never one to volunteer news  and  besides  would naturally think me  in his confidence     i found she knew nothing of our expedition  as no one had gone into the  house  had only heard the horses and voices  and wondered  i was able to  tell her what had happened  but the moment i began to question her as to  any knowledge of my uncle s intentions  my strength gave way  and i burst  into tears      don t be silly  belorba   cried martha  almost severely   you an engaged  young lady  and tied so to your uncle s apron strings that you cry the  minute he s out of your sight  you didn t cry when mr  day left you       no   i answered   he was going only for a day or two       and for how many is your uncle gone       that is what i want to know  he means to be away a long time  i fear       then it s nothing but your fancy sets you crying   but i ll just see    she returned   i shall know by the money he left for the house keeping   only i won t budge till i see you eat      faint for want of food  i had no appetite  but i began at once to eat   and she left me to fetch the money he had given her as he went     she came back with a pocket book  opened it  and looked into it  then she  looked at me  her expression was of unmistakable dismay  i took the  pocket book from her hand  it was full of notes     i learned afterward  that it was his habit to have money in the house  in  readiness for some possible sudden need of it           chapter xxviii       another vision     that same night  within an hour  to my unspeakable relief  john came  home  at least he came to me  who he always said was his home  it was  rather late  but we went out to the wilderness  where i had a good cry on  his shoulder  after which i felt better  and hope began to show signs of  life in me  i never asked him how he had got on in london  but told him  all that had happened since he went  it was worse than painful to tell  him about his mother s letter  and what my uncle told me in consequence  of it  also my personal adventure with her so lately  but i felt i must  hide nothing  if a man s mother is a devil  it is well he should know it     he sat like a sleeping hurricane while i spoke  saying never a word  when  i had ended        is that all   he asked      it is all  john  is it not enough   i answered      it is enough   he cried  with an oath that frightened me  and started to  his feet  the hurricane was awake     i threw my arms round him      where are you going   i said      to  her   he answered      what for       to  kill  her   he said  then threw himself on the ground  and lay  motionless at my feet     i kept silence  i thought with myself he was fighting the nature his  mother had given him     he lay still for about two minutes  then quietly rose      good night  dearest   he said     no  good bye  it is not fit the son of  such a mother should marry any honest woman       i beg your pardon  john   i returned   i hope  i  may have a word in the  matter  if i choose to marry you  what right have you to draw back  let  us leave alone the thing that has to be  and remember that my uncle must  not be denounced as a murderer  something must be done  that he is beyond  personal danger for the present is something  but is he to be the talk of  the country       no harm shall come to him   said john   if i don t throttle the tigress   i ll muzzle her  i know how to deal with her  she has learned at least   that what her stupid son says  he does  i shall make her understand that   on her slightest movement to disgrace your uncle  i will marry you right  off  come what may  and if she goes on  i shall get myself summoned for  the defence  that  if i can say nothing for  him   i may say something  against  her   besides  i will tell her that  when my time comes  if i  find anything amiss with her accounts  i will give her no quarter   but   orbie   he continued   as i will not threaten what i may not be able to  perform  you must promise not to prevent me from carrying it out       i promise   i said   that  if it be necessary for your truth  i will  marry you at once  i only hope she may not already have taken steps       her two days are not yet expired  i shall present myself in good  time   but i wonder you are not afraid to trust yourself alone with the  son of such a mother       to be what i know you  john   i answered   and the son of that woman   shows a good angel was not far off at your birth  but why talk of angels   whoever was your mother  god is your father      he made no reply beyond a loving pressure of my hand  then he asked me  whether i could lend him something to ride home upon  i told him there  was an old horse the bailiff rode sometimes  i was very sorry he could  not have zoe  she had been out all day and was too tired  he said zoe was  much too precious for a hulking fellow like him to ride  but he would be  glad of the old horse     i went to the stable with him  and saw him mount  what a determined look  there was on his face  he seemed quite a middle aged man     i have now to tell how he fared on the moor as he rode     it had turned gusty and rather cold  and was still a dark night  the moon  would be up by and by however  and giving light enough  he thought   before he came to the spot where his way parted company with that to  dumbleton  the moon  however  did not see fit to rise so soon as john  expected her  he was not at that time quite  up  in moons  any more than  in the paths across that moor     now as he had not an idea where his rider wanted to be carried  and as  john did for a while  he confessed it  fall into a reverie or something  worse  old sturdy had to choose for himself where to go  and took a path  he had often had to take some years before  nor did john discover that he  was out of the way  until he felt him going steep clown  and thought of  sleipner bearing hermod to the realm of hela  but he let him keep on   wishing to know  as he said  what the old fellow was up to  presently  he  came to a dead halt     john had not the least notion where they were  but i knew the spot the  moment he began to describe it  by the removal of the peat on the side of  a slope  the skeleton of the hill had been a little exposed  and had for  a good many years been blasted for building stones  nothing was going on  in the quarry at present  above  it was rather a dangerous place  there  was a legend of man and horse having fallen into it  and both being  killed  john had never seen or heard of it     when his horse stopped  he became aware of an indefinite sensation which  inclined him to await the expected moon before attempting either to  advance or return  he thought afterward it might have been some feeling  of the stone about him  but at the time he took the place for an abrupt  natural dip of the surface of the moor  in the bottom of which might be a  pool  sturdy stood as still as if he had been part of the quarry  stood  as if never of himself would he move again     the light slowly grew  or rather  the darkness slowly thinned  all at  once john became aware that  some yards away from him  there was  something whitish  a moment  and it began to move like a flitting mist  through the darkness  the same instant sturdy began to pull his feet from  the ground  and move after the mist  which rose and rose until it came  for a second or two between john and the sky  it was a big white horse   with my uncle on his back  death and he  john concluded  were out on one  of their dark wanderings  his impulse  of course  was to follow them   but  as they went up the steep way  sturdy came down on his old knees   and john got off his back to let him recover himself the easier  when  they reached the level  where the moon  showing a blunt horn above the  horizon  made it possible to see a little  the white horse and his rider  had disappeared  in some shadow  or behind some knoll  i fancy  and john   having not the least notion in what part of the moor he was  or in which  direction he ought to go  threw the reins on the horse s neck  sturdy  brought him back almost to his stable  before he knew where he was  then  he turned into the road  for he had had enough of the moor  and took the  long way home           chapter xxix       mother and son     in the morning he breakfasted alone  a son with a different sort of  mother  might then have sought her in her bedroom  but john had never  within his memory seen his mother in her bedroom  and after what lie had  heard the night before  could hardly be inclined to go there to her now   within half an hour  however  a message was brought him  requesting his  presence in her ladyship s dressing room     he went with his teeth set      whose horse is that in the stable  john   she said  the moment their  eyes met      mr  whichcote s  madam   answered john   mother  he could not say      you intend to keep up your late relations with those persons       i do       you mean to marry the hussy       i mean to marry the lady to whom you give that epithet  there are those  who think it not quite safe for you to call other people names      she rose and came at him as if she would strike him  john stood  motionless  except a woman had a knife in her hand  he said  he would not  even avoid a blow from her   a woman can t hurt you much  she can only  break your heart   he said   my mother would not know a heart when she  had broken it   he added     he stood and looked at her     she turned away  and sat down again  i think she felt the term of her  power at hand      the man told you then  that  if you did not return immediately  i would  get him into trouble       he has told me nothing  i have not seen him for some days  i have been  to london       you should have contrived your story better  you contradict yourself       i am not aware that i do       you have the man s horse       his horse is in my stable  he is not himself at home       fled from justice  it shall not avail him       it may avail you though  madam  it is sometimes prudent to let well  alone  may i not suggest that a hostile attempt on your part  might lead  to awkward revelations       ah  where could the seed of slander find fitter soil than the heart of a  son with whom the prayer of his mother is powerless      to all appearance she had thoroughly regained her composure  and looked  at him with a quite artistic reproach      the prayer of a mother that never prayed in her life   returned john      of a woman that never had an anxiety but for herself   i don t believe  you are my mother  if i was born of you  there must have been some  juggling with my soul in antenatal regions  i disown you   cried john  with indignation that grew as he gave it issue     her face turned ashy white  but whether it was from conscience or fear   or only with rage  who could tell     she was silent for a moment  then again recovering herself        and what  pray  would you make of me   she said coolly   your slave       i would have you an honest woman  i would die for that   oh  mother   mother   he cried bitterly      that being apparently impossible  what else does my dutiful son demand  of his mother       that she should leave me unmolested in my choice of a wife  it does not  seem to me an unreasonable demand       nor does it seem to me an unreasonable reply  that any mother would  object to her son s marrying a girl whose father she could throw into a  felon s prison with a word       that the girl does not happen to be the daughter of the gentleman you  mean  signifies nothing  i am very willing she should pass for such  but  take care  he is ready to meet whatever you have to say  he is not gone  for his own sake  but to be out of the way of our happiness  to prevent  you from blasting us with a public scandal  if you proceed in your  purpose  we shall marry at once  and make your scheme futile       how are you to live  pray       madam  that is my business   answered john      are you aware of the penalty on your marrying without my consent    pursued his mother      i am not  i do not believe there is any such penalty       you dare me       i do       marry  then  and take the consequences       if there were any  you would not thus warn me of them       john day  you are no gentleman       i shall not ask your definition of a gentleman  madam       your father was a clown       if my father were present  he would show himself a gentleman by making  you no answer  if you say a word more against him  i will leave the  room       i tell you your father was a clown and a fool  like yourself      john turned and went to the stable  had old sturdy saddled  and came to  me     on his way over the heath  he spent an hour trying to find the place  where he had been the night before  but without success  i presume that  sturdy  with his nose in that direction  preferred his stall  and did not  choose to find the quarry  as often as john left him to himself  he went  homeward  when john turned his head in another direction  he would set  out in that direction  but gradually work round for the farm     john told me all i have just set down  and then we talked      i have already begun to learn farming   i said      you are the right sort  orbie   returned john   i shall be glad to teach  you anything i know       if you will show me how a farmer keeps his books   i answered   that i  may understand the bailiff s  i shall be greatly obliged to you  as to  the dairy  and poultry yard  and that kind of thing  martha can teach me  as well as any       i ll do my best   said john      come along then  and have a talk with simmons  i feel as if i could bear  anything after what you saw last night  my uncle is not far off  he is  somewhere about with the rest of the angels            chapter xxx       once more  and yet again     from that hour i set myself to look after my uncle s affairs  it was the  only way to endure his absence  working for him  thinking what he would  like  trying to carry it out  referring every perplexity to him and  imagining his answer  he grew so much dearer to me  that his absence was  filled with hope  my heart being in it  i had soon learned enough of the  management to perceive where  in more than one quarter  improvement   generally in the way of saving  was possible  i do not mean by any  lowering of wages  my uncle would have conned me small thanks for such  improvement as that  neither was it long before i began to delight in the  feeling that i was in partnership with the powers of life  that i had to  do with the operation and government and preservation of things created   that i was doing a work to which i was set by the highest  that i was at  least a floor sweeper in the house of god  a servant for the good of his  world  existence had grown fuller and richer  i had come  like a toad out  of a rock  into a larger  therefore truer universe  in which i had work  to do that was wanted  had i not been thus expanded and strengthened  how  should i have patiently waited while hearing nothing of my uncle     it was not many days before john began to press me to let my uncle have  his way  where was the good any longer  he said  in our not being  married  but i could not endure the thought of being married without my  uncle  it would not seem real marriage without his giving me to my  husband  and when john was convinced that i could not be prevailed upon   i found him think the more of me because of my resolve  and my  persistency in it  for john was always reasonable  and that is more than  can be said of most men  some  indeed  who are reasonable enough with  men  are often unreasonable with women  if in course of time the  management of affairs be taken from men and given to women  which may god  for our sakes forbid  it will be because men have made it necessary by  their arrogance  but when they have been kept down long enough to learn  that they are not the lords of creation one bit more than the weakest  woman  i hope they will be allowed to take the lead again  lest women  should become what men were  and go strutting in their importance  only  the true man knows the true woman  only the true woman knows the true  man  the difficulty between men and women comes all from the prevailing  selfishness  that is  untruth  of both  who  while such is their  character  would be judge or divider between them  save one of their own  kind  when such ceases to be their character  they will call for no  umpire     john lived in his own house with his mother  but they did not meet  his  mother managed his affairs  to whose advantage i need hardly say  and  john helped me to manage my uncle s  to the advantage of all concerned   every morning he came to see me  and every night rode back to his worse  than dreary home  at my earnest request  he had a strong bolt put on his  bedroom door  the use of which he promised me never to neglect  at my  suggestion too  he let it be known that he had always a brace of loaded  pistols within his reach  and showed himself well practiced in shooting  with them  i feared much for john     after i no longer only believed  but knew the bailiff trustworthy  and  had got some few points in his management bettered  i ceased giving so  much attention to details  and allowed myself more time to read and walk  and ride with john  i laid myself out to make up to him  as much as ever  i could  for the miserable lack of any home life  at rising he had not  the least sense of comfort or even security  he could never tell what his  mother might not be plotting against him  he had a very strong close box  made for leander  and always locked him up in it at night  never allowing  one of the men there to touch him  the horse had all the attention any  master could desire  when  having locked his box behind him  he brought  him over to us in the morning     one lovely  cold day  in the month of march  with ice on some of the  pools  and the wind blowing from the north  i mounted zoe to meet john  midway on the moor  and had gone about two thirds of the distance  when i  saw him  as i thought  a long way to my right  and concluded he had not  expected me so soon  and had gone exploring  i turned aside therefore to  join him  but had gone only a few yards when  from some shift in a  shadow  or some change in his position with regard to the light  i saw  that the horse was not john s  it was a gray  or rather  a white horse   could the rider be my uncle  even at that distance i almost thought i  recognized him  it must indeed have been he john saw at the quarry  he  was not gone abroad  he had been all this long time lingering about the  place  lest ill should befall us   just like him   said my heart  as i  gave zoe the rein  and she sprang off at her best speed  but after riding  some distance  i lost sight of the horseman  whoever he was  and then saw  that  if i did not turn at once  i should not keep my appointment with  john  of course had i  believed  it was my uncle  i should have followed  and followed  and the incident would not have been worth mentioning  for  gray horses are not so uncommon that there might not be one upon the  heath at any moment  but for something more i saw the same night     it was bright moonlight  i had taken down a curtain of my window to mend   and the moon shone in so that i could not sleep  my thoughts were all  with my uncle  wondering what he was about  whether he was very dull   whether he wanted me much  whether he was going about paris  or haunting  the moor that stretched far into the distance from where i lay  perhaps  at that moment he was out there in the moonlight  would be there alone   in the cold  wide night  while i slept  the thought made me feel lonely  myself  one is indeed apt to feel lonely when sleepless  and as the moon  was having a night of it  or rather making a day of it  all alone with  herself  why should we not keep each other a little company  i rose  drew  the other curtain of my window aside  and looked out     i have said that the house lay on the slope of a hollow  from whichever  window of it you glanced  you saw the line of your private horizon either  close to you  or but a little way off  if you wanted an outlook  you must  climb  and then you were on the moor     from my window i could see the more distant edge of the hollow  looking  thitherward  i saw against the sky the shape of a man on horseback  not  for a moment could i doubt it was my uncle  the figure was plainly his   my heart seemed to stand still with awe  or was it with intensity of  gladness  perhaps every night he was thus near me while i slept  a  heavenly sentinel patrolling the house  the visible one of a whole camp  unseen  of horses of fire and chariots of fire  so entrancing was the  notion  that i stood there a little child  a mere incarnate love  the  tears running down my checks for very bliss     but presently my mood changed  what had befallen him  when first i saw  him  horse and man were standing still  and i noted nothing strange   blinded perhaps by the tears of my gladness  but presently they moved on   keeping so to the horizon line that it was plain my uncle s object was to  have the house full in view  and as thus they skirted the edge of heaven   oh  how changed he seemed  his tall figure hung bent over the pommel  his  neck drooped heavily  and the horse was so thin that i seemed to see   almost to feel his bones  poor thanatos  he looked tired to death  and i  fancied his bent knees quivering  each short slow step he took  ah  how  unlike the happy old horse that had been  i thought of death returning  home weary from the slaughter of many kings  and cast the thought away  i  thought of death returning home on the eve of the great dawn  worn with  his age long work  pleased that at last it was over  and no more need of  him  i kept that thought  along the sky line they held their slow way   toilsome through weakness  the rider with weary swing in the saddle  the  horse with long gray neck hanging low to his hoofs  as if picking his  path with purblind eyes  when his rider should collapse and fall from his  back  not a step further would he take  but stand there till he fell to  pieces     fancy gave way to reality  i woke up  called myself hard names  and  hurried on a few of my clothes  my blessed uncle out in the night and  weary to dissolution  and i at a window  contemplating him like a  picture  i was an evil  heartless brute     by the time i had my shoes on  and went again to the window  he had  passed out of its range  i ran to one on the stair that looked at right  angles to mine  he had not yet come within its field  i stood and waited   presently he appeared  crawling along  a gray mounted ghost  in the light  that so strangely befits lovers wandering in the may of hope  and the  wasted spectre no less  whose imagination of the past reveals him to the  eyes of men  for an instant i almost wished him dead and at rest  the  next i was out of the house  then up on the moor  looking eagerly this  way and that  poised on the swift feet of love  ready to spring to his  bosom  how i longed to lead him to his own warm bed  and watch by him as  he slept  while the great father kept watch over every heart in his  universe  i gazed and gazed  but nowhere could i see the death jaded  horseman     i bounded down the hill  through the wilderness and the dark alleys  and  hurried to the stable  trembling with haste i led zoe out  sprang on her  bare back  and darted off to scout the moor  not a man or a horse or a  live thing was to be seen in any direction  once more i all but concluded  i had looked on an apparition  was my uncle dead  had he come back thus  to let me know  and was he now gone home indeed  cold and disappointed  i  returned to bed  full of the conviction that i had seen my uncle  but  whether in the body or out of the body  i could not tell     when john came  the notion of my having been out alone on the moor in the  middle of the night  did not please him  he would have me promise not  again  for any vision or apparition whatever  to leave the house without  his company  but he could not persuade me  he asked what i would have  done  if  having overtaken the horseman  i had found neither my uncle nor  death  i told him i would have given zoe the use of her heels  when   that  horse would soon have seen the last of her  at the same time  he  was inclined to believe with me  that i had seen my uncle  his intended  proximity would account  he said  for his making no arrangement to hear  from me  and if he continued to haunt the moor in such fashion  we could  not fail to encounter him before long  in the meantime he thought it well  to show no sign of suspecting his neighbourhood     that i had seen my uncle  john was for a moment convinced when  the very  next day  having gone to wittenage  he saw thanatos carrying dr   southwell  my uncle s friend  on the other hand  thanatos looked very  much alive  and in lovely condition  the doctor would not confess to  knowing anything about my uncle  and expressed wonder that he had not yet  returned  but said he did not mind how long he had the loan of such a  horse     things went on as before for a while     john began again to press me to marry him  i think it was mainly   i am sure it was in part  that i might never again ride the midnight  moor   like a witch out on her own mischievous hook   as he had once  said  he knew that  if i caught sight of anything like my uncle anywhere   john or no john  i would go after it     there was another good reason  however  besides the absence of my uncle   for our not marrying  john was not yet of legal age  and who could tell  what might not lurk in his mother s threat  who could tell what such a  woman might not have prevailed on her husband to set down in his will  i  was ready enough to marry a poor man  but i was not ready to let my lover  become a poor man by marrying me a few months sooner  were we not happy  enough  seeing each other everyday  and mostly all day long  no doubt  people talked  but why not let them talk  the mind of the many is not the  mind of god  as to society  john called it an oyster of a divinity  he  argued  however  that probably my uncle was keeping close until he saw us  married  i answered that  if we were married  his mother would only be  the more eager to have her revenge on us all  and my uncle the more  careful of himself for our sakes  anyhow  i said  i would not consent to  be happier than we were  until we found him  the greater happiness i  would receive only from his hand           chapter xxxi       my uncle comes home     time went on  and it was now the depth of a cold  miserable winter  i  remember the day to which i have now come so well  it was a black day   there was such a thickness of snow in the air  that what light got  through had a lost look  it was almost more like a london fog than an  honest darkness of the atmosphere  bred in its own bounds  but while the  light lasted  the snow did not fall  i went about the house doing what i  could find to do  and wondering john did not come     his horse had again fallen lame  this time through an accident which made  it necessary for him to stay with the poor animal long after his usual  time of starting to come to me  when he did start  it was on foot  with  the short winter afternoon closing in  but he knew the moor by this time  nearly as well as i did     it was quite dark when he drew near the house  which he generally entered  through the wilderness and the garden  the snow had begun at last  and  was coming down in deliberate earnest  it would lie feet deep over the  moor before the morning  he was thinking what a dreary tramp home it  would be by the road  for the wind was threatening to wake  and in a  snow wind the moor was a place to be avoided  when he struck his foot  against something soft  in the path his own feet had worn to the  wilderness  and fell over it  a groan followed  and john rose with the  miserable feeling of having hurt some creature  dropping on his knees to  discover what it was  he found a man almost covered with snow  and nearly  insensible  he swept the snow off him  contrived to get him on his back   and brought him round to the door  for the fence would have been awkward  to cross with him  just as i began to be really uneasy at his prolonged  absence  there he was  with a man on his back apparently lifeless     i did not stop to stare or question  but made haste to help him  his  burden was slipping sideways  so we lowered it on a chair  and then  carried it between us into the kitchen  i holding the legs  the moment a  ray of light fell upon the face  i saw it was my uncle     i just saved myself from a scream  my heart stopped  then bumped as if it  would break through  i turned sick and cold  we laid him on the sofa  but  i still held on to the legs  i was half unconscious  martha set me on a  chair  and in a moment or two i came to myself  and was able to help her   she said never a word  but was quite collected  looking every now and  then in the face of her cousin with a doglike devotion  but never  stopping an instant to gaze  we got him some brandy first  then some hot  milk  and then some soup  he took a little of everything we offered him   we did not ask him a single question  but  the moment he revived  carried  him up the stair  and laid him in bed  once he cast his eyes about  and  gave a sigh as of relief to find himself in his own room  then went off  into a light doze  which  broken with starts and half wakings  lasted  until next day about noon  either john or martha or i was by his bedside  all the time  so that he should not wake without seeing one of us near  him     but the sad thing was  that  when he did wake  he did not seem to come to  himself  he never spoke  but just lay and looked out of his eyes  if  indeed it was more than his eyes that looked  if indeed  he  looked out  of them at all      he has overdone his strength   we said to each other   he has not been  taking care of himself   and then to have lain perhaps hours in the snow   it s a wonder he s alive       he s nothing but skin and bone   said martha   it will take weeks to get  him up again   and just look at his clothes  how ever did he come nigh  such  they re fit only for a beggar  they must have knocked him down and  stripped him   look at his poor boots   she said pitifully  taking up one  of them  and stroking it with her hand   he ll never recover it       he will   i said   here are three of us to give him of our life  he ll  soon be himself again  now that we have him      but my heart was like to break at the sad sight  i cannot put in words  what i felt      he would get well much quicker   said john   if only we could tell him  we were married       it will do just as well to invite him to the wedding   i answered      i do hope he will give you away   said martha      he will never give me away   i returned   but he will give me to john   and i will not have the wedding until he is able to do that       you are right   said john   and we mustn t ask him anything  or even  refer to anything  till he wants to hear      days went and came  and still he did not seem to know quite where he was   if he did know  he seemed so content with knowing it  that he did not  want to know anything more in heaven or earth  we grew very anxious about  him  he did not heed a word that dr  southwell said  his mind seemed as  exhausted as his body  the doctor justified john s resolve  saying he  must not be troubled with questions  or the least attempt to rouse his  memory     john was now almost constantly with us  one day i asked him whether his  mother took any notice of his being now so seldom home at night  he  answered she did not  and  but for being up to her ways  he would imagine  she knew nothing at all about his doings      what does she do herself all day long   i asked      goes over her books  i imagine   he answered   she knows the hour is at  hand when she must render account of her stewardship  and i suppose she  is getting ready to meet it   how  i would rather not conjecture  she  gives me no trouble now  and i have no wish to trouble her       have you no hope of ever being on filial terms with her again   i said      there can be few things more unlikely   he replied     i was a little troubled  notwithstanding my knowledge of her and my  feeling toward her  that he should regard a complete alienation from his  mother with such indifference  i could not  however  balance the account  between them  if she had a strong claim in the sole fact that she was his  mother  how much had she not injured him simply by not being lovable   love unpaid is the worst possible debt  and to make it impossible to pay  it  is the worst of wrongs     but  oh  what a heart oppression it was  that my uncle had returned so  different  we were glad to have him  but how gladly would we not have let  him go again to restore him to himself  even were it never more to rest  our eyes upon him in this world  dearly as i loved john  it seemed as if  nothing could make me happy while my uncle remained as he was  it was a  kind of cold despair to know him such impassable miles from me  i could  not get near him  i went about all day with a sense  not merely of loss   but of a loss that gnawed at me with a sickening pain  he never spoke  he  never said  little one  to me now  he never looked in my eyes as if he  loved me  he was very gentle  never complained  never even frowned  but  lay there with a dead question in his eyes  we feared his mind was  utterly gone     by degrees his health returned  but apparently neither his memory  nor  his interest in life  yet he had a far away look in his eyes  as if he  remembered something  and started and turned at every opening of the  door  as if he expected something  he took to wandering about the yard  and the stable and the cow house  would gaze for an hour at some animal  in its stall  would watch the men threshing the corn  or twisting  straw ropes  when dr  southwell sent back his horse  it was in great hope  that the sight of death would wake him up  that he would recognize his  old companion  jump on his back  and be well again  but my uncle only  looked at him with a faint admiration  went round him and examined him as  if he were a horse he thought of buying  then turned away and left him   death was troubled at his treatment of him  he on his part showed him all  the old attention  using every equine blandishment he knew  but having  met with no response  he too turned slowly away  and walked to his  stable  dr  southwell would gladly have bought him  but neither john nor  i would hear of parting with him  he was almost a portion of his master   my uncle might come to himself any moment  how could we look him in the  face if death was gone from us  besides  we loved the horse for his own  sake as well as my uncle s  and john would be but too glad to ride him     my uncle would wander over the house  up and down  but seemed to prefer  the little drawing room  i made it my special business to keep a good  fire there  he never went to the study  never opened the door in the  chimney corner  he very seldom spoke  and seldomer to me than to any  other  it  was  a dreary time  our very souls had longed for him back   and thus he came to us     sorely i wept over the change that had passed upon the good man  he must  have received some terrible shock  it was just as if his mother  john  said  had got hold of him  and put a knife in his heart  it was well   however  that he was not wandering about the heath  exposed to the  elements  and there was yet time for many a good thing to come  where one   must  wait  one  can  wait     john had to learn this  for  say what he would  the idea of marrying  while my uncle remained in such plight  was to me unendurable           chapter xxxii       twice two is one     the spring came  but brought little change in the condition of my uncle   in the month of may  dr  southwell advised our taking him abroad  when we  proposed it to him  he passed his hand wearily over his forehead  as if  he felt something wrong there  and gave us no reply  we made our  preparations  and when the day arrived  he did not object to go     we were an odd party  john and i  bachelor and spinster  my uncle  a  silent  moody man  who did whatever we asked him  and the still   open eyed martha moon  who  i sometimes think  understood more about it  all than any of us  i could talk a little french  john a good deal of  german  when we got to paris  we found my uncle considerably at home  there  when he cared to speak  he spoke like a native  and was never at a  loss for word or phrase     it was he  indeed  who took us to a quiet little hotel he knew  and when  we were comfortably settled in it  he began to take the lead in all our  plans  by degrees he assumed the care and guidance of the whole party   and so well did he carry out what he had silently  perhaps almost  unconsciously undertaken  that we conceived the greatest hopes of the  result to himself  a mind might lie quiescent so long as it was  ministered to  and hedged from cares and duties  but wake up when  something was required of it  no one would have thought anything amiss  with my uncle  that heard him giving his orders for the day  or acting  cicerone to the little company  there for his sake  though he did not  know it  how often john and i looked at each other  and how glad were our  hearts  my uncle was fast coming to himself  it was like watching the  dead grow alive     one day he proposed taking a carriage and a good pair of horses  and  driving to versailles to see the palace  we agreed  and all went well  i  had not  in my wildest dreams  imagined a place so grand and beautiful   we wandered about it for hours  and were just tired enough to begin  thinking with pleasure of the start homeward  when we found ourselves in  a very long  straight corridor  i was walking alone  a little ahead of  the rest  my uncle was coming along next  but a good way behind me  a few  paces behind my uncle  came john with martha  to whom he was more  scrupulously attentive than to myself     in front of me was a door  dividing the corridor in two  apparently  filled with plain plate glass  to break the draught without obscuring the  effect of the great length of the corridor  which stretched away as far  on the other side as we had come on this  i paused and stood aside   leaning against the wall to wait for my uncle  and gazing listlessly out  of a window opposite me  but as my uncle came nearer to open the door for  us  i happened to cast my eyes again upon it  and saw  as it seemed  my  uncle coming in the opposite direction  whence i concluded of course   that i had made a mistake  and that what i had taken for a clear plate of  glass  was a mirror  reflecting the corridor behind me  i looked back at  my uncle with a little anxiety  my reader may remember that  when he came  to fetch me from rising  the day after i was lost on the moor   encountering a mirror at unawares  he started and nearly fell  from this  occurrence  and from the absence of mirrors about the house  i had  imagined in his life some painful story connected with a mirror     once again i saw him start  and then stand like stone  almost immediately  a marvellous light overspread his countenance  and with a cry he bounded  forward  i looked again at the mirror  and there i saw the self same  light irradiated countenance coming straight  as was natural  to meet  that of which it was the reflection  then all at once the solid  foundations of fact seemed to melt into vaporous dream  for as i saw the  two figures come together  the one in the mirror  the other in the world   and was starting forward to prevent my uncle from shattering the mirror  and wounding himself  the figures fell into each other s arms  and i  heard two voices weeping and sobbing  as the substance and the shadow  embraced     two men had for a moment been deceived like myself  neither glass nor  mirror was there  only the frame from which a swing door had been  removed  they walked each into the arms of the other  whom they had at  first each taken for himself     they paused in their weeping  held each other at arm s length  and gazed  as in mute appeal for yet better assurance  then  smiling like two suns  from opposing rain clouds  fell again each on the other s neck  and wept  anew  neither had killed the other  neither had lost the other  the world  had been a graveyard  it was a paradise     we stood aside in reverence  martha moon s eyes glowed  but she  manifested no surprise  john and i stared in utter bewilderment  the two  embraced each other  kissed and hugged and patted each other  wept and  murmured and laughed  then all at once  with one great sigh between them   grew aware of witnesses  they were too happy to blush  yet indeed they  could not have blushed  so red were they with the fire of heaven s own  delight  utterly unembarrassed they turned toward us  and then came a  fresh astonishment  an old and new joy together out of the treasure of  the divine house holder  the uncle of the mirror  radiant with a joy such  as i had never before beheld upon human countenance  came straight to me   cried   ah  little one   took me in his arms  and embraced me with all  the old tenderness  then i knew that my own old uncle was the same as  ever i had known him  the same as when i used to go to sleep in his arms     the jubilation that followed  it is impossible for me to describe  and my  husband  who approves of all i have yet written  begs me not to attempt  an adumbration of it      it would be a pity   he says   to end a won race with a tumble down at  the post            chapter xxxiii       half one is one     i am going to give you the whole story  but not this moment  i want to  talk a little first  i need not say that i had twin uncles  they were but  one man to the world  to themselves only were they a veritable two  the  word  twin  means one of two that once were one  to  twin  means to   divide   they tell me  the opposite action is  of  twain  to make one   to me as well as the world  i believe  but for the close individual  contact of all my life with my uncle edward  the two would have been but  as one man  i hardly know that i felt any richer at first for having two  uncles  it was long before i should have felt much poorer for the loss of  uncle edmund  uncle edward was to me the substance of which uncle edmund  was the shadow  but at length i learned to love him dearly through  perceiving how dearly my own uncle loved him  i loved the one because he  was what he was  the other because he was not that one  creative love  commonly differentiates that it may unite  in the case of my uncles it  seemed only to have divided that it might unite  i am hardly intelligible  to myself  in my mind at least i have got into a bog of confused  metaphysics  out of which it is time i scrambled  what i would say is  this  that what made the world not care there should be two of them  made  the earth a heaven to those two  by their not being one  they were able  to love  and so were one  like twin planets they revolved around each  other  and in a common orbit around god their sun  it was a beautiful  thing to see how uncle edmund revived and expanded in the light of his  brother s presence  until he grew plainly himself  he had suffered more  than my own uncle  and had not had an orphan child to love and be loved  by     what a drive home that was  paris  anywhere seemed home now  i had john  and my uncles  john had me and my uncle  my uncles had each other  and i  suspect  if we could have looked into martha  we should have seen that  she  through her lovely unselfishness  possessed us all more than any one  of us another  oh the outbursts of gladness on the way   the talks   the  silences  the past fell off like an ugly veil from the true face of  things  the present was sunshine  the future a rosy cloud     when we reached our hotel  it was dinner time  and john ordered  champagne  he and i were hungry as two happy children  the brothers ate  little  and scarcely drank  they were too full of each other to have room  for any animal need  a strange solemnity crowned and dominated their  gladness  each was to the other a lazarus given back from the grave  but  to understand the depth of their rapture  you must know their story  that  of martha and mary and lazarus could not have equalled it but for the  presence of the master  for neither sisters nor brother had done each  other any wrong  they looked to me like men walking in a luminous mist  a  mist of unspeakable suffering radiant with a joy as unspeakable  the very  stuff to fashion into glorious dreams     when we drew round the fire  for the evenings were chilly  they laid  their whole history open to us  what a tale it was  and what a telling of  it  my own uncle  edward  was the principal narrator  but was  occasionally helped out by my newer uncle  edmund  i had the story  already  my reader will remember  in my uncle s writing  at home  when we  returned i read it  not with the same absorption as if it had come first   but with as much interest  and certainly with the more thorough  comprehension that i had listened to it before  that same written story i  shall presently give  supplemented by what  necessarily  my uncle edmund  had to supply  and with some elucidation from the spoken narrative of my  uncle edward     as the story proceeded  overcome with the horror of the revelation i  foresaw  i forgot myself  and cried out       and that woman is john s mother       whose mother   asked uncle edmund  with scornful curiosity      john day s   i answered      it cannot be   he cried  blazing up   are you sure of it       i have always been given so to understand   replied john for me   but i  am by no means sure of it  i have doubted it a thousand times       no wonder  then we may go on  but  indeed  to believe you her son  would  be to doubt you  i  don t  believe it       you could not help doubting me   responded john     i might be true   though  even if i were her son   he added      ed   said edmund to edward   let us lay our heads together       ready ed   said edward to edmund     thereupon they began comparing memories and recollections   to find   however  that they had by no means data enough  one thing was clear to  me  that nothing would be too bad for them to believe of her      she would pick out the eye of a corpse if she thought a sovereign lay  behind it   said uncle edmund      to have the turning over of his rents     said uncle edward  and checked  himself      yes  it would be just one of her devil tricks   agreed uncle edmund      i beg your pardon  john   said uncle edward  as if it were he that had  used the phrase  and uncle edmund nodded to john  as if he had himself  made the apology     john said nothing  his eyes looked wild with hope  he felt like one who   having been taught that he is a child of the devil  begins to know that  god is his father  the one discovery worth making by son of man     then  at my request  they went on with their story  which i had  interrupted     when it was at length all poured out  and the last drops shaken from the  memory of each  there fell a long silence  which my own uncle broke      when shall we start  ed   he said      to morrow  ed       this business of john s must come first  ed       it shall  ed       you know where you were born  john       on my father s estate of rubworth in gloucestershire  i  believe    answered john      you must be prepared for the worst  you know       i am prepared  as orba told me once  god is my father  whoever my mother  may be       that s right  hold by that   said my uncles  as with one breath      do you know the year you were born   asked uncle edmund      my  mother  says i was born in            you have not seen the entry       no  one does not naturally doubt such statements       assuredly not  until    he paused     how uncle edmund had regained his wits  and how young the brothers  looked      you mean   said john   until he has known my mother      now for the story of my twin uncles  mainly as written by my uncle  edward           chapter xxxiv       the story of my twin uncles      my brother and i were marvellously like  very few of our friends  none  of them with certainty  could name either of us apart  or even together   only two persons knew absolutely which either of us was  and those two  were ourselves  our mother certainly did not  at least without seeing one  or other of our backs  even we ourselves have each made the blunder  occasionally of calling the other by the wrong name  our  indistinguishableness was the source of ever recurring mistake  of  constant amusement  of frequent bewilderment  and sometimes of annoyance  in the family  i once heard my father say to a friend  that god had never  made two things alike  except his twins  we two enjoyed the fun of it so  much  that we did our best to increase the confusions resulting from our  resemblance  we did not lie  but we dodged and pretended  questioned and  looked mysterious  till i verily believe the person concerned  having in  himself so vague an idea of our individuality  not unfrequently forgot  which he had blamed  or which he had wanted  and became hopelessly  muddled      a man might well have started the question what good could lie in the  existence of a duality in which the appearance was  if not exactly  yet  so nearly identical  that no one but my brother or myself could have  pointed out definite differences  but it could have been started only by  an outsider  my brother and i had no doubt concerning the advantage of a  duality in which each was the other s double  the fact was to us a never  ceasing source of delight  each seemed to the other created such   expressly that he might love him as a special  individual property of his  own  it was as if the image of narcissus had risen bodily out of the  watery mirror  to be what it had before but seemed  it was as if we had  been made two  that each might love himself  and yet not be selfish      we were almost always together  but sometimes we got into individual  scrapes  when  which will appear to some incredible  the one accused  always accepted punishment without denial or subterfuge or attempt to  perplex  it was all one which was the culprit  and which should be the  sufferer  nor did this indistinction work badly  that the other was just  as likely to suffer as the doer of the wrong  wrought rather as a  deterrent  the mode of behaviour may have had its origin in the  instinctive perception of the impossibility of proving innocence  but had  we  loving as we did  been capable of truthfully accusing each other  i  think we should have been capable of lying also  the delight of existence  lay  embodied and objective to each  in the existence of the other      at school we learned the same things  and only long after did any  differences in taste begin to develop themselves      our brother  elder by five years  who would succeed to the property  had  the education my father thought would best fit him for the management of  land  we twins were trained to be lawyer and doctor  i the doctor      we went to college together  and shared the same rooms      having finished our separate courses  our father sent us to a german  university  he would not have us insular      there we did not work hard  nor was hard work required of us  we went  out a good deal in the evenings  for the students that lived at home in  the town were hospitable  we seemed to be rather popular  owing probably  to our singular likeness  which we found was regarded as a serious  disadvantage  the reason of this opinion we never could find  flattering  ourselves indeed that what it typified gave us each double the base and  double the strength      we had all our friends in common  every friend to one of us was a friend  to both  if one met man or woman he was pleased with  he never rested  until the other knew that man or woman also  our delight in our friends  must have been greater than that of other men  because of the constant  sharing      our all but identity of form  our inseparability  our unanimity  and our  mutual devotion  were often  although we did not know it  a subject of  talk in the social gatherings of the place  it was more than once or  twice openly mooted  what  in the chances of life  would be likeliest to  strain the bond that united us  not a few agreed that a terrible  catastrophe might almost be expected from what they considered such an  unnatural relation      i think you must already be able to foresee from what the first  difference between us would arise  discord itself was rooted in the very  unison  for unison it was  not harmony  of our tastes and instincts  and  will now begin to understand why it was so difficult  indeed impossible  for me  not to have a secret from my little one      among the persons we met in the home circles of our fellow students   appeared by and by an english lady  a young widow  they said  though  little in her dress or carriage suggested widowhood  we met her again and  again  each thought her the most beautiful woman he had ever seen  but  neither was much interested in her at first  nor do i believe either  would  of himself  ever have been  our likings and dislikings always  hitherto had gone together  and  left to themselves  would have done so  always  i believe  whence it seems probable that  left to ourselves  we  should also have found  when required  a common strength of abnegation   but in the present case  our feelings were not left to themselves  the  lady gave the initiative  and the dividing regard was born in the one   and had time to establish itself  ere the provoking influence was brought  to bear on the other      within the last few years i have had a visit from an old companion of  the period  i daresay you will remember the german gentleman who amused  you with the funny way in which he pronounced certain words  one of the  truest hearted and truest tongued men i have ever known  he gave me much  unexpected insight into the evil affair  he had learned certain things  from a sister  the knowledge of which  old as the story they concerned by  that time was  chiefly moved his coming to england to find me      one evening  he told me  when a number of the ladies we were in the  habit of meeting happened to be together without any gentleman present   the talk turned  half in a philosophical  half in a gossipy spirit  upon  the consequences that might follow  should two men  bound in such strange  fashion as my brother and i  fall in love with the same woman  a thing  not merely possible  but to be expected  the talk  my friend said  was  full of a certain speculative sort of metaphysics which  in the present  state of human development  is far from healthy  both because of our  incompleteness  and because we are too near to what we seem to know  to  judge it aright  one lady was present  a lady by us more admired and  trusted than any of the rest  who alone declared a conviction that love  of no woman would ever separate us  provided the one fell in love first   and the other knew the fact before he saw the lady  for  she said  no  jealousy would in that case be roused  and the relation of the brother to  his brother and sister would be so close as to satisfy his heart  in a  few days probably he too would fall in love  and his lady in like manner  be received by his brother  when they would form a square impregnable  to attack  the theory was a good one  and worthy of realization  but   alas  the prince of the power of the air was already present in force   in the heart of the english widow  young in years  but old in pride  and self confidence  she smiled at the notion of our advocate  she said  that the idea of any such friendship between men was nonsense  that she  knew more about men than some present could be expected to know  their  love was but a matter of custom and use  the moment self took part in  the play  it would burst  it was but a bubble company  as for love  proper  she meant the love between man and woman  its law was the  opposite to that of friendship  its birth and continuance depended on the  parties  not  getting accustomed to each other  the less they knew each  other  the more they would love each other      upon this followed much confused talk  during which the english lady  declared nothing easier than to prove friendship  or the love of  brothers  the kind of thing she had said      most of the company believed the young widow but talking to show off   while not a few felt that they desired no nearer acquaintance with one  whose words  whatever might be her thoughts  degraded humanity  the  circle was very speedily broken into two segments  one that liked the  english lady  and one that almost hated her      from that moment  the english widow set before her the devil victory of  alienating two hearts that loved each other  and she gained it for a  time  until death proved stronger than the devil  people said we could  not be parted   she  would part us  she began with my brother  to tell  how i know that she began with him  i should have to tell how she began  with me  and that i cannot do  for  little one  i dare not let the tale  of the treacheries of a bad woman toward an unsuspecting youth  enter  your ears  suffice it to say  such a woman has well studied those regions  of a man s nature into which  being less divine  the devil in her can  easier find entrance  there  she knows him better than he knows himself   and makes use of her knowledge  not to elevate  but to degrade him  she  fills him with herself  and her animal influences  she gets into his  self consciousness beside himself  by means of his self love  through the  ever open funnel of his self greed  she pours in flattery  by  depreciation of others  she hints admiration of himself  by the slightest  motion of a finger  of an eyelid  of her person  she will pay him a  homage of which first he cannot  then he will not  then he dares not  doubt the truth  not such a woman only  but almost any silly woman  may  speedily make the most ordinary  and hitherto modest youth  imagine  himself the peak of creation  the triumph of the deity  no man alive is  beyond the danger of imagining himself exceptional among men  if such as  think well of themselves were right in so doing  truly the world were ill  worth god s making  he is the wisest who has learned to  be naught  awhile   the silly soul becomes so full of his tempter  and of himself in  and through her  that he loses interest in all else  cares for nobody but  her  prizes nothing but her regard  broods upon nothing but her favours   looks forward to nothing but again her presence and further favours  god  is nowhere  fellow man in the way like a buzzing fly  else no more to be  regarded than a speck of dust neither upon his person nor his garment   and this terrible disintegration of life rises out of the most wonderful   mysterious  beautiful  and profound relation in humanity  its roots go  down into the very deeps of god  and out of its foliage creeps the old  serpent  and the worm that never dies  out of it steams the horror of  corruption  wrapt in whose living death a man cries out that god himself  can do nothing for him  it is but the natural result of his making the  loveliest of god s gifts into his god  and worshipping and serving the  creature more than the creator  oh my child  it is a terrible thing to  be  except he knows god the saviour  man stands face to face with a  torturing enigma  hopeless of solution      the woman sought and found the enemy  my false self  in the house of my  life  to that she gave herself  as if she gave herself to me  oh  how she  made me love her   if that be love which is a deification of self  the  foul worship of one s own paltry being   and that when most it seems  swallowed up and lost  no  it is not love  does love make ashamed  the  memories of it may be full of pain  but can the soul ever turn from love  with sick contempt  that which at length is loathed  can never have been  loved      of my brother she would speak as of a poor creature not for a moment to  be compared with myself  how i could have believed her true when she  spoke thus  knowing that in the mirror i could not have told myself from  my brother  knowing also that our minds  tastes  and faculties bore as  strong a resemblance as our bodies  i cannot tell  but she fooled me to a  fool through the indwelling folly of my self love  at other times   wishing to tighten the bonds of my thraldom that she might the better  work her evil end  proving herself a powerful devil  she would rouse my  jealousy by some sign of strong admiration of edmund  she must have acted  the same way with my brother  i saw him enslaved just as i  knew we were  faring alike  knew the very thoughts as well as feelings in his heart   and instead of being consumed with sorrow  chuckled at the  knowledge   that  i  was the favoured one  i suspect now that she showed him more  favour than myself  and taught him to put on the look of the hopeless  one  i fancied i caught at times a covert flash in his eye  he knew what  he knew  if so  poor edmund  thou hadst the worst of it every way      shall i ever get her kisses off my lips  her poison out of my brain   from my heart  her image was burned in a moment  as utterly as if by  years of hell      the estrangement between us was sudden  there were degrees only in the  widening of it  first came embarrassment at meeting  then all commerce of  wish  thought  and speculation  ended  there was no more merrymaking  jugglery with identity  each was himself only  and for himself alone   gone was all brother gladness  we avoided each other more and more  when  we must meet  we made haste to part  heaven was gone from home  each yet  felt the same way toward the other  but it was the way of repelling  not  drawing  when we passed in the street  it was with a look that said  or  at least meant   you are my brother  i don t want you   we ceased even to  nod to each other  still in our separation we could not separate  each  took a room in another part of the town  but under the same pseudonym   our common lodging was first deserted  then formally given up by each   always what one did  that did the other  though no longer intending to  act in consort with him  he could not help it though he tried  for the  other tried also  and did the same thing  one of us might for months have  played the part of both without detection  especially if it had been  understood that we had parted company  but i think it was never  suspected  although now we were rarely for a moment together  and still  more rarely spoke  a few weeks sufficed to bring us to the verge of  madness      to this day i doubt if the woman  our common disease  knew the one of us  from the other  that in any part of her being there was the least  approach to a genuine womanly interest in either of us  i do not believe   i am very sure she never cared for me  preference i cannot think  possible  she could not  it seems to me  have felt anything for one of us  without feeling the same for both  i do not see how  with all she knew of  us  we could have made two impressions upon her moral sensorium      it was at length the height of summer  and every one sought change of  scene and air  it was time for us to go home  but i wrote to my father   and got longer leave       i wrote too   interposed my uncle edmund at this point of the story   when my own uncle was telling it that evening in paris      the day after the date of his answer to my letter  my father died  but  edmund and i were already on our way  by different routes  to the  mountain village whither the lady had preceded us  and having  in our  infatuation  left no address  my brother never saw the letter announcing  our loss  and i not for months      a few weeks more  and our elder brother  who had always been delicate   followed our father  this also remained for a time unknown to me  my  mother had died many years before  and we had now scarce a relation in  the world  martha moon is the nearest relative you and i have  besides  her and you  there were left therefore of the family but myself and your  uncle edmund  both absorbed in the same worthless woman      at the village there were two hostelries  i thought my brother would go  to the better  he thought i would go to the better  so we met at the  worse  i remember a sort of grin on his face when we saw each other  and  have no doubt the same grin was on mine  we always did the same thing   just as of old  the next morning we set out  i need hardly say each by  himself  to find the lady      she had rented a small chalet on the banks of a swift mountain stream   and thither  for a week or so  we went every day  often encountering  the  efforts we made to avoid each other being similar and simultaneous  they  oftener resulted in our meeting  when one did nothing  the other  generally did nothing also  and when one schemed  the other also schemed   and similarly  thus what had been the greatest pleasure of our peculiar  relation  our mental and moral resemblance  namely  became a large factor  in our mutual hate  for with self loathing shame  and a misery that makes  me curse the day i was born  i confess that for a time i hated the  brother of my heart  and i have but too good ground for believing that he  also hated me       i did  i did   cried uncle edmund  when my own uncle  in his verbal  narrative  mentioned his belief that his brother hated him  whereupon  uncle edward turned to me  saying       is it not terrible  my little one  that out of a passion called by the  same name with that which binds you and john day  the hellish smoke of  such a hate should arise  god must understand it  that is a comfort  in  vain i seek to sound it  even then i knew that i dwelt in an evil house   amid the highest of such hopes as the woman roused in me  i scented the  vapours of the pit  i was haunted by the dim shape of the coming hour  when i should hate the woman that enthralled me  more than ever i had  loved her  the greater sinner i am  that i yet yielded her dominion over  me  i was the willing slave of a woman who sought nothing but the  consciousness of power  who  to the indulgence of that vilest of  passions  would sacrifice the lives  the loves  the very souls of men   she lived to separate  where jesus died to make one  how weak and  unworthy was i to be caught in her snares  how wicked and vile not to  tear myself loose  the woman whose touch would defile the pharisee  is  pure beside such a woman      i return to his manuscript      the lady must have had plenty of money  and she loved company and show   i cannot but think  therefore  that she had her design in choosing such a  solitary place  its loveliness would subserve her intent of enthralling  thoroughly heart and soul and brain of the fools she had in her toils  i  doubt  however  if the fools were alive to any beauty but hers  if they  were not dead to the wavings of god s garment about them  was i ever  truly aware of the presence of those peaks that dwelt alone with their  whiteness in the desert of the sky  awfully alone  of the world  but not  with the world  i think we saw nothing save with our bodily eyes  and  very little with them  for we were blinded by a passion fitter to wander  the halls of eblis  than the palaces of god      the chalet stood in a little valley  high in the mountains  whose  surface was gently undulating  with here and there the rocks breaking  through its rich flowering meadows  down the middle of it ran the deep  swift stream  swift with the weight of its fullness  as well as the steep  slope of its descent  it was not more than seven or eight feet across   but a great body of water went rushing along its deep course  about a  quarter of a mile from the chalet  it reached the first of a series of  falls of moderate height and slope  after which it divided into a number  of channels  mostly shallow  in a wide pebbly torrent bed  these  a  little lower down  reunited into a narrower and yet swifter stream  a  small fierce river  which presently  at one reckless bound  shot into the  air  to tumble to a valley a thousand feet below  shattered into spray as  it fell      the chalet stood alone  the village was at no great distance  but not a  house was visible from any of its windows  it had no garden  the meadow   one blaze of colour  softened by the green of the mingling grass  came up  to its wooden walls  and stretched from them down to the rocky bank of  the river  in many parts to the very water s edge  the chalet stood like  a yellow rock in a green sea  the meadow was the drawing room where the  lady generally received us      one lovely evening  i strolled out of the hostelry  and went walking up  the road that led to the village of auerbach  so named from the stream  and the meadow i have described  the moon was up  and promised the  loveliest night  i was in no haste  for the lady had  in our common  hearing  said  she was going to pass that night with a friend  in a town  some ten miles away  i dawdled along therefore  thinking only to greet  the place  walk with the stream  and lie in the meadow  sacred with the  shadow of her demonian presence  quit of the restless hope of seeing her   i found myself taking some little pleasure in the things about me  and  spent two hours on the way  amid the sound of rushing water  now  swelling  now sinking  all the time      it had not crossed me to wonder where my brother might be  i banished  the thought of him as often as it intruded  not able to help meeting  we  had almost given up avoiding each other  but when we met  our desire was  to part  i do not know that  apart  we had ever yet felt actual hate   either to the other      the road led through the village  it was asleep  i remember a gleam in  just one of the houses  the moonlight seemed to have drowned all the  lamps of the world  i came to the stream  rushing cold from its far off  glacier mother  crossed it  and went down the bank opposite the chalet  i  had taken a fancy to see it from that side  glittering and glancing under  the moon  the wild little river rushed joyous to its fearful fall  a  short distance away  it was even now falling  falling from off the face  of the world  this moment it was falling from my very feet into the  void  falling  falling  unupheld  down  down  through the moonlight  to  the ghastly rock foot below      the chalet seemed deserted  with the same woefully desolate look  it  constantly comes back in my dreams  i went farther down the valley  the  full rushing stream went with me like a dog  it made no murmur  only a  low gurgle as it shot along  it seemed to draw me with it to its last  leap  as i looked at its swiftness  i thought how hard it would be to get  out of  the swiftness of it comes to me yet in my dreams      i came to a familiar rock  which  part of the bank whereon i walked   rose some six or seven feet above the meadow  just opposite a little  hollow where the lady oftenest sat  two were on the grass together  one a  lady seated  the other a man  with his head in the lady s lap  i gave a  leap as if a bullet had gone through my heart  then instinctively drew  back behind the rock  there i came to myself  and began to take courage   she had gone away for the night  it could not be she  i peeped  the man  had raised his head  and was leaning on his elbow  it was edmund  i was  certain  she stooped and kissed him  i scrambled to the top of the rock   and sprang across the stream  which ran below me like a flooded millrace   would to god i had missed the bank  and been swept to the great fall  i  was careless  and when i lighted  i fell  her clear mocking laugh rang  through the air  and echoed from the scoop of some still mountain  when i  rose  they were on their feet       quite a chamois spring   remarked the lady with derision      she saw the last moment was come  neither of us two spoke       i told you   she said   neither of you was to trouble me to night  you  have paid no regard to my wish for quiet  it is time the foolery should  end  i am weary of it  a woman cannot marry a double man  or half a man  either  without at least being able to tell which is which of the two  halves       she ended with a toneless laugh  in which my brother joined  she turned  upon him with a pitiless mockery which  i see now  must have left in his  mind the conviction that she had been but making game of him  while i  never doubted myself the dupe  not once had she received me as i now saw  her  though the night was warm  her deshabille was yet a somewhat  prodigal unmasking of her beauty to the moon  the conviction in each of  us was  that she and the other were laughing at him      we locked in a deadly struggle  with what object i cannot tell  i do not  believe either of us had an object  it was a mere blind conflict of  pointless enmity  in which each cared but to overpower the other  which  first laid hold  which  if either  began to drag  i have not a suspicion   the next thing i know is  we were in the water  each in the grasp of the  other  now rolling  now sweeping  now tumbling along  in deadly embrace      the shock of the ice cold water  and the sense of our danger  brought me  to myself  i let my brother go  but he clutched me still  down we shot  together toward the sheer descent  already we seemed falling  the terror  of it over mastered me  it was not the crash i feared  but the stayless  rush through the whistling emptiness  in the agony of my despair  i  pushed him from me with all my strength  striking at him a fierce  wild   aimless blow  the only blow struck in the wrestle  his hold relaxed  i  remember nothing more      at this point of the verbal narrative  my uncle edmund again spoke      you never struck me  ed   he cried   or if you did  i was already  senseless  i remember nothing of the water       when i came to myself   the manuscript goes on   i was lying in a pebbly  shoal  the moon was aloft in heaven  i was cold to the heart  cold to the  marrow of my bones  i could move neither hand nor foot  and thought i was  dead  by slow degrees a little power came back  and i managed at length   after much agonizing effort  to get up on my feet  only to fall again   after several such failures  i found myself capable of dragging myself  along like a serpent  and so got out of the water  and on the next  endeavour was able to stand  i had forgotten everything  but when my eyes  fell on the darting torrent  i remembered all  not as a fact  but as a  terrible dream from which i thanked heaven i had come awake      but as i tottered along  i came slowly to myself  and a fearful doubt  awoke  if it was a dream  where had i dreamt it  how had i come to wake  where i found myself  how had the dream turned real about me  where was i  last in my remembrance  where was my brother  where was the lady in the  moonlight  no  it was not a dream  if my brother had not got out of the  water  i was his murderer  i had struck him   oh  the horror of it  if  only i could stop dreaming it  three times almost every night      again uncle edmund interposed  not altogether logically      i tell you  i don t believe you struck me  ed  and you must remember   neither of us would have got out if you hadn t       you might have let me go   said the other      on the way down the degenfall  perhaps   rejoined uncle edmund     i  believe it was that blow brought me to my senses  and made me get out       thank you  ed   said uncle edward     once more i write from the manuscript      i said to myself he  must  have got out  it could not be that i had  drowned my own brother  such a ghastly thing could not have been  permitted  it was too terrible to be possible      how  then  had we been living the last few months  what brothers had we  been  had we been loving one another  had i been a neighbour to my  nearest  had i been a brother to my twin  was not murder the natural  outcome of it all  he that loveth not his brother is a murderer  if so   where the good of saving me from being in deed what i was in nature  i  had cast off my brother for a treacherous woman  my very thought sickened  within me      my soul seemed to grow luminous  and understand everything  i saw my  whole behaviour as it was  the scales fell from my inward eyes  and there  came a sudden  total  and absolute revulsion in my conscious self  like  what takes place  i presume  at the day of judgment  when the god in  every man sits in judgment upon the man  had the gate of heaven stood  wide open  neither angel with flaming sword  nor peter with the keys to  dispute my entrance  i would have turned away from it  and sought the  deepest hell  i loathed the woman and myself  in my heart the sealed  fountain of old affection had broken out  and flooded it      all the time this thinking went on  i was crawling slowly up the endless  river toward the chalet  driven by a hope inconsistent with what i knew  of my brother  what i felt  he  if he were alive  must be feeling also   how then could i say to myself that i should find him with her  it was  the last dying hope that i had not killed him that thus fooled me   she  will be warming him in her bosom   i said  but at the very touch  the  idea turned and presented its opposite pole   good god   i cried in my  heart   how shall i compass his deliverance  better he lay at the bottom  of the fall  than lived to be devoured by that serpent of hell  i will go  straight to the den of the monster  and demand my brother       but to see the eyes of uncle edmund at this point of the story      at last i approached the chalet  all was still  a handkerchief lay on  the grass  white in the moonlight  i went up to it  hoping to find it my  brother s  it was the lady s  i flung it from me like a filthy rag      what was the passion worth which in a moment could die so utterly      i turned to the house  i would tear him from her  he was mine  not hers      my wits were nigh gone  i thought the moonlight was dissolving the  chalet  that the two within might escape me  i held it fast with my eyes   the moon drew back  she only possessed and filled it  no  the moon was  too pure  she but shone reflected from the windows  she would not go in    i  would go in  i was justice  the woman was a thief  she had broken  into the house of life  and was stealing      i stood for a moment looking up at her window  there was neither motion  nor sound  was she gone away  and my brother with her  could she be in  bed and asleep  after seeing us swept down the river to the degenfall   could he be with her and at rest  believing me dashed to pieces  i must  be resolved  the door was not bolted  i stole up the stair to her  chamber  the door of it was wide open  i entered  and stood  the moon  filled the tiny room with a clear  sharp edged  pale yellow light  she  lay asleep  lovely to look at as an angel of god  her hair  part of it  thrown across the top rail of the little iron bed  streamed out on each  side over the pillow  and in the midst of it lay her face  a radiant isle  in a dark sea  i stood and gazed  fascinated by her beauty  god forbid  i  was fascinated by the awful incongruity between that face  pure as the  moonlight  and the charnel house that lay unseen behind it  she was to  me  henceforth  not a woman  but a live death  i had no sense of  sacredness  such as always in the chamber even of a little girl  how  should i  it was no chamber  it was a den  she was no woman  but a female  monster  i stood and gazed      my presence was more potent than i knew  she opened her eyes  opened  them straight into mine  all the colour sank away out of her face  and it  stiffened to that of a corpse  with the staring eyes of one strangled   she lay as motionless as i stood  i moved not an inch  spoke not a word   drew not a step nearer  retreated not a hair s breadth  motion was taken  from me  was it hate that fixed my eyes on hers  and turned my limbs into  marble  it certainly was not love  but neither was it hate      agony had been burrowing in me like a mole  the half of what i felt i  have not told you  i came to find my brother  and found only  in a sweet  sleep  the woman who had just killed him  the bewilderment  of it all   with my long insensibility and wet garments  had taken from me either the  power of motion or of volition  i do not know which  speechless in the  moonlight  i must have looked to the wretched woman both ghostly and  ghastly      two or three long moments she gazed with those horror struck eyes  then  a frightful shriek broke from her drawn  death like lips  she who could  sleep after turning love into hate  life into death  would have fled into  hell to escape the eyes of the dead  insensibility is not courage  wake  in the scornfullest mortal the conviction that one of the disembodied  stands before him  and he will shiver like an aspen leaf  scream followed  scream  volition or strength  whichever it was that had left me   returned  i backed from the room  went noiseless from the house  and  fled  as if she had been the ghost  and i the mortal  would i had been  the spectre for which she took me      here uncle edward again spoke      small wonder she screamed  the wretch   he cried   that was her second  dose of the horrible that night  you found the door unbolted because i  had been there before you  i too entered her room  and saw her asleep as  you describe  i went close to her bedside  and cried out   where is my  brother   she woke  and fainted  and i left her       then   said i   when she came to herself  thinking she had had a bad  dream  she rearranged her hair  and went to sleep again       just so  i daresay  little one   answered uncle edward      i had not yet begun to think what i should do  when i found myself at  our little inn   the manuscript continues   no idea of danger to myself  awoke in my mind  nor was there any cause to heed such an idea  had it  come  nobody there knew the one from the other of us  not many would know  there were two of us  any one who saw me twice  might well think he had  seen us both  if my brother s body were found in the valley stream  it  was not likely to be recognized  or to be indeed recognizable  the only  one who could tell what happened at the top of the fall  would hardly  volunteer information  but  while i knew myself my brother s murderer  i  thought no more of these sheltering facts than i did of danger  i made it  no secret that my brother had gone over the fall  i went to the foot of  the cataract  thence to search and inquire all down the stream  but no  one had heard of any dead body being found  they told me that the poor  gentleman must  before morning  have been far on his way to the danube      giving up the quest in despair  i resigned myself to a torture which has  hitherto come no nearer expending itself than the consuming fire of god      i dared not carry home the terrible news  which must either involve me  in lying  or elicit such confession as would multiply tenfold my father s  anguish  and was in utter perplexity what to do  when it occurred to me  that i ought to inquire after letters at the lodging where last we had  lived together  then first i learned that both my father and my elder  brother  your father  little one  were dead      the sense of guilt had not destroyed in me the sense of duty  i did not  care what became of the property  but i did care for my brother s child   and the interests of her succession      your father had all his life been delicate  and had suffered not a  little  when your mother died  about a year after their marriage  leaving  us you  it soon grew plain to see that  while he loved you dearly  and  was yet more friendly to all about him than before  his heart had given  up the world  when i knew he was gone  i shed more tears over him than i  had yet shed over my twin  the worm that never dies made my brain too hot  to weep much for edmund  then first i saw that my elder brother had been  a brother indeed  and that we twins had never been real to each other  i  saw what nothing but self loathing would ever have brought me to see   that my love to edmund had not been profound  while a man is himself  shallow  how should his love be deep  i saw that we had each loved our  elder brother in a truer and better fashion than we had loved each other   one of the chief active bonds between us had been fun  another  habit   and another  constitutional resemblance  not one of them strong   underneath were bonds far stronger  but they had never come into  conscious play  no strain had reached them  they were there  i say  for  wherever is the poorest flower of love  it is there in virtue of the  perfect root of love  and love s root must one day blossom into love s  perfect rose  my chief consolation under the burden of my guilt is  that  i love my brother since i killed him  far more than i loved him when we  were all to each other  had we never quarrelled  and were he alive  i  should not be loving him thus      that we shall meet again  and live in the devotion of a far deeper love   i feel in the very heart of my soul  that it is my miserable need that  has wrought in me this confidence  is no argument against the confidence   as misery alone sees miracles  so is there many a truth into which misery  alone can enter  my little one  do not pity your uncle much  i have  learned to lift up my heart to god  i look to him who is the saviour of  men to deliver me from blood guiltiness  to lead me into my brother s  pardon  and enable me somehow to make up to him for the wrong i did him      some would think i ought to give myself up to justice  but i felt and  feel that i owe my brother reparation  not my country the opportunity of  retribution  it cannot be demanded of me to pretermit  because of my  crime  the duty more strongly required of me because of the crime  must i  not use my best endeavour to turn aside its evil consequences from  others  was i  were it even for the cleansing of my vile soul  to leave  the child of my brother alone with a property exposing her to the  machinations of prowling selfishness  would it atone for the wrong of  depriving her of one uncle  to take the other from her  and so leave her  defenceless with a burden she could not carry  must i take so called  justice on myself at her expense  to the oppression  darkening  and  endangering of her life  were i accused  i would tell the truth  but i  would not volunteer a phantasmal atonement  what comfort would it be to  my brother that i was hanged  let the punishment god pleased come upon  me  i said  as far as lay in me  i would live for my brother s child  i  have lived for her      but i am  and have been  and shall  i trust  throughout my earthly time   and what time thereafter may be needful  always be in purgatory  i should  tremble at the thought of coming out of it a moment ere it had done its  part      one day  after my return home  as i unpacked a portmanteau  my fingers  slipped into the pocket of a waistcoat  and came upon something which   when i brought it to the light  proved a large ruby  a pang went to my  heart  i looked at the waistcoat  and found it the one i had worn that  terrible night  the ruby was the stone of the ring edmund always wore  it  must have been loose  and had got there in our struggle  every now and  then i am drawn to look at it  at first i saw in it only the blood  now i  see the light also  the moon of hope rises higher as the sun of life  approaches the horizon      i was never questioned about the death of my twin brother  one  of two  so like  must seem enough  our resemblance  i believe  was a bore  which  the teasing use we made of it aggravated  therefore the fact that there  was no longer a pair of us  could not be regarded as cause for regret   and things quickly settled down to the state in which you so long knew  them  if there be one with a suspicion of the terrible truth  it is  cousin martha      you will not be surprised that you should never have heard of your uncle  edmund      i dare not ask you  my child  not to love me less  for perhaps you ought  to do so  if you do  i have my consolation in the fact that my little one  cannot make me love  her  less      thus ended the manuscript  signed with my uncle s name and address in  full  and directed to me at the bottom of the last page           chapter xxxv       uncle edmund s appendix     when my uncle edward had told his story  corresponding  though more  conversational in form  with that i have now transcribed  my uncle edmund  took up his part of the tale from the moment when he came to himself  after their fearful rush down the river  it was to this effect     he lay on the very verge of the hideous void  how it was that he got thus  far and no farther  he never could think  he was out of the central  channel  and the water that ran all about him and poured immediately over  the edge of the precipice  could not have sufficed to roll him there   finding himself on his back  and trying to turn on his side in order to  rise  his elbow found no support  and lifting his head a little  he  looked down into a moon pervaded abyss  where thin silvery vapours were  stealing about  one turn  and he would have been on his way  plumb down   to the valley below  say  rather  on his way off the face of the world  into the vast that bosoms the stars and the systems and the cloudy  worlds  his very soul quivered with terror  the pang of it was so keen  that it saved him from the swoon in which he might yet have dropped from  the edge of the world  not daring to rise  and unable to roll himself up  the slight slope  he shifted himself sideways along the ground  inch by  inch  for a few yards  then rose  and ran staggering away  as from a  monster that might wake and pursue and overtake him  he doubted if he  would ever have recovered the sudden shock of his awful position  of his  one glance into the ghastly depth  but for the worse horror of the  all but conviction that his brother had gone down to hades through that  terrible descent  if only he too had gone  he cried in his misery  they  would now be together  with no wicked woman between their hearts  for his  love too was changed into loathing  he too was at once  and entirely  and  for ever freed from her fascination  the very thought of her was hateful  to him     with straight course  but wavering walk  he made his way through the  moonlight to demand his brother  he too picked up the handkerchief  and  dropped it with disgust     what followed in the lady s chamber  i have already given in his own  words     when he fled from the chalet  it was with self slaughter in his heart   but he endured in the comfort of the thought that the door of death was  always open  that he might enter when he would  he sought the foot of the  fall the same night  then  as one possessed of demons to the tombs  fled  to the solitary places of the dark mountains     he went through many a sore stress  ignorant of the death of his father  and his elder brother  the dread misery of encountering them with his  brother s blood on his soul  barred his way home  he could not bear the  thought of reading in their eyes his own horror of himself  his money was  soon spent  and for months he had to endure severe hardships  of simple   wholesome human sort  he thought afterward that  if he had had no trouble  of that kind  his brain would have yielded  he would have surrendered  himself but for the uselessness of it  and the misery and public stare it  would bring upon his family     knowing german well  and contriving at length to reach berlin  he found  employment there of various kinds  and for a good many years managed to  live as well as he had any heart for  and spare a little for some worse  off than himself  having no regard to his health  however  he had at  length a terrible attack of brain fever  and but partially recovering his  faculties after it  was placed in an asylum  there he dreamed every night  of his home  came awake with the joy of the dream  and could sleep no  more for longing  not to go home  that he dared not think of  but to look  upon the place  if only once again  the longing grew till it became  intolerable  by his talk in his sleep  the good people about him learning  his condition  gave and gathered money to send him home  on his way  he  came to himself quite  but when he reached england  he found he dared not  go near the place of his birth  he remained therefore in london  where he  made the barest livelihood by copying legal documents  in this way he  spent a few miserable years  and then suddenly set out to walk to the  house of his fathers  he had but five shillings in his possession when  the impulse came upon him     he reached the moor  and had fallen exhausted  when a solitary gypsy   rare phenomenon  i presume  with a divine spot awake in his heart  found  him  gave him some gin  and took him to a hut he had in the wildest part  of the heath  he lay helpless for a week  and then began to recover  when  he was sufficiently restored  he helped his host to weave the baskets  which  as soon as he had enough to make a load  he took about the country  in a cart  he soon became so clever at the work as quite to earn his food  and shelter  making more baskets while the gypsy was away selling the  others  at home  the old horse managed to live  or rather not to die  on  the moor  and  all things considered  had not a very hard life of it  on  his back  uncle edmund  ill able to walk so far  for he was anything but  strong now  would sometimes go wandering in the twilight  or when the  moon shone  to some spot whence he could see his old home  occasionally  he would even go round and round the house while we slept  like a ghost  dreaming of ancient days      but   i said  interrupting his narrative   the horseman i saw that night  in the storm could not have been you  uncle  for the horse was a grand  creature  rearing like the horse with peter the great on his back  in the  corner of the map of russia       were  you  out that terrible night   he returned   the lightning was  enough to frighten even an older horse than the gypsy s   i wonder how my  friend is getting on  he must think me very ungrateful  but i daresay he  imagines me lying fathom deep in the bog   you will do something for him   won t you  ed       you shall do for him yourself what you please  ed   answered my own  uncle   and i will help you       but  uncle edmund   i said   if it was you we saw  the place you were in  was a very boggy one always  and nearly a lake then       i thought i should never get out   he replied   but for the poor horse  and his owner  i should not have minded       how  did  you get out of it  uncle   i persisted   lady cairnedge  smothered a splendid black horse not far from there  through the darkness  i heard him going down  it makes me shudder every time i think of it       i cannot tell you  child  i suppose my gray was such a skeleton that the  bog couldn t hold him  i left it all to him  and he got himself and me  too out of it somehow  it was too dark  as you know  to see anything  between the flashes  i remember we were pretty deep sometimes      he went back to london after that  and had come and gone once or twice   he said  when he came he always lodged with his gypsy friend  he had  learned that his father was dead  but took the mr  whichcote he heard  mentioned  for his elder brother  david  my father     i asked him how it was he appeared to such purpose  and in the very nick  of time  that afternoon when lady cairnedge had come with her servants to  carry john away  for of course i knew now that our champion must have  been uncle edmund  he answered he had that very morning made up his mind  to present himself at the house  and had walked there for the purpose   resolved to tell his brother all  he got in by the end of the garden  as  john was in the way of doing  and had reached the little grove of firs by  the house  when he saw a carriage at the door  and drew back  hearing  then the noises of attack and defence  he came to the window and looked  in  heard lady cairnedge s shriek  saw her on the floor  and the men  attempting to force an entrance at the other side of the window  hardly  knowing what he did  he rushed at them and beat them off  then suddenly  turning faint  for his heart was troublesome  he retired into the grove   and lay there helpless for a time  he recovered only to hear the carriage  drive away  leaving quiet behind it     to see that woman in the house of his fathers  was a terrible shock to  him  could it be that david had married her  he stole from his covert   and crawled across the moor to the gypsy s hut  there he was consoled by  learning that the mistress of the house was a young girl  whom he rightly  concluded to be the daughter of his brother david     in making a second visit with the same intent  he had another attack of  the heart  and now knew that he would have died in the snow had not john  found him           chapter xxxvi       the end of the first volume     we returned to england the next day  all the journey through  my uncles  were continually reverting to the matter of john s parentage  the more  they saw of him  the less could they believe lady cairnedge his mother   through questions put to him  and inquiries afterward made  they  discovered that  when he went to london  he had gone to lady cairnedge s  lawyer  not his father s  of whom he had never heard  which accounted for  his having on that occasion learned nothing of consequence to him  when  we reached london  my uncle edmund  who  having been bred a lawyer  knew  how to act  went at once to examine the will left by john s father  that  done  he set out for the place where john was born  the rest of us went  home     the second day after our arrival there  uncle edmund came  he had found  perfect proof  not only that lady cairnedge was john s step mother  but  that she had no authority over him or his property whatever     a long discussion took place in my uncles  study  i have to shift the  apostrophe of possession  as to whether john ought to compel restitution  of what she might have wrongfully spent or otherwise appropriated  she  had been left an income by each of her husbands  upon either of which  incomes she might have lived at ease  but they had a strong suspicion   soon entirely justified  that while spending john s money  she had been  saving up far more than her own  but in the discussion  john held to it  that  as she had once been the wife of his father  he would spare her so  far  provided she had nowise impoverished either of the estates  he would  insist only upon her immediate departure      yes  little one   said my uncle  one summer evening  as he and i talked  together  seated alone in the wilderness   what we call misfortune is  always the only good fortune  few will say  yes  in response  but truth  is independent of supporters  being justified by her children      until  misfortune  found us   he went on   my brother and i had indeed  loved one another  but with a love so poor that a wicked woman was able  to send it to sleep  to what she might have brought us  had she had full  scope  god only knows   now  all the women in hell could not separate  us       and all the women in paradise would but bring you closer   i ventured to  add     the day after our marriage  which took place within a month of our return  from paris  john went to rising  on a visit to lady cairnedge of anything  but ceremony  and took his uncles and myself with him      will you tell her ladyship   he said to the footman   that mr  day  desires to see her      the man would have shut the door in our faces  with the words   i will  see if my lady is at home   but john was prepared for him  he put his  foot between the door and the jamb  and his two hands against the door   driving it to the wall with the man behind it  there he held him till we  were all in  then closed the door  and said to him  in a tone i had never  heard him use till that moment      let lady cairnedge know at once that mr  day desires to see her      the man went  we walked into the white drawing room  the same where i sat  alone among the mirrors the morning after i was lost on the moor  how  well i remembered it  there we waited  the gentlemen stood  but  john  insisting  i sat  my eyes fixed on the door by which we had entered   in a few minutes  however  a slight sound in another part of the room   caused me to turn them thitherward  there stood lady cairnedge  in a  riding habit  with a whip in her hand  staring  pale as death  at my  uncles  then  with a scornful laugh  she turned and went through a door  immediately behind her  which closed instantly  and became part of the  wainscot  hardly distinguishable  john darted to it  it was bolted on the  outside  he sought another door  and ran hither and thither through the  house to find the woman  my uncles ran after him  afraid something might  befall him  i remained where i was  far from comfortable  two or three  minutes passed  and then i heard the thunder of hoofs  i ran to the  window  there she was  tearing across the park at full gallop  on just  such a huge black horse as she had smothered in the bog  i was the only  one of us that saw her  and not one of us ever set eyes upon her again     when we went over the house  it soon became plain to us that she had been  in readiness for a sudden retreat  having prepared for it after a fashion  of her own  not a single small article of value was to be discovered in  it  john s great aunt  who left him the property  died in the house   possessed of a large number of jewels  many of them of great price both  in themselves and because of their antiquity  not one of them was ever  found     a report reached us long after  that lady cairnedge was found dead in her  bed in a hotel in the tyrol     my uncles lived for many years on the old farm  uncle edmund bought a  gray horse  as like uncle edward s as he could find one  only younger  i  often wondered what death must think  to know he had his master on his  back  and yet see him mounted by his side  every day one or the other   most days both  would ride across the moor to see us  for many years  martha walked in at the door at least once every week     my uncles took no pains  for they had no desire  to be distinguished the  one from the other  each was always ready to meet any obligation of the  other  if one made an appointment  few could tell which it was  and  nobody which would keep it  no one could tell  except  perhaps  one who  had been present  which of them had signed any document  their two hands  were absolutely indistinguishable  i do not believe either of them  after  a time  always himself knew whether the name was his or his brother s  he  could only be always certain it must have been written by one of them   but each indifferently was ready to honour the signature   ed   whichcote      they died within a month of each other  their bodies lie side by side  on  their one tombstone is the inscription     here lie the disused garments of edward and edmund whichcote     born feb               died june     and    july              they are not here  they are risen     john and i are waiting     belorba day                   ever compels his return  being formed by nature  he is  circumscribed by her laws  there exists nothing beyond the great whole  of which he forms a part  of which he experiences the influence  the  beings his fancy pictures as above nature  or distinguished from her   are always chimeras formed after that which he has already seen  but of  which it is utterly impossible he should ever form any finished idea   either as to the place they occupy  or their manner of acting  for him  there is not  there can be nothing out of that nature which includes all  beings     therefore  instead of seeking out of the world he inhabits for beings  who can procure him a happiness denied to him by nature  let him study  this nature  learn her laws  contemplate her energies  observe the  immutable rules by which she acts   let him apply these discoveries to  his own felicity  and submit in silence to her precepts  which nothing  can alter   let him cheerfully consent to be ignorant of causes hid from  him under the most impenetrable veil   let him yield to the decrees of  a universal power  which can never be brought within his comprehension   nor ever emancipate him from those laws imposed on him by his essence     the distinction which has been so often made between the  physical  and  the  moral  being  is evidently an abuse of terms  man is a being  purely physical  the moral man is nothing more than this physical being  considered under a certain point of view  that is to say  with  relation to some of his modes of action  arising out of his individual  organization  but is not this organization itself the work of nature   the motion or impulse to action  of which he is susceptible  is that  not physical  his visible actions  as well as the invisible motion  interiorly excited by his will or his thoughts  are equally the natural  effects  the necessary consequences  of his peculiar construction   and the impulse he receives from those beings by whom he is always  surrounded  all that the human mind has successively invented  with a  view to change or perfect his being  to render himself happy  was never  more than the necessary consequence of man s peculiar essence  and that  of the beings who act upon him  the object of all his institutions  all  his reflections  all his knowledge  is only to procure that happiness  toward which he is continually impelled by the peculiarity of his  nature  all that he does  all that he thinks  all that he is  all that  he will be  is nothing more than what universal nature has made him   his ideas  his actions  his will  are the necessary effects of those  properties infused into him by nature  and of those circumstances in  which she has placed him  in short  art is nothing but nature acting  with the tools she has furnished     nature sends man naked and destitute into this world which is to be his  abode  he quickly learns to cover his nakedness  to shelter himself from  the inclemencies of the weather  first with artlessly constructed huts   and the skins of the beasts of the forest  by degrees he mends their  appearance  renders them more convenient  he establishes manufactories  to supply his immediate wants  he digs clay  gold  and other fossils  from the bowels of the earth  converts them into bricks for his house   into vessels for his use  gradually improves their shape  and augments  their beauty  to a being exalted above our terrestrial globe  man would  not appear less subjected to the laws of nature when naked in the forest  painfully seeking his sustenance  than when living in civilized society  surrounded with ease  or enriched with greater experience  plunged in  luxury  where he every day invents a thousand new wants and discovers  a thousand new modes of supplying them  all the steps taken by man to  regulate his existence  ought only to be considered as a long succession  of causes and effects  which are nothing more than the development of  the first impulse given him by nature     the same animal  by virtue of his organization  passes successively from  the most simple to the most complicated wants  it is nevertheless the  consequence of his nature  the butterfly whose beauty we admire  whose  colours are so rich  whose appearance is so brilliant  commences as  an inanimate unattractive egg  from this  heat produces a worm  this  becomes a chrysalis  then changes into that beautiful insect adorned  with the most vivid tints  arrived at this stage he reproduces   he generates  at last despoiled of his ornaments  he is obliged to  disappear  having fulfilled the task imposed on him by nature  having  performed the circle of transformation marked out for beings of his  order     the same course  the same change takes place in the vegetable world  it  is by a series of combinations originally interwoven with the energies  of the aloe  that this plant is insensibly regulated  gradually  expanded  and at the end of a number of years produces those flowers  which announce its dissolution     it is equally so with man  who in all his motion  all the changes  he undergoes  never acts but according to the laws peculiar to his  organization  and to the matter of which he is composed     the  physical man   is he who acts by the causes our faculties make us  understand     the  moral man   is he who acts by physical causes  with which our  prejudices preclude us from becoming perfectly acquainted     the  wild man  is a child destitute of experience  incapable of  proceeding in his happiness  because he has not learnt how to oppose  resistance to the impulses he receives from those beings by whom he is  surrounded     the  civilized man   is he whom experience and sociality have enabled to  draw from nature the means of his own happiness  because he has learned  to oppose resistance to those impulses he receives from exterior beings   when experience has taught him they would be destructive to his welfare     the  enlightened man  is man in his maturity  in his perfection  who  is capable of advancing his own felicity  because he has learned to  examine  to think for himself  and not to take that for truth upon  the authority of others  which experience has taught him a critical  disquisition will frequently prove erroneous     the  happy man  is he who knows how to enjoy the benefits bestowed  upon him by nature  in other words  he who thinks for himself  who is  thankful for the good he possesses  who does not envy the welfare of  others  nor sigh after imaginary benefits always beyond his grasp     the  unhappy man  is he who is incapacitated to enjoy the benefits of  nature  that is  he who suffers others to think for him  who neglects  the absolute good he possesses  in a fruitless search after ideal  benefits  who vainly sighs after that which ever eludes his pursuit     it necessarily results  that man in his enquiry ought always to  contemplate experience  and natural philosophy  these are what he should  consult in his religion   in his morals   in his legislation   in  his political government   in the arts   in the sciences   in his  pleasures   above all  in his misfortunes  experience teaches that  nature acts by simple  regular  and invariable laws  it is by his  senses  man is bound to this universal nature  it is by his perception  he must penetrate her secrets  it is from his senses he must draw  experience of her laws  therefore  whenever he neglects to acquire  experience or quits its path  he stumbles into an abyss  his imagination  leads him astray     all the errors of man are physical  he never deceives himself but when  he neglects to return back to nature  to consult her laws  to call  practical knowledge to his aid  it is for want of practical knowledge  he forms such imperfect ideas of matter  of its properties  of its  combinations  of its power  of its mode of action  and of the energies  which spring from its essence  wanting this experience  the whole  universe  to him  is but one vast scene of error  the most ordinary  results appear to him the most astonishing phenomena  he wonders at  every thing  understands nothing  and yields the guidance of his actions  to those interested in betraying his interests  he is ignorant of  nature  and he has mistaken her laws  he has not contemplated the  necessary routine which she has marked out for every thing she holds   mistaken the laws of nature  did i say  he has mistaken himself  the  consequence is  that all his systems  all his conjectures  all his  reasonings  from which he has banished experience  are nothing more than  a tissue of errors  a long chain of inconsistencies     error is always prejudicial to man  it is by deceiving himself  the  human race is plunged into misery  he neglected nature  he did not  comprehend her laws  he formed gods of the most preposterous and  ridiculous kinds  these became the sole objects of his hope  and the  creatures of his fear  he was unhappy  he trembled under these visionary  deities  under the supposed influence of visionary beings created by  himself  under the terror inspired by blocks of stone  by logs of  wood  by flying fish  or the frowns of men  mortal as himself  whom  his disturbed fancy had elevated above that nature of which alone he  is capable of forming any idea  his very posterity laughs at his folly   because experience has convinced them of the absurdity of his groundless  fears  of his misplaced worship  thus has passed away the ancient  mythology  with all the trifling and nonsensical attributes attached to  it by ignorance     not understanding that nature  equal in her distributions  entirely  destitute of malice  follows only necessary and immutable laws  when  she either produces beings or destroys them  when she causes those to  suffer  whose construction creates sensibility  when she scatters among  them good and evil  when she subjects them to incessant change  he did  not perceive it was in the breast of nature herself  that it was in her  exuberance he ought to seek to satisfy his deficiencies  for remedies  against his pains  for the means of rendering himself happy  he expected  to derive these benefits from fantastic beings  whom he supposed to  be above nature  whom he mistakingly imagined to be the authors of his  pleasures  and the cause of his misfortunes  from hence it appears that  to his ignorance of nature  man owes the creation of those illusive  powers  under which he has so long trembled with fear  that  superstitious worship  which has been the source of all his misery  and  the evils entailed upon posterity     for want of clearly comprehending his own peculiar nature  his proper  course  his wants  and his rights  man has fallen in society  from  freedom into slavery  he had forgotten the purpose of his existence  or  else he believed himself obliged to suppress the natural desires of his  heart  to sacrifice his welfare to the caprice of chiefs  either elected  by himself  or submitted to without examination  he was ignorant of the  true policy of association  of the object of government  he disdained to  listen to the voice of nature  which loudly proclaimed the price of all  submission to be protection and happiness  the end of all government  is the benefit of the governed  not the exclusive advantage of the  governors  he gave himself up without enquiry to men like himself  whom  his prejudices induced him to contemplate as beings of a superior order   as gods upon earth  they profited by his ignorance  took advantage of  his prejudices  corrupted him  rendered him vicious  enslaved him  and  made him miserable  thus man  intended by nature for the full enjoyment  of liberty  to patiently search out her laws  to investigate her  secrets  to cling to his experience  has  from a neglect of her salutary  admonitions  from an inexcusable ignorance of his own peculiar essence   fallen into servility  has been wickedly governed     having mistaken himself  he has remained ignorant of the indispensable  affinity that subsists between him  and the beings of his own species   having mistaken his duty to himself  it consequently follows  he has  mistaken his duty to others  he made a calculation in error of what his  happiness required  he did not perceive  what he owed to himself  the  excesses he ought to avoid  the desires he ought to resist  the impulses  he ought to follow  in order to consolidate his felicity  to promote his  comfort  and to further his advantage  in short  he was ignorant of his  true interests  hence his irregularities  his excesses  his shameful  extravagance  with that long train of vices  to which he has abandoned  himself  at the expense of his preservation  at the hazard of his  permanent prosperity     it is  therefore  ignorance of himself that has hindered man from  enlightening his morals  the corrupt authorities to which he had  submitted  felt an interest in obstructing the practice of his duties   even when he knew them  time  with the influence of ignorance  aided by  his corruption  gave them a strength not to be resisted by his enfeebled  voice  his duties continued unperformed  and he fell into contempt both  with himself and with others     the ignorance of man has endured so long  he has taken such slow   such irresolute steps to ameliorate his condition  only because he has  neglected to study nature  to scrutinize her laws  to search out her  expedients  to discover her properties  that his sluggishness finds its  account  in permitting himself to be guided by example  rather than to  follow experience  which demands activity  to be led by routine  rather  than by his reason  which enjoins reflection  to take that for truth  upon the authority of others  which would require a diligent and patient  investigation  from hence may be traced the hatred man betrays for every  thing that deviates from those rules to which he has been accustomed   hence his stupid  his scrupulous respect for antiquity  for the most  silly  the most absurd and ridiculous institutions of his fathers   hence those fears that seize him  when the most beneficial changes are  proposed to him  or the most likely attempts are made to better his  condition  he dreads to examine  because he has been taught to hold  it irreverent of something immediately connected with his welfare  his  credulity suffers him to believe the interested advice  and spurns at  those who wish to show him the danger of the road he is travelling     this is the reason why nations linger on in the most shameful lethargy   suffering under abuses handed down from century to century  trembling at  the very idea of that which alone can repair their calamities     it is for want of energy  for want of consulting experience  that  medicine  natural philosophy  agriculture  painting  in fact  all the  useful sciences  have so long remained under the fetters of authority   have progressed so little  those who profess these sciences  prefer  treading the beaten paths  however imperfect  rather than strike out  new ones   they prefer the phrensy of their imagination  their voluntary  conjectures  to that laboured experience which alone can extract her  secrets from nature     man  in short  whether from sloth or from terror  having abnegated the  evidence of his senses  has been guided in all his actions  in all his  enterprizes  by imagination  by enthusiasm  by habit  by preconceived  opinions  but above all  by the influence of authority  which knew  well how to deceive him  to turn his ignorance to esteem  his sloth  to advantage  thus imaginary  unsubstantial systems  have supplied the  place of experience  of mature reflection  of reason  man  petrified  with his fears  intoxicated with the marvellous  stupified with sloth   surrendered his experience  guided by his credulity  he was unable to  fall back upon it  he became consequently inexperienced  from thence he  gave birth to the most ridiculous opinions  or else adopted all those  vague chimeras  all those idle notions offered to him by men whose  interest it was to continue him in that lamentable state of ignorance     thus the human race has continued so long in a state of infancy  because  man has been inattentive to nature  has neglected her ways   because he has disdained experience  because he has thrown by his  reason  because he has been enraptured with the marvellous and the  supernatural   because he has unnecessarily trembled  these are the  reasons there is so much trouble in conducting him from this state of  childhood to that of manhood  he has had nothing but the most trifling  hypotheses  of which he has never dared to examine either the principles  or the proofs  because he has been accustomed to hold them sacred  to  consider them as the most perfect truths  and which he is not permitted  to doubt  even for an instant  his ignorance made him credulous  his  curiosity made him swallow the wonderful  time confirmed him in his  opinions  and he passed his conjectures from race to race for realities   a tyrannical power maintained him in his notions  because by those alone  could society be enslaved  it was in vain that some faint glimmerings  of nature occasionally attempted the recall of his reason  that slight  corruscations of experience sometimes threw his darkness into light  the  interest of the few was founded on his enthusiasm  their pre eminence  depended on his love of the marvellous  their very existence rested on  the firmness of his ignorance  they consequently suffered no opportunity  to escape  of smothering even the transient flame of intelligence   the many were thus first deceived into credulity  then forced into  submission  at length the whole science of man became a confused mass  of darkness  falsehood  and contradictions  with here and there a feeble  ray of truth  furnished by that nature  of which he can never entirely  divest himself  because  without his perception  his necessities are  continually bringing him back to her resources     let us then  if possible  raise ourselves above these clouds of  prepossession  let us quit the heavy atmosphere in which we are  enucleated  let us in a more unsullied medium  in a more elastic  current  contemplate the opinions of men  and observe their various  systems  let us learn to distrust a disordered conception  let us take  that faithful monitor  experience  for our guide  let us consult nature   examine her laws  dive into her stores  let us draw from herself  our  ideas of the beings she contains  let us recover our senses  which  interested error has taught us to suspect  let us consult that reason   which  for the vilest purposes has been so infamously calumniated  so  cruelly dishonoured  let us examine with attention the visible world   let us try  if it will not enable us to form a supportable judgment of  the invisible territory of the intellectual world  perhaps it may be  found there has been no sufficient reason for distinguishing them  that  it is not without motives  well worthy our enquiry  that two empires  have been separated  which are equally the inheritance of nature     the universe  that vast assemblage of every thing that exists  presents  only matter and motion  the whole offers to our contemplation  nothing  but an immense  an uninterrupted succession of causes and effects  some  of these causes are known to us  because they either strike immediately  on our senses  or have been brought under their cognizance  by the  examination of long experience  others are unknown to us  because they  act upon us by effects  frequently very remote from their primary cause   an immense variety of matter  combined under an infinity of forms   incessantly communicates  unceasingly receives a diversity of impulses   the different qualities of this matter  its innumerable combinations   its various methods of action  which are the necessary consequence of  these associations  constitute for man what he calls the essence of  beings  it is from these varied essences that spring the orders  the  classes  or the systems  which these beings respectively possess  of  which the sum total makes up that which is known by the term  nature      nature  therefore  in its most significant meaning  is the great  whole that results from the collection of matter  under its various  combinations  with that contrariety of motion  which the universe  presents to our view  nature  in a less extended sense  or considered in  each individual  is the whole that results from its essence  that is  to say  the peculiar qualities  the combination  the impulse  and the  various modes of action  by which it is discriminated from other beings   it is thus that man is  as a whole  or in his nature  the result of  a certain combination of matter  endowed with peculiar properties   competent to give  capable of receiving  certain impulses  the  arrangement of which is called  organization   of which the essence is   to feel  to think  to act  to move  after a manner distinguished from  other beings  with which he can be compared  man  therefore  ranks in  an order  in a system  in a class by himself  which differs from that of  other animals  in whom we do not perceive those properties of which he  is possessed  the different systems of beings  or if they will  their   particular natures   depend on the general system of the great whole   or that universal nature  of which they form a part  to which every  thing that exists is necessarily submitted and attached     having described the proper definition that should be applied to the  word nature  i must advise the reader  once for all  that whenever in  the course of this work the expression occurs  that  nature produces  such or such an effect   there is no intention of personifying that  nature which is purely an abstract being  it merely indicates that the  effect spoken of necessarily springs from the peculiar properties of  those beings which compose the mighty macrocosm  when  therefore  it is  said   nature demands that man should pursue his own happiness   it is  to prevent circumlocution  to avoid tautology  it is to be understood   that it is the property of a being that feels  that thinks  that acts   to labour to its own happiness  in short  that is called  natural    which is conformable to the essence of things  or to the laws  which  nature prescribes to the beings she contains  in the different orders  they occupy  under the various circumstances through which they are  obliged to pass  thus health is  natural  to man in a certain state   disease is  natural  to him under other circumstances  dissolution  or  if they will  death  is a  natural  state for a body  deprived of some  of those things  necessary to maintain the existence of the animal   c   by essence is to be understood  that which constitutes a being  such as  it is  the whole of the properties or qualities by which it acts as it  does  thus  when it is said  it is the  essence  of a stone to fall  it  is the same as saying that its descent is the necessary effect of its  gravity  of its density  of the cohesion of its parts  of the elements  of which it is composed  in short  the  essence  of a being is its  particular  its individual nature             chap  ii      of motion  and its origin        motion is an effect by which a body either changes  or has a tendency  to change  its position  that is to say  by which it successively  corresponds with different parts of space  or changes its relative  distance to other bodies  it is motion alone that establishes the  relation between our senses and exterior or interior beings  it is only  by motion that these beings are impressed upon us  that we know their  existence  that we judge of their properties  that we distinguish the  one from the other  that we distribute them into classes     the beings  the substances  or the various bodies of which nature is  the assemblage  are themselves effects of certain combinations or causes  which become causes in their turn  a cause is a being which puts another  in motion  or which produces some change in it  the effect is the change  produced in one body  by the motion or presence of another     each being  by its essence  by its peculiar nature  has the faculty of  producing  is capable of receiving  has the power of communicating  a  variety of motion  thus some beings are proper to strike our organs   these organs are competent to receiving the impression  are adequate to  undergoing changes by their presence  those which cannot act on any of  our organs  either immediately and by themselves  or immediately by the  intervention of other bodies  exist not for us  since they can neither  move us  nor consequently furnish us with ideas  they can neither be  known to us  nor of course be judged of by us  to know an object  is to  have felt it  to feel it  it is requisite to have been moved by it  to  see  is to have been moved  by something acting on the visual organs   to hear  is to have been struck  by something on our auditory nerves  in  short  in whatever mode a body may act upon us  whatever impulse we may  receive from it  we can have no other knowledge of it than by the change  it produces in us     nature  as we have already said  is the assemblage of all the beings   consequently of all the motion of which we have a knowledge  as well  as of many others of which we know nothing  because they have not yet  become accessible to our senses  from the continual action and re action  of these beings  result a series of causes and effects  or a chain  of motion guided by the constant and invariable laws peculiar to each  being  which are necessary or inherent to its particular nature  which  make it always act or move after a determinate manner  the different  principles of this motion are unknown to us  because we are in many  instances  if not in all  ignorant of what constitutes the essence of  beings  the elements of bodies escape our senses  we know them only in  the mass  we are neither acquainted with their intimate combination   nor the proportion of these combinations  from whence must necessarily  result their mode of action  their impulse  or their different effects     our senses bring us generally acquainted with two sorts of motion in the  beings that surround us  the one is the motion of the mass  by which an  entire body is transferred from one place to another  of the motion of  this genus we are perfectly sensible   thus  we see a stone fall  a ball  roll  an arm move  or change its position  the other is an internal or  concealed motion  which always depends on the peculiar energies of a  body  that is to say  on its  essence   or the combination  the action   and re action of the minute  of the insensible particles of matter  of  which that body is composed  this motion we do not see  we know it only  by the alteration or change  which after some time we discover in  these bodies or mixtures  of this genus is that concealed motion which  fermentation produces in the particles that compose flour  which   however scattered  however separated  unite  and form that mass which  we call bread  such also is the imperceptible motion by which we see a  plant or animal enlarge  strengthen  undergo changes  and acquire new  qualities  without our eyes being competent to follow its progression   or to perceive the causes which have produced these effects  such also  is the internal motion that takes place in man  which is called his  intellectual faculties  his thoughts  his passions  his will  of these  we have no other mode of judging  than by their action  that is  by  those sensible effects which either accompany or follow them  thus  when  we see a man run away  we judge him to be interiorly actuated by the  passion of fear     motion  whether visible or concealed  is styled acquired  when it is  impressed on one body by another  either by a cause to which we are  a stranger  or by an exterior agent which our senses enable us to  discover  thus we call that  acquired motion   which the wind gives  to the sails of a ship  that motion which is excited in a body  that  contains within itself the causes of those changes we see it undergo  is  called spontaneous  then it is said  this body acts or moves by its own  peculiar energies  of this kind is the motion of the man who walks   who talks  who thinks  nevertheless  if we examine the matter a little  closer  we shall be convinced  that  strictly speaking  there is no  such thing as spontaneous motion in any of the various bodies of nature   seeing they are perpetually acting one upon the other  that all their  changes are to be attributed to the causes  either visible or concealed   by which they are moved  the will of man is secretly moved or determined  by some exterior cause that produces a change in him  we believe he  moves of himself  because we neither see the cause that determined him   the mode in which it acted  nor the organ that it put in motion     that is called simple motion  which is excited in a body by a single  cause  compound motion  that which is produced by two or more  different causes  whether these causes are equal or unequal  conspiring  differently  acting together or in succession  known or unknown     let the motion of beings be of whatsoever nature it may  it is always  the necessary consequence of their essence  or of the properties which  compose them  and of those causes of which they experience the action   each being can only move and act after a particular manner  that is to  say  conformably to those laws which result from its peculiar essence   its particular combination  its individual nature  in short  from its  specific energies  and those of the bodies from which it receives an  impulse  it is this that constitutes the invariable laws of motion   i say  invariable   because they can never change  without producing  confusion in the essence of things  it is thus that a heavy body must  necessarily fall  if it meets with no obstacle sufficient to arrest its  descent  that a sensible body must naturally seek pleasure  and avoid  pain  that fire must necessarily burn  and diffuse light     each being  then  has laws of motion  that are adapted to itself  and  constantly acts or moves according to these laws  at least when  no superior cause interrupts its action  thus  fire ceases to burn  combustible matter  as soon as sufficient water is thrown into it  to  arrest its progress  thus  a sensible being ceases to seek pleasure  as  soon as he fears that pain will be the result     the communication of motion  or the medium of action  from one body to  another  also follows certain and necessary laws  one being can only  communicate motion to another  by the affinity  by the resemblance  by  the conformity  by the analogy  or by the point of contact  which it  has with that other being  fire can only propagate when it finds matter  analogous to itself  it extinguishes when it encounters bodies which it  cannot embrace  that is to say  that do not bear towards it a certain  degree of relation or affinity     every thing in the universe is in motion  the essence of matter is to  act  if we consider its parts  attentively  we shall discover there is  not a particle that enjoys absolute repose  those which appear to us to  be without motion  are  in fact  only in relative or apparent rest   they experience such an imperceptible motion  and expose it so little  on their surfaces  that we cannot perceive the changes they undergo  all  that appears to us to be at rest  does not  however  remain one instant  in the same state  all beings are continually breeding  increasing   decreasing  or dispersing  with more or less dullness or rapidity  the  insect called ephemeron  is produced and perishes in the same day   of consequence  it experiences the greatest changes of its being very  rapidly  in our eyes  those combinations which form the most solid  bodies  which appear to enjoy the most perfect repose  are nevertheless  decomposed  and dissolved in the course of time  the hardest stones  by  degrees  give way to the contact of air  a mass of iron  which time  and  the action of the atmosphere  has gnawed into rust  must have been in  motion  from the moment of its formation  in the bowels of the earth   until the instant we behold it in this state of dissolution     natural philosophers  for the most part  seem not to have sufficiently  reflected on what they call the  nisus   that is to say  the incessant  efforts one body is making on another  but which  notwithstanding  appear  to our superficial observation  to enjoy the most perfect  repose  a stone of five hundred weight seems to rest quiet on the earth   nevertheless  it never ceases for an instant  to press with force upon  the earth  which resists or repulses it in its turn  will the assertion  be ventured  that the stone and earth do not act  do they wish to be  undeceived  they have nothing to do but interpose their hand betwixt the  earth and the stone  it will then be discovered  that notwithstanding  its seeming repose  the stone has power adequate to bruise it   because the hand has not energies sufficient  within itself  to resist  effectually both the stone and earth   action cannot exist in bodies  without re action  a body that experiences an impulse  an attraction   or a pressure of any kind  if it resists  clearly demonstrates by such  resistance that it re acts  from whence it follows  there is a concealed  force  called by these philosophers  vis inertia   that displays itself  against another force  and this clearly demonstrates  that this inert  force is capable of both acting and re acting  in short  it will be  found  on close investigation  that those powers which are called   dead   and those which are termed  live  or  moving   are powers of  the same kind  which only display themselves after a different manner   permit us to go a greater distance yet  may we not say  that in those  bodies  or masses  of which their whole become evident from appearances  to us to be at rest  there is notwithstanding  a continual action  and  counter action  constant efforts  uninterrupted or communicated force   and continued opposition  in short  a  nisus   by which the constituting  portions of these bodies press one upon another  mutually resisting  each other  acting and re acting incessantly  that this reciprocity of  action  this simultaneous re action  keeps them united  causes their  particles to form a mass  a body  and a combination  which  viewed in  its whole  has the appearance of complete rest  notwithstanding no one  of its particles really ceases to be in motion for a single instant   these collective masses appear to be at rest  simply by the equality of  the motion  by the responsory impulse of the powers acting in them     thus it appears that bodies enjoying perfect repose  really receive   whether upon their surface  or in their interior  a continual  communicated force  from those bodies by which they are either  surrounded or penetrated  dilated or contracted  rarified or condensed   in fact  from those which compose them  whereby their particles are  incessantly acting and re acting  or in continual motion  the effects  of which are displayed by extraordinary changes  thus heat rarifies and  dilates metals  which is evidence deducible that a bar of iron  from the  change of the atmosphere alone  must be in continual motion  that there  is not a single particle in it that can be said to enjoy rest even for a  single moment  in those hard bodies  indeed  the particles of which are  in actual contact  and which are closely united  how is it possible to  conceive  that air  cold  or heat  can act upon one of these particles   even exteriorly  without the motion being communicated to those which  are most intimate and minute in their union  without motion  how should  we be able to comprehend the manner in which our sense of smelling is  affected  by emanations escaping from the most solid bodies  of which  all the particles appear to be at perfect rest  how could we  even by  the assistance of a telescope  see the most distant stars  if there was  not a progressive motion of light from these stars to the retina of our  eye     observation and reflection ought to convince us  that every thing in  nature is in continual motion  that there is not a single part  however  small  that enjoys repose  that nature acts in all  that she would cease  to be nature if she did not act  practical knowledge teaches us  that  without unceasing motion  nothing could be preserved  nothing could  be produced  nothing could act in this nature  thus the idea of nature  necessarily includes that of motion  but it will be asked  and not a  little triumphantly  from whence did she derive her motion  our reply  is  we know not  neither do they  that  we  never shall  that  they   never will  it is a secret hidden from us  concealed from them  by the  most impenetrable veil  we also reply  that it is fair to infer  unless  they can logically prove to the contrary  that it is in herself  since  she is the great whole  out of which nothing can exist  we say this  motion is a manner of existence  that flows  necessarily  out of the  nature of matter  that matter moves by its own peculiar energies  that  its motion is to be attributed to the force which is inherent in itself   that the variety of motion  and the phenomena which result  proceed from  the diversity of the properties  of the qualities  of the combinations   which are originally found in the primitive matter  of which nature is  the assemblage     natural philosophers  for the most part  have regarded as inanimate  or  as deprived of the faculty of motion  those bodies which are only  moved by the intervention of some agent or exterior cause  they have  considered themselves justified in concluding  that the matter which  forms these bodies is perfectly inert in its nature  they have not  forsaken this error  although they must have observed  that whenever  a body is left to itself  or disengaged from those obstructions which  oppose themselves to its descent  it has a tendency to fall or to  approach the centre of the earth  by a motion uniformly accelerated   they have rather chosen to suppose a visionary exterior cause  of which  they themselves had but an imperfect idea  than admit that these bodies  held their motion from their own peculiar nature     these philosophers  also  notwithstanding they saw above them an  infinite number of globes that moved with great rapidity round a common  centre  still adhered to their favourite opinions  and never ceased to  suppose some whimsical causes for these movements  until the immortal  newton clearly demonstrated that it was the effect of the gravitation  of these celestial bodies towards each other  experimental philosophers   however  and amongst them the great newton himself  have held the cause  of gravitation as inexplicable  notwithstanding the great weight of this  authority  it appears manifest that it may be deduced from the motion of  matter  by which bodies are diversely determined  gravitation is nothing  more than a mode of moving  a tendency towards a centre  to speak  strictly  all motion is relative gravitation  since that which falls  relatively to us  rises  with relation to other bodies  from this  it follows  that every motion in our microcosm is the effect of  gravitation  seeing that there is not in the universe either top or  bottom  nor any absolute centre  it should appear  that the weight of  bodies depends on their configuration  as well external as internal   which gives them that form of action which is called gravitation  thus   for instance  a piece of lead  spherically formed  falls quickly and  direct  reduce this ball into very thin plates  it will be sustained  in the air for a much longer time  apply to it the action of fire  this  lead will rise in the atmosphere  here  then  the same metal  variously  modified  has very different modes of action     a very simple observation would have sufficed to make the philosophers   antecedent to newton  feel the inadequateness of the causes they  admitted to operate with such powerful effect  they had a sufficiency  to convince themselves  in the collision of two bodies  which they could  contemplate  and in the known laws of that motion  which these always  communicate by reason of their greater or less compactness  from whence  they ought to have inferred  that the density of  subtle  or  ethereal   matter  being considerably less than that of the planets  it could only  communicate to them a very feeble motion  quite insufficient to produce  that velocity of action  of which they could not possibly avoid being  the witnesses     if nature had been viewed uninfluenced by prejudice  they must have been  long since convinced that matter acts by its own peculiar activity  that  it needs no exterior communicative force to set it in motion  they might  have perceived that whenever mixed bodies were placed in a situation to  act on each other  motion was instantly excited  and that these mixtures  acted with a force capable of producing the most surprising results     if particles of iron  sulphur  and water be mixed together  these  bodies thus capacitated to act on each other  are heated by degrees  and  ultimately produce a violent combustion  if flour be wetted with water   and the mixture closed up  it will be found  after some lapse of time    by the aid of a microscope  to have produced organized beings that  enjoy life  of which the water and the flour were believed incapable   it is thus that inanimate matter can pass into life  or animate matter   which is in itself only an assemblage of motion     reasoning from analogy  which the philosophers of the present day do not  hold incompatible  the production of a man  independent of the ordinary  means  would not be more astonishing than that of an insect with flour  and water  fermentation and putrid substances  evidently produce living  animals  we have here the principle  with proper materials  principles  can always be brought into action  that generation which is styled   uncertain  is only so for those who do not reflect  or who do not  permit themselves  attentively  to observe the operations of nature     the generative of motion  and its developement  as well as the energy of  matter  may be seen everywhere  more particularly in those unitions in  which fire  air  and water  find themselves combined  these elements  or  rather these mixed bodies  are the most volatile  the most fugitive  of beings  nevertheless in the hands of nature  they are the essential  agents employed to produce the most striking phenomena  to these we must  ascribe the effects of thunder  the eruption of volcanoes  earthquakes    c  science offers to our consideration an agent of astonishing force   in gunpowder  the instant it comes in contact with fire  in short  the  most terrible effects result from the combination of matter  which is  generally believed to be dead and inert     these facts prove  beyond a doubt  that motion is produced  is  augmented  is accelerated in matter  without the help of any exterior  agent  therefore it is reasonable to conclude that motion is the  necessary consequence of immutable laws  resulting from the essence   from the properties existing in the different elements  and the  various combinations of these elements  are we not justified  then   in concluding  from these precedents  that there may be an infinity of  other combinations  with which we are unacquainted  competent to produce  a great variety of motion in matter  without being under the necessity  of having recourse  for the explanation  to agents who are more  difficult to comprehend than even the effects which are attributed to  them     had man but paid proper attention to what passed under his review  he  would not have sought out of nature  a power distinguished from herself   to set her in action  and without which he believes she cannot move  if   indeed  by nature is meant a heap of dead matter  destitute of peculiar  qualities purely passive  we must unquestionably seek out of this nature  the principle of her motion  but if by nature be understood  what it  really is  a whole  of which the numerous parts are endowed with various  properties  which oblige them to act according to these properties   which are in a perpetual ternateness of action and reaction  which  press  which gravitate towards a common center  whilst others depart  from and fly off towards the periphery  or circumference  which attract  and repel  which by continual approximation and constant collision   produce and decompose all the bodies we behold  then  i say  there is  no necessity to have recourse to supernatural powers  to account for the  formation of things  and those extraordinary appearances which are the  result of motion     those who admit a cause exterior to matter  are obliged to believe that  this cause produced all the motion by which matter is agitated in giving  it existence  this belief rests on another  namely  that matter could  begin to exist  an hypothesis that  until this moment  has never been  satisfactorily demonstrated  to produce from nothing  or the creation   is a term that cannot give us the least idea of the formation of the  universe  it presents no sense  upon which the mind can rely  in fact   the human mind is not adequate to conceive a moment of non existence  or  when all shall have passed away  even admitting this to be a truth  it  is no truth for us  because by the very nature of our organization  we  cannot admit positions as facts  of which no evidence can be adduced  that has relation to our senses  we may  indeed  consent to believe it   because others say it  but will any rational being be satisfied with  such an admission  can any moral good spring from such blind assurance   is it consistent with sound doctrine  with philosophy  or with reason   do we  in fact  pay any respect to the intellectual powers of another   when we say to him   i will believe this  because in all the attempts  you have ventured  for the purpose of proving what you say  you have  entirely failed  and have been at last obliged to acknowledge you know  nothing about the matter   what moral reliance ought we to have on such  people  hypothesis may succeed hypothesis  system may destroy system  a  new set of ideas may overturn the ideas of a former day  other  gallileos may be condemned to death  other newtons may arise  we may  reason  argue  dispute  quarrel  punish and destroy  nay  we may even  exterminate those who differ from us in opinion  but when we have  done all this  we shall be obliged to fall back upon our original  darkness  to confess  that that which has no relation with our senses   that which cannot manifest itself to us by some of the ordinary modes  by which other things are manifested  has no existence for us  is not  comprehensible by us  can never entirely remove our doubt  can never  seize on our stedfast belief  seeing it is that of which we cannot form  even a notion  in short  that it is that  which as long as we remain  what we are  must be hidden from us by a veil  which no power  no  faculty  no energy we possess  is able to remove  all who are not  enslaved by prejudice agree to the truth of the position  that  nothing  can be made of nothing   many theologians have acknowledged nature to  be an active whole  almost all the ancient philosophers were agreed to  regard the world as eternal  ocellus lucanus  speaking of the universe   says    it has always been  and it always will be    vatable and grotius  assure us  that to render the hebrew phrase in the first chapter of  genesis correctly  we must say    when god made heaven and earth  matter  was without form    if this be true  and every hebraist can judge for  himself  then the word which has been rendered  created   means only  to fashion  form  arrange  we know that the greek words  create  and   form   have always indicated the same thing  according to st  jerome    creare  has the same meaning as  condere   to found  to build  the  bible does not anywhere say in a clear manner  that the world was made  of nothing  tertullian and the father petau both admit  that   this is  a truth established more by reason than by authority    st  justin seems  to have contemplated matter as eternal  since he commends plato for  having said  that   god  in the creation of the world  only gave impulse  to matter  and fashioned it    burnet and pythagoras were entirely of  this opinion  and even our church service may be adduced in support  for  although it admits by implication a beginning  it expressly denies an  end    as it was in the beginning  is now  and ever shall be  world  without end    it is easy to perceive that that which cannot cease to  exist  must have always been     motion becomes still more obscure  when creation  or the formation of  matter  is attributed to a spiritual being  that is to say  to a being  which has no analogy  no point of contact  with it  to a being which  has neither extent or parts  and cannot  therefore  be susceptible of  motion  as we understand the term  this being only the change of one  body  relatively to another body  in which the body moved presents  successively different parts to different points of space  moreover   as all the world are nearly agreed that matter can never be totally  annihilated  or cease to exist  by what reasoning  i would ask  do they  comprehend  how understand  that that which cannot cease to be  could  ever have had a beginning     if  therefore  it be asked  whence came matter  it is very reasonable to  say it has always existed  if it be inquired  whence proceeds the motion  that agitates matter  the same reasoning furnishes the answer  namely   that as motion is coeval with matter  it must have existed from all  eternity  seeing that motion is the necessary consequence of its  existence  of its essence  of its primitive properties  such as its  extent  its gravity  its impenetrability  its figure   c  by virtue  of these essential constituent properties  inherent in all matter  and  without which it is impossible to form an idea of it  the various matter  of which the universe is composed must from all eternity have  pressed against  each other  have gravitated towards a center  have  clashed  have come in contact  have been attracted  have been  repelled  have been combined  have been separated  in short  must have  acted and moved according to the essence and energy peculiar to each  genus  and to each of its combinations     existence supposes properties in the thing that exists  whenever it  has properties  its mode of action must necessarily flow from those  properties which constitute  its mode of being  thus  when a body is  ponderous  it must fall  when it falls  it must come in collision with  the bodies it meets in its descent  when it is dense  when it is solid   it must  by reason of this density  communicate motion to the bodies  with which it clashes  when it has analogy  when it has affinity with  these bodies  it must be attracted  must be united with them  when it  has no point of analogy with them  it must be repulsed     from which it may be fairly inferred  that in supposing  as we are under  the necessity of doing  the existence of matter  we must suppose it to  have some kind of properties  from which its motion  or modes of action   must necessarily flow  to form the universe  descartes asked but matter  and motion  a diversity of matter sufficed for him  variety of motion  was the consequence of its existence  of its essence  of its properties   its different modes of action would be the necessary consequence of  its different modes of being  matter without properties would be a mere  nothing  therefore  as soon as matter exists  it must act  as soon as  it is various  it must act variously  if it cannot commence to exist   it must have existed from all eternity  if it has always existed  it can  never cease to be  if it can never cease to be  it can never cease to  act by its own energy  motion is a manner of being  which matter derives  from its peculiar existence     the existence  then  of matter is a fact  the existence of motion is  another fact  our visual organs point out to us matter with different  essences  forming a variety of combinations  endowed with various  properties that discriminate them  indeed  it is a palpable error to  believe that matter is a homogeneous body  of which the parts differ  from each other only by their various modifications  among the  individuals of the same species that come under our notice  no two  resemble exactly  and it is therefore evident that the difference  of situation alone will  necessarily  carry a diversity more or less  sensible  not only in the modifications  but also in the essence  in  the properties  in the entire system of beings  this truth was well  understood by the profound and subtle leibnitz     if this principle be properly digested  and experience seems always to  produce evidence of its truth  we must be convinced that the matter or  primitive elements which enter into the composition of bodies  are  not of the same nature  and consequently  can neither have the same  properties  nor the same modifications  and if so  they cannot have  the same mode of moving and acting  their activity or motion  already  different  can be diversified to infinity  augmented or diminished   accelerated or retarded  according to the combinations  the proportions   the pressure  the density  the volume of the matter  that enters their  composition  the endless variety to be produced  will need no further  illustration than the commonest book of arithmetic furnishes us  where  it will be found  that to ring all the changes that can be produced on  twelve bells only  would occupy a space of more than ninety one years   the element of fire is visibly more active and more inconstant than that  of earth  this is more solid and ponderous than fire  air  or water   according to the quantity of these elements  which enter the composition  of bodies  these must act diversely  and their motion must in some  measure partake the motion peculiar to each of their constituent parts   elementary fire appears to be in nature the principle of activity   it may be compared to a fruitful leaven  that puts the mass into  fermentation and gives it life  earth appears to be the principle of  solidity in bodies  from its impenetrability  and by the firm coherence  of its parts  water is a medium  to facilitate the combination of  bodies  into which it enters itself  as a constituent part  air is a  fluid whose business it seems to be  to furnish the other elements with  the space requisite to expand  to exercise their motion  and which is   moreover  found proper to combine with them  these elements  which  our senses never discover in a pure state  which are continually and  reciprocally set in motion by each other  which are always acting and  re acting  combining and separating  attracting and repelling  are  sufficient to explain to us the formation of all the beings we behold   their motion is uninterruptedly and reciprocally produced from each  other  they are alternately causes and effects  thus  they form a vast  circle of generation and destruction  of combination and decomposition   which  it is quite reasonable to suppose  could never have had a  beginning  and which  consequently can never have an end  in short   nature is but an immense chain of causes and effects  which unceasingly  flow from each other  the motion of particular beings depends on the  general motion  which is itself maintained by individual motion  this  is strengthened or weakened  accelerated or retarded  simplified or  complicated  procreated or destroyed  by a variety of combinations and  circumstances  which every moment change the directions  the tendency   the modes of existing  and of acting  of the different beings that  receive its impulse     if it were true  as has been asserted by some philosophers  that every  thing has a tendency to form one unique or single mass  and in that  unique mass the instant should arrive when all was in  nisus   all would  eternally remain in this state  to all eternity there would be no more  than one being and one effort  this would be eternal and universal  death     if we desire to go beyond this  to find the principle of action in  matter  to trace the origin of things  it is for ever to fall back upon  difficulties  it is absolutely to abridge the evidence of our senses  by  which only we can understand  by which alone we can judge of the causes  acting upon them  or the impulse by which they are set in action     let us  therefore  content ourselves with saying what is supported by  our experience  and by all the evidence we are capable of understanding   against the truth of which not a shadow of proof  such as our reason can  admit  has ever been adduced  which has been maintained by philosophers  in every age  which theologians themselves have not denied  but which  many of them have upheld  namely  that  matter always existed  that  it moves by virtue of its essence  that all the phenomena of nature  is ascribable to the diversified motion of the variety of matter she  contains  and which  like the phoenix  is continually regenerating out  of its own ashes              chap  iii      of matter   of its various combinations   of its diversified motion  or  of the course of nature        we know nothing of the elements of bodies  but we know some of their  properties or qualities  and we distinguish their various matter by the  effect or change produced on our senses  that is to say  by the variety  of motion their presence excites in us  in consequence  we discover  in them  extent  mobility  divisibility  solidity  gravity  and inert  force  from these general and primitive properties flow a number  of others  such as density  figure  colour  ponderosity   c  thus   relatively to us  matter is all that affects our senses in any manner  whatever  the various properties we attribute to matter  by which we  discriminate its diversity  are founded on the different impressions we  receive on the changes they produce in us     a satisfactory definition of matter has not yet been given  man   deceived and led astray by his prejudices  formed but vague   superficial  and imperfect notions concerning it  he looked upon it  as an unique being  gross and passive  incapable of either moving by  itself  of forming combinations  or of producing any thing by its  own energies  instead of this unintelligible jargon  he ought to have  contemplated it as a  genus  of beings  of which the individuals   although they might possess some common properties  such as extent   divisibility  figure   c  should not  however  be all ranked in the same  class  nor comprised under the same general denomination     an example will serve more fully to explain what we have asserted   throw its correctness into light  and facilitate the application   the properties common to all matter  are extent  divisibility   impenetrability  figure  mobility  or the property of being moved in  mass  fire  beside these general properties  common to all matter   enjoys also the peculiar property of being put into activity by a motion  that produces on our organs of feeling the sensation of heat  and by  another  that communicates to our visual organs the sensation of light   iron  in common with matter in general  has extent and figure  is  divisible  and moveable in mass  if fire be combined with it in a  certain proportion  the iron acquires two new properties  namely  those  of exciting in us similar sensations of heat and light  which were  excited by the element of fire  but which the iron had not  before its  combination with the igneous matter  these distinguishing properties  are inseparable from matter  and the phenomena that result  may  in the  strictest sense of the word  be said to result necessarily     if we contemplate a little the paths of nature  if  for a time  we trace  the beings in this nature  under the different states through which   by reason of their properties  they are compelled to pass  we shall  discover  that it is to motion  and motion only  that is to be ascribed  all the changes  all the combinations  all the forms  in short  all the  various modifications of matter  that it is by motion every thing that  exists is produced  experiences change  expands  and is destroyed  it  is motion that alters the aspect of beings  that adds to  or takes away  from their properties  which obliges each of them  by a consequence of  its nature  after having occupied a certain rank or order  to quit it   to occupy another  and to contribute to the generation  maintenance  and  decomposition of other beings  totally different in their bulk  rank   and essence     in what experimental philosophers have styled the three orders of  nature  that is to say  the  mineral   the  vegetable   and  animal   worlds  they have established  by the aid of motion  a transmigration   an exchange  a continual circulation in the particles of matter  nature  has occasion in one place  for those particles which  for a time  she  has placed in another  these particles  after having  by particular  combinations  constituted beings endued with peculiar essences  with  specific properties  with determinate modes of action  dissolve and  separate with more or less facility  and combining in a new manner  they  form new beings  the attentive observer sees this law execute itself  in  a manner more or less prominent  through all the beings by which he is  surrounded  he sees nature full of  erratic germe   some of which expand  themselves  whilst others wait until motion has placed them in their  proper situation  in suitable wombs or matrices  in the necessary  circumstances  to unfold  to increase  to render them more perceptible  by the addition of other substances of matter analogous to their  primitive being  in all this we see nothing but the effect of motion   necessarily guided  modified  accelerated or slackened  strengthened or  weakened  by reason of the various properties that beings successively  acquire and lose  which  every moment  infallibly produces alterations  in bodies more or less marked  indeed  these bodies cannot be  strictly  speaking  the same in any two successive moments of their existence   they must  every instant  either acquire or lose  in short  they are  obliged to undergo continual variations in their essences  in their  properties  in their energies  in their masses  in their qualities  in  their mode of existence     animals  after they have been expanded in  and brought out of  the wombs  that are suitable to the elements of their machine  enlarge  strengthen   acquire new properties  new energies  new faculties  either by deriving  nourishment from plants analogous to their being  or by devouring other  animals whose substance is suitable to their preservation  that is to  say  to repair the continual deperdition or loss of some portion of  their own substance  that is disengaging itself every instant  these  same animals are nourished  preserved  strengthened  and enlarged  by  the aid of air  water  earth  and fire  deprived of air  or of the fluid  that surrounds them  that presses on them  that penetrates them  that  gives them their elasticity  they presently cease to live  water   combined with this air  enters into their whole mechanism of which  it facilitates the motion  earth serves them for a basis  by giving  solidity to their texture  it is conveyed by air and water  which carry  it to those parts of the body with which it can combine  fire itself   disguised and enveloped under an infinity of forms  continually received  into the animal  procures him heat  continues him in life  renders him  capable of exercising his functions  the aliments  charged with these  various principles  entering into the stomach  re establish the nervous  system  and restore  by their activity  and the elements which compose  them  the machine which begins to languish  to be depressed  by the loss  it has sustained  forthwith the animal experiences a change in his  whole system  he has more energy  more activity  he feels more courage   displays more gaiety  he acts  he moves  he thinks  after a different  manner  all his faculties are exercised with more ease  this igneous  matter  so congenial to generation  so restorative in its effect  so  necessary to life  was the jupiter of the ancients  from all that has  preceded  it is clear  that what are called the elements  or primitive  parts of matter  variously combined  are  by the agency of motion   continually united to  and assimilated with  the substance of  animals  that they visibly modify their being  have an evident influence  over their actions  that is to say  upon the motion they undergo   whether visible or concealed     the same elements  which under certain circumstances serve to nourish   to strengthen  to maintain the animal  become  under others  the  principles of his weakness  the instruments of his dissolution  of his  death  they work his destruction  whenever they are not in that just  proportion which renders them proper to maintain his existence  thus   when water becomes too abundant in the body of the animal  it enervates  him  it relaxes the fibres  and impedes the necessary action of the  other elements  thus  fire admitted in excess  excites in him disorderly  motion destructive of his machine  thus  air  charged with principles  not analogous to his mechanism  brings upon him dangerous diseases and  contagion  in fine  the aliments modified after certain modes  in the  room of nourishing  destroy the animal  and conduce to his ruin  the  animal is preserved no longer than these substances are analogous to his  system  they ruin him when they want that just equilibrium that renders  them suitable to maintain his existence     plants that serve to nourish and restore animals are themselves  nourished by earth  they expand on its bosom  enlarge and strengthen at  its expense  continually receiving into their texture  by their  roots and their pores  water  air  and igneous matter  water visibly  reanimates them whenever their vegetation or genus of life languishes   it conveys to them those analogous principles by which they are enabled  to reach perfection  air is requisite to their expansion  and furnishes  them with water  earth  and the igneous matter with which it is charged   by these means they receive more or less of the inflammable matter  the  different proportions of these principles  their numerous combinations   from whence result an infinity of properties  a variety of forms   constitute the various families and classes into which botanists have  distributed plants  it is thus we see the cedar and the hyssop develop  their growth  the one rises to the clouds  the other creep humbly on  the earth  thus  by degrees  from an acorn springs the majestic oak   accumulating  with time  its numerous branches  and overshadowing us  with its foliage  thus  a grain of corn  after having drawn its own  nourishment from the juices of the earth  serves  in its turn  for  the nourishment of man  into whose system it conveys the elements or  principles by which it has been itself expanded  combined  and modified  in such a manner  as to render this vegetable proper to assimilate and  unite with the human frame  that is to say  with the fluids and solids  of which it is composed     the same elements  the same principles  are found in the formation  of minerals  as well as in their decomposition  whether natural or  artificial  we find that earth  diversely modified  wrought  and  combined  serves to increase their bulk  and give them more or less  density and gravity  air and water contribute to make their particles  cohere  the igneous matter  or inflammable principle  tinges them with  colour  and sometimes plainly indicates its presence  by the brilliant  scintillation which motion elicits from them  these stones and metals   these bodies  so compact and solid  are disunited  are destroyed  by  the agency of air  water  and fire  which the most ordinary analysis is  sufficient to prove  as well as a multitude of experience  to which our  eyes are the daily evidence     animals  plants  and minerals  after a lapse of time  give back to  nature  that is to say  to the general mass of things  to the universal  magazine  the elements  or principles  which they have borrowed  the  earth retakes that portion of the body of which it formed the basis  and the solidity  the air charges itself with these parts  that are   analogous to it  and with those particles which are light and subtle   water carries off that which is suitable to liquescency  fire  bursting  its chains  disengages itself  and rushes into new combinations with  other bodies     the elementary particles of the animal  being thus dissolved  disunited   and dispersed  assume new activity  and form new combinations  thus   they serve to nourish  to preserve  or destroy new beings  among others   plants  which arrived at their maturity  nourish and preserve new  animals  these in their turn yielding to the same fate as the first     such is the constant  the invariable course  of nature  such is  the eternal circle of mutation  which all that exists is obliged  to describe  it is thus motion generates  preserves for a time  and  successively  destroys  one part of the universe by the other  whilst  the sum of existence remains eternally the same  nature  by its  combinations  produces suns  which place themselves in the centre of  so many systems  she forms planets  which  by their peculiar essence   gravitate and describe their revolutions round these suns  by degrees  the motion is changed altogether  and becomes eccentric  perhaps the day  may arrive when these wondrous masses will disperse  of which man  in  the short space of his existence  can only have a faint and transient  glimpse     it is clear  then  that the continual motion inherent in matter  changes  and destroys all beings  every instant depriving them of some of their  properties  to substitute others  it is motion  which  in thus changing  their actual essence  changes also their order  their direction  their  tendency  and the laws which regulate their mode of acting and being   from the stone formed in the bowels of the earth  by the intimate  combination and close coherence of similar and analogous particles  to  the sun  that vast reservoir of igneous particles  which sheds torrents  of light over the firmament  from the benumbed oyster  to the thoughtful  and active man  we see an uninterrupted progression  a perpetual chain  of motion and combination  from which is produced  beings that only  differ from each other by the variety of their elementary matter  by the  numerous combinations of these elements  from whence springs modes  of action and existence  diversified to infinity  in generation  in  nutrition  in preservation  we see nothing more than matter  variously  combined  of which each has its peculiar motion  regulated by fixed and  determinate laws  which oblige them to submit to necessary changes  we  shall find  in the formation  in the growth  in the instantaneous  life  of animals  vegetables  and minerals  nothing but matter  which  combining  accumulating  aggregating  and expanding by degrees  forms  beings  who are either feeling  living  vegetating  or else destitute  of these faculties  which  having existed some time under one particular  form  are obliged to contribute by their ruin to the production of other  forms     thus  to speak strictly  nothing in nature is either born  or dies   according to the common acceptation of those terms  this truth was  felt by many of the ancient philosophers  plato says  that according to  tradition   the living were born of the dead  the same as the dead did  come of the living  and that this is the constant routine of nature   he  adds from himself   who knows  if to live  be not to die  and if to die   be not to live   this was the doctrine of pythagoras  a man of great  talent and no less note  empedocles asserts   there is neither birth nor  death  for any mortal  but only a combination  and a separation of that  which was combined  and that this is what amongst men they call birth   and death   again he remarks   those are infants  or short sighted  persons  with very contracted understandings  who imagine any thing is  born  which did not exist before  or that any thing can die or perish  totally              chap  iv      laws of motion  common to every being of nature   attraction and  repulsion   inert force   necessity        man is never surprised at those effects  of which he thinks he knows the  cause  he believes he does know the cause  as soon as he sees them act  in an uniform and determinate manner  or when the motion excited is  simple  the descent of a stone  that falls by its own peculiar weight   is an object of contemplation to the philosopher only  to whom the mode  by which the most immediate causes act  and the most simple motion  are  no less impenetrable mysteries than the most complex motion  and the  manner by which the most complicated causes give impulse  the uninformed  are seldom tempted either to examine the effects which are familiar to  them  or to recur to first principles  they think they see nothing in  the descent of a stone  which ought to elicit their surprise  or become  the object of their research  it requires a newton to feel that the  descent of heavy bodies is a phenomenon  worthy his whole  his most  serious attention  it requires the sagacity of a profound experimental  philosopher  to discover the laws by which heavy bodies fall  by which  they communicate to others their peculiar motion  in short  the mind  that is most practised in philosophical observation  has frequently the  chagrin to find  that the most simple and most common effects escape all  his researches  and remain inexplicable to him     when any extraordinary  any unusual  effect is produced  to which our  eyes have not been accustomed  or when we are ignorant of the energies  of the cause  the action of which so forcibly strikes our senses  we  are tempted to meditate upon it  and take it into our consideration   the european  accustomed to the use of gunpowder  passes it by  without  thinking much of its extraordinary energies  the workman  who labours to  manufacture it  finds nothing marvellous in its properties  because he  daily handles the matter that forms its composition  the american  to  whom this powder was a stranger  who had never beheld its operation   looked upon it as a divine power  and its energies as supernatural  the  uninformed  who are ignorant of the true cause of thunder  contemplate  it as the instrument of divine vengeance  the experimental philosopher  considers it as the effect of the electric matter  which  nevertheless   is itself a cause which he is very far from perfectly understanding   it  required the keen  the penetrating mind of a franklin  to throw light  on the nature of this subtle fluid  to develop the means by which  its effects might be rendered harmless  to turn to useful purposes  a  phenomenon that made the ignorant tremble  that filled their minds with  terror  their hearts with dismay  as indicating the anger of the gods   impressed with this idea  they prostrated themselves  they sacrificed to  jupiter  to deprecate his wrath     be this as it may  whenever we see a cause act  we look upon its effect  as natural  when this cause becomes familiar to the sight  when we are  accustomed to it  we think we understand it  and its effects surprise  us no longer  whenever any unusual effect is perceived  without our  discovering the cause  the mind sets to work  becomes uneasy  this  uneasiness increases in proportion to its extent  as soon as it is  believed to threaten our preservation  we become completely agitated  we  seek after the cause with an earnestness proportioned to our alarm   our perplexity augments in a ratio equivalent to the persuasion we are  under  how essentially requisite it is  we should become acquainted with  the cause that has affected us in so lively a manner  as it frequently  happens that our senses can teach us nothing respecting this cause  which so deeply interests us  which we seek with so much ardour  we have  recourse to our imagination  this  disturbed with alarm  enervated by  fear  becomes a suspicious  a fallacious guide  we create chimeras   fictitious causes  to whom we give the credit  to whom we ascribe the  honour of those phenomena by which we have been so much alarmed  it is  to this disposition of the human mind that must be attributed  as will  be seen in the sequel  the religious errors of man  who  despairing of  the capacity to trace the natural causes of those perplexing phenomena  to which he was the witness  and sometimes the victim  created in his  brain  heated with terror  imaginary causes  which have become to him a  source of the most extravagant folly     in nature  however  there can be only natural causes and effects  all  motion excited in this nature  follows constant and necessary laws  the  natural operations  to the knowledge of which we are competent  of which  we are in a capacity to judge  are of themselves sufficient to enable us  to discover those which elude our sight  we can at least judge of them  by analogy  if we study nature with attention  the modes of action which  she displays to our senses will teach us not to be disconcerted by those  which she refuses to discover  those causes which are the most remote  from their effects  unquestionably act by intermediate causes  by the  aid of these  we can frequently trace out the first  if in the chain of  these causes we sometimes meet with obstacles that oppose themselves  to our research  we ought to endeavour by patience and diligence to  overcome them  when it so happens we cannot surmount the difficulties  that occur  we still are never justified in concluding the chain to be  broken  or that the cause which acts is super natural  let us  then  be  content with an honest avowal  that nature contains resources of which  we are ignorant  but never let us substitute phantoms  fictions  or  imaginary causes  senseless terms  for those causes which escape our  research  because  by such means we only confirm ourselves in ignorance   impede our enquiries  and obstinately remain in error     in spite of our ignorance with respect to the meanderings of nature    for of the essence of being  of their properties  their elements  their  combinations  their proportions  we yet know the simple and general  laws  according to which bodies move   we see clearly  that some of  these laws  common to all beings  never contradict themselves  although   on some occasions  they appear to vary  we are frequently competent to  discover that the cause becoming complex  from combination with other  causes  either impedes or prevents its mode of action being such as  in its primitive state we had a right to expect  we know that active   igneous matter  applied to gunpowder  must necessarily cause it to  explode  whenever this effect does not follow the combination of the  igneous matter with the gunpowder  whenever our senses do not give us  evidence of the fact  we are justified in concluding  either that the  powder is damp  or that it is united with some other substance that  counteracts its explosion  we know that all the actions of man have a  tendency to render him happy  whenever  therefore  we see him labouring  to injure or destroy himself  it is just to infer that he is moved by  some cause opposed to his natural tendency  that he is deceived by some  prejudice  that  for want of experience  he is blind to consequences   that he does not see whither his actions will lead him     if the motion excited in beings was always simple  if their actions did  not blend and combine with each other  it would be easy to know  and we  should be assured  in the first instance  of the effect a cause would  produce  i know that a stone  when descending  ought to describe a  perpendicular  i also know  that if it encounters any other body which  changes its course  it is obliged to take an oblique direction  but if  its fall be interrupted by several contrary powers  which act upon it  alternately  i am no longer competent to determine what line it will  describe  it may be a parabola  an ellipsis  spiral  circular   c  this  will depend on the impulse  it receives  and the powers by which it is  impelled     the most complex motion  however  is never more than the result of  simple motion combined  therefore as soon as we know the general laws of  beings and their action  we have only to decompose  to analyse them  in  order to discover those of which they are combined  experience teaches  us the effects we are to expect  thus it is clear  the simplest motion  causes that necessary junction of different matter  of which all bodies  are composed  that matter  varied in its essence  in its properties   in its combinations  has each its several modes of action or motion   peculiar to itself  the whole motion of a body is consequently the sum  total of each particular motion that is combined     amongst the matter we behold  some is constantly disposed to unite   whilst other is incapable of union  that which is suitable to unite   forms combinations  more or less intimate  possessing more or less  durability  that is to say  with more or less capacity to preserve their  union  to resist dissolution  those bodies which are called solids   receive into their composition a great number of homogeneous  similar   and analogous particles  disposed to unite themselves with energies  conspiring or tending to the same point  the primitive beings  or  elements of bodies  have need of supports  of props  that is to say  of  the presence of each other  for the purpose of preserving themselves   of acquiring consistence or solidity  a truth  which applies with equal  uniformity to what is called  physical   as to what is termed  moral      it is upon this disposition in matter and bodies  with relation to each  other  that is founded those modes of action which natural philosophers  designate by the terms  attraction  repulsion  sympathy  antipathy   affinities  relations   that moralists describe under the names of   love  hatred  friendship  aversion   man  like all the beings in  nature  experiences the impulse of attraction and repulsion  the motion  excited in him differing from that of other beings  only  because it is  more concealed  and frequently so hidden  that neither the causes which  excite it  nor their mode of action are known  this system of attraction  and repulsion is very ancient  although it required a newton to develop  it  that love  to which the ancients attributed the unfolding  or  disentanglement of chaos  appears to have been nothing more than a  personification of the principle of attraction  all their allegories and  fables upon chaos  evidently indicate nothing more than the accord or  union that exists between analogous and homogeneous substances  from  whence resulted the existence of the universe  whilst discord or  repulsion  which they called sois  was the cause of dissolution   confusion  and disorder  there can scarcely remain a doubt  but this was  the origin of the doctrines of the two principles  according to diogenes  laertius  the philosopher  empedocles  asserted  that   there is a  kind of affection by which the elements unite themselves  and a sort of  discord  by which they separate or remove themselves       however it may be  it is sufficient for us to know that by an invariable  law  certain bodies are disposed to unite with more or less facility   whilst others cannot combine or unite themselves  water combines itself  readily with salt  but will not blend with oil  some combinations are  very strong  cohering with great force  as metals  others are extremely  feeble  their cohesion slight and easily decomposed  as in fugitive  colours  some bodies  incapable of uniting by themselves  become  susceptible of union by the agency of other bodies  which serve for  common bonds or mediums  thus  oil and water  naturally heterogeneous   combine and make soap  by the intervention of alkaline salt  from matter  diversely combined  in proportions varied almost to infinity  result  all physical and moral bodies  the properties and qualities of which are  essentially different  with modes of action more or less complex  which  are either understood with facility  or difficult of comprehension   according to the elements or matter that has entered into their  composition  and the various modifications this matter has undergone     it is thus  from the reciprocity of their attraction  the primitive  imperceptible particles of matter  which constitute bodies  become  perceptible  form compound substances  aggregate masses  by the union  of similar and analogous matter  whose essences fit them to cohere  the  same bodies are dissolved  their union broken  whenever they undergo the  action of matter inimical to their junction  thus by degrees are formed   plants  metals  animals  men  each grows  expands  and increases in its  own system or order  sustaining itself in its respective existence   by the continual attraction of analogous matter  to which it becomes  united  and by which it is preserved and strengthened  thus  certain  aliments become fit for the sustenance of man  whilst others destroy his  existence  some are pleasant to him  strengthen his habit  others  are repugnant to him  weaken his system  in short  never to separate  physical from moral laws  it is thus that men  mutually attracted  to each other by their reciprocal wants  form those unions which we  designate by the terms  marriage  families  societies  friendships   connexions  it is thus that virtue strengthens and consolidates them   that vice relaxes or totally dissolves them     of whatever nature may be the combination of beings  their motion has  always one direction or tendency  without direction we could not have  any idea of motion  this direction is regulated by the properties of  each being  as soon as they have any given properties  they necessarily  act in obedience to them  that is to say  they follow the law invariably  determined by these same properties  which  of themselves  constitute  the being such as he is found  and settle his mode of action  which  is always the consequence of his manner of existence  but what is the  general direction  or common tendency  we see in all beings  what is  the visible and known end of all their motion  it is to conserve their  actual existence  to preserve themselves  to strengthen their several  bodies  to attract that which is favorable to them  to repel that  which is injurious them  to avoid that which can harm them  to resist  impulsions contrary to their manner of existence  and to their natural  tendency     to exist  is to experience the motion peculiar to a determinate essence   to conserve this existence  is to give and receive that motion from  which results its maintenance   it is to attract matter suitable  to corroborate its being  to avoid that by which it may be either  endangered or enfeebled  thus  all beings of which we have any  knowledge  have a tendency to conserve themselves  each after its  peculiar manner  the stone  by the firm adhesion of its particles   opposes resistance to its destruction  organized beings conserve  themselves by more complicated means  but which are  nevertheless   calculated to maintain their existence against that by which it may  be injured  man  both in his physical and in his moral capacity  is  a living  feeling  thinking  active being  who  every instant of his  duration  strives equally to avoid that which may be injurious  and to  procure that which is pleasing to him  or that which is suitable to his  mode of existence  all his actions tending solely to conserve himself   st  augustine admits this tendency in all whether organized or not     conservation  then  is the common point to which all the energies  all  the powers  all the faculties of beings  seem continually directed   natural philosophers call this direction or tendency  self gravitation   newton calls it inert force  moralists denominate it in man  self love  which is nothing more than the tendency he has to preserve himself  a  desire of happiness  a love of his own welfare  a wish for pleasure  a  promptitude in seizing on every thing that appears favourable to  his conservation  a marked aversion to all that either disturbs his  happiness  or menaces his existence  primitive sentiments  that are  common to all beings of the human species  which all their faculties are  continually striving to satisfy  which all their passions  their wills   their actions  have eternally for their object and their end  this  self gravitation  then  is clearly a necessary disposition in man   and in all other beings  which  by a variety means  contribute to the  preservation of the existence they have received  as long as nothing  deranges the order of their machine  or its primitive tendency     cause always produces effect  there can be no effect without cause   impulse is always followed by some motion  more or less sensible  by  some change  more or less remarkable in the body which receives it   but motion  and its various modes of displaying itself  is  as has been  already shewn  determined by the nature  the essence  the properties   the combinations of the beings acting  it must  then  be concluded that  motion  or the modes by which beings act  arises from some cause  that  as this cause is not able to move or act  but in conformity with the  manner of its being or its essential properties  it must equally be  concluded  that all the phenomena we perceive are necessary  that every  being in nature  under the circumstances in which it is placed  and with  the given properties it possesses  cannot act otherwise than it does     necessity is the constant and infallible relation of causes with their  effects  fire consumes  of necessity  combustible matter plated within  its circuit of action  man  by fatality  desires either that which  really is  or appears to be serviceable to his welfare  nature  in all  the extraordinary appearances she exhibits  necessarily acts after her  own peculiar essence  all the beings she contains  necessarily act each  after its own a individual nature  it is by motion that the whole has  relation with its parts  and these parts with the whole  it is thus  that in the general system every thing is connected  it is itself but  an immense chain of causes and effects  which flow without ceasing  one  from the other  if we reflect  we shall be obliged to acknowledge that  every thing we see is necessary  that it cannot be otherwise than it is   that all the beings we behold  as well as those which escape our  sight  act by invariable laws  according to these laws  heavy  bodies fall  light bodies ascend  analogous substances attract each  other  beings tend to preserve themselves  man cherishes himself  loves  that which he thinks advantageous  detests that which he has an idea may  prove unfavourable to him   in fine  we are obliged to admit  there  can be no perfectly independent energy  no separated cause  no detached  action  in a nature where all the beings are in a reciprocity of  action  who  without interruption  mutually impel and resist each  other  who is herself nothing more than an eternal circle of motion   given and received according to necessary laws  which under the same  given incidents  invariably produce the same effect     two examples will serve to throw the principle here laid down  into  light  one shall be taken from physics  the other from morals     in a whirlwind of dust  raised by elemental force  confused as it  appears to our eyes  in the most frightful tempest excited by contrary  winds  when the waves roll high as mountains  there is not a single  particle of dust  or drop of water  that has been placed by chance  that  has not a cause for occupying the place where it is found  that does  not  in the most rigorous sense of the word  act after the manner in  which it ought to act  that is  according to its own peculiar essence   and that of the beings from whom it receives this communicated force   a geometrician exactly knew the different energies acting in each case   with the properties of the particles moved  could demonstrate that after  the causes given  each particle acted precisely as it ought to act  and  that it could not have acted otherwise than it did     in those terrible convulsions that sometimes agitate political  societies  shake their foundations  and frequently produce the overthrow  of an empire  there is not a single action  a single word  a single  thought  a single will  a single passion in the agents  whether they act  as destroyers  or as victims  that is not the necessary result of the  causes operating  that does not act  as  of necessity  it must act  from  the peculiar essence of the beings who give the impulse  and that of the  agents who receive it  according to the situation these agents fill in  the moral whirlwind  this could be evidently proved by an understanding  capacitated to rate all the action and re action  of the minds and  bodies of those who contributed to the revolution     in fact  if all be connected in nature  if all motion be produced   the one from the other  notwithstanding their secret communications  frequently elude our sight  we ought to feel convinced of this truth   that there is no cause  however minute  however remote  that does not  sometimes produce the greatest and most immediate effects on man  it  may  perhaps  be in the parched plains of lybia  that are amassed  the first elements of a storm or tempest  which  borne by the winds   approach our climate  render our atmosphere dense  and thus operating  on the temperament  may influence the passions of a man  whose  circumstances shall have capacitated him to influence many others  who  shall decide after his will the fate of many nations     man  in fact  finds himself in nature  and makes a part of it  he acts  according to laws  which are appropriate to him  he receives in a manner  more or less distinct  the action and impulse of the beings who surround  him  who themselves act after laws that are peculiar to their essence   thus he is variously modified  but his actions are always the result of  his own energy  and that of the beings who act upon him  and by whom he  is modified  this is what gives such variety to his determinations  what  generally produces such contradiction in his thoughts  his opinions   his will  his actions  in short  in that motion  whether concealed or  visible  by which he is agitated  we shall have occasion  in the sequel   to place this truth  at present so much contested  in a clearer light   it will be sufficient for our purpose at present to prove  generally   that every thing in nature is necessary  that nothing to be found in it  can act otherwise than it does     motion  alternately communicated and received  establishes the  connection or relation between the different orders of beings  when they  are in the sphere of reciprocal action  attraction approximates  them  repulsion dissolves and separates them  the one strengthens and  preserves them  the other enfeebles and destroys them  once combined   they have a tendency to conserve themselves in that mode of existence   by virtue of their  inert force   in this they cannot succeed  because  they are exposed to the continual influence of all other beings  who  perpetually and successively act upon them  their change of form  their  dissolution  is requisite to the preservation of nature herself  this is  the sole end we are able to assign her  to which we see her tend without  intermission  which she follows without interruption  by the destruction  and reproduction of all subordinate beings  who are obliged to submit to  her laws  to concur  by their mode of action  to the maintenance of her  active existence  so essentially requisite to the great whole     it is thus each being is an individual  who  in the great family   performs his necessary portion of the general labour  who executes the  unavoidable task assigned to him  all bodies act according to laws   inherent in their peculiar essence  without the capability to swerve   even for a single instant  from those according to which nature herself  acts  this is the central power  to which all other powers  essences   and energies  are submitted  she regulates the motions of beings  by the  necessity of her own peculiar essence  she makes them concur by various  modes to the general plan  this appears to be nothing more than the  life  action  and maintenance of the whole  by the continual change of  its parts  this object she obtains  in removing them  one by the other   by that which establishes  and by that which destroys  the relation  subsisting between them  by that which gives them  and that which  deprives them of  their forms  combinations  proportions  and qualities   according to which they act for a time  after a given mode  these are  afterwards taken from them  to make them act after a different manner   it is thus that nature makes them expand and change  grow and decline   augment and diminish  approximate and remove  forms and destroys them   according as she finds it requisite to maintain the whole  towards the  conservation which this nature is herself essentially necessitated to  have a tendency     this irresistible power  this universal necessity  this general energy   then  is only a consequence of the nature of things  by virtue of which  every thing acts  without intermission  after constant and immutable  laws  these laws not varying more for the whole than for the beings of  which it is composed  nature is an active living whole  to which all its  parts necessarily concur  of which  without their own knowledge  they  maintain the activity  the life  and the existence  nature acts and  exists necessarily  all that she contains  necessarily conspires to  perpetuate her active existence  this is the decided opinion of plato   when he says    matter and necessity are the same thing  this necessity  is the mother of the world    in point of fact  we cannot go beyond this  aphorism  matter acts  because it exists  and exists  to act  if it be  enquired how  or for why  matter exists  we answer  we know not  but  reasoning by analogy  of what we do not know by that which we do  we  should be of opinion it exists necessarily  or because it contains  within itself a sufficient reason for its existence  in supposing it to  be created or produced by a being distinguished from it  or less known  than itself   which it may be  for any thing we know to the contrary    we must still admit  that this being is necessary  and includes a  sufficient reason for his own existence  we have not then removed any of  the difficulty  we have not thrown a clearer light upon the subject  we  have not advanced a single step  we have simply laid aside a being   of which we know some few of the properties  but of which we are still  extremely ignorant  to have recourse to a power  of which it is utterly  impossible we can  as long as we are men  form any distinct idea  of  which  notwithstanding it may be a truth  we cannot  by any means we  possess  demonstrate the existence  as  therefore  these must be at best  but speculative points of belief  which each individual  by reason of  its obscurity  may contemplate with different optics  under various  aspects  they surely ought to be left free for each to judge after his  own fashion  the hindoo can have no just cause of enmity against  the christian for his faith  this has no moral right to question  the mussulman upon his  the numerous sects of each of the various  persuasions spread over the face of the earth  ought to make it a creed  to look with an eye of complacency on the deviation of the others   and rest upon that great moral axiom  which is strictly conformable  to nature  which contains the whole of man s happiness    do not unto  another  that which do you not wish another should do unto you    for it  is evident  according to their own doctrines  out of all the variety of  systems  one only can be right     we shall see in the sequel  how much man s imagination labours to  form an idea  of the energies of that nature he has personified  and  distinguished from herself  in short  we shall examine some of the  ridiculous and pernicious inventions  which  for want of understanding  nature  have been imagined to impede her course  to suspend her eternal  laws  to place obstacles to the necessity of things             chap  v      order and confusion   intelligence   chance        the observation of the necessary  regular  and periodical motion in the  universe  generated in the mind of man the idea of order  this term   in its original signification  represents nothing more than a mode of  considering  a facility of perceiving  together and separately  the  different relations of a whole  in which is discovered  by its manner of  existing and acting  a certain affinity or conformity with his own  man   in extending this idea to the universe  carried with him those methods  of considering things which are peculiar to himself  he has consequently  supposed there really existed in nature affinities and relations  which  he classed under the name of order  and others which appeared to him not  to conform to those  which he has ranked under the term of confusion     it is easy to comprehend  that this idea of order and confusion can have  no absolute existence in nature  where every thing is necessary  where  the whole follows constant and invariable laws  which oblige each being   in every moment of its duration  to submit to other laws  which  flow from its own peculiar mode of existence  therefore it is in his  imagination  only  man finds a model of that which he terms order or  confusion  which  like all his abstract  metaphysical ideas  supposes  nothing beyond his reach  order  however  is never more than the faculty  of conforming himself with the beings by whom he is environed  or with  the whole of which he forms a part     nevertheless  if the idea of order be applied to nature  it will be  found to be nothing but a series of action or motion  which he judges  to conspire to one common end  thus  in a body that moves  order is the  chain of action  the series of motion  proper to constitute it what it  is  and to maintain it in its actual state  order  relatively to the  whole of nature  is the concatenation of causes and effects  necessary  to her  active  existence  to maintaining her constantly together  but   as it has been proved in the chapter preceding  every individual being  is obliged to concur to this end  in the different ranks they occupy   from whence it is a necessary deduction  that what is called the order  of nature  can never be more than a certain manner of considering the  necessity of things  to which all  of which man has any knowledge  is  submitted  that which is styled confusion  is only a relative term  used  to designate that series of necessary action  that chain of requisite  motion  by which an individual being is necessarily changed or disturbed  in its mode of existence  by which it is instantaneously obliged to  alter its manner of action  but no one of these actions  no part of  this motion is capable  even for a single instant  of contradicting  or deranging the general order of nature  from which all beings derive  their existence  their properties  the motion appropriate to each     what is termed confusion in a being  is nothing more than its passage  into a new class  a new mode of existence  which necessarily carries  with it a new series of action  a new chain of motion  different from  that of which this being found itself susceptible in the preceding  rank it occupied  that which is called order  in nature  is a mode of  existence  or a disposition of its particles  strictly  necessary   in  every other assemblage of causes and effects  of worlds  as well as  in that which we inhabit  some sort of arrangement  some kind of order  would necessarily be established  suppose the most incongruous  the  most heterogeneous substances were put into activity  and assembled by  a concatenation of extraordinary circumstances  they would form amongst  themselves  a complete order  a perfect arrangement  this is the true  notion of a property  which may be defined  an aptitude to constitute a  being  such as it is actually found  such as it is with respect to the  whole of which it makes a part     order  then  is nothing but necessity  considered relatively to the  series of actions  or the connected chain of causes and effects  that  it produces in the universe  what is the motion in our planetary system   but a series of phenomena  operated upon according to necessary laws   that regulate the bodies of which it is composed  in conformity to these  laws  the sun occupies the centre  the planets gravitate towards it  and  revolve round it  in regulated periods  the satellites of these planets  gravitate towards those which are in the centre of their sphere of  action  and describe round them their periodical route  one of these  planets  the earth which man inhabits  turns on its own axis  and by the  various aspects which its revolution obliges it to present to the sun   experiences those regular variations which are called seasons  by a  sequence of the sun s action upon different parts of this globe  all its  productions undergo vicissitudes  plants  animals  men  are in a sort of  morbid drowsiness during  winter   in  spring   these beings re animate   to come as it were out of a long lethargy  in short  the mode in  which the earth receives the sun s beams  has an influence on all its  productions  these rays  when darted obliquely  do not act in the same  manner as when they fall perpendicularly  their periodical absence   caused by the revolution of this sphere on itself  produces  night  and   day   however  in all this  man never witnesses more than necessary  effects  flowing from the nature of things  which  whilst that remains  the same  can never be opposed with propriety  these effects are owing  to gravitation  attraction  centrifugal power   c     on the other hand  this  order   which man admires as a supernatural  effect  is sometimes disturbed  or changed into what he calls   confusion   this confusion is  however  always a necessary consequence  of the laws of nature  in which it is requisite to the support of the  whole that some of her parts should be deranged and thrown out of the  ordinary course  it is thus  comets present themselves so unexpectedly  to man s wondering eyes  their eccentric motion disturbs the  tranquillity of his planetary system  they excite the terror of the  misinstructed to whom every thing unusual is marvellous  the natural  philosopher  himself  conjectures that in former ages  these comets  have overthrown the surface of this mundane ball  and caused great  revolutions on the earth  independent of this extraordinary  confusion    he is exposed to others more familiar to him  sometimes  the seasons  appear to have usurped each other s place  to have quitted their regular  order  sometimes the opposing elements seem to dispute among themselves  the dominion of the world  the sea bursts its limits  the solid earth  is shaken and rent asunder  mountains are in a state of conflagration   pestilential diseases destroy both men and animals  sterility desolates  a country  then affrighted man utters piercing cries  offers up his  prayers to recall order  tremblingly raises his hands towards the being  he supposes to be the author of all these calamities  nevertheless  the  whole of this afflicting confusion are necessary effects  produced by  natural causes  which act according to fixed laws  determined by their  own peculiar essence  and the universal essence of nature  in which  every thing must necessarily be changed  moved  and dissolved  where  that which is called order  must sometimes be disturbed and altered into  a new mode of existence  which to his deluded mind  to his imagination   led astray by ignorance and want of reflection  appears confusion     there cannot possibly exist what is generally termed  a confusion of  nature   man finds order in every thing that is conformable to his  own mode of being  confusion in every thing by which it is opposed   nevertheless  in nature  all is in order  because none of her parts are  ever able to emancipate themselves from those invariable rules which  flow from their respective essences  there  is  not  there  cannot   be confusion in a whole  to the maintenance of which what is  called   confusion is absolutely requisite  of which the general course can never  be discomposed  although individuals may be  and necessarily are  where  all the effects produced are the consequence of natural causes  that  under the circumstances in which they are placed  act only as they  infallibly are obliged to act     it therefore follows  there can be neither monsters nor prodigies   wonders nor miracles in nature  those which are designated monsters  are  certain combinations  with which the eyes of man are not familiarized   but which  therefore  are not less the necessary effects of natural  causes  those which he terms prodigies  wonders  or supernatural  effects  are phenomena of nature  with whose mode of action he is  unacquainted  of which his ignorance does not permit him to ascertain  the principles  whose causes he cannot trace  but which his impatience   his heated imagination  aided by a desire to explain  makes him  foolishly attribute to imaginary causes  which  like the idea of order   have no existence but in himself  and which  that he may conceal his  own ignorance  that he may obtain more respect with the uninformed   he places beyond nature  out of which his experience is every instant  demonstrably proving that none of these things can have existence     as for those effects which are called miracles  that is to say  contrary  to the unalterable laws of nature  it must be felt such things are  impossible  because  nothing can  for an instant  suspend the necessary  course of beings  without the whole of nature was arrested  without  she was disturbed in her tendency  there have neither been wonders nor  miracles in nature  except for those  who have not sufficiently studied  the laws  who consequently do not feel  that those laws can never be  contradicted  even in the most minute parts  without the whole being  destroyed  or at least without changing her essence  her mode of action   that it is the height of folly to recur to supernatural causes to  explain the phenomena man beholds  before he becomes fully acquainted  with natural causes  with the powers and capabilities which nature  herself contains      order  and  confusion   then  are only relative terms  by which man  designates the state in which particular beings find themselves  he  says  a being is in order  when all the motion it undergoes conspires to  favor its tendency to its own preservation  when it is conducive to the  maintenance of its actual existence  that it is in confusion when the  causes which move it disturb the harmony of its existence  or have a  tendency to destroy the equilibrium necessary to the conservation of its  actual state  nevertheless  confusion  as we have shown  is nothing but  the passage of a being into a new order  the more rapid the progress   the greater the confusion for the being that is submitted to it  that  which conducts man to what is called death  is  for him  the greatest  of all possible confusion  yet this death is nothing more than a passage  into a new mode of existence  it is the eternal  the invariable  the  unconquerable law of nature  to which the individuals of his order  each  in his turn  is obliged to submit     the human body is said to be in order  when its various component parts  act in that mode  from which results the conservation of the whole  from  which emanates that which is the tendency of his actual existence   in other words  when all the impulse he receives  all the motion he  communicates  tends to preserve his health  to render him happy  by  promoting the happiness of his fellow men  he is said to be in health  when the fluids and solids of his body concur to render him robust  to  keep his mind in vigour  when each lends mutual aid towards this end  he  is said to be in  confusion   or in ill health  whenever this tendency  is disturbed  when any of the essential parts of his body cease to  concur to his preservation  or to fulfil its peculiar functions  this  it is that happens in a state of sickness  in which  however  the motion  excited in the human machine is as necessary  is regulated by laws as  certain  as natural  as invariable  as that which concurs to produce  health  sickness merely produces in him a new order of motion  a new  series of action  a new chain of things  man dies  to him  this appears  the greatest confusion he can experience  his body is no longer what it  was  its parts no longer concur to the same end  his blood has lost  its circulation  he is deprived of feeling  his ideas have vanished  he  thinks no more  his desires have fled  death is the epoch  the cessation  of his human existence   his frame becomes an inanimate mass  by the  subtraction of those principles by which it was animated  that is  which  made it act after a determinate manner  its tendency has received a  new direction  its action is changed  the motion excited in its ruins  conspires to a new end  to that motion  the harmony of which he calls  order  which produced life  sentiment  thought  passions  health   succeeds a series of motion of another species  that  nevertheless   follows laws as necessary as the first  all the parts of the dead  man conspire to produce what is called dissolution  fermentation   putrefaction  these new modes of being  of acting  are just as natural  to man  reduced to this state  as sensibility  thought  the periodical  motion of the blood   c  were to the living man  his essence having  changed  his mode of action can no longer be the same  to that regulated  motion  to that necessary action  which conspired to the production  of life  succeeds that determinate motion  that series of action which  concurs to produce the dissolution of the dead carcass  the dispersion  of its parts  the formation of new combinations  from which result new  beings  and which  as we have before seen  is the immutable order of  active nature     how then can it be too often repeated  that relatively to the great  whole  all the motion of beings  all their modes of action  can never be  but in order  that is to say  are always conformable to nature  that in  all the stages through which beings are obliged to pass  they invariably  act after a mode necessarily subordinate to the universal whole  to say  more  each individual being always acts in order  all its actions   the whole system of its motion  are the necessary consequence of its  peculiar mode of existence  whether that be momentary or durable  order   in political society  is the effect of a necessary series of ideas   of wills  of actions  in those who compose it  whose movements are  regulated in a manner  either calculated to maintain its indivisibility   or to hasten its dissolution  man constituted  or modified  in the  manner we term virtuous  acts necessarily in that mode  from whence  results the welfare of his associates  the man we stile wicked  acts  necessarily in that mode  from whence springs the misery of his fellows   his nature  being essentially different  he must necessarily act after  a different mode  his individual order is at variance  but his relative  order is complete  it is equally the essence of the one  to promote  happiness  as it is of the other to induce misery     thus  order and confusion in individual beings  is nothing more than  the manner of man s considering the natural and necessary effects  which  they produce relatively to himself  he fears the wicked man  he says  that he will carry confusion into society  because he disturbs its  tendency and places obstacles to its happiness  he avoids a falling  stone  because it will derange in him the order necessary to his  conservation  nevertheless  order and confusion  are always  as we  have shewn  consequences  equally necessary to either the transient or  durable state of beings  it is in order that fire burns  because it  is of its essence to burn  on the other hand  it is in order  that an  intelligent being should remove himself from whatever can disturb his  mode of existence  a being  whose organization renders him sensible   must in virtue of his essence  fly from every thing that can injure his  organs  or that can place his existence in danger     man calls those beings  intelligent   who are organized after his  own manner  in whom he sees faculties proper for their preservation   suitable to maintain their existence in the order that is convenient to  them  that can enable them to take the necessary measures towards this  end  with a consciousness of the motion they undergo  from hence  it  will be perceived  that the faculty called intelligence  consists in a  possessing capacity to act comformably to a known end  in the being  to which it is attributed  he looks upon these beings as deprived of  intelligence  in which he finds no conformity with himself  in whom  he discovers neither the same construction  nor the same faculties   of which he knows neither the essence  the end to which they tend  the  energies by which they act  nor the order that is necessary to them  the  whole cannot have a distinct name  or end  because there is nothing out  of itself  to which it can have a tendency  if it be in himself  that  he arranges the idea of  order   it is also in himself  that he draws up  that of  intelligence   he refuses to ascribe it to those beings  who  do not act after his own manner  he accords it to all those whom he  supposes to act like himself  the latter he calls intelligent agents   the former blind causes  that is to say  intelligent agents who act  by  chance   thus chance is an empty word without sense  but which  is always opposed to that of intelligence  without attaching any  determinate  or any certain idea     man  in fact  attributes to  chance  all those effects  of which the  connection they have with their causes is not seen  thus he uses the  word  chance   to cover his ignorance of those natural causes  which  produce visible effects  by means which he cannot form an idea of  or  that act by a mode of which he does not perceive the order  or whose  system is not followed by actions conformable to his own  as soon as he  sees  or believes he sees  the order of action  or the manner of motion   he attributes this order to an  intelligence   which is nothing more  than a quality borrowed from himself  from his own peculiar mode of  action  from the manner in which he is himself affected     thus an  intelligent being  is one who thinks  who wills  and who acts   to compass an end  if so  he must have organs  an aim conformable to  those of man  therefore  to say nature is governed by an intelligence   is to affirm that she is governed by a being  furnished with organs   seeing that without this organic construction  he can neither have  sensations  perceptions  ideas  thought  will  plan  nor action which he  understands     man always makes himself the center of the universe  it is to himself  that he relates all he beholds  as soon as he believes he discovers a  mode of action that has a conformity with his own  or some phenomenon  that interests his feelings  he attributes it to a cause that resembles  himself  that acts after his manner  that has faculties similar to those  he possesses  whose interests are like his own  whose projects are in  unison with and have the same tendency as those he himself indulges  in  short  it is from himself  or the properties which actuate him  that he  forms the model of this cause  it is thus that man beholds  out of his  own species  nothing but beings who act differently from himself   yet believes that he remarks in nature an order similar to his own  ideas  views conformable to those which he himself possesses  he  imagines that nature is governed by a cause whose intelligence is  conformable to his own  to whom he ascribes the honor of the order which  he believes he witnesses  of those views that fall in with those that  are peculiar to himself  of an aim which quadrates with that which is  the great end of all his own actions  it is true that man  feeling his  incapability of producing the vast  the multiplied effects of which he  witnesses the operation  when contemplating the universe  was under the  necessity of making a distinction between himself and the cause which  he supposed to be the author of such stupendous effects  he believed  he removed every difficulty  by amplifying in this cause all those  faculties of which he was himself in possession  adding others of which  his own self love made him desirous  or which he thought would render  his being more perfect  thus  he gave jupiter wings  with the faculty of  assuming any form he might deem convenient  it was thus  by degrees   he arrived at forming an idea of that intelligent cause  which he has  placed above nature  to preside over action  to give her that motion  of which he has chosen to believe she was in herself incapable  he  obstinately persists in regarding this nature as a heap of dead  inert  matter  without form  which has not within itself the power of producing  any of those great effects  those regular phenomena  from which emanates  what he styles  the order of the universe   anaxagoras is said to have  been the first who supposed the universe created and governed by an  intelligence  aristotle reproaches him with having made an automaton  of this intelligence  or in other words  with ascribing to it the  production of things  only when he was at a loss to account for their  appearance  from whence it may be deduced  that it is for want of being  acquainted with the powers of nature  or the properties of matter  that  man has multiplied beings without necessity  that he has supposed the  universe under the government of an intelligent cause  which he is  and  perhaps always will be  himself the model  in fine  this cause has been  personified under such a variety of shapes  sexes  and names  that  a list of the deities he has at various times supposed to guide this  nature  or to whom he has submitted her  makes a large volume that  occupies some years of his youthful education to understand  he only  rendered this cause more inconceivable  when he extended in it his own  faculties too much  he either annihilates  or renders it altogether  impossible  when he would attach to it incompatible qualities  which  he is obliged to do  to enable him to account for the contradictory and  disorderly effects he beholds in the world  in fact  he sees confusion  in the world  yet  notwithstanding his confusion contradicts the  plan  the power  the wisdom  the bounty of this intelligence  and the  miraculous order which he ascribes to it  he says  the extreme beautiful  arrangement of the whole  obliges him to suppose it to be the work of  a sovereign intelligence  unable  however  to reconcile this seeming  confusion with the benevolence he attaches to this cause  he had  recourse to another effort of his imagination  he made a new cause   to whom he ascribed all the evil  all the misery  resulting from this  confusion  still  his own person served for the model  to which he  added those deformities which he had learned to hold in disrespect  in  multiplying these counter or destroying causes  he peopled pandemonium     it will no doubt be argued  that as nature contains and produces  intelligent beings  either she must be herself intelligent  or else she  must be governed by an intelligent cause  we reply  intelligence is  a faculty peculiar to organized beings  that it is to say  to beings  constituted and combined after a determinate manner  from whence results  certain modes of action  which are designated under various names   according to the different effects which these beings produce  wine  has not the properties called  wit  and  courage   nevertheless  it  is sometimes seen that it communicates those qualities to men  who are  supposed to be in themselves entirely devoid of them  it cannot be  said nature is intelligent after the manner of any of the beings she  contains  but she can produce intelligent beings by assembling matter  suitable to their particular organization  from whose peculiar modes of  action will result the faculty called intelligence  who shall be capable  of producing certain effects which are the necessary consequence of this  property  i therefore repeat  that to have intelligence  designs and  views  it is requisite to have ideas  to the production of ideas  organs  or senses are necessary  this is what is neither said of nature nor  of the causes he has supposed to preside over her actions  in short  experience warrants the assertion  it does more  it proves beyond  a doubt  that matter  which is regarded as inert and dead  assumes  sensible action  intelligence  and life  when it is combined and  organized after particular modes     from what has been said  it must rationally be concluded that  order  is  never more than the necessary or uniform connection of causes with  their effects  or that series of action which flows from the peculiar  properties of beings  so long as they remain in a given state  that   confusion  is nothing more than the change of this state  that in the  universe  all is necessarily in order  because every thing acts and  moves according to the various properties of the different beings it  contains  that in nature there cannot be either confusion or real evil   since every thing follows the laws of its natural existence  that there  is neither  chance  nor any thing fortuitous in this nature  where no  effect is produced without a sufficient  without a substantial cause   where all causes act necessarily according to fixed and certain laws   which are themselves dependant on the essential properties of these  causes or beings  as well as on the combination  which constitutes  either their transitory or permanent state  that intelligence is a mode  of acting  a method of existence natural to some particular beings  that  if this intelligence should be attributed to nature  it would then be  nothing more than the faculty of conserving herself in active existence  by necessary means  in refusing to nature the intelligence he himself  enjoys  in rejecting the intelligent cause which is supposed to be the  contriver of this nature  or the principle of that  order  he discovers  in her course  nothing is given to  chance   nothing to a blind cause   nothing to a power which is indistinguishable  but every thing he  beholds is attributed to real  to known causes  or to those which by  analogy are easy of comprehension  all that exists is acknowledged to  be a consequence of the inherent properties of eternal matter  which by  contact  by blending  by combination  by change of form  produces order  and confusion  with all those varieties which assail his sight  it  is himself who is blind  when he imagines blind causes   man only  manifested his ignorance of the powers of motion  of the laws of nature   when he attributed  any of its effects to  chance   he did not shew a  more enlightened feeling when he ascribed them to an intelligence  the  idea of which he borrowed from himself  but which is never in conformity  with the effects which he attributes to its intervention  he only  imagined words to supply the place of things  he made jupiter  saturn   juno  and a thousand others  operate that which he found himself  inadequate to perform  he distinguished them from nature  gave them an  amplification of his own properties  and believed he understood them by  thus obscuring ideas  which he never dared either define or analyze             chap  vi      moral and physical distinctions of man   his origin        let us now apply the general laws we have scrutinized  to those beings  of nature who interest us the most  let us see in what man differs from  the other beings by which he is surrounded  let us examine if he has not  certain points in conformity with them  that oblige him  notwithstanding  the different properties they respectively possess  to act in certain  respects according to the universal laws to which every thing is  submitted  finally  let us enquire if the ideas he has formed of himself  in meditating on his own peculiar mode of existence  be chimerical  or  founded in reason     man occupies a place amidst that crowd  that multitude of beings   of which nature is the assemblage  his essence  that is to say  the  peculiar manner of existence  by which he is distinguished from other  beings  renders him susceptible of various modes of action  of a variety  of motion  some of which are simple and visible  others concealed and  complicated  his life itself is nothing more than a long series  a  succession of necessary and connected motion  which operates perpetual  changes in his machine  which has for its principle either causes  contained within himself  such as blood  nerves  fibres  flesh  bones   in short  the matter  as well solid as fluid  of which his body is  composed  or those exterior causes  which  by acting upon him  modify  him diversely  such as the air with which he is encompassed  the  aliments by which he is nourished  and all those objects from which  he receives any impulse whatever  by the impression they make on his  senses     man  like all other beings in nature  tends to his own destruction  he  experiences inert force  he gravitates upon himself  he is attracted by  objects that are contrary or repugnant to his existence  he seeks after  some  he flies  or endeavours to remove himself from others  it is this  variety of action  this diversity of modification of which the human  being is susceptible  that has been designated under such different  names  by such varied nomenclature  it will be necessary  presently  to  examine these closely and go more into detail     however marvellous  however hidden  however secret  however complicated  may be the modes of action  which the human frame undergoes  whether  interiorly or exteriorly  whatever may be  or appear to be the impulse  he either receives or communicates  examined closely  it will be found  that all his motion  all his operations  all his changes  all his  various states  all his revolutions  are constantly regulated by the  same laws  which nature has prescribed to all the beings she brings  forth  which she developes  which she enriches with faculties  of which  she increases the bulk  which she conserves for a season  which she ends  by decomposing  by destroying  obliging them to change their form     man  in his origin  is an imperceptible point  a speck  of which the  parts are without form  of which the mobility  the life  escapes his  senses  in short  in which he does not perceive any sign of those  qualities  called sentiment  feeling  thought  intelligence  force   reason   c  placed in the womb suitable to his expansion  this point  unfolds  extends  increases  by the continual addition of matter he  attracts  that is analogous to his being  which consequently assimilates  itself with him  having quitted this womb  so appropriate to conserve  his existence  to unfold his qualities  to strengthen his habits  so  competent to give  for a season  consistence to the weak rudiments of  his frame  he travels through the stage of infancy  he becomes adult   his body has then acquired a considerable extension of bulk  his motion  is marked  his action is visible  he is sensible in all his parts  he is  a living  an active mass  that is to say  a combination that feels and  thinks  that fulfils the functions peculiar to beings of his species   but how has he become sensible  because he has been by degrees  nourished  enlarged  repaired by the continual attraction that takes  place within himself  of that kind of matter which is pronounced inert   insensible  inanimate  which is  nevertheless  continually combining  itself with his machine  of which it forms an active whole  that is  living  that feels  judges  reasons  wills  deliberates  chooses   elects  that has the capability of labouring  more or less  efficaciously  to his own individual preservation  that is to say  to  the maintenance of the harmony of his existence     all the motion and changes that man experiences in the course of his  life  whether it be from exterior objects or from those substances  contained within himself  are either favorable or prejudicial to his  existence  either maintain its order  or throw it into confusion  are  either in conformity with  or repugnant to  the essential tendency of  his peculiar mode of being  he is compelled by nature to approve of  some  to disapprove of others  some of necessity render him happy   others contribute to his misery  some become the objects of his most  ardent desire  others of his determined aversion  some elicit his  confidence  others make him tremble with fear     in all the phenomena man presents  from the moment he quits the womb  of his mother  to that wherein he becomes the inhabitant of the silent  tomb  he perceives nothing but a succession of necessary causes and  effects  which are strictly conformable to those laws that are common  to all the beings in nature  all his modes of action  all his  sensations  all his ideas  all his passions  every act of his  will  every impulse which he either gives or receives  are the necessary  consequences of his own peculiar properties  and those which he finds in  the various beings by whom he is moved  every thing he does  every thing  that passes within himself  his concealed motion  his visible action   are the effects of inert force  of self gravitation  the attractive or  repulsive powers contained in his machine  of the tendency he has  in  common with other beings  to his own individual preservation  in short   of that energy which is the common property of every being he beholds   nature  in man  does nothing more than shew  in a decided manner  what  belongs to the peculiar nature by which he is distinguished from the  beings of a different system or order     the source of those errors into which man has fallen  when he has  contemplated himself  has its rise  as will presently be shown  in the  opinion he has entertained  that he moved by himself  that he always  acts by his own natural energy  that in his actions  in the will that  gave him impulse  he was independent of the general laws of nature  and  of those objects which  frequently  without his knowledge  always in  spite of him  in obedience to these laws  are continually acting upon  him  if he had examined himself attentively  he must have acknowledged   that none of the motion he underwent was spontaneous  he must have  discovered  that even his birth depended on causes  wholly out of the  reach of his own powers  that  it was without his own consent he entered  into the system in which he occupies a place  that  from the moment  in which he is born  until that in which he dies  he is continually  impelled by causes  which  in spite of himself  influence his frame   modify his existence  dispose of his conduct  would not the slightest  reflection have sufficed to prove to him  that the fluids  the solids   of which his body is composed  as well as that concealed mechanism   which he believes to be independent of exterior causes  are  in fact   perpetually under the influence of these causes  that without them he  finds himself in a total incapacity to act  would he not have seen   that his temperament  his constitution  did in no wise depend on  himself  that his passions are the necessary consequence of this  temperament  that his will is influenced  his actions determined by  these passions  consequently by opinions  which he has not given to  himself  of which he is not the master  his blood  more or less heated  or abundant  his nerves more or less braced  his fibres more or less  relaxed  give him dispositions either transitory or durable  are not  these  at every moment decisive of his ideas  of his thoughts  of his  desires  of his fears  of his motion  whether visible or concealed  the  state in which he finds himself  does it not necessarily depend on the  air which surrounds him diversely modified  on the various properties  of the aliments which nourish him  on the secret combinations that form  themselves in his machine  which either preserve its order  or throw it  into confusion  in short  had man fairly studied himself  every thing  must have convinced him  that in every moment of his duration  he was  nothing more than a passive instrument in the hands of necessity     thus it must appear  that where all is connected  where all the causes  are linked one to the other  where the whole forms but one immense  chain  there cannot be any independent  any isolated energy  any  detached power  it follows then  that nature  always in action  marks  out to man each point of the line he is bound to describe  establishes  the route  by which he must travel  it is nature that elaborates  that  combines the elements of which he must be composed   it is nature that  gives him his being  his tendency  his peculiar mode of action  it is  nature that develops him  expands him  strengthens him  increases his  bulk  preserves him for a season  during which he is obliged to fulfil  the task imposed on him  it is nature  that in his journey through life   strews on the road those objects  those events  those adventures   that modify him in a variety of ways  that give him impulses which  are sometimes agreeable and beneficial  at others prejudicial and  disagreeable  it is nature  that in giving him feeling  in supplying him  with sentiment  has endowed him with capacity to choose  the means to  elect those objects  to take those methods that are most conducive  most  suitable  most natural  to his conservation  it is nature  who when he  has run his race  when he has finished his career  when he has  described the circle marked out for him  conducts him in his turn to  his destruction  dissolves the union of his elementary particles   and obliges him to undergo the constant  the universal law  from the  operation of which nothing is exempted  it is thus  motion places man in  the matrix of his mother  brings him forth out of her womb  sustains  him for a season  at length destroys him  obliges him to return into  the bosom of nature  who speedily reproduces him  scattered under an  infinity of forms  in which each of his particles run over again  in the  same manner  the different stages  as necessary as the whole had before  run over those of his preceding existence     the beings of the human species  as well as all other beings  are  susceptible of two sorts of motion  the one  that of the mass  by which  an entire body  or some of its parts  are visibly transferred from one  place to another  the other  internal and concealed  of some of which  man is sensible  while some takes place without his knowledge  and is  not even to be guessed at  but by the effect it outwardly produces  in a  machine so extremely complex as man  formed by the combination of such  a multiplicity of matter  so diversified in its properties  so different  in its proportions  so varied in its modes of action  the motion  necessarily becomes of the most complicated kind  its dullness  as well  as its rapidity  frequently escapes the observation of those themselves   in whom it takes place     let us not  then  be surprised  if  when man would account to himself  for his existence  for his manner of acting  finding so many obstacles  to encounter  he invented such strange hypotheses to explain the  concealed spring of his machine  if then this motion appeared to him   to be different from that of other bodies  he conceived an idea  that he  moved and acted in a manner altogether distinct from the other beings in  nature  he clearly perceived that his body  as well as different parts  of it  did act  but  frequently  he was unable to discover what  brought them into action  from whence he received the impulse  he then  conjectured he contained within himself a moving principle distinguished  from his machine  which secretly gave an impulse to the springs which  set this machine in motion  that moved him by its own natural energy   that consequently he acted according to laws totally distinct from those  which regulated the motion of other beings  he was conscious of certain  internal motion  which he could not help feeling  but how could he  conceive  that this invisible motion was so frequently competent to  produce such striking effects  how could he comprehend  that a fugitive  idea  an imperceptible act of thought  was so frequently capacitated  to bring his whole being into trouble and confusion  he fell into the  belief  that he perceived within himself a substance distinguished from  that self  endowed with a secret force  in which he supposed existed  qualities distinctly differing from those  of either the visible  causes that acted on his organs  or those organs themselves  he did not  sufficiently understand  that the primitive cause which makes a stone  fall  or his arm move  are perhaps as difficult of comprehension   as arduous to be explained  as those internal impulses  of which his  thought or his will are the effects  thus  for want of meditating  nature  of considering her under her true point of view  of remarking  the conformity  of noticing the simultaneity  the unity of the motion  of this fancied motive power with that of his body  of his material  organs  he conjectured he was not only a distinct being  but that he was  set apart  with different energies  from all the other beings in nature   that he was of a more simple essence having nothing in common with any  thing by which he was surrounded  nothing that connected him with all  that he beheld     it is from thence has successively sprung his notions of spirituality   immateriality  immortality  in short  all those vague unmeaning words  he has invented by degrees  in order to subtilize and designate the  attributes of the unknown power  which he believes he contains within  himself  which he conjectures to be the concealed principle of all his  visible actions when man once imbibes an idea that he cannot comprehend   he meditates upon it until he has given it a complete personification   thus he saw  or fancied he saw  the igneous matter pervade every thing   he conjectured that it was the only principle of life and activity  he  proceeded to embody it  he gave it his own form  called it jupiter  and  ended by worshipping this image of his own creation  as the power from  whom he derived every good he experienced  every evil he sustained   to crown the bold conjectures he ventured to make on this internal  motive power  he supposed  that different from all other beings  even  from the body that served to envelope it  it was not bound to undergo  dissolution  that such was its perfect simplicity  that it could not  be decomposed  nor even change its form  in short  that it was by  its essence exempted from those revolutions to which he saw the body  subjected  as well as all the compound beings with which nature is  filled     thus man  in his own ideas  became double  he looked upon himself as a  whole  composed by the inconceivable assemblage of two different  two  distinct natures  which have no point of analogy between themselves  he  distinguished two substances in himself  one evidently submitted to  the influence of gross beings  composed of coarse inert matter  this  he called body   the other  which he supposed to be simple  of a purer  essence  was contemplated as acting from itself  giving motion to the  body  with which it found itself so miraculously united  this he called  soul  or spirit  the functions of the one  he denominated  physical   corporeal  material   the functions of the other he styled  spiritual   intellectual   man  considered relatively to the first  was termed the  physical man  viewed with relation to the last  he was designated the  moral man  these distinctions  although adopted by the greater number of  the philosophers of the present day  are  nevertheless  only founded  on gratuitous suppositions  man has always believed he remedied his  ignorance of things  by inventing words to which he could never attach  any true sense or meaning  he imagined he understood matter  its  properties  its faculties  its resources  its different combinations   because he had a superficial glimpse of some of its qualities  he has   however  in reality  done nothing more than obscure the faint ideas he  has been capacitated to form of this matter  by associating it with a  substance much less intelligible than itself  it is thus  speculative  man  in forming words  in multiplying beings  has only plunged himself  into greater difficulties than those he endeavoured to avoid  and  thereby placed obstacles to the progress of his knowledge  whenever he  has been deficient of facts  he has had recourse to conjecture  which he  quickly changed into fancied realities  thus  his imagination  no longer  guided by experience  hurried on by his new ideas  was lost  without  hope of return  in the labyrinth of an ideal  of an intellectual world   to which he had himself given birth  it was next to impossible to  withdraw him from this delusion  to place him in the right road  of  which nothing but experience can furnish him the clue  nature points out  to man  that in himself  as well as in all those objects which act upon  him  there is never more than matter endowed with various properties   diversely modified  that acts by reason of these properties  that man is  an organized whole  composed of a variety of matter  that like all the  other productions of nature  he follows general and known laws  as  well as those laws or modes of action which are peculiar to himself and  unknown     thus  when it shall be inquired  what is man     we say  he is a material being  organized after a peculiar manner   conformed to a certain mode of thinking  of feeling  capable  of modification in certain modes peculiar to himself  to his  organization  to that particular combination of matter which is found  assembled in him     if  again  it be asked  what origin we give to beings of the human  species     we reply  that  like all other beings  man is a production of nature   who resembles them in some respects  and finds himself submitted to  the same laws  who differs from them in other respects  and follows  particular laws  determined by the diversity of his conformation     if  then  it be demanded  whence came man     we answer  our experience on this head does not capacitate us to resolve  the question  but that it cannot interest us  as it suffices for us to  know that man exists  that he is so constituted  as to be competent to  the effects we witness     but it will be urged  has man always existed  has the human species  existed from all eternity  or is it only an instantaneous production of  nature  have there been always men like ourselves  will there always  be such  have there been  in all times  males and females  was there a  first man  from whom all others are descended  was the animal anterior  to the egg  or did the egg precede the animal  is this species without  beginning  will it also be without end  the species itself  is it  indestructible  or does it pass away like its individuals  has man  always been what he now is  or has he  before he arrived at the state in  which we see him  been obliged to pass under an infinity of successive  developements  can man at last flatter himself with having arrived at  a fixed being  or must the human species again change  if man is the  production of nature  it will perhaps be asked  is this nature competent  to the production of new beings  to make the old species disappear   adopting this supposition  it may be inquired  why nature does not  produce under our own eyes new beings  new species     it would appear on reviewing these questions  to be perfectly  indifferent  as to the stability of the argument we have used  which  side was taken  that  for want of experience  hypothesis must settle a  curiosity that always endeavours to spring forward beyond the boundaries  prescribed to our mind  this granted  the contemplator of nature will  say  that he sees no contradiction  in supposing the human species  such  as it is at the present day  was either produced in the course of time   or from all eternity  he will not perceive any advantage that can arise  from supposing that it has arrived by different stages  or successive  developements  to that state in which it is actually found  matter is  eternal  it is necessary  but its forms are evanescent and contingent   it may be asked of man  is he any thing more than matter combined  of  which the former varies every instant     notwithstanding  some reflections seem to favor the supposition  to  render more probable the hypothesis  that man is a production formed in  the course of time  who is peculiar to the globe he inhabits  who is the  result of the peculiar laws by which it is directed  who  consequently   can only date his formation as coeval with that of his planet  existence  is essential to the universe  or the total assemblage of matter  essentially varied that presents itself to our contemplation  the  combinations  the forms  however  are not essential  this granted   although the matter of which the earth is composed has always existed   this earth may not always have had its present form  its actual  properties  perhaps it may be a mass detached in the course of time from  some other celestial body   perhaps it is the result of the spots  or  those encrustations which astronomers discover in the sun s disk   which have had the faculty to diffuse themselves over our planetary  system   perhaps the sphere we inhabit may be an extinguished or a  displaced comet  which heretofore occupied some other place in the  regions of space   which  consequently  was then competent to produce  beings very different from those we now behold spread over its surface   seeing that its then position  its nature  must have rendered its  productions different from those which at this day it offers to our  view     whatever may be the supposition adopted  plants  animals  men  can only  be regarded as productions inherent in and natural to our globe  in the  position and in the circumstances in which it is actually found  these  productions it would be reasonable to infer would be changed  if this  globe by any revolution should happen to shift its situation  what  appears to strengthen this hypothesis  is  that on our ball itself  all  the productions vary  by reason of its different climates  men  animals   vegetables  minerals  are not the same on every part of it  they vary  sometimes in a very sensible manner  at very inconsiderable distances   the elephant is indigenous to  or native of the torrid zone  the rein  deer is peculiar to the frozen climates of the north  indostan is the  womb that matures the diamond  we do not find it produced in our own  country  the pine apple grows in the common atmosphere of america  in  our climate it is never produced in the open ground  never until art has  furnished a sun analogous to that which it requires  the european in his  own climate finds not this delicious fruit  man in different climates  varies in his colour  in his size  in his conformation  in his powers   in his industry  in his courage  and in the faculties of his mind  but   what is it that constitutes climate  it is the different position of  parts of the same globe  relatively to the sun  positions that suffice  to make a sensible variety in its productions     there is  then  sufficient foundation to conjecture that if by any  accident our globe should become displaced  all its productions would of  necessity be changed  seeing that causes being no longer the same  or  no longer acting after the same manner  the effects would necessarily no  longer be what they now are  all productions  that they may be able to  conserve themselves  or maintain their actual existence  have occasion  to co order themselves with the whole from which they have emanated   without this they would no longer be in a capacity to subsist  it is  this faculty of co ordering themselves   this relative adaption  which  is called the order of the universe  the want of it is called confusion   those productions which are treated as monstrous  are such as are unable  to co order themselves with the general or particular laws of the beings  who surround them  or with the whole in which they find themselves  placed  they have had the faculty in their formation to accommodate  themselves to these laws  but these very laws are opposed to their  perfection  for this reason they are unable to subsist  it is thus that  by a certain analogy of conformation  which exists between animals of  different species  mules are easily produced  but these mules  unable to  co order themselves with the beings that surround them  are not able to  reach perfection  consequently cannot propagate their species  man can  live only in air  fish only in water  put the man into the water  the  fish into the air  not being able to co order themselves with the fluids  which surround them  these animals will quickly be destroyed  transport  by imagination  a man from our planet into saturn  his lungs will  presently be rent by an atmosphere too rarified for his mode of being   his members will be frozen with the intensity of the cold  he will  perish for want of finding elements analogous to his actual existence   transport another into mercury  the excess of heat  beyond what his mode  of existence can bear  will quickly destroy him     thus  every thing seems to authorise the conjecture  that the human  species is a production peculiar to our sphere  in the position in which  it is found  that when this position may happen to change  the human  species will  of consequence  either be changed or will be obliged to  disappear  seeing that there would not then be that with which man could  co order himself with the whole  or connect himself with that which can  enable him to subsist  it is this aptitude in man to co order himself  with the whole  that not only furnishes him with the idea of order  but  also makes him exclaim   whatever is  is right    whilst every thing is  only that which it can be  as long as the whole is necessarily what it  is  whilst it is positively neither good nor bad  as we understand those  terms  it is only requisite to displace a man  to make him accuse the  universe of confusion     these reflections would appear to contradict the ideas of those  who  are willing to conjecture that the other planets  like our own  are  inhabited by beings resembling ourselves  but if the laplander differs  in so marked a manner from the hottentot  what difference ought we not  rationally to suppose between an inhabitant of our planet and one of  saturn or of venus     however it may be  if we are obliged to recur by imagination to the  origin of things  to the infancy of the human species  we may say that  it is probable that man was a necessary consequence of the disentangling  of our globe  or one of the results of the qualities  of the  properties  of the energies  of which it is susceptible in its present  position  that he was born male and female  that his existence is  co ordinate with that of the globe  under its present position  that as  long as this co ordination shall subsist  the human specie will conserve  himself  will propagate himself  according to the impulse  after  the primitive laws  which he has originally received  that if this  co ordination should happen to cease  if the earth  displaced  should  cease to receive the same impulse  the same influence  on the part of  those causes which actually act upon it  or which give it energy  that  then the human species would change  to make place for new beings   suitable to co order themselves with the state that should succeed to  that which we now see subsist     in thus supposing the changes in the position of our globe  the  primitive man did  perhaps  differ more from the actual man  than the  quadruped differs from the insect  thus man  the same as every thing  else that exists on our planet  as well as in all the others  may be  regarded as in a state of continual vicissitude  thus the last term of  the existence of man is to us as unknown and as indistinct as the first   there is  therefore  no contradiction in the belief that the species  vary incessantly  that to us it is as impossible to know what he will  become  as to know what he has been     with respect to those who may ask why nature does not produce new  beings  we may enquire of them in turn  upon what foundation they  suppose this fact  what it is that authorizes them to believe this  sterility in nature  know they if  in the various combinations which  she is every instant forming  nature be not occupied in producing new  beings  without the cognizance of these observers  who has informed them  that this nature is not actually assembling  in her immense elaboratory   the elements suitable to bring to light  generations entirely new   that will have nothing in common with those of the species at present  existing  what absurdity then  or what want of just inference would  there be  to imagine that the man  the horse  the fish  the bird  will  be no more  are these animals so indispensably requisite to nature  that  without them she cannot continue her eternal course  does not all change  around us  do we not ourselves change  is it not evident that the whole  universe has not been  in its anterior eternal duration  rigorously the  same that it now is  that it is impossible  in its posterior eternal  duration  it can be rigidly in the same state that it now is for a  single instant  how  then  pretend to divine that  to which the  infinite succession of destruction  of reproduction  of combination  of  dissolution  of metamorphosis  of change  of transposition  may be able  eventually to conduct it by their consequence  suns encrust themselves   and are extinguished  planets perish and disperse themselves in the vast  plains of air  other suns are kindled  and illumine their systems  new  planets form themselves  either to make revolutions round these suns   or to describe new routes  and man  an infinitely small portion of the  globe  which is itself but an imperceptible point in the immensity  of space  vainly believes it is for himself this universe is made   foolishly imagines he ought to be the confident of nature  confidently  flatters himself he is eternal  and calls himself king of the  universe       o man  wilt thou never conceive  that thou art but an ephemeron  all  changes in the great macrocosm  nothing remains the same an instant  in  the planet thou inhabitest  nature contains no one constant form  yet  thou pretendest thy species can never disappear  that thou shalt be  exempted from the universal law  that wills all shall experience  change  alas  in thy actual being  art not thou submitted to continual  alterations  thou  who in thy folly  arrogantly assumest to thyself the  title of king of nature  thou  who measurest the earth and the heavens   thou  who in thy vanity imaginest  that the whole was made  because thou  art intelligent  there requires but a very slight accident  a single  atom to be displaced  to make thee perish  to degrade thee  to ravish  from thee this intelligence of which thou appearest so proud     if all the preceding conjectures be refused by those opposed to us  if  it be pretended that nature acts by a certain quantum of immutable and  general laws  if it be believed that men  quadrupeds  fish  insects   plants  are from all eternity  and will remain eternally  what they now  are  if i say it be contended  that from all eternity the stars have  shone  in the immense regions of space  have illuminated the firmament   if it be insisted  we must no more demand why man is such as he appears   then ask why nature is such as we behold her  or why the world exists   we are no longer opposed to such arguments  whatever may be the system  adopted  it will perhaps reply equally well to the difficulties with  which our opponents endeavour to embarrass the way  examined closely  it  will be perceived they make nothing against those truths  which we have  gathered from experience  it is not given to man to know every thing  it  is not given him to know his origin  it is not given him to penetrate  into the essence of things  nor to recur to first principles  but it is  given him  to have reason  to have honesty  to ingenuously allow he  is ignorant of that which he cannot know  and not to substitute  unintelligible words  absurd suppositions  for his uncertainty  thus  we  say to those  who to solve difficulties far above their reach  pretend  that the human species descended from a first man and a first woman   created diversely according to different creeds   that we have some  ideas of nature  but that we have none of creation   that the human mind  is incapable of comprehending the period when all was nothing   that to  use words we cannot understand  is only in other terms to acknowledge  our ignorance of the powers of nature   that we are unable to fathom  the means by which she has been capacitated to produce the phenomena we  behold     let us then conclude  that man has no just  no solid reason to believe  himself a privileged being in nature  because he is subject to the same  vicissitudes  as all her other productions  his pretended prerogatives  have their foundation in error  arising from mistaken opinions  concerning his existence  let him but elevate himself by his thoughts  above the globe he inhabits  he will look upon his own species with  the same eyes he does all other beings in nature  he will then clearly  perceive that in the same manner that each tree produces its fruit  by  reason of its energies  in consequence of its species  so each man acts  by reason of his particular energy  that he produces fruit  actions   works  equally necessary  he will feel that the illusion which he  anticipates in favour of himself  arises from his being  at one and the  same time  a spectator and a part of the universe  he will acknowledge   that the idea of excellence which he attaches to his being  has no other  foundation than his own peculiar interest  than the predilection he  has in favour of himself  that the doctrine he has broached with such  seeming confidence  bottoms itself on a very suspicious foundation   namely ignorance and self love             chap  vii      the soul and the spiritual system        man  after having gratuitously supposed himself composed of two distinct  independent substances  that have no common properties  relatively with  each other  has pretended  as we have seen  that that which actuated him  interiorly  that motion which is invisible  that impulse which is  placed within himself  is essentially different from those which act  exteriorly  the first he designated  as we have already said  by the  name of a spirit or a soul  if however it be asked  what is a spirit   the moderns will reply  that the whole fruit of their metaphysical  researches is limited to learning that this motive power  which they  state to be the spring of man s action  is a substance of an unknown  nature  so simple  so indivisible  so deprived of extent  so invisible   so impossible to be discovered by the senses  that its parts cannot be  separated  even by abstraction or thought  the question then arises  how  can we conceive such a substance  which is only the negation of every  thing of which we have a knowledge  how form to ourselves an idea of a  substance  void of extent  yet acting on our senses  that is to say   on those organs which are material  which have extent  how can a  being without extent be moveable  how put matter in action  how can a  substance devoid of parts  correspond successively with different parts  of space  but a very cogent question presents itself on this occasion   if this distinct substance that is said to form one of the component  parts of man  be really what it is reported  and if it be not  it is  not what it is described  if it be unknown  if it be not pervious to  the senses  if it be invisible  by what means did the metaphysicians  themselves become acquainted with it  how did they form ideas of a  substance  that taking their own account of it  is not  under any of its  circumstances  either directly or by analogy  cognizable to the mind of  man  if they could positively achieve this  there would no longer be any  mystery in nature  it would be as easy to conceive the time when all was  nothing  when all shall have passed away  to account for the  production of every thing we behold  as to dig in a garden or read a  lecture   doubt would vanish from the human species  there could no  longer be any difference of opinion  since all must necessarily be of  one mind on a subject so accessible to every enquirer     but it will be replied  the materialist himself admits  the natural  philosophers of all ages have admitted  elements and atoms  beings  simple and indivisible  of which bodies are composed   granted  they  have no more  they have also admitted that many of these atoms  many  of these elements  if not all  are unknown to them  nevertheless  these  simple beings  these atoms of the materialist  are not the same thing  with the spirit  or the soul of the metaphysician  when the natural  philosopher talks of atoms  when he describes them as simple beings   he indicates nothing more than that they are homogeneous  pure  without  mixture  but then he allows that they have extent  consequently parts   are separable by thought  although no other natural agent with which  he is acquainted is capable of dividing them  that the simple beings  of this genus are susceptible of motion  can impart action  receive  impulse  are material  are placed in nature  are indestructible   that  consequently  if he cannot know them from themselves  he can form some  idea of them by analogy  thus he has done that intelligibly  which the  metaphysician would do unintelligibly  the latter  with a view to render  man immortal  finding difficulties to his wish  from seeing that  the body decayed  that it has submitted to the great  the universal  law  has  to solve the difficulty  to remove the impediment  given him a  soul  distinct from the body  which he says is exempted from the action  of the general law  to account for this  he has called it a spiritual  being  whose properties are the negation of all known properties   consequently inconceivable  had he  however  had recourse to the atoms  of the former  had he made this substance the last possible term of the  division of matter  it would at least have been intelligible  it would  also have been immortal  since  according to the reasonings of all men   whether metaphysicians  theologians  or natural philosophers  an atom is  an indestructible element  that must exist to all eternity     all men are agreed in this position  that motion is the successive  change of the relations of one body with other bodies  or with  the different parts of space  if that which is called  spirit  be  susceptible of communicating or receiving motion  if it acts  if  it gives play to the organs of body  to produce these effects  it  necessarily follows that this being changes successively its relation   its tendency  its correspondence  the position of its parts  either  relatively to the different points of space  or to the different organs  of the body which it puts in action  but to change its relation  with space  with the organs to which it gives impulse  it follows of  necessity that this spirit most have extent  solidity  consequently  distinct parts  whenever a substance possesses these qualities  it  is what we call matter  it can no longer be regarded as a simple pure  being  in the sense attached to it by the moderns  or by theologians     thus it will be seen  that those who  to conquer insurmountable  difficulties  have supposed in man an immaterial substance   distinguished from his body  have not thoroughly understood themselves   indeed they have done nothing more than imagined a negative quality   of which they cannot have any correct idea  matter alone is capable of  acting on our senses  without this action nothing would be capable  of making itself known to us  they have not seen that a being without  extent is neither in a capacity to move itself  nor has the capability  of communicating motion to the body  since such a being  having no  parts  has not the faculty of changing its relation  or its distance   relatively to other bodies  nor of exciting motion in the human body   which is itself material  that which is called our soul moves itself  with us  now motion is a property of matter  this soul gives impulse to  the arm  the arm  moved by it  makes an impression  a blow  that follows  the general law of motion  in this case  the force remaining the same   if the mass was two fold  the blow should be double  this soul again  evinces its materiality in the invincible obstacles it encounters on  the part of the body  if the arm be moved by its impulse when nothing  opposes it  yet this arm can no longer move  when it is charged with  a weight beyond its strength  here then is a mass of matter that  annihilates the impulse given by a spiritual cause  which spiritual  cause having no analogy with matter  ought not to find more difficulty  in moving the whole world  than in moving a single atom  nor an atom   than the universe  from this  it is fair to conclude  such a substance  is a chimera  a being of the imagination  that it required a being  differently endowed  differently constituted  to set matter in  motion  to create all the phenomena we behold  nevertheless  it is a  being the metaphysicians have made the contriver  the author of nature   as man  in all his speculations  takes himself for the model  he no  sooner imagined a spirit within himself  than giving it extent  he  made it universal  then ascribed to it all those causes with which his  ignorance prevents him from becoming acquainted  thus he identified  himself with the author of nature  then availed himself of the  supposition to explain the connection of the soul with the body  his  self complacency prevented his perceiving that he was only enlarging the  circle of his errors  by pretending to understand that which it is  more than possible he will never be permitted to know  his self love  prevented him from feeling  that whenever he punished another for not  thinking as he did  that he committed the greatest injustice  unless he  was satisfactorily able to prove that other wrong  and himself right   that if he himself was obliged to have recourse to hypothesis  to  gratuitous suppositions  whereon to found his doctrine  that from the  very fallibility of his nature  these might be erroneous  thus gallileo  was persecuted  because the metaphysicians  the theologians of his day   chose to make others believe what it was evident they did not themselves  understand     as soon as i feel an impulse  or experience motion  i am under the  necessity to acknowledge extent  solidity  density  impenetrability in  the substance i see move  or from which i receive impulse  thus  when  action is attributed to any cause whatever  i am obliged to consider  it material  i may be ignorant of its individual nature  of its mode  of action  or of its generic properties  but i cannot deceive myself in  general properties  which are common to all matter  this ignorance will  only be increased  when i shall take that for granted of a being  of  which from that moment i am precluded by what i admit from forming any  idea  which moreover deprives it completely either of the faculty of  moving itself  giving an impulse  or acting  thus  according to the  received idea of the term  a spiritual substance that moves itself  that  gives motion to matter  and that acts  implies a contradiction  that  necessarily infers a total impossibility     the partizans of spirituality believe they answer the difficulties they  have accumulated  by asserting that   the soul is entire  is whole under  each point of its extent    if an absurd answer will solve difficulties   they certainly have done it  but let us examine this reply   it will  be found that this indivisible part which is called soul  however  insensible or however minute  must yet remain something  then an  infinity of unextended substances  or the same substance having no  dimensions  repeated an infinity of times  would constitute a substance  that has extent  this cannot be what they mean  because according to  this principle  the human soul would then be as infinite as the author  of nature  seeing that they have stated this to be a being without  extent  who is an infinity of times whole in each part of the universe   but when there shall appear as much solidity in the answer as there is  a want of it  it must be acknowledged that in whatever manner the spirit  or the soul finds itself in its extent  when the body moves forward the  soul does not remain behind  if so  it has a quality in common with  the body  peculiar to matter  since it is conveyed from place to place  jointly with the body  thus  when even the soul should be admitted to  be immaterial  what conclusion must be drawn  entirely submitted to the  motion of the body  without this body it would remain dead and inert   this soul would only be part of a two fold machine  necessarily impelled  forward by a concatenation  or connection with the whole  it would  resemble a bird  which a child conducts at its pleasure  by the string  with which it is bound     thus  it is for want of consulting experience  by not attending to  reason  that man has darkened his ideas upon the concealed principle of  his motion  if  disentangled from prejudice  if  destitute of gratuitous  suppositions  if  throwing aside error  he would contemplate his soul   or the moving principle that acts within him  he would be convinced that  it forms a part of its body  that it cannot be distinguished from  it  but by abstraction  that it is only the body itself  considered  relatively with some of its functions  or with those faculties of which  its nature  or its peculiar organization  renders it susceptible   he  will perceive that this soul is obliged to undergo the same changes as  the body  that it is born with it  that it expands itself with it   that like the body  it passes through a state of infancy  a period of  weakness  a season of inexperience  that it enlarges itself  that it  strengthens itself  in the same progression  that like the body  it  arrives at an adult age or reaches maturity  that it is then  and not  till then  it obtains the faculty of fulfilling certain functions  that  it is in this stage  and in no other  that it enjoys reason  that it  displays more or less wit  judgment  and manly activity  that like the  body  it is subject to those vicissitudes which exterior causes obliges  it to undergo by their influence  that  conjointly with the body  it  suffers  enjoys  partakes of its pleasures  shares its pains  is sound  when the body is healthy  and diseased when the body is oppressed  with sickness  that like the body  it is continually modified by the  different degrees of density in the atmosphere  by the variety of the  seasons  and by the various properties of the aliments received into  the stomach  in short  he would be obliged to acknowledge that at some  periods it manifests visible signs of torpor  stupefaction  decrepitude   and death     in despite of this analogy  or rather this continual identity  of  the soul with the body  man has been desirous of distinguishing their  essence  he has therefore made the soul an inconceivable being  but  in order that he might form to himself some idea of it  he was   notwithstanding  obliged to have recourse to material beings  and to  their manner of acting  the word  spirit   therefore  presents to the  mind no other ideas than those of breathing  of respiration  of wind   thus  when it is said the  soul is a spirit   it really means nothing  more than that its mode of action is like that of breathing  which  though invisible in itself  or acting without being seen  nevertheless  produces very visible effects  but breath  it is acknowledged  is a  material cause  it is allowed to be air modified  it is not  therefore   a simple or pure substance  such as the moderns designate under the name  of spirit     it is rather singular that in the hebrew  the greek  and the latin  the  synonymy  or corresponding term for spirit should signify  breath    the metaphysicians themselves can best say why they have adopted such  a word  to designate the substance they have distinguished from matter   some of them  fearful they should not have distinct beings enough  have  gone farther  and compounded man of three substances  body  soul  and  intellect     although the word  spirit  is so very ancient among men  the sense  attached to it by the moderns is quite new  the idea of spirituality  as  admitted at this day  is a recent production of the imagination  neither  pythagoras nor plato  however heated their brain  however decided  their taste for the marvellous  appear to have understood by spirit an  immaterial substance  or one without extent  devoid of parts  such as  that of which the moderns have formed the human soul  the concealed  author of motion  the ancients  by the word spirit  were desirous to  define matter of an extreme subtilty  of a purer quality than that which  acted grossly on our senses  in consequence  some have regarded the soul  as an ethereal substance  others as igneous matter  others again have  compared it to light  democritus made it consist in motion  consequently  gave it a manner of existence  aristoxenes  who was himself a musician   made it harmony  aristotle regarded the soul as the moving faculty  upon  which depended the motion of living bodies     the earliest doctors of christianity had no other idea of the soul   than that it was material  tertullian  arnobius  clement of alexandria   origen  saint justin  irenaeus  have all of them discoursed upon it  but  have never spoken of it other than as a corporeal substance  as matter   it was reserved for their successors at a great distance of time  to  make the human soul and the soul of the world  pure spirits   that is  to say  immaterial substances  of which it is impossible they could  form any accurate idea  by degrees this incomprehensible doctrine of  spirituality  conformable without doubt to the views of those who make  it a principle to annihilate reason  prevailed over the others  but  it might be fairly asked  if the pretended proofs of this doctrine owe  themselves to a man  who on a much more comprehensible point has been  proved in error  if  on that which time has shewn was accessible to  man s reason  the great champion in support of this dogma was deceived   are we not bound to examine  with the most rigorous investigation  the  reasonings  the evidence  of one who was the decided  the proven child  of enthusiasm and error  yet descartes  to whose sublime errors the  world is indebted for the newtonian system  although before him the  soul had been considered spiritual  was the first who established that     that which thinks ought to be distinguished from matter    from whence  he concludes rather hastily  that the soul  or that which thinks in man   is a spirit  or a simple indivisible substance  perhaps it would have  been more logical  more consistent with reason  to have said  since  man  who is matter  who has no idea but of matter  enjoys the faculty of  thought  matter can think  that is  it is susceptible of that particular  modification called thought     however this may be  this doctrine was believed divine  supernatural   because it was inconceivable to man  those who dared believe even that  which was believed before  namely   that the soul was material   were  held as rash inconsiderate madmen  or else treated as enemies to the  welfare and happiness of the human race  when man had once renounced  experience  when he had abjured his reason  when he had joined the  banner of this enthusiastic novelty  he did nothing more  day after day   than subtilize the delirium  the ravings of his imagination  he pleased  himself by continually sinking deeper into the most unfathomable depths  of error  he felicitated himself on his discoveries  on his pretended  knowledge  in an exact ratio as his understanding became enveloped in  the mists of darkness  environed with the clouds of ignorance  thus   in consequence of man s reasoning upon false principles  of having  relinquished the evidence of his senses  the moving principle within  him  the concealed author of motion  has been made a mere chimera  a  mere being of the imagination  because he has divested it of all known  properties  because he has attached to it nothing but properties  which  from the very nature of his existence  he is incapacitated to  comprehend     the doctrine of spirituality  such as it now exists  offers nothing but  vague ideas  or rather is the absense of all ideas  what does it present  to the mind  but a substance which possesses nothing of which our senses  enable us to have a knowledge  can it be truth that a man is able to  figure to himself a being not material  having neither extent nor  parts  which  nevertheless  acts upon matter without having any point  of contact  any kind of analogy with it  and which itself receives the  impulse of matter by means of material organs  which announce to it the  presence of other beings  is it possible to conceive the union of the  soul with the body  to comprehend how this material body can bind   enclose  constrain  determine a fugitive being which escapes all our  senses  is it honest  is it plain dealing  to solve these difficulties   by saying there is a mystery in them  that they are the effects of a  power  more inconceivable than the human soul  than its mode of acting   however concealed from our view  when to resolve these problems  man is  obliged to have recourse to miracles or to make the divinity interfere   does he not avow his own ignorance  when  notwithstanding the ignorance  he is thus obliged to avow by availing himself of the divine agency   he tells us  this immaterial substance  this soul  shall experience the  action of the element of fire  which he allows to be material  when he  confidently says this soul shall be burnt  shall suffer in purgatory   have we not a right to believe  that either he has a design to deceive  us  or else that he does not himself understand that which he is so  anxious we should take upon his word     let us not then be surprised at those subtile hypotheses  as ingenious  as they are unsatisfactory  to which theological prejudice has obliged  the most profound modern speculators to recur  when they have undertaken  to reconcile the spirituality of the soul  with the physical action of  material beings  on this incorporeal substance  its re action upon these  beings  its union with the body  when the human mind permits itself to  be guided by authority without proof  to be led forward by enthusiasm   when it renounces the evidence of its senses  what can it do more  than sink into error  let those who doubt this  read the metaphysical  romances of leibnitz  descartes  malebranche  cudworth  and many others   let them coolly examine the ingenious  but fanciful systems entitled   the pre established harmony of occasional causes  physical pre motion    c      if man wishes to form to himself clear  perspicuous ideas of his soul   let him throw himself back on his experience  let him renounce his  prejudices  let him avoid theological conjecture  let him tear the  bandages which he has been taught to think necessary  but with which he  has been blind folded  only to confound his reason  if it be wished to  draw man to virtue  let the natural philosopher  let the anatomist   let the physician  unite their experience  let them compare their  observations  in order to show what ought to be thought of a substance   so disguised  so hidden by absurdities  as not easily to be known  their  discoveries may perhaps teach moralists the true motive power that ought  to influence the actions of man  legislators  the true motives that  should actuate him  that should excite him to labour to the welfare of  society  sovereigns  the means of rendering their subjects truly happy   of giving solidity to the power of the nations committed to their  charge  physical souls have physical wants  and demand physical  happiness  these are real  are preferable objects  to that variety of  fanciful chimeras  each in its turn giving place to the other  with  which the mind of man has been fed during so many ages  let us  then   labour to perfect the morality of man  let us make it agreeable to him   let us excite in him an ardent thirst for its purity  we shall presently  see his morals become better  himself become happier  his soul become  calm and serene  his will determined to virtue  by the natural  by the  palpable motives held out to him  by the diligence  by the care which  legislators shall bestow on natural philosophy  they will form citizens  of sound understandings  robust and well constituted  who  finding  themselves happy  will be themselves accessary to that useful impulse so  necessary for their soul  when the body is suffering  when nations are  unhappy  the soul cannot be in a proper state   mens sana in corpore  sano   a sound mind in a sound body  will be always able to make a good  citizen     the more man reflects  the more he will be convinced that the soul  very  far from being distinguished from the body  is only the body itself   considered relatively to some of its functions  or to some of the modes  of existing or acting  of which it is susceptible whilst it enjoys life   thus  the soul is man  considered relatively to the faculty he has of  feeling  of thinking  of acting in a mode resulting from his peculiar  nature  that is to say  from his properties  from his particular  organization  from the modifications  whether durable or transitory   which the beings who act upon him cause his machine to undergo     those who have distinguished the soul from the body  appear only to  have distinguished their brain from themselves  indeed  the brain is the  common center  where all the nerves  distributed through every part of  the body  meet and blend themselves  it is by the aid of this interior  organ that all those operations are performed which are attributed to  the soul  it is the impulse  or the motion  communicated to the nerve   which modifies the brain  in consequence  it re acts  or gives play to  the bodily organs  or rather it acts upon itself  and becomes capable  of producing within itself a great variety of motion  which has been  designated  intellectual faculties      from this it may be seen that some philosophers have been desirous to  make a spiritual substance of the brain  it is evidently nothing but  ignorance that has given birth to and accredited this system  which  embraces so little  either of the natural or the rational  it is from  not having studied himself  that man has supposed he was compounded with  an agent  essentially different from his body  in examining this body   he will find that it is quite useless to recur to hypothesis for the  explanation of the various phenomena it presents to his contemplation   that hypothesis can do nothing more than lead him out of the right road  to the information after which he seeks  what obscures this question   arises from this  that man cannot see himself  indeed  for this purpose   that would be requisite which is impossible  namely  that he could he  at one and the same moment both within and without himself  he may be  compared to an eolian harp  that issues sounds of itself  and should  demand what it is that causes it to give them forth  it does not  perceive that the sensitive quality of its chords causes the air to  brace them  that being so braced  it is rendered sonorous by every gust  of wind with which it happens to come in contact     when a theologian  obstinately bent on admitting into man two substances  essentially different  is asked why he multiplies beings without  necessity  he will reply  because   thought cannot be a property of  matter    if  then  it be enquired of him   cannot god give to matter  the faculty of thought   he will answer    no  seeing that god cannot  do impossible things    according to his principles  it is as impossible  that spirit or thought can produce matter  as it is impossible that  matter can produce spirit or thought  it might  therefore  be concluded  against him  that the world was not made by a spirit  any more than a  spirit was made by the world  but in this case  does not the theologian   according to his own assertion  acknowledge himself to be the true  atheist  does he not  in fact  circumscribe the attributes of the  deity  and deny his power  to suit his own purpose  yet these men demand  implicit belief in doctrines  which they are obliged to maintain by the  most contradictory assertions     the more experience we collect  the more we shall be convinced that the  word  spirit   in its present received usage  conveys no one sense  that is tangible  either to ourselves or to those that invented it   consequently cannot be of the least use  either in physics or morals   what modern metaphysicians believe and understand by the word  is  nothing more than an  occult  power  imagined to explain  occult   qualities and actions  but which  in fact  explains nothing  savage  nations admit of spirits  to account to themselves for those effects   which to them appear marvellous  as long as their ignorance knows  not the cause to which they ought to be attributed  in attributing to  spirits the phenomena of nature  as well as those of the human body  do  we  in fact  do any thing more than reason like savages  man has filled  nature with spirits  because he has almost always been ignorant of  the true causes of those effects by which he was astonished  not being  acquainted with the powers of nature  he has supposed her to be animated  by a  great spirit   not understanding the energy of the human frame   he has in like manner conjectured it to be animated by a  minor spirit    from this it would appear  that whenever he wished to indicate the  unknown cause of a phenomena  he knew not how to explain in a natural  manner  he had recourse to the word  spirit   in short   spirit  was a  term by which he solved all his doubts  and cleared up his ignorance to  himself  it was according to these principles that when the americans  first beheld the terrible effects of gunpowder  they ascribed the cause  to wrathful spirits  to their enraged divinities  it was by adopting  these principles  that our ancestors believed in a plurality of gods  in  ghosts  in genii   c  pursuing the same track  we ought to attribute  to spirits gravitation  electricity  magnetism   c   c  it is somewhat  singular  that priests have in all ages so strenuously upheld those  systems which time has exploded  that they have appeared to be either  the most crafty or the most ignorant of men  where are now the priests  of apollo  of juno  of the sun  and a thousand others  yet these are the  men  who in all times have persecuted those who have been the first  to give natural explanations of the phenomena of nature  as witness  anaxagoras  aristotle  gallileo  descartes   c   c             chap  viii      the intellectual faculties derived from the faculty of feeling        to convince ourselves that the faculties called  intellectual   are  only certain modes of existence  or determinate manners of acting   which result from the peculiar organization of the body  we have only  to analyze them  we shall then see that all the operations which are  attributed to the soul  are nothing more than certain modifications  of the body  of which a substance that is without extent  that has no  parts  that is immaterial  is not susceptible     the first faculty we behold in the living man  and that from which all  his others flow  is  feeling   however inexplicable this faculty may  appear  on a first view  if it be examined closely  it will be found  to be a consequence of the essence  or a result of the properties  of organized beings  the same as  gravity  magnetism  elasticity   electricity    c  result from the essence or nature of some others  we  shall also find these last phenomena are not less inexplicable than that  of feeling  nevertheless  if we wish to define to ourselves a clear and  precise idea of it  we shall find that feeling is a particular manner of  being moved  a mode of receiving an impulse peculiar to certain organs  of animated bodies  which is occasioned by the presence of a material  object that acts upon these organs  and transmit the impulse or shock to  the brain     man only feels by the aid of nerves dispersed through his body  which is  itself  to speak correctly  nothing more than a great nerve  or may  be said to resemble a large tree  of which the branches experience the  action of the root  communicated through the trunk  in man the nerves  unite and lose themselves in the brain  that intestine is the true seat  of feeling  like the spider in the centre of his web  it is quickly  warned of all the changes that happen to the body  even at the  extremities to which it sends its filaments and branches  experience  enables us to ascertain  that man ceases to feel in those parts of his  body of which the communication with the brain is intercepted  he feels  very little  or not at all  whenever this organ is itself deranged or  affected in too lively a manner  a proof of this is afforded in the  transactions of the royal academy of sciences at paris  they inform us  of a man who had his scull taken off  in the room of which his brain was  recovered with skin  in proportion as a pressure was made by the hand on  his brain  the man fell into a kind of insensibility  which deprived  him of all feeling  bartolin says  the brain of a man is twice as big as  that of an ox  this observation had been already made by aristotle   in the dead body of an idiot dissected by willis  the brain was found  smaller than ordinary  he says the greatest difference he found between  the parts of the body of this idiot  and those of wiser men  was  that  the plexus of the intercostal nerves  which is the mediator between the  brain and the heart  was extremely small  accompanied by a less number  of nerves than usual  according to willis  the ape is  of all animals   that which has the largest brain  relatively to his size  he is also   after man  that which has the most intelligence  this is further  confirmed  by the name he bears in the soil  to which he is indigenous   which is  ourang outang   or the man beast  there is  therefore  every  reason to believe that it is entirely in the brain  that consists the  difference  that is found not only between man and beasts  but also  between the man of wit  and the fool  between the thinking man  and he  who is ignorant  between the man of sound understanding  and the madman   a multitude of experience  serves to prove  that those persons who are  most accustomed to use their intellectual faculties  have their brain  more extended than others  the same has been remarked of watermen  that  they have arms much longer than other men     however this may be  the sensibility of the brain  and all its parts  is  a fact  if it be asked  whence comes this property  we shall reply   it is the result of an arrangement  of a combination  peculiar to the  animal  it is thus that milk  bread  wine  change themselves in the  substance of man  who is a sensible being  this insensible matter  becomes sensible  in combining itself with a sensible whole  some  philosophers think that sensibility is a universal quality of matter   in this case  it would be useless to seek from whence this property is  derived  as we know it by its effects  if this hypothesis be admitted   in like manner as two kinds of motion are distinguished in nature  the  one called  live  force  the other  dead   or  inert  force  two sorts  of sensibility will be distinguished  the one active or alive  the other  inert or dead  then to animalize a substance  is only to destroy  the obstacles that prevent its being active or sensible  in fact   sensibility is either a quality which communicates itself like motion   and which is acquired by combination  or this sensibility is a property  inherent in all matter  in both  or either case  an unextended being   without parts  such as the human soul is said to be  can neither be the  cause of it nor submitted to its operation  but we may fairly conclude   that all the parts of nature enjoy the capability to arrive at  animation  the obstacle is only in the state  not in the quality  life  is the perfection of nature  she has no parts which do not tend to  it  which do not attain it by the same means  life in an insect  a dog   a man  has no other difference  than that this act is more perfect   relatively to ourselves in proportion to the structure of the organs   if  therefore  it be asked  what is requisite to animate a body  we  reply  it needs no foreign aid  it is sufficient that the power of  nature be joined to its organization     the conformation  the arrangement  the texture  the delicacy of the  organs  as well exterior as interior  which compose men and animals   render their parts extremely mobile  or make their machine susceptible  of being moved with great facility  in a body  which is only a heap  of fibres  a mass of nerves  contiguous one to the other  united in a  common center  always ready to act  in a whole  composed of fluids and  solids  of which the parts are in equilibrium  the smallest touching  each other  are active in their motion  communicating reciprocally   alternately and in succession  the impression  oscillations  and shocks  they receive  in such a composition  it is not surprising that the  slightest impulse propagates itself with celerity  that the shocks  excited in its remotest parts  make themselves quickly felt in the  brain  whose delicate texture renders it susceptible of being itself  very easily modified  air  fire  water  agents the most inconstant   possessing the most rapid motion  circulate continually in the fibres   incessantly penetrate the nerves  without doubt these contribute to that  incredible celerity with which the brain is acquainted with what passes  at the extremities of the body     notwithstanding the great mobility with which man s organization renders  him susceptible  although exterior as well as interior causes are  continually acting upon him  he does not always feel in a distinct  in  a decided manner  the impulse given to his senses  indeed  he does not  feel it  until it has produced some change  or given some shock to his  brain  thus  although completely environed by air  he does not feel its  action  until it is so modified  as to strike with a sufficient degree  of force on his organs  to penetrate his skin  through which his brain  is warned of its presence  thus  during a profound and tranquil sleep   undisturbed by any dream  man ceases to feel  in short  notwithstanding  the continued motion that agitates his frame  man does not appear to  feel  when this motion acts in a convenient order  he does not perceive  a state of health  but he discovers a state of grief or sickness   because  in the first  his brain does not receive too lively an impulse   whilst in the others  his nerves are contracted  shocked  and agitated   with violent  with disorderly motion  these communicating with his  brain  give notice that some cause acts strongly upon them  impels  them in a manner that bears no analogy with their natural habit  this  constitutes  in him  that peculiar mode of existing which he calls   grief      on the other hand  it sometimes happens that exterior objects produce  very considerable changes on his body  without his perceiving them at  the moment  often  in the heat of battle  the soldier perceives not  that he is dangerously wounded  because  at the time  the rapidity  the  multiplicity of impetuous motion that assails his brain  does not  permit him to distinguish the particular change a part of his body has  undergone by the wound  in short  when a great number of causes are  simultaneously acting on him with too much vivacity  he sinks under  their accumulated pressure   he swoons  he loses his senses  he is  deprived of feeling     in general  feeling only obtains  when the brain can distinguish  distinctly  the impressions made on the organs with which it has  communication  it is the distinct shock  the decided modification man  undergoes  that constitutes  conscience   doctor clarke  says to this  effect   conscience is the act of reflecting  by means of which i know  that i think  and that my thoughts  or my actions belong to me  and  not to another   from this it will appear  that  feeling  is a mode of  being  a marked change  produced on our brain  occasioned by the impulse  communicated to our organs  whether by interior or exterior agents  by  which it is modified either in a durable or transient manner  it is  not always requisite that man s organs should be moved by an exterior  object  to enable him to feel that he should be conscious of the changes  effected in him  he can feel them within himself by means of an interior  impulse  his brain is then modified  or rather he renews within himself  the anterior modifications  we are not to be astonished that the brain  should be necessarily warned of the shocks  of the impediments  of the  changes that may happen to so complicated a machine as the human body   in which  notwithstanding all the parts are contiguous to the brain   and concentrate themselves in this brain  and are by their essence in a  continual state of action and re action     when a man experiences the pains of the gout  he is conscious of them   in other words  he feels interiorly  that it has produced very marked   very distinct changes in him  without his perceiving  that he has  received an impulse from any exterior cause  nevertheless  if he will  recur to the true source of these changes  he will find that they have  been wholly produced by exterior agents  they have been the consequence   either of his temperament  of the organization received from his  parents  of the aliments with which his frame has been nourished   besides a thousand trivial  inappreciable causes  which congregating  themselves by degrees produce in him the gouty humour  the effect of  which is to make him feel in an acute and very lively manner  the pain  of the gout engenders in his brain an idea  so modifies it that it  acquires the faculty of representing to itself  of reiterating as it  were  this pain when even he shall be no longer tormented with the gout   his brain  by a series of motion interiorly excited  is again placed  in a state analogous to that in which it was when he really experienced  this pain  but if he had never felt it  he would never have been in a  capacity to form to himself any just idea of its excruciating torments     the visible organs of man s body  by the intervention of which his brain  is modified  take the name of  senses   the various modifications which  his brain receives by the aid of these senses  assumes a variety of  names   sensation    perception   and  idea   are terms that designate  nothing more than the changes produced in this interior organ  in  consequence of impressions made on the exterior organs by bodies  acting on them  these changes considered by themselves  are called   sensations   they adopt the term  perception  when the brain is warned  of their presence   ideas  is that state of them in which the brain is  able to ascribe them to the objects by which they have been produced     every  sensation   then  is nothing more than the shock given to the  organs  every  perception  is this shock propagated to the brain   every  idea  is the image of the object to which the sensation and the  perception is to be ascribed  from whence it will be seen  that if the  senses be not moved  there can neither be sensations  perceptions  nor  ideas  this will be proved to those  who can yet permit themselves to  doubt so demonstrable and striking a truth     it is the extreme mobility of which man is capable  owing to his  peculiar organization  that distinguishes him from other beings that are  called insensible or inanimate  the different degrees of this mobility   of which the individuals of his species are susceptible  discriminate  them from each other  make that incredible variety  that infinity of  difference which is to be found  as well in their corporeal faculties   as in those which are mental or intellectual  from this mobility   more or less remarkable in each human being  results wit  sensibility   imagination  taste   c   for the present  however  let us follow the  operation of the senses  let us examine in what manner they are  acted upon  and are modified by exterior objects   we will afterwards  scrutinize the re action of the interior organ or brain     the eyes are very delicate  very movable organs  by means of which the  sensation of light or colour is experienced  these give to the brain  a distinct perception  in consequence of which  man forms an idea   generated by the action of luminous or coloured bodies  as soon as the  eyelids are opened  the retina is affected in a peculiar manner  the  fluid  the fibres  the nerves  of which they are composed  are excited  by shocks which they communicate to the brain  to which they delineate  the images of the bodies from which they have received the impulse  by  this means  an idea is acquired of the colour  the size  the form  the  distance of these bodies  it is thus that may be explained the mechanism  of  sight      the mobility and the elasticity of which the skin is rendered  susceptible  by the fibres and nerves which form its texture  accounts  for the rapidity with which this envelope to the human body is affected  when applied to any other body  by their agency  the brain has notice of  its presence  of its extent  of its roughness  of its smoothness  of its  surface  of its pressure of its ponderosity   c  qualities from which  the brain derives distinct perceptions  which breed in it a diversity of  ideas  it is this that constitutes the  touch  or  feeling      the delicacy of the membrane by which the interior of the nostrils is  covered  renders them easily susceptible of irritation  even by the  invisible and impalpable corpuscles that emanate from odorous bodies   by these means sensations are excited  the brain has perceptions  and  generates ideas  it is this that forms the sense of  smelling      the mouth  filled with nervous  sensible  movable  irritable glands   saturated with juices suitable to the dissolution of saline substances   is affected in a very lively manner by the aliments which pass through  it for the nourishment of the body  these glands transmit to the brain  the impressions received  perceptions are of consequence  ideas follow   it is from this mechanism that results  taste      the ear  whose conformation fits it to receive the various impulses  of air  diversely modified  communicates to the brain the shocks or  sensations  these breed the perception of sound  and generate the idea  of sonorous bodies  it is this that constitutes  hearing      such are the only means by which man receives sensations  perceptions   and ideas  these successive modifications of his brain are effects  produced by objects that give impulse to his senses  they become  themselves causes  producing in his soul new modifications  which are  denominated  thought  reflection  memory  imagination  judgment  will   action   the basis  however  of all these is  sensation      to form a precise notion of  thought   it will be requisite to examine   step by step  what passes in man during the presence of any object  whatever  suppose for a moment this object to be a peach  this fruit  makes  at the first view  two different impressions on his eyes  that  is to say  it produces two modifications  which are transmitted to the  brain  which on this occasion experiences two new perceptions  or has  two new ideas or modes of existence  designated by the terms  colour   and  rotundity   in consequence  he has an idea of a body possessing  roundness and colour  if he places his hand on this fruit  the organ  of feeling having been set in action  his hand experiences three new  impressions  which are called  softness  coolness  weight   from whence  result three new perceptions in the brain  he has consequently three  new ideas  if he approximates this peach to his nose  the organ of   smelling  receives an impulse  which  communicated to the brain  a new  perception arises  by which he acquires a new idea  called  odour   if  he carries this fruit to his mouth  the organ of taste becomes affected  in a very lively manner  this impulse communicated to the brain  is  followed by a perception that generates in him the idea of  flavour   in  re uniting all these impressions  or these various modifications of his  organs  which it have been consequently transmitted to his brain  that  is to say  in combining the different sensations  perceptions  and  ideas  that result from the impulse he has received  he has an idea of  a whole  which he designates by the name of a peach  with which he can  then occupy his thoughts     from this it is sufficiently proved that thought has a commencement  a  duration  an end  or rather a generation  a succession  a dissolution   like all the other modifications of matter  like them  thought is  excited  is determined  is increased  is divided  is compounded  is  simplified   c  if  therefore  the soul  or the principle that thinks   be indivisible  how does it happen  that this soul has the faculty of  memory  or of forgetfulness  is capacitated to think successively  to  divide  to abstract  to combine  to extend its ideas  to retain them   or to lose them  how can it cease to think  if forms appear divisible in  matter  it is only in considering them by abstraction  after the method   of geometricians  but this divisibility of form exists not in nature  in  which there is neither a point  an atom  nor form perfectly regular   it must therefore be concluded  that the forms of matter are not less  indivisible than thought     what has been said is sufficient to show the generation of sensations   of perceptions  of ideas  with their association  or connection in the  brain  it will be seen that these various modifications are nothing more  than the consequence of successive impulses  which the exterior organs  transmit to the interior organ  which enjoys the faculty of thought   that is to say  to feel in itself the different modifications it has  received  or to perceive the various ideas which it has generated  to  combine them  to separate them  to extend them  to abridge them  to  compare them  to renew them   c  from whence it will be seen  that  thought is nothing more than the perception of certain modifications   which the brain either gives to itself  or has received from exterior  objects     indeed  not only the interior organ perceives the modifications it  receives from without  but again it has the faculty of modifying itself   of considering the changes which take place in it  the motion by which  it is agitated in its peculiar operations  from which it imbibes new  perceptions and new ideas  it is the exercise of this power to fall back  upon itself  that is called  reflection      from this it will appear  that for man to think and to reflect  is to  feel  or perceive within himself the impressions  the sensations  the  ideas  which have been furnished to his brain by those objects which  give impulse to his senses  with the various changes which his brain  produced on itself in consequence      memory  is the faculty which the brain has of renewing in itself the  modifications it has received  or rather  to restore itself to a state  similar to that in which it has been placed by the sensations  the  perceptions  the ideas  produced by exterior objects  in the exact order  it received them  without any new action on the part of these objects   or even when these objects are absent  the brain perceives that these  modifications assimilate with those it formerly experienced in the  presence of the objects to which it relates  or attributes them  memory  is faithful  when these modifications are precisely the same  it  is treacherous  when they differ from those which the organs have  exteriorly experienced      imagination  in man is only the faculty which the brain has of  modifying itself  or of forming to itself new perceptions  upon the  model of those which it has anteriorly received through the action of  exterior objects on the senses  the brain  then  does nothing more than  combine ideas which it has already formed  which it recalls to itself   from which it forms a whole  or a collection of modifications  which  it has not received  which exists no where but in itself  although the  individual ideas  or the parts of which this ideal whole is composed   have been previously communicated to it  in consequence of the impulse  given to the senses by exterior objects  it is thus man forms to himself  the idea of  centaurs   or a being composed of a man and a horse  of   hyppogriffs   or a being composed of a horse with wings and a griffin   besides a thousand other objects  equally ridiculous  by memory  the  brain renews in itself the sensations  the perceptions  and the ideas  which it has received or generated  represents to itself the objects  which have actually moved its organs  by imagination it combines them  variously  forms objects in their place which have not moved its organs   although it is perfectly acquainted with the elements or ideas of which  it composes them  it is thus that man  by combining a great number  of ideas borrowed from himself  such as justice  wisdom  goodness   intelligence   c  by the aid of imagination  has formed various ideal  beings  or imaginary wholes  which he has called jupiter  juno  bramah   saturn   c      judgment  is the faculty which the brain possesses of comparing with  each other the modifications it receives  the ideas it engenders  or  which it has the power of awakening within itself  to the end that it  may discover their relations  or their effects      will  is a modification of the brain  by which it is disposed to  action  that is to say  to give such an impulse to the organs of the  body  as can induce to act in a manner  that will procure for itself  what is requisite to modify it in a mode analogous to its own existence   or to enable it to avoid that by which it can be injured  to  will  is  to be disposed to  action   the exterior objects  or the interior ideas   which give birth to this disposition are called  motives   because they  are the springs or movements which determine it to act  that is to say   which give play to the organs of the body  thus   voluntary actions   are the motion of the body  determined by the modification of the  brain  fruit hanging on a tree  through the agency of the visual organs   modifies the brain in such a manner as to dispose the arm to stretch  itself forth to cull it  again  it modifies it in another manner  by  which it excites the hand to carry it to the mouth     all the modifications which the interior organ or the brain receives   all the sensations  all the perceptions  all the ideas that are  generated by the objects which give impulse to the senses  or which  it renews within itself by its own peculiar faculties  are either  favourable or prejudicial to man s mode of existence  whether that be  transitory or habitual  they dispose the interior organ to action  which  it exercises by reason of its own peculiar energy  this action is not   however  the same in all the individuals of the human species  depending  much on their respective temperaments  from hence the passions have  their birth  these are more or less violent  they are  however  nothing  more than the motion of the will  determined by the objects which give  it activity  consequently composed of the analogy or of the discordance  which is found between these objects  man s peculiar mode of existence   and the force of his temperament  from this it results  that the  passions are modes of existence or modifications of the brain  which  either attract or repel those objects by which man is surrounded  that  consequently they are submitted in their action to the physical laws of  attraction and repulsion     the faculty of perceiving or of being modified  as well by itself as  exterior objects which the brain enjoys is sometimes designated by the  term  understanding   to the assemblage of the various faculties  of which this interior organ is susceptible  is applied the name of   intelligence   to a determined mode in which the brain exercises the  faculties peculiar to itself  is given the appellation of  reason   the  dispositions or the modifications of the brain  some of them constant   others transitory  which give impulse to the beings of the human  species  causing them to act  are styled  wit  wisdom  goodness   prudence  virtue   c      in short  as there will be an opportunity presently to prove  all  the intellectual faculties  that is to say  all the modes of action  attributed to the soul  may be reduced to the modifications  to the  qualities  to the modes of existence  to the changes produced by the  motion of the brain  which is visibly in man the seat of feeling  the  principle of all his actions  these modifications are to be attributed  to the objects that strike on his senses  of which the impression is  transmitted to the brain  or rather to the ideas  which the perceptions  caused by the action of these objects on his senses have there  generated  and which it has the faculty to re produce  this brain moves  itself in its turn  re acts upon itself  gives play to the organs  which  concentrate themselves in it  or which are rather nothing more than an  extension of its own peculiar substance  it is thus the concealed motion  of the interior organ  renders itself sensible by outward and visible  signs  the brain  affected by a modification which is called fear   diffuses a paleness over the countenance  excites a tremulous motion in  the limbs called trembling  the brain  affected by a sensation of grief   causes tears to flow from the eyes  even without being moved by any  exterior object  an idea which it retraces with great strength  suffices  to give it very little modifications  which visibly have an influence on  the whole frame     in all this  nothing more is to be perceived than the same substance  which acts diversely on the various parts of the body  if it be objected  that this mechanism does not sufficiently explain the principles of the  motion or the faculties of the soul  we reply  that it is in the same  situation as all the other bodies of nature  in which the most simple  motion  the most ordinary phenomena  the most common modes of action are  inexplicable mysteries  of which we shall never be able to fathom the  first principles  indeed  how can we flatter ourselves we shall ever be  enabled to compass the true principle of that gravity by which a stone  falls  are we acquainted with the mechanism which produces attraction in  some substances  repulsion in others  are we in a condition to explain  the communication of motion from one body to another  but it may be  fairly asked   are the difficulties that occur  when attempting to  explain the manner in which the soul acts  removed by making it a   spiritual being   a substance of which we have not  nor cannot form one  idea  which consequently must bewilder all the notions we are capable  of forming to ourselves of this being  let us then be contented to know  that the soul moves itself  modifies itself  in consequence of material  causes  which act upon it which give it activity  from whence the  conclusion may be said to flow consecutively  that all its operations   all its faculties  prove that it is itself  material              chap  ix      the diversity of the intellectual faculties  they depend on physical  causes  as do their moral qualities   the natural principles of  society   morals   politics        nature is under the necessity of diversifying all her works  elementary  matter  different in its essence  must necessarily form different  beings  various in their combinations  in their properties  in their  modes of action  in their manner of existence  there is not  neither  can there be  two beings  two combinations  which are mathematically  and rigorously the same  because the place  the circumstances  the  relations  the proportions  the modifications  never being exactly  alike  the beings that result can never bear a perfect resemblance to  each other  their modes of action must of necessity vary in something   even when we believe we find between them the greatest conformity     in consequence of this principle  which every thing we see conspires to  prove to be a truth  there are not two individuals of the human species  who have precisely the same traits  who think exactly in the same  manner  who view things under the same identical point of sight  who  have decidedly the same ideas  consequently no two of them have  uniformly the same system of conduct  the visible organs of man  as well  as his concealed organs  have indeed some analogy  some common points  of resemblance  some general conformity  which makes them appear   when viewed in the gross  to be affected in the same manner by certain  causes  but the difference is infinite in the detail  the human soul  may be compared to those instruments  of which the chords  already  diversified in themselves  by the manner in which they have been spun   are also strung upon different notes  struck by the same impulse  each  chord gives forth the sound that is peculiar to itself  that is to  say  that which depends on its texture  its tension  its volume  on the  momentary state in which it is placed by the circumambient air  it is  this that produces the diversified spectacle  the varied scene  which  the moral world offers to our view  it is from this that results the  striking contrariety that is to be found in the minds  in the faculties   in the passions  in the energies  in the taste  in the imagination  in  the ideas  in the opinions of man  this diversity is as great as that of  his physical powers  like them it depends on his temperament  which  is as much varied as his physiognomy  this variety gives birth to that  continual series of action and reaction  which constitutes the life of  the moral world  from this discordance results the harmony which at once  maintains and preserves the human race     the diversity found among the individuals of the human species  causes  inequalities between man and man  this inequality constitutes the  support of society  if all men were equal in their bodily powers  in  their mental talents  they would not have any occasion for each other   it is the variation of his faculties  the inequality which this places  him in  with regard to his fellows  that renders morals necessary  to man  without these  he would live by himself  he would remain an  isolated being  from whence it may be perceived  that this inequality  of which man so often complains without cause  this impossibility which  each man finds when in an isolated state  when left to himself  when  unassociated with his fellow men  to labour efficaciously to his own  welfare  to make his own security  to ensure his own conservation   places him in the happy situation of associating with his like  of  depending on his fellow associates  of meriting their succour  of  propitiating them to his views  of attracting their regard  of calling  in their aid to chase away  by common and united efforts  that which  would have the power to trouble or derange the order of his existence   in consequence of man s diversity  of the inequality that results  the  weaker is obliged to seek the protection of the stronger  this  in his  turn  recurs to the understanding  to the talents  to the industry of  the weaker  whenever his judgment points out he can be useful to him   this natural inequality furnishes the reason why nations distinguish  those citizens who have rendered their country eminent services  it is  in consequence of his exigencies that man honors and recompenses those  whose understanding  good deeds  assistance  or virtues  have procured  for him real or supposed advantages  pleasures  or agreeable sensations  of any sort  it is by this means that genius gains an ascendancy over  the mind of man  and obliges a whole people to acknowledge its powers   thus  the diversity and inequality of the faculties  as well corporeal  as mental or intellectual  renders man necessary to his fellow man   makes him a social being  and incontestibly proves to him the necessity  of morals     according to this diversity of faculties  the individuals of the human  species are divided into different classes  each in proportion to the  effects produced  or the different qualities that may be remarked  all  these varieties in man flow from the individual properties of his soul   or from the particular modification of his brain  it is thus  that  wit  imagination  sensibility  talents   c  diversify to infinity the  differences that are to be found in man  it is thus  that some are  called good  others wicked  some are denominated virtuous  others  vicious  some are ranked as learned  others as ignorant  some are  considered reasonable  others unreasonable   c     if all the various faculties attributed to the soul are examined  it  will be found that like those of the body they are to be ascribed to  physical causes  to which it will be very easy to recur  it will be  found that the powers of the soul are the same as those of the body   that they always depend on the organization of this body  on its  peculiar properties  on the permanent or transitory modifications that  it undergoes  in a word  on its temperament      temperament  is  in each individual  the habitual state in which he  finds the fluids and the solids of which his body is composed  this  temperament varies  by reason of the elements or matter that predominate  in him  in consequence of the different combinations  of the various  modifications  which this matter  diversified in itself  undergoes in  his machine  thus  in one  the blood is superabundant  in another  the  bile  in a third  phlegm   c     it is from nature  from his parents  from causes  which from the first  moment of his existence have unceasingly modified him  that man derives  his temperament  it is in his mother s womb that he has attracted the  matter which  during his whole life  shall have an influence on his  intellectual faculties  on his energies  on his passions  on his  conduct  the very nourishment he takes  the quality of the air he  respires  the climate he inhabits  the education he receives  the  ideas that are presented to him  the opinions he imbibes  modify this  temperament  as these circumstances can never be rigorously the same in  every point for any two men  it is by no means surprising that such an  amazing variety  so great a contrariety  should be found in man  or  that there should exist as many different temperaments  as there are  individuals in the human species     thus  although man may bear a general resemblance  he differs  essentially  as well by the texture of his fibres and the disposition of  his nerves  as by the nature  the quality  the quantity of matter that  gives them play  that sets his organs in motion  man  already different  from his fellow  by the elasticity of his fibres  the tension of  his nerves  becomes still more distinguished by a variety of other  circumstances  he is more active  more robust  when he receives  nourishing aliments  when he drinks wine  when he takes exercise  whilst  another  who drinks nothing but water  who takes less juicy nourishment   who languishes in idleness  shall be sluggish and feeble     all these causes have necessarily an influence on the mind  on the  passions  on the will  in a word  on what are called the intellectual  faculties  thus  it may be observed  that a man of a sanguine  constitution  is commonly lively  ingenious  full of imagination   passionate  voluptuous  enterprising  whilst the phlegmatic man is dull   of a heavy understanding  slow of conception  inactive  difficult to be  moved  pusillanimous  without imagination  or possessing it in a less  lively degree  incapable of taking any strong measures  or of willing  resolutely     if experience was consulted  in the room of prejudice  the physician  would collect from morals  the key to the human heart  in curing the  body  he would sometimes be assured of curing the mind  man  in making  a spiritual substance of his soul  has contented himself with  administering to it spiritual remedies  which either have no influence  over his temperament  or do it an injury  the doctrine of the  spirituality of the soul has rendered morals a conjectural science  that  does not furnish a knowledge of the true motives which ought to be  put in activity  in order to influence man to his welfare  if  calling  experience to his assistance  man sought out the elements which form the  basis of his temperament  or of the greater number of the individuals  composing a nation  he would then discover what would be most proper  for him   that which could be most convenient to his mode of  existence  which could most conduce to his true interest  what laws  would be necessary to his happiness  what institutions would be most  useful for him  what regulations would be most beneficial  in short   morals and politics would be equally enabled to draw from  materialism    advantages which the dogma of spirituality can never supply  of which  it even precludes the idea  man will ever remain a mystery  to those  who shall obstinately persist in viewing him with eyes prepossessed  by metaphysics  he will always be an enigma to those who shall  pertinaciously attribute his actions to a principle  of which it is  impossible to form to themselves any distinct idea  when man shall be  seriously inclined to understand himself  let him sedulously endeavour  to discover the matter that enters into his combination  which  constitutes his temperament  these discoveries will furnish him with the  clue to the nature of his desires  to the quality of his passions  to  the bent of his inclinations  will enable him to foresee his conduct  on given occasions  will indicate the remedies that may be successfully  employed to correct the defects of a vicious organization  of a  temperament  as injurious to himself as to the society of which he is a  member     indeed  it is not to be doubted that man s temperament is capable of  being corrected  of being modified  of being changed  by causes as  physical as the matter of which it is constituted  we are all in some  measure capable of forming our own temperament  a man of a sanguine  constitution  by taking less juicy nourishment  by abating its quantity   by abstaining from strong liquor   c  may achieve the correction of  the nature  the quality  the quantity  the tendency  the motion of the  fluids  which predominate in his machine  a bilious man  or one who is  melancholy  may  by the aid of certain remedies  diminish the mass of  this bilious fluid  he may correct the blemish of his humours  by the  assistance of exercise  he may dissipate his gloom  by the gaiety which  results from increased motion  an european transplanted into hindostan   will  by degrees  become quite a different man in his humours  in his  ideas  in his temperament  in his character     although but few experiments have been made with a view to learn what  constitutes the temperament of man  there are still enough if he would  but deign to make use of them  if he would vouchsafe to apply to useful  purposes the little experience he has gleaned  it would appear  speaking  generally  that the igneous principle which chemists designate under the  name of  phlogiston   or inflammable matter  is that which in man  yields him the most active life  furnishes him with the greatest energy   affords the greatest mobility to his frame  supplies the greatest spring  to his organs  gives the greatest elasticity to his fibres  the greatest  tension to his nerves  the greatest rapidity to his fluids  from these  causes  which are entirely material  commonly result the dispositions  or faculties called sensibility  wit  imagination  genius  vivacity   c   which give the tone to the passions  to the will  to the moral  actions of man  in this sense  it is with great justice we apply the  expressions   warmth of soul    ardency of imagination    fire of  genius    c     it is this fiery element  diffused unequally  distributed in various  proportions through the beings of the human species  that sets man in  motion  gives him activity  supplies him with animal heat  and which  if  we may be allowed the expression  renders him more or less alive  this  igneous matter  so active  so subtle  dissipates itself with great  facility  then requires to be reinstated in his system by means of  aliments that contain it  which thereby become proper to restore  his machine  to lend new warmth to the brain  to furnish it with the  elasticity requisite to the performance of those functions which are  called intellectual  it is this ardent matter contained in wine  in  strong liquor  that gives to the most torpid  to the dullest  to  the most sluggish man  a vivacity of which  without it  he would be  incapable  which urges even the coward on to battle  when this fiery  element is too abundant in man  whilst he is labouring under certain  diseases  it plunges him into delirium  when it is in too weak or in too  small a quantity  he swoons  he sinks to the earth  this igneous matter  diminishes in his old age  it totally dissipates at his death  it would  not be unreasonable to suppose  that what physicians call the nervous  fluid  which so promptly gives notice to the brain of all that happens  to the body  is nothing more than electric matter  that the various  proportions of this matter diffused through his system  is the cause  of that great diversity to be discovered in the human being  and in the  faculties he possesses     if the intellectual faculties of man  or his moral qualities  be  examined according to the principles here laid down  the conviction must  be complete that they are to be attributed to material causes  which  have an influence more or less marked  either transitory or durable   over his peculiar organization  but where does he derive this  organization  except it be from the parents from whom he receives the  elements of a machine necessarily analogous to their own  from whence  does he derive the greater or less quantity of igneous matter  or  vivifying heat  that decides upon  that gives the tone to his mental  qualities  it is from the mother who bore him in her womb  who has  communicated to him a portion of that fire with which she was herself  animated  which circulated through her veins with her blood   it is  from the aliments that have nourished him   it is from the climate he  inhabits   it is from the atmosphere that surrounds  all these causes  have an influence over his fluids  over his solids  and decide on his  natural dispositions  in examining these dispositions  from whence his  faculties depend  it will ever be found  that they are  corporeal   that  they are  material      the most prominent of these dispositions in man  is that physical  sensibility from which flows all his intellectual or moral qualities  to  feel  according to what has been said  is to receive an impulse  to be  moved  to have a consciousness of the changes operated on his system   to have sensibility is nothing more than to be so constituted as to feel  promptly  and in a very lively manner  the impressions of those objects  which act upon him  a sensible soul is only man s brain  disposed in a  mode to receive the motion communicated to it with facility  to re act  with promptness  by giving an instantaneous impulse to the organs   thus the man is called sensible  whom the sight of the distressed  the  contemplation of the unhappy  the recital of a melancholy tale  the  witnessing of an afflicting catastrophe  or the idea of a dreadful  spectacle  touches in so lively a manner as to enable the brain to give  play to his lachrymal organs  which cause him to shed tears  a sign by  which we recognize the effect of great grief  of extreme anguish in the  human being  the man in whom musical sounds excite a degree of pleasure   or produce very remarkable effects  is said to have a  sensible  or a  fine ear  in short  when it is perceived that eloquence  the beauty of  the arts  the various objects that strike his senses  excite in him very  lively emotions  he is said to possess a soul full of sensibility      wit   is a consequence of this physical sensibility  indeed  wit is  nothing more than the facility which some beings  of the human species  possess  of seizing with promptitude  of developing with quickness  a  whole  with its different relations to other objects   genius   is the  facility with which some men comprehend this whole  and its various  relations when they are difficult to be known  but useful to forward  great and mighty projects  wit may be compared to a piercing eye which  perceives things quickly  genius is an eye that comprehends at one view   all the points of an extended horizon  or what the french term  coup  d oeil   true wit is that which perceives objects with their relations  such as they really are  false wit is that which catches at relations   which do not apply to the object  or which arises from some blemish in  the organization  true wit resembles the direction on a hand post      imagination  is the faculty of combining with promptitude ideas or  images  it consists in the power man possesses of re producing with ease  the modifications of his brain  of connecting them  of attaching them to  the objects to which they are suitable  when imagination does this  it  gives pleasure  its fictions are approved  it embellishes nature  it  is a proof of the soundness of the mind  it aids truth  when on the  contrary  it combines ideas  not formed to associate themselves with  each other  when it paints nothing but disagreeable phantoms  it  disgusts  its fictions are censured  it distorts nature  it advocates  falsehood  it is the proof of a disordered  of a deranged mind  thus  poetry  calculated to render nature more pathetic  more touching   pleases when it creates ideal beings  but which move us agreeably  we   therefore  forgive the illusions it has held forth  on account of the  pleasure we have reaped from them  the hideous chimeras of superstition  displease  because they are nothing more than the productions of a  distempered imagination  that can only awaken the most afflicting  sensations  fills us with the most disagreeable ideas     imagination  when it wanders  produces fanaticism  superstitious  terrors  inconsiderate zeal  phrenzy  and the most enormous crimes  when  it is well regulated  it gives birth to a strong predilection for useful  objects  an energetic passion for virtue  an enthusiastic love of our  country  and the most ardent friendship  the man who is divested  of imagination  is commonly one in whose torpid constitution phlegm  predominates over the igneous fluid  over that sacred fire  which is  the great principle of his mobility  of that warmth of sentiment  which  vivifies all his intellectual faculties  there must be enthusiasm for  transcendent virtues as well as for atrocious crimes  enthusiasm places  the soul in a state similar to that of drunkenness  both the one and the  other excite in man that rapidity of motion which is approved  when  good results  when its effects are beneficial  but which is censured   is called folly  delirium  crime  fury  when it produces nothing but  disorder and confusion     the mind is out of order  it is incapable of judging sanely  the  imagination is badly regulated  whenever man s organization is not so  modified  as to perform its functions with precision  at each moment of  his existence  man gathers experience  every sensation he has  furnishes  a fact that deposits in his brain an idea which his memory recalls with  more or less fidelity  these facts connect themselves  these ideas  are associated  their chain constitutes  experience   this lays the  foundation of  science   knowledge is that consciousness which arises  from reiterated experience  from experiments made with precision of the  sensations  of the ideas  of the effects which an object is capable of  producing  either in ourselves or in others  all science  to be just   must be founded on truth  truth itself rests on the constant  the  faithful relation of our senses  thus   truth  is that conformity  that  perpetual affinity  which man s senses  when well constituted  when  aided by experience  discover to him  between the objects of which he  has a knowledge  and the qualities with which he clothes them  in short   truth is nothing more than the just  the precise association of his  ideas  but how can he  without experience  assure himself of the  accuracy  of the justness of this association  how  if he does not  reiterate this experience  can he compare it  how prove its truth  if  his senses are vitiated  how is it possible they can convey to him with  precision  the sensations  the facts  with which they store his brain   it is only by multiplied  by diversified  by repeated experience  that  he is enabled to rectify the errors of his first conceptions     man is in error every time his organs  either originally defective in  their nature  or vitiated by the durable or transitory modifications  which they undergo  render him incapable of judging soundly of objects   error consists in the false association of ideas  by which qualities are  attributed to objects which they do not possess  man is in error  when  he supposes those beings really to have existence  which have no  local habitation but in his own imagination  he is in error  when he  associates the idea of happiness with objects capable of injuring him   whether immediately or by remote consequences which he cannot foresee     but how can he foresee effects of which he has not yet any knowledge   it is by the aid of experience  by the assistance which this experience  affords  it is known that analogous  that like causes  produce  analogous  produce like effects  memory  by recalling these effects   enables him to form a judgment of those he may expect  whether it be  from the same causes  or from causes that bear a relation to those of  which he has already experienced the action  from this it will appear   that  prudence    foresight   are faculties that are ascribable to  that  grow out of experience  if he has felt that fire excited in his organs  painful sensation  this experience suffices him to know  to foresee   that fire so applied  will consequently excite the same sensations   if he has discovered that certain actions  on his part  stirred up the  hatred  elicited the contempt of others  this experience sufficiently  enables him to foresee  that every time he shall act in a similar  manner  he will be either hated or despised     the faculty man has of gathering experience  of recalling it to himself   of foreseeing effects by which he is enabled to avoid whatever may have  the power to injure him  to procure that which may be useful to the  conservation of his existence  which may contribute to that which is  the sole end of all his actions  whether corporeal or mental   his  felicity  constitutes that  which  in one word  is designated under the  name of  reason   sentiment  imagination  temperament  may be capable  of leading him astray  may have the power to deceive him  but experience  and reflection will rectify his errors  point out his mistakes  place  him in the right road  teach him what can really conduce to  what can  truly conduct him to happiness  from this  it will appear  that  reason   is man s nature  modified by experience  moulded by judgment  regulated  by reflection  it supposes a moderate  sober temperament  a just  a  sound mind  a well regulated  orderly imagination  a knowledge of truth   grounded upon tried  upon reiterated experience  in fact  prudence  and foresight  this will serve to prove  that although nothing is more  commonly asserted  although the phrase is repeated daily  nay  hourly   that  man is a reasonable being   yet there are but a very small number  of the individuals who compose the human species  of whom it can with  truth be said  who really enjoy the faculty of reason  or who combine  the dispositions  the experience  by which it is constituted  it ought  not  then to excite surprise  that the individuals of the human race   who are in a capacity to make true experience  are so few in number   man  when he is born  brings with him into the world organs susceptible  of receiving impulse  amassing ideas  of collecting experience  but  whether it be from the vice of his system  the imperfection of his  organization  or from those causes by which it is modified  his  experience is false  his ideas are confused  his images are badly  associated  his judgment is erroneous  his brain is saturated with  vicious  with wicked systems  which necessarily have an influence over  his conduct  which are continually disturbing his mind  and confounding  his reason     man s senses  as it has been shewn  are the only means by which he is  enabled to ascertain whether his opinions are true or false  whether  his conduct is useful to himself and beneficial to others  whether it is  advantageous or disadvantageous  but that his senses may be competent to  make a faithful relation  that they may be in a capacity to impress true  ideas on his brain  it is requisite they should be sound  that is to  say  in the state necessary to maintain his existence  in that  order which is suitable to his preservation  that condition which is  calculated to ensure his permanent felicity  it is also indispensable  that his brain itself should be healthy  or in the proper circumstances  to enable it to fulfil its functions with precision  to exercise its  faculties with vigour  it is necessary that memory should faithfully  delineate its anterior sensations  should accurately retrace its former  ideas  to the end  that he may be competent to judge  to foresee the  effects he may have to hope  the consequences he may have to fear  from  those actions to which he may be determined by his will  if his organic  system be vicious  if his interior or exterior organs be defective   whether by their natural conformation or from those causes by which they  are regulated  he feels but imperfectly  in a manner less distinct than  is requisite  his ideas are either false or suspicious  he judges badly   he is in a delusion  in a state of ebriety  in a sort of intoxication  that prevents his grasping the true relation of things  in short  if  his memory is faulty  if it is treacherous  his reflection is void   his imagination leads him astray  his mind deceives him  whilst the  sensibility of his organs  simultaneously assailed by a crowd of  impressions  shocked by a variety of impulsions  oppose him to prudence   to foresight  to the exercise of his reason  on the other hand  if the  conformation of his organs  as it happens with those of a phlegmatic  temperament  of a dull habit  does not permit him to move  except with  feebleness  in a sluggish manner  his experience is slow  frequently  unprofitable  the tortoise and the butterfly are alike incapable of  preventing their destruction  the stupid man  equally with him who is  intoxicated  are in that state which renders it impossible for them to  arrive at or attain the end they have in view     but what is the end  what is the aim of man in the sphere he occupies   it is to preserve himself  to render his existence happy  it becomes  then of the utmost importance  that he should understand the true means  which reason points out  which prudence teaches him to use  in order  that he may with certainty  that he may constantly arrive at the  end which he proposes to himself  these he will find are his natural  faculties  his mind  his talents  his industry  his actions  determined  by those passions of which his nature renders him susceptible  which  give more or less activity to his will  experience and reason again shew  him  that the men with whom he is associated are necessary to him   are capable of contributing to his happiness  are in a capacity to  administer to his pleasures  are competent to assist him by those  faculties which are peculiar to them  experience teaches him the mode he  must adopt to induce them to concur in his designs  to determine them to  will and incline them to act in his favour  this points out to him the  actions they approve  those which displease them  the conduct which  attracts them  that which repels them  the judgment by which they are  swayed  the advantages that occur  the prejudicial effects that result  to him from their various modes of existence and from their diverse  manner of acting  this experience furnishes him with the ideas of virtue  and of vice  of justice and of injustice  of goodness and of wickedness   of decency and of indecency  of probity and of knavery  in short   he learns to form a judgment of men  to estimate their actions  to  distinguish the various sentiments excited in them  according to the  diversity of those effects which they make him experience  it is  upon the necessary diversity of these effects that is founded the  discrimination between good and evil  between virtue and vice   distinctions which do not rest  as some thinkers have believed  on the  conventions made between men  still less  as some metaphysicians have  asserted  upon the chimerical will of supernatural beings  but upon the  solid  the invariable  the eternal relations that subsist between beings  of the human species congregated together  and living in society  which  relations will have existence as long as man shall remain  as long as  society shall continue to exist     thus  virtue  is every thing that is truly beneficial  every thing  that is constantly useful to the individuals of the human race  living  together in society   vice  every thing that is really prejudicial   every thing that is permanently injurious to them  the greatest virtues  are those which procure for man the most durable advantages  from which  he derives the most solid happiness  which preserves the greatest degree  of order in his association  the greatest vices  are those which most  disturb his tendency to happiness  which perpetuate error  which most  interrupt the necessary order of society     the  virtuous man   is he whose actions tend uniformly to the welfare   constantly to the happiness  of his fellow creatures  the  vicious man    is he whose conduct tends to the misery  whose propensities form the  unhappiness of those with whom he lives  from whence his own peculiar  misery most commonly results     every thing that procures for a man true and permanent happiness is  reasonable  every thing that disturbs his individual felicity  or that  of the beings necessary to his happiness  is foolish and unreasonable   the man who injures others  is wicked  the man who injures himself  is  an imprudent being  who neither has a knowledge of reason  of his own  peculiar interests  nor of truth     man s  duties  are the means pointed out to him by experience  the  circle which reason describes for him  by which he is to arrive at that  goal he proposes to himself  these duties are the necessary consequence  of the relations subsisting between mortals  who equally desire  happiness  who are equally anxious to preserve their existence  when it  is said these duties  compel him   it signifies nothing more than that   without taking these means  he could not reach the end proposed to him  by his nature  thus   moral obligation  is the necessity of employing  the natural means to render the beings with whom he lives happy  to  the end that he may determine them in turn to contribute to his own  individual happiness  his obligation toward himself  is the necessity  he is under to take those means  without which he would be incapable to  conserve himself  or render his existence solidly and permanently  happy  morals  like the universe  is founded upon necessity  or upon the  eternal relation of things      happiness  is a mode of existence of which man naturally wishes the  duration  or in which he is willing to continue  it is measured by its  duration  by its vivacity  the greatest happiness is that which has the  longest continuance  transient happiness  or that which has only a  short duration  is called  pleasure   the more lively it is  the more  fugitive  because man s senses are only susceptible of a certain quantum  of motion  when pleasure exceeds this given quantity  it is changed into   anguish   or into that painful mode of existence  of which he ardently  desires the cessation  this is the reason why pleasure and pain  frequently so closely approximate each other as scarcely to be  discriminated  immoderate pleasure is the forerunner of regret  it is  succeeded by ennui  it is followed by weariness  it ends in disgust   transient happiness frequently converts itself into durable misfortune   according to these principles it will be seen that man  who in each  moment of his duration seeks necessarily after happiness  ought  when  he is reasonable  to manage  to husband  to regulate his pleasures  to  refuse himself to all those of which the indulgence would be succeeded  by regret  to avoid those which can convert themselves into pain  in  order that he may procure for himself the most permanent felicity     happiness cannot be the same for all the beings of the human species   the same pleasures cannot equally affect men whose conformation is  different  whose modification is diverse  this no doubt  is the true  reason why the greater number of moral philosophers are so little  in accord upon those objects in which they have made man s happiness  consist  as well as on the means by which it may be obtained   nevertheless  in general  happiness appears to be a state  whether  momentary or durable  in which man readily acquiesces  because he finds  it conformable to his being  this state results from the accord   springs out of the conformity  which is found between himself and  those circumstances in which he has been placed by nature  or  if it be  preferred   happiness is the co ordination of man  with the causes that  give him impulse      the ideas which man forms to himself of happiness depend not only on his  temperament  on his individual conformation  but also upon the habits he  has contracted   habit  is  in man  a mode of existence  of thinking  of  acting  which his organs  as well interior as exterior  contract  by the  frequent reiteration of the same motion  from whence results the faculty  of performing these actions with promptitude  of executing them with  facility     if things be attentively considered  it will be found that almost  the whole conduct of man  the entire system of his actions  his  occupations  his connexions  his studies  his amusements  his  manners  his customs  his very garments  even his aliments  are the  effect of habit  he owes equally to habit  the facility with which  he exercises his mental faculties of thought  of judgment  of wit  of  reason  of taste   c  it is to habit he owes the greater part of his  inclinations  of his desires  of his opinions  of his prejudices  of the  ideas  true or false  he forms to himself of his welfare  in short  it  is to habit  consecrated by time  that he owes those errors into  which everything strives to precipitate him  from which every thing  is calculated to prevent him emancipating himself  it is habit that  attaches him either to virtue or to vice  experience proves this   observation teaches incontrovertibly that the first crime is always  accompanied by more pangs of remorse than the second  this again  by  more than the third  so on to those that follow  a first action is the  commencement of a habit  those which succeed confirm it  by force  of combatting the obstacles that prevent the commission of criminal  actions  man arrives at the power of vanquishing them with ease  of  conquering them with facility  thus he frequently becomes wicked from  habit     man is so much modified by habit  that it is frequently confounded  with his nature  from hence results  as will presently be seen  those  opinions or those ideas  which he has called  innate   because he has  been unwilling to recur back to the source from whence they sprung   which has  as it were  identified itself with his brain  however this  may be  he adheres with great strength of attachment to all those things  to which he is habituated  his mind experiences a sort of violence  an  incommodious revulsion  a troublesome distaste  when it is endeavoured  to make him change the course of his ideas  a fatal predilection  frequently conducts him back to the old track in despite of reason     it is by a pure mechanism that may be explained the phenomena of habit   as well physical as moral  the soul  notwithstanding its spirituality   is modified exactly in the same manner as the body  habit  in man   causes the organs of voice to learn the mode of expressing quickly the  ideas consigned to his brain  by means of certain motion  which  during  his infancy  the tongue acquires the power of executing with facility   his tongue  once habituated to move itself in a certain manner  finds  much trouble  has great pain  to move itself after another mode  the  throat yields with difficulty to those inflections which are exacted by  a language different from that to which he has  been accustomed  it is  the same with regard to his ideas  his brain  his interior organ  his  soul  inured to a given manner of modification  accustomed to attach  certain ideas to certain objects  long used to form to itself a system  connected with certain opinions  whether true or false  experiences a  painful sensation  whenever he undertakes to give it a new impulse  or  alter the direction of its habitual motion  it is nearly as difficult to  make him change his opinions as his language     here  then  without doubt  is the cause of that almost invincible  attachment which man displays to those customs  those prejudices  those  institutions of which it is in vain that reason  experience  good sense  prove to him the inutility  or even the danger  habit opposes itself to  the clearest  the most evident demonstrations  these can avail  nothing against those passions  those vices  which time has rooted  in him  against the most ridiculous systems  against the most absurd  notions  against the most extravagant hypotheses  against the strangest  customs  above all  when he has learned to attach to them the ideas  of utility  of common interest  of the welfare of society  such is the  source of that obstinacy  of that stubbornness  which man evinces for  his religion  for ancient usages  for unreasonable customs  for laws so  little accordant with justice  for abuses  which so frequently make him  suffer  for prejudices of which he sometimes acknowledges the absurdity   yet is unwilling to divest himself of them  here is the reason  why nations contemplate the most useful novelties as mischievous  innovations  why they believe they would be lost  if they were to  remedy those evils to which they have become habituated  which they have  learned to consider as necessary to their repose  which they have been  taught to consider dangerous to be cured      education  is only the art of making man contract  in early life   that is to say  when his organs are extremely flexible  the habits  the  opinions  the modes of existence  adopted by the society in which he  is placed  the first moments of his infancy are employed in collecting  experience  those who are charged with the care of rearing him  or who  are entrusted to bring him up  teach him how to apply it  it is they who  develope reason in him  the first impulse they give him commonly decides  upon his condition  upon his passions  upon the ideas he forms to  himself of happiness  upon the means he shall employ to procure it   upon his virtues  and upon his vices  under the eyes of his masters   the infant acquires ideas  under their tuition he learns to associate  them   to think in a certain manner   to judge well or ill  they point  out to him various objects  which they accustom him either to love or  to hate  to desire or to avoid  to esteem or to despise  it is thus  opinions are transmitted from fathers  mothers  nurses  and masters   to man in his infantine state  it is thus  that his mind by degrees  saturates itself with truth  or fills itself with error  after which  he regulates his conduct  which renders him either happy or miserable   virtuous or vicious  estimable or hateful  it is thus he becomes either  contented or discontented with his destiny  according to the objects  towards which they have directed his passions  towards which they have  bent the energies of his mind  that is to say  in which they have shewn  him his interest  in which they have taught him to place his felicity   in consequence  he loves and searches after that which they have taught  him to revere  that which they have made the object of his research  he  has those tastes  those inclinations  those phantasms  which  during the  whole course of his life  he is forward to indulge  which he is eager to  satisfy  in proportion to the activity they have excited in him  and the  capacity with which he has been provided by nature      politics  ought to be the art of regulating the passions of man  of  directing them to the welfare of society  of diverting them into a  genial current of happiness  of making them flow gently to the  general benefit of all  but too frequently it is nothing more than the  detestible art of arming the passions of the various members of society  against each other   of making them the engines to accomplish their  mutual destruction   of converting them into agents which embitter  their existence  create jealousies among them  and fill with rancorous  animosities that association from which  if properly managed  man ought  to derive his felicity  society is commonly so vicious because it is not  founded upon nature  upon experience  and upon general utility  but  on the contrary  upon the passions  upon the caprices  and upon the  particular interests of those by whom it is governed  in short  it is  for the most part the advantage of the few opposed to the prosperity of  the many     politics  to be useful  should found its principles upon nature  that is  to say  should conform itself to the essence of man  should mould itself  to the great end of society  but what is society  and what is its end   it is a whole  formed by the union of a great number of families  or by  a collection of individuals  assembled from a reciprocity of interest   in order that they may satisfy with greater facility their reciprocal  wants  that they may  with more certainty  procure the advantages they  desire  that they may obtain mutual succours  above all  that they may  gain the faculty of enjoying  in security  those benefits with which  nature and industry may furnish them  it follows  of course  that  politics  which are intended to maintain society  and to consolidate  the interests of this congregation  ought to enter into its views  to  facilitate the means of giving them efficiency  to remove all those  obstacles that have a tendency to counteract the intention with which  man entered into association     man  in approximating to his fellow man  to live with him in society   has made  either formally or tacitly  a covenant  by which he engages  to render mutual services  to do nothing that can be prejudicial to his  neighbour  but as the nature of each individual impels him each instant  to seek after his own welfare  which he has mistaken to consist in the  gratification of his passions  and the indulgence of his transitory  caprices  without any regard to the convenience of his fellows  there  needed a power to conduct him back to his duty  to oblige him to conform  himself to his obligations  and to recall him to his engagements  which  the hurry of his passions frequently make him forget  this power is the   law   it is  or ought to be  the collection of the will of society   reunited to fix the conduct of its members  to direct their action in  such a mode  that it may concur to the great end of his association  the  general good     but as society  more especially when very numerous  is incapable of  assembling itself  unless with great difficulty  as it cannot with  tumult make known its intentions  it is obliged to choose citizens in  whom it places a confidence  whom it makes the interpreter of its will   whom it constitutes the depositaries of the power requisite to carry  it into execution  such is the origin of all  government   which to be  legitimate can only be founded on the free consent of society  those  who are charged with the care of governing  call themselves sovereigns   chiefs  legislators  according to the form which society has been  willing to give to its government  these sovereigns are styled monarchs   magistrates  representatives   c  government only borrows its power from  society  being established for no other purpose than its welfare  it is  evident society can revoke this power whenever its interest shall exact  it  change the form of its government  extend or limit the power which  it has confided to its chiefs  over whom  by the immutable laws of  nature  it always conserves a supreme authority  because these laws  enjoin  that the part shall always remain subordinate to the whole     thus sovereigns are the ministers of society  its interpreters  the  depositaries of a greater or of a less portion of its power  but they  are not its absolute masters  neither are they the proprietors of  nations  by a  covenant   either expressed or implied  they engage  themselves to watch over the maintenance  to occupy themselves with the  welfare of society  it is only upon these conditions society consents to  obey them  the price of obedience is protection  there is or ought to  be a reciprocity of interest between the governed and the governor   whenever this reciprocity is wanting  society is in that state of  confusion of which we spoke in the fifth chapter  it is verging on  destruction  no society upon earth was ever willing or competent to  confer irrevocably upon its chiefs the power  the right  of doing it  injury  such a concession  such a compact  would be annulled  would be  rendered void by nature  because she wills that each society  the  same as each individual of the human species shall tend to its own  conservation  it has not therefore the capacity to consent to its  permanent unhappiness   laws   in order that they may be just  ought  invariably to have for their end  the general interest of society  that  is to say  to assure to the greater number of citizens those advantages  for which man originally associated  these advantages are  liberty   property  security       liberty   to man  is the faculty of doing  for his own peculiar  happiness  every thing which does not injure or diminish the happiness  of his associates  in associating  each individual renounced the  exercise of that portion of his natural liberty which would be able to  prejudice or injure the liberty of his fellows  the exercise of that  liberty which is injurious to society is called  licentiousness       property   to man  is the faculty of enjoying those advantages which  spring from labour  those benefits which industry or talent has procured  to each member of society      security   to man  is the certitude  the assurance  that each  individual ought to have  of enjoying in his person  of finding for  his property the protection of the laws  as long as he shall faithfully  observe  as long as he shall punctually perform  his engagements with  society      justice   to man  assures to all the members of society  the possession  of these advantages  the enjoyment of those rights  which belong to  them  from this  it will appear  that without justice  society is not in  a condition to procure the happiness of any man  justice is also called   equity   because by the assistance of the laws made to command the  whole  she reduces all its members to a state of equality  that is  to say  she prevents them from prevailing one over the other  by  the inequality which nature or industry may have made between their  respective powers      rights   to man  are every thing which society  by equitable laws   permits each individual to do for his own peculiar felicity  these  rights are evidently limited by the invariable end of all association   society has  on its part  rights over all its members  by virtue of the  advantages which it procures for them  all its members  in turn  have  a right to claim  to exact from society  or secure from its ministers  those advantages for the procuring of which they congregated  in favour  of which they renounced a portion of their natural liberty  a society   of which the chiefs  aided by the laws  do not procure any good for its  members  evidently loses its right over them  those chiefs who injure  society lose the right of commanding  it is not our country  without  it secures the welfare of its inhabitants  a society without equity  contains only enemies  a society oppressed is composed only of tyrants  and slaves  slaves are incapable of being citizens  it is liberty   property  and security  that render our country dear to us  it is the  true love of his country that forms the citizen     for want of having a proper knowledge of these truths  or for want  of applying them when known  some nations have become unhappy  have  contained nothing but a vile heap of slaves  separated from each other   detached from society  which neither procures for them any good  nor  secures to them any one advantage  in consequence of the imprudence of  some nations  or of the craft  cunning  and violence of those to whom  they have confided the power of making laws  and carrying them into  execution  their sovereigns have rendered themselves absolute masters of  society  these  mistaking the true source of their power  pretended to  hold it from heaven  to be accountable for their actions to god alone   to owe nothing  not to have any obligation to society  in a word  to  be gods upon earth  to possess the right of governing arbitrarily   from thence politics became corrupted  they were only a mockery  such  nations  disgraced and grown contemptible  did not dare resist the will  of their chiefs  their laws were nothing more than the expression of the  caprice of these chiefs  public welfare was sacrificed to their peculiar  interests  the force of society was turned against itself  its members  withdrew to attach themselves to its oppressors  to its tyrants  these  to seduce them  permitted them to injure it with impunity and to profit  by its misfortunes  thus liberty  justice  security  and virtue  were  banished from many nations  politics was no longer any thing more than  the art of availing itself of the forces of a people and of the treasure  of society  of dividing it on the subject of its interest  in order to  subjugate it by itself  at length a stupid  a mechanical habit  made  them cherish their oppressors  and love their chains     man when he has nothing to fear  presently becomes wicked  he who  believes he has not occasion for his fellow  persuades himself he may  follow the inclinations of his heart without caution or discretion  thus  fear is the only obstacle society can effectually oppose to the passions  of its chiefs  without it they will quickly become corrupt  and will  not scruple to avail themselves of the means society has placed in their  hands  to make them accomplices in their iniquity  to prevent these  abuses  it is requisite society should set bounds to its confidence   should limit the power which it delegates to its chiefs  should reserve  to itself a sufficient portion of authority to prevent them from  injuring it  it must establish prudent checks  it must cautiously divide  the power it confers  because re united  it will by such reunion be  infallibly oppressed  the slightest reflection  the most scanty  review  will make men feel that the burthen of governing and weight  of administration  is too ponderous and overpowering to be borne by an  individual  that the scope of his jurisdiction  that the range of his  surveillance  and multiplicity of his duties must always render him  negligent  that the extent of his power has ever a tendency to render  him mischievous  in short  the experience of all ages will convince  nations that man is continually tempted to the abuse of power  that as  an abundance of strong liquor intoxicates his brain  so unlimited power  corrupts his heart  that therefore the sovereign ought to be subject to  the law  not the law to the sovereign      government  has necessarily an equal influence over the philosophy  as  over the morals of nations  in the same manner that its care produces  labour  activity  abundance  salubrity and justice  its negligence  induces idleness  sloth  discouragement  penury  contagion  injustice   vices and crimes  it depends upon government either to foster industry   mature genius  give a spring to talents  or stifle them  indeed  government  the disturber of dignities  of riches  of rewards  and  punishments  the master of those objects in which man from his infancy  has learned to place his felicity  and contemplate as the means of his  happiness  acquires a necessary influence over his conduct  it kindles  his passions  gives them direction  makes him instrumental to whatever  purpose it pleases  it modifies him  determines his manners  which in  a whole people  as in the individual  is nothing more than the conduct   the general system of wills  of actions that necessarily result from his  education  government  laws  and religious opinions  his institutions   whether rational or irrational  in short  manners are the habits of a  people  these are good whenever society draws from them true felicity  and solid happiness  they are bad  they are detestable in the eye of  reason  when the happiness of society does not spring from them  they  are unwholesome when they have nothing more in their favour than the  suffrage of time  and the countenance of prejudice which rarely  consults experience  which is almost ever at variance with good sense   notwithstanding they may have the sanction of the law  custom  religion   public opinion  or example  they may be unworthy and may be disgraceful   provided society is in disorder  that crime abounds  that virtue shrinks  beneath the basilisk eye of triumphant vice  they may then be said to  resemble the upas  whose luxuriant yet poisonous foliage  the produce  of a rank soil  becomes more baneful to those who are submitted to  its vortex  in proportion as it extends its branches  if experience he  consulted  it will be found there is no action  however abominable  that  has not received the applause  that has not obtained the approbation of  some people  parricide  the sacrifice of children  robbery  usurpation   cruelty  intolerance  and prostitution  have all in their turn been  licensed actions  have been advocated  have been deemed laudable  and meritorious deeds with some nations of the earth  above all    superstition  has consecrated the most unreasonable  the most revolting  customs     man s passions result from and depend on the motion of attraction or  repulsion  of which he is rendered susceptible by nature  who enables  him  by his peculiar essence  to be attracted by those objects which  appear useful to him  to be repelled by those which he considers  prejudicial  it follows that government  by holding the magnet  can put  these passions into activity  has the power either of restraining them   or of giving them a favorable or an unfavorable direction  all his  passions are constantly limited by either loving or hating  seeking  or avoiding  desiring or fearing  these passions  so necessary to the  conservation of man  are a consequence of his organization  they display  themselves with more or less energy  according to his temperament   education and habit develope them  government gives them play  conducts  them towards those objects  which it believes itself interested in  making desirable to its subjects  the various names which have been  given to these passions  are relative to the different objects by which  they are excited  such as pleasure  grandeur  or riches  which produce  voluptuousness  ambition  vanity and avarice  if the source of those  passions which predominate in nations be attentively examined it will  be commonly found in their governments  it is the impulse received  from their chiefs that renders them sometimes warlike  sometimes  superstitious  sometimes aspiring after glory  sometimes greedy after  wealth  sometimes rational  and sometimes unreasonable  if sovereigns   in order to enlighten and render happy their dominions  were to employ  only the  tenth  part of the vast expenditures which they lavish  only  a  tythe  of the pains which they employ to render them brutish  to  stupify them  to deceive them  and to afflict them  their subjects  would presently be as wise  would quickly be as happy  as they are now  remarkable for being blind  ignorant  and miserable     let the vain project of destroying  the delusive attempt at rooting his  passions from the heart of man  he abandoned  let an effort be made to  direct them towards objects that may be useful to himself  beneficial to  his associates  let education  let government  let the laws  habituate  him to restrain his passions within those just bounds that experience  fixes and reason prescribes  let the ambitious have honours  titles   distinctions  and power  when they shall have usefully served their  country  let riches be given to those who covet them  when they shall  have rendered themselves necessary to their fellow citizens  let  commendations  let eulogies  encourage those who shall be actuated by  the love of glory  in short  let the passions of man have a free  an  uninterrupted course  whenever there shall result from their exercise   real  substantial  and durable advantages to society  let education  kindle only those  which are truly beneficial to the human species  let  it favour those alone which are really necessary to the maintenance of  society  the passions of man are dangerous  only because every thing  conspires to give them an evil direction     nature does not make man either good or wicked  she combines machines  more or less active  mobile  and energetic  she furnishes him with  organs and temperament  of which his passions  more or less impetuous   are the necessary consequence  these passions have always his happiness  for their object  his welfare for their end  in consequence they are  legitimate  they are natural  they can only be called bad or good   relatively  to the influence they have on the beings of his species   nature gives man legs proper to sustain his weight  and necessary to  transport him from one place to another  the care of those who rear them  strengthens them  habituates him to avail himself of him  accustoms  him to make either a good or a bad use of them  the arm which he has  received from nature is neither good nor bad  it is necessary to a great  number of the actions of life  nevertheless  the use of this arm  becomes criminal  if he has contracted the habit of using it to rob  to  assassinate  with a view to obtain that money which he has been taught  from his infancy to desire  and which the society in which he lives  renders necessary to him  but which his industry will enable him to  obtain without doing injury to his fellow man     the heart of man is a soil which nature has made equally suitable to the  production of brambles  or of useful grain  of deleterous poison  or of  refreshing fruit  by virtue of the seeds which may be sown in it  by the  cultivation that may be bestowed upon it  in his infancy  those objects  are pointed out to him which he is to estimate or to despise  to  seek after or to avoid  to love or to hate  it is his parents   his instructors  who render him either virtuous or wicked  wise or  unreasonable  studious or dissipated  steady or trifling  solid or  vain  their example  their discourse  modify him through his whole life   teaching him what are the things he ought either to desire or to avoid   what the objects he ought to fear or to love  he desires them  in  consequence  and he imposes on himself the task of obtaining them   according to the energy of his temperament  which ever decides the  force of his passions  it is thus that education  by inspiring him with  opinions  by infusing into him ideas  whether true or false  gives  him those primitive impulsions after which he acts  in a manner either  advantageous or prejudicial both to himself and to others  man  at  his birth  brings with him into the world nothing but the necessity  of conserving himself  of rendering his existence happy  instruction   example  the customs of the world  present him with the means  either  real or imaginary  of achieving it  habit procures for him the facility  of employing these means  he attaches himself strongly to those he  judges best calculated  most proper to secure to him the possession of  those objects which they have taught him  which he has learned to  desire as the preferable good attached to his existence  whenever his  education  whenever the examples which have been afforded him  whenever  the means with which he has been provided  are approved by reason  are  the result of experience  every thing concurs to render him virtuous   habit strengthens these dispositions in him  he becomes  in consequence   a useful member of society  to the interests of which  every thing ought  to prove to him his own permanent well being  his own durable felicity   is necessarily allied  if  on the contrary  his education  his  institutions  the examples which are set before him  the opinions which  are suggested to him in his infancy  are of a nature to exhibit to his  mind virtue as useless and repugnant  vice as useful and congenial to  his own individual happiness  he will become vicious  he will believe  himself interested in injuring society  in rendering his associates  unhappy  he will be carried along by the general current  he will  renounce virtue  which to him will no longer be any thing more than  a vain idol  without attractions to induce him to follow it  without  charms to tempt his adoration  because it will appear to exact  that he  should immolate at its shrine  that he should sacrifice at its altar all  those objects which he has been constantly taught to consider the most  dear to himself  to contemplate as benefits the most desirable     in order that man may become virtuous  it is absolutely requisite that  he should have an interest  that he should find advantages in practising  virtue  for this end  it is necessary that education should implant in  him reasonable ideas  that public opinion should lean towards virtue  as  the most desirable good  that example should point it out as the object  most worthy esteem  that government should faithfully recompense  should  regularly reward it  that honor should always accompany its practice   that vice should constantly be despised  that crime should invariably be  punished  is virtue in this situation amongst men  does the education of  man infuse into him just  faithful ideas of happiness  true notions of  virtue  dispositions really favourable to the beings with whom he is to  live  the examples spread before him  are they suitable to innocence and  manners  are they calculated to make him respect decency  to cause him  to love probity  to practice honesty  to value good faith  to esteem  equity  to revere conjugal fidelity  to observe exactitude in fulfilling  his duties  religion  which alone pretends to regulate his manners  does  it render him sociable  does it make him pacific  does it teach him to  be humane  the arbiters  the sovereigns of society  are they faithful  in recompensing  punctual in rewarding  those who have best served their  country  in punishing those who have pillaged  who have robbed  who have  plundered  who have divided  who have ruined it  justice  does she hold  her scales with a firm  with an even hand  between all the citizens  of the state  the laws  do they never support the strong against the  weak  favor the rich against the poor  uphold the happy against the  miserable  in short  is it an uncommon spectacle to behold crime  frequently justified  often applauded  sometimes crowned with success   insolently triumphing  arrogantly striding over that merit which it  disdains  over that virtue which it outrages  well then  in societies  thus constituted  virtue can only be heard by a very small number of  peaceable citizens  a few generous souls  who know how to estimate its  value  who enjoy it in secret  for the others  it is only a disgusting  object  they see in it nothing but the supposed enemy to their  happiness  or the censor of their individual conduct     if man  according to his nature  is necessitated to desire his welfare   he is equally obliged to love and cherish the means by which he believes  it is to be acquired  it would be useless  it would perhaps be unjust   to demand that a man should be virtuous  if he could not be so without  rendering himself miserable  whenever he thinks vice renders him happy   he must necessarily love vice  whenever he sees inutility recompensed   crime rewarded  whenever he witnesses either or both of them  honored   what interest will he find in occupying himself with the  happiness of his fellow creatures  what advantage will he discover in  restraining the fury of his passions  whenever his mind is saturated  with false ideas  filled with dangerous opinions  it follows  of course   that his whole conduct will become nothing more than a long chain of  errors  a tissue of mistakes  a series of depraved actions     we are informed  that the savages  in order to flatten the heads  of their children  squeeze them between two boards  by that means  preventing them from taking the shape designed for them by nature  it is  pretty nearly the same thing with the institutions of man  they commonly  conspire to counteract nature  to constrain and divert  to extinguish  the impulse nature has given him  to substitute others which are the  source of all his misfortunes  in almost all the countries of the  earth  man is bereft of truth  is fed with falsehoods  and amused with  marvellous chimeras  he is treated like those children whose members  are  by the imprudent care of their nurses  swathed with little fillets   bound up with rollers  which deprive them of the free use of their  limbs  obstruct their growth  prevent their activity  and oppose  themselves to their health     most of the superstitious opinions of man have for their object only to  display to him his supreme felicity in those illusions for which they  kindle his passions  but as the phantoms which are presented to his  imagination are incapable of being considered in the same light by all  who contemplate them  he is perpetually in dispute concerning these  objects  he hates his fellow  he persecutes his neighbour  his neighbour  in turn persecutes him  and he believes that in doing this he is doing  well  that in committing the greatest crimes to sustain his opinions  he is acting right  it is thus superstition infatuates man from his  infancy  fills him with vanity  and enslaves him with fanaticism  if he  has a heated imagination  it drives him on to fury  if he has activity   it makes him a madman  who is frequently as cruel himself  as he is  dangerous to his fellow creatures  as he is incommodious to others  if   on the contrary  he be phlegmatic  and of a slothful habit  he becomes  melancholy and useless to society      public opinion  every instant offers to man s contemplation false ideas  of honor  and wrong notions of glory  it attaches his esteem not only  to frivolous advantages  but also to prejudicial interests and injurious  actions  which example authorizes  which prejudice consecrates  which  habit precludes him from viewing with the disgust and horror which they  merit  indeed  habit familiarizes his mind with the most absurd  ideas  the most unreasonable customs  the most blameable actions  with  prejudices the most contrary to his own interests  and detrimental  to the society in which he lives  he finds nothing strange  nothing  singular  nothing despicable  nothing ridiculous  except those opinions  and objects to which he is himself unaccustomed  there are countries  in which the most laudable actions appear very blameable and  ridiculous  where the foulest and most diabolical actions pass for very  honest and perfectly rational conduct  in some nations they kill the old  men  in some the children strangle their fathers  the phoenicians and  carthaginians immolated their children to their gods  europeans approve  duels  he who refuses to cut the throat of another  or to blow out the  brains of his neighbour  is contemplated by them as dishonoured  the  spaniards and portuguese think it meritorious to burn an heretic  in  some countries women prostitute themselves without dishonour  in others  it is the height of hospitality for a man to present his wife to the  embraces of the stranger  the refusal to accept this  excites his scorn  and calls forth his resentment      authority  commonly believes itself interested in maintaining the  received opinions  those prejudices and errors which it considers  requisite to the maintenance of its power and the consolidation of its  interests  are sustained by force  which is never rational  princes  themselves  filled with deceptive images of happiness  mistaken notions  of power  erroneous opinions of grandeur  and false ideas of glory  are  surrounded with flattering courtiers  who are interested in keeping  up the delusion of their masters  these contemptible men have acquired  ideas of virtue  only that they may outrage it  by degrees they  corrupt the people  these become depraved  lend themselves to their  debaucheries  pander to the vices of the great  then make a merit of  imitating them in their irregularities  a court is too frequently the  true focus of the corruption of a people     this is the true source of moral evil  it is thus that every thing  conspires to render man vicious  and give a fatal impulse to his soul   from whence results the general confusion of society  which becomes  unhappy  from the misery of almost every one of its members  the  strongest motive powers are put in action to inspire man with a passion  for futile objects which are indifferent to him  which make him become  dangerous to his fellow man  by the means which he is compelled to  employ  in order to obtain them  those who have the charge of guiding  his steps  either impostors themselves  or the dupes to their own  prejudices  forbid him to hearken to reason  they make truth appear  dangerous to him  they exhibit error as requisite to his welfare  not  only in this world  but in the next  in short  habit strongly attaches  him to his irrational opinions  to his perilous inclinations  and to his  blind passion for objects either useless or dangerous  here  then   is the reason why for the most part man finds himself necessarily  determined to evil  the reason why the passions  inherent in his  nature and necessary to his conservation  become the instruments of his  destruction  and the bane of that society  which properly conducted   they ought to preserve  the reason why society becomes a state of  warfare  why it does nothing but assemble enemies  who are envious of  each other  and are always rivals for the prize  if some virtuous beings  are to be found in these societies  they must be sought for in the  very small number of those  who born with a phlegmatic temperament have  moderate passions  who therefore  either do not desire at all  or desire  very feebly  those objects with which their associates are continually  inebriated     man s nature  diversely cultivated  decides upon his faculties  as  well corporeal as intellectual  upon his qualities  as well moral  as physical  the man who is of a sanguine  robust constitution  must  necessarily have strong passions  he who is of a bilious  melancholy  habit  will as necessarily have fantastical and gloomy passions  the man  of a gay turn  of a sprightly imagination  will have cheerful passions   while the man in whom phlegm abounds  will have those which are gentle   or which have a very slight degree of violence  it appears to be upon  the equilibrium of the humours  that depends the state of the man who  is called  virtuous   his temperament seems to be the result of a  combination  in which the elements or principles are balanced with such  precision that no one passion predominates over another  or carries into  his machine more disorder than its neighbour     habit  as we have seen  is man s nature modified  this latter furnishes  the matter  education  domestic example  national manners  give it the  form  these  acting on his temperament  make him either reasonable  or  irrational  enlightened  or stupid  a fanatic  or a hero  an enthusiast  for the public good  or an unbridled criminal  a wise man  smitten with  the advantages of virtue  or a libertine  plunged into every kind of  vice  all the varieties of the moral man  depend on the diversity of his  ideas  which are themselves arranged and combined in his brain by the  intervention of his senses  his temperament is the produce of physical  substances  his habits are the effect of physical modifications  the  opinions  whether good or bad  injurious or beneficial  true or false   which form themselves in his mind  are never more than the effect of  those physical impulsions which the brain receives by the medium of the  senses             chap  x      the soul does not derive its ideas from itself  it has no innate  ideas        what has preceded suffices to prove  that the interior organ of man   which is called his  soul   is purely material  he will be enabled to  convince himself of this truth  by the manner in which he acquires his  ideas   from those impressions which material objects successively make  on his organs  which are themselves acknowledged to be material  it has  been seen  that the faculties which are called intellectual  are to be  ascribed to that of feeling  the different qualities of those faculties  which are called moral  have been explained after the necessary laws  of a very simple mechanism  it now remains  to reply to those who still  obstinately persist in making the soul a substance distinguished from  the body  or who insist on giving it an essence totally distinct  they  seem to found their distinction upon this  that this interior organ has  the faculty of drawing its ideas from within itself  they will have it   that man  at his birth  brings with him ideas into the world  which   according to this wonderful notion  they have called  innate   the jews  have a similar doctrine which they borrowed from the chaldeans  their  rabbins taught  that each soul  before it was united to the seed that  must form an infant in the womb of a woman  is confided to the care of  an angel  which causes him to behold heaven  earth  and hell  this  they  pretend  is done by the assistance of a lamp  which extinguishes itself  as soon as the infant comes into the world  some ancient philosophers  have held  that the soul originally contains the principles of several  notions or doctrines  the stoics designated this by the term prolepsis    anticipated opinions   the greek mathematicians  koinas ennoias    universal ideas   they have believed that the soul  by a special  privilege  in a nature where every thing is connected  enjoyed the  faculty of moving itself without receiving any impulse  of creating to  itself ideas  of thinking on a subject  without being determined to  such action  by any exterior object  which by moving its organs should  furnish it with an image of the subject of its thoughts  in consequence  of these gratuitous suppositions  of these extraordinary pretensions   which it is only requisite to expose  in order to confute some very able  speculators  who were prepossessed by their superstitious prejudices   have ventured the length to assert  that without model  without  prototype to act on the senses  the soul is competent to delineate to  itself  the whole universe with all the beings it contains  descartes  and his disciples have assured us  that the body went absolutely for  nothing  in the sensations  in the perceptions  in the ideas of the  soul  that it can feel  that it can perceive  that it can understand   that it can taste  that it can touch  even when there should exist  nothing that is corporeal or material exterior to ourselves  but what  shall be said of a berkeley  who has endeavoured  who has laboured to  prove to man  that every thing in this world is nothing more than a  chimerical illusion  that the universe exists nowhere but in himself   that it has no identity but in his imagination  who has rendered the  existence of all things problematical by the aid of sophisms  insolvable  even to those who maintain the doctrine of the spirituality of the soul     extravagant as this doctrine of the bishop of cloyne may appear  it  cannot well be more so than that of malebranche  the champion of innate  ideas  who makes the divinity the common bond between the soul and the  body  or than that of those metaphysicians  who maintain that the soul  is a substance heterogeneous to the body  who by ascribing to this soul  the thoughts of man  have in fact rendered the body superfluous  they  have not perceived they were liable to one solid objection  which is   that if the ideas of man are innate  if he derives them from a superior  being  independent of exterior causes  if he sees every thing in god   how comes it that so many false ideas are afloat  that so many errors  prevail  with which the human mind is saturated  from whence comes these  opinions  which according to the theologians are so displeasing to god   might it not be a question to the malebranchists  was it in the divinity  that spinoza beheld his system     nevertheless  to justify such monstrous opinions  they assert that ideas  are only the objects of thought  but according to the last analysis   these ideas can only reach man from exterior objects  which in giving  impulse to his senses modify his brain  or from the material beings  contained within the interior of his machine  who make some parts of his  body experience those sensations which he perceives  which furnish him  with ideas  which he relates  faithfully or otherwise  to the cause that  moves him  each idea is an effect  but however difficult it may be to  recur to the cause  can we possibly suppose it is not ascribable to  a cause  if we can only form ideas of material substances  how can we  suppose the cause of our ideas can possibly be immaterial  to pretend  that man without the aid of exterior objects  without the intervention  of his senses  is competent to form ideas of the universe  is to assert   that a blind man is in a capacity to form a true idea of a picture  that  represents some fact of which he has never heard any one speak     it is very easy to perceive the source of those errors  into which men   otherwise extremely profound and very enlightened have fallen  when they  have been desirous to speak of the soul  to describe its operations   obliged either by their own prejudices  or by the fear of combatting the  opinions of some imperious theologian  they have become the advocates of  the principle  that the soul was a pure spirit  an immaterial substance   of an essence directly different from that of the body  from every thing  we behold  this granted  they have been incompetent to conceive how  material objects could operate  in what manner gross and corporeal  organs were enabled to act on a substance  that had no kind of analogy  with them  how they were in a capacity to modify it by conveying its  ideas  in the impossibility of explaining this phenomenon  at the same  time perceiving that the soul had ideas  they concluded that it must  draw them from itself  and not from those beings  which according to  their own hypothesis  were incapable of acting on it  or rather  of  which they could not conceive the manner of action  they therefore  imagined that all the modifications  all the actions of this soul   sprung from its own peculiar energy  were imprinted on it from its first  formation  by the author of nature  that these did not in any manner  depend upon the beings of which we have a knowledge  or which act upon  it  by the gross means of our senses     there are  however  some phenomena  which  considered superficially   appear to support the opinion of these philosophers  to announce a  faculty in the human soul of producing ideas within itself  without any  exterior aid  these are  dreams   in which the interior organ of man   deprived of objects that move it visibly  does not  however  cease to  have ideas  to be set in activity  to be modified in a manner that is  sufficiently sensible  to have an influence upon his body  but if a  little reflection be called in  the solution to this difficulty will  be found  it will be perceived that  even during sleep  his brain is  supplied with a multitude of ideas  with which the eye or time before  has stocked it  these ideas were communicated to it by exterior or  corporeal objects  by which they have been modified  it will be found  that these modifications renew themselves  not by any spontaneous   not by any voluntary motion on its part  but by a chain of involuntary  movements which take place in his machine  which determine  which excite  those that give play to the brain  these modifications renew themselves  with more or less fidelity  with a greater or lesser degree of  conformity to those which it has anteriorly experienced  sometimes in  dreaming  he has memory  then he retraces to himself the objects which  have struck him faithfully   at other times  these modifications renew  themselves without order  and without connection  very differently from  those  which real objects have before excited in his interior organ  if  in a dream he believes he sees a friend  his brain renews in itself the  modifications or the ideas which this friend had formerly excited  in  the same order that they arranged themselves when his eyes really beheld  him  this is nothing more than an effect of memory  if in his dream he  fancies he sees a monster which has no model in nature  his brain is  then modified in the same manner that it was by the particular  by the  detached ideas  with which it then does nothing more than compose an  ideal whole  by assembling  and associating  in a ridiculous manner  the  scattered ideas that were consigned to its keeping  it is then  that in  dreaming he has imagination     those dreams that are troublesome  extravagant  whimsical  or  unconnected  are commonly the effect of some confusion in his machine   such as painful indigestion  an overheated blood  a prejudicial  fermentation   c   these material causes excite in his body a disorderly  motion  which precludes the brain from being modified in the same manner  it was on the day before  in consequence of this irregular motion the  brain is disturbed  it only represents to itself confused ideas that  want connection  when in a dream  he believes he sees a sphinx  a being  supposed by the poets to have a head and face like a woman  a body like  a dog  wings like a bird  and claws like a lion  who put forth riddles  and killed those who could not expound them  either  he has seen the  representation of one when he was awake  or else the disorderly motion  of the brain is such that it causes it to combine ideas  to connect  parts  from which there results a whole without model  of which the  parts were not formed to be united  it is thus  that his brain combines  the head of a woman  of which it already has the idea  with the body of  a lioness  of which it also has the image  in this his head acts in the  same manner  as when by any defect in the interior organ  his disordered  imagination paints to him some objects  notwithstanding he is awake  he  frequently dreams  without being asleep  his dreams never produce any  thing so strange but that they have some resemblance  with the  objects which have anteriorly acted on his senses  which have already  communicated ideas to his brain  the watchful theologians have composed   at their leisure  in their waking hours  those phantoms  of which they  avail themselves  to terrify or frighten man  they have done nothing  more than assemble the scattered traits which they have found in the  most terrible beings of their own species  by exaggerating the powers   by enlarging the rights claimed by tyrants  they have formed ideal  beings  before whom man trembles  and is afraid     thus  it is seen  that dreams  far from proving that the soul acts by  its own peculiar energy  that it draws its ideas from its own recesses   prove  on the contrary  that in sleep it is intirely passive  that it  does not even renew its modifications  but according to the involuntary  confusion  which physical causes produce in the body  of which every  thing tends to shew the identity  the consubstantiality with the soul   what appears to have led those into a mistake  who maintained that the  soul drew its ideas from itself  is this  they have contemplated these  ideas  as if they were real beings  when  in point of fact  they are  nothing more than the modifications produced in the brain of man  by  objects to which this brain is a stranger  they are these objects   who are the true models  who are the real archetypes to which it is  necessary to recur  here is the source of all their errors     in the individual who dreams  the soul does not act more from itself   than it does in the man who is drunk  that is to say  who is modified  by some spirituous liquor  or than it does in the sick man  when he is  delirious  that is to say  when he is modified by those physical causes  which disturb his machine  which obstruct it in the performance of its  functions  or than it  does in him  whose brain is disordered  dreams   like these various states  announce nothing more than a physical  confusion in the human machine  under the influence of which the brain  ceases to act  after a precise and regular manner  this disorder may  be traced to physical causes  such as the aliments  the humours  the  combinations  the fermentations  which are but little analogous to the  salutary state of man  from hence it will appear  that his brain is  necessarily confused  whenever his body is agitated in an extraordinary  manner     do not let him  therefore  believe that his soul acts by itself  or  without a cause  in any one moment of his existence  it is  conjointly  with the body  submitted to the impulse of beings  who act on him  necessarily  according to their various properties  wine taken in too  great a quantity  necessarily disturbs his ideas  causes confusion in  his corporeal functions  occasions disorder in his mental faculties     if there really existed a being in nature  with the capability of moving  itself by its own peculiar energies  that is to say  able to produce  motion  independent of all other causes  such a being would have the  power of arresting itself  or of suspending the motion of the universe   which is nothing more than an immense chain of causes linked one to  another  acting and re acting by necessary immutable laws  and which  cannot be changed  which are incapable of being suspended  unless the  essences of every thing in it were changed  without the properties  of every thing were annihilated  in the general system of the world   nothing more can be perceived than a long series of motion  received  and communicated in succession  by beings capacitated to give impulse to  each other  it is thus  that each body is moved by the collision of some  other body  the invisible motion of some soul is to be attributed to  causes concealed within himself  he believes that it is moved by itself   because he does not see the springs which put it in motion  or because  he conceives those powers are incapable of producing the effects he  so much admires  but  does he more clearly conceive  how a spark in  exploding gunpowder  is capable of producing the terrible effects he  witnesses  the source of his errors arise from this  that he regards his  body as gross and inert  whilst this body is a sensible machine  which  has necessarily an instantaneous conscience the moment it receives an  impression  which is conscious of its own existence by the recollection  of impressions successively experienced  memory by resuscitating an  impression anteriorly received  by detaining it  or by causing an  impression which it receives to remain  whilst it associates it with  another  then with a third  gives all the mechanism of  reasoning      an idea  which is only an imperceptible modification of the brain  gives  play to the organ of speech  which displays itself by the motion it  excites in the tongue  this  in its turn  breeds ideas  thoughts  and  passions  in those beings who are provided with organs susceptible of  receiving analagous motion  in consequence of which  the wills of  a great number of men are influenced  who  combining their efforts   produce a revolution in a state  or even have an influence over the  entire globe  it is thus  that an alexander decided the fate of asia  it  is thus  that a mahomet changed the face of the earth  it is thus   that imperceptible causes produce the most terrible  the most extended  effects  by a series of necessary motion imprinted on the brain of man     the difficulty of comprehending the effects produced on the soul of man   has made him attribute to it those incomprehensible qualities which have  been examined  by the aid of imagination  by the power of thought  this  soul appears to quit his body  to carry itself with the greatest ease   to transport itself with the utmost facility towards the most distant  objects  to run over  to approximate in the twinkling of an eye  all the  points of the universe  he has therefore believed  that a being who is  susceptible of such rapid motion  must be of a nature very distinguished  from all others  he has persuaded himself that this soul in reality does  travel  that it actually springs over the immense space necessary to  meet these various objects  he did not perceive  that to do it in  an instant  it had only to run over itself to approximate the ideas  consigned to its keeping  by means of the senses     indeed  it is never by any other means than by his senses  that  beings become known to man  or furnish him with ideas  it is only  in consequence of the impulse given to his body  that his brain is  modified  or that his soul thinks  wills  and acts  if  as aristotle  asserted more than two thousand years ago     nothing enters the mind  of man but through the medium of his senses     it follows as a  consequence  that every thing that issues from it must find some  sensible object to which it can attach its ideas  whether immediately   as a man  a tree  a bird   c  or in the last analysis or decomposition   such as pleasure  happiness  vice  virtue   c  this principle  so true   so luminous  so important in its consequence  has been set forth in all  its lustre  by a great number of philosophers  among the rest  by the  great locke  whenever  therefore  a word or its idea does not connect  itself with some sensible object to which it can be related  this word  or this idea is unmeaning  and void of sense  it were better for man  that the idea was banished from his mind  struck out of his language   this principle is only the converse of the axiom of aristotle     if  the direct be evident  the inverse must be so likewise    how has it  happened  that the profound locke  who  to the great mortification  of the metaphysicians  has placed this principle of aristotle in the  clearest point of view  how is it  that all those who  like him  have  recognized the absurdity of the system of innate ideas  have not drawn  the immediate  the necessary consequences  how has it come to pass  that  they have not had sufficient courage to apply so clear a principle to  all those fanciful chimeras with which the human mind has for such a  length of time been so vainly occupied  did they not perceive that  their principle sapped the very foundations of those metaphysical  speculations  which never occupy man but with those objects of which  as  they are inaccessible to his senses  he consequently can never form  to himself any accurate idea  but prejudice  when it is generally held  sacred  prevents him from seeing the most simple application of the most  self evident principles  in metaphysical researches  the greatest men  are frequently nothing more than children  who are incapable of either  foreseeing or deducing the consequence of their own data     locke  as well as all those who have adopted his system  which is so  demonstrable   or to the axiom of aristotle  which is so clear  ought  to have concluded from it that all those wonderful things with  which metaphysicians have amused themselves  are mere chimeras  mere  wanderings of the imagination  that an immaterial spirit or substance   without extent  without parts  is  in fact  nothing more than an  absence of ideas  in short  they ought to have felt that the ineffable  intelligence which they have supposed to preside at the helm of the  world  is after all nothing more than a being of their own imagination   on which man has never been in accord  whom he has pictured under all  the variety of forms  to which he has at different periods  in different  climes  ascribed every kind of attribute  good or bad  but of which  it is impossible his senses can ever prove either the existence or the  qualities     for the same reason  moral philosophers ought to have concluded  that  what is called moral sentiment   moral instinct   that is  innate  ideas of virtue  anterior to all experience of the good or bad effects  resulting from its practice  are mere chimerical notions  which  like a  great many others  have for their guarantee and base only metaphysical  speculation  before man can judge  he must feel  before he can  distinguish good from evil  he must compare   morals   is a science of  facts  to found them  therefore  on an hypothesis inaccessible to his  senses  of which he has no means of proving the reality  is to render  them uncertain  it is to cast the log of discord into his lap  to cause  him unceasingly to dispute upon that which he can never understand   to assert that the ideas of morals are  innate   or the effect of   instinct   is to pretend that man knows how to read before he has  learned the letters of the alphabet  that he is acquainted with the laws  of society before they are either made or promulgated     to undeceive him  with respect to innate ideas or modifications   imprinted on his soul  at the moment of his birth  it is simply  requisite to recur to their source  he will then see that those with  which he is familiar  which have  as it were  identified themselves with  his existence  have all come to him through the medium of some of  his senses  that they are sometimes engraven on his brain with great  difficulty   that they have never been permanent   that they have  perpetually varied in him  he will see that these pretended inherent  ideas of his soul  are the effect of education  of example  above all   of habit  which by reiterated motion has taught his brain to associate  his ideas either in a confused or a perspicuous manner  to familiarize  itself with systems either rational or absurd  in short  he takes those  for innate ideas of which he has forgotten the origin  he no longer  recals to himself  either the precise epoch  or the successive  circumstances when these ideas were first consigned to his brain   arrived at a certain age he believes he has always had the same notions   his memory  crowded with experience  loaded with a multitude of facts   is no longer able to distinguish the particular circumstances which  have contributed to give his brain its present modifications  its  instantaneous mode of thinking  its actual opinions  for example  not  one of his race  perhaps  recollects the first time the word god struck  his ears  the first ideas that it formed in him  the first thoughts that  it produced in him  nevertheless  it is certain that from thence he  has searched for some being with whom to connect the idea which he has  either formed to himself  or which has been suggested to him  accustomed  to hear god continually spoken of  he has  when in other respects  the  most enlightened  regarded this idea as if it were infused into him by  nature  whilst it is visibly to be attributed to those delineations of  it  which his parents or his instructors have made to him  which he has   in consequence  modified according to his own particular organization   and the circumstances in which he has been placed  it is thus  that each  individual forms to himself a god  of which he is himself the model  or  which he modifies after his own fashion     his ideas of morals  although more real than those of metaphysics  are  not however innate  the moral sentiments he forms on the will  or the  judgment he passes on the actions of man  are founded on experience   which alone can enable him to discriminate those which are either useful  or prejudicial  virtuous or vicious  honest or dishonest  worthy his  esteem  or deserving his censure  his moral sentiments are the fruit  of a multitude of experience that is frequently very long and very  complicated  he gathers it with time  it is more or less faithful  by  reason of his particular organization and the causes by which he is  modified  he ultimately applies this experience with greater or less  facility  to this is to be attributed his habit of judging  the celerity  with which he applies his experience when he judges of the moral actions  of his fellow man  is what has been termed  moral instinct      that which in natural philosophy is called  instinct   is only the  effect of some want of the body  the consequence of some attraction or  some repulsion in man or animals  the child that is newly born  sucks  for the first time  the nipple of the breast is put into his mouth   by the natural analogy  that is found between the conglomerate glands   filled with nerves  which line his mouth  and the milk which flows from  the bosom of the nurse  through the medium of the nipple  causes  the child to press it with his mouth  in order to express the fluid  appropriate to nourish his tender age  from all this the infant gathers  experience  by degrees the idea of a nipple  of milk  of pleasure   associate themselves in his brain  every time he sees the nipple  he  seizes it  promptly conveys it to his mouth  and applies it to the use  for which it is designed     what has been said  will enable us to judge of those prompt and sudden  sentiments  which have been designated  the force of blood    those sentiments of love  which fathers and mothers have for their  children  those feelings of affection  which children  with good  inclinations  bear towards their parents  are by no means  innate  sentiments   they are nothing more  than the effect of experience  of  reflection  of habit  in souls of sensibility  these sentiments do not  even exist in a great number of human beings  we but too often witness  tyrannical parents  occupied with making enemies of their children  who  appear to have been formed  only to be the victims of their irrational  caprices or their unreasonable desires     from the instant in which man commences  until that in which he ceases  to exist  he feels  he is moved either agreeably or unpleasantly  he  collects facts  he gathers experience  these produce ideas in his brain   that are either cheerful or gloomy  not one individual has all this  experience present to his memory at the same time  it does not ever  represent to him the whole clew at once  it is  however  this experience  that mechanically directs him  without his knowledge  in all his  actions  it was to designate the rapidity with  which he applied this  experience  of which he so frequently loses the connection  of which he  is so often at a loss to render himself an account  that he imagined the  word  instinct   it appears to be the effect of magic  the operation of  a supernatural power  to the greater number of individuals  it is a word  devoid of sense to many others  but to the philosopher it is the effect  of a very lively feeling to him it consists in the faculty of combining   promptly  a multitude of experience  of arranging with facility  of  comparing with quickness  a long and numerous train of extremely  complicated ideas  it is want that causes the inexplicable instinct we  behold in animals which have been denied souls without reason   whilst they are susceptible of an infinity of actions that prove they  think  judge  have memory  are capable of experience  can combine  ideas  can apply them with more or less facility to satisfy the wants  engendered by their particular organization  in short  that prove they  have passions that are capable of being modified  nothing but the  height of folly can refuse intellectual faculties to animals  they feel   choose  deliberate  express love  show hatred  in many instances their  senses are much keener than those of man  fish will return periodically  to the spot where it is the custom to throw them bread     it is well known the embarrassments which animals have thrown in the  way of the partizans of the doctrine of spirituality  they have been  fearful  if they allowed them to have a spiritual soul  of elevating  them to the condition of human creatures  on the other hand  in not  allowing them to have a soul  they have furnished their adversaries  with authority to deny it in like manner to man  who thus finds himself  debased to the condition of the animal  metaphysicians have never known  how to extricate themselves from this difficulty  descartes fancied he  solved it by saying that beasts have no souls  but are mere machines   nothing can be nearer the surface  than the absurdity of this principle   whoever contemplates nature without prejudice  will readily acknowledge  that there is no other difference between the man and the beast  than  that which is to be attributed to the diversity of his organization     in some beings of the human species  who appear to be endowed with a  greater sensibility of organs than others  may be seen an instinct   by the assistance of which they very promptly judge of the concealed  dispositions of their fellows  simply by inspecting the lineaments of  their face  those who are denominated  physiognomists   are only men of  very acute feelings  who have gathered an experience of which others   whether from the coarseness of their organs  from the little attention  they have paid  or from some defect in their senses  are totally  incapable  these last do not believe in the science of physiognomy   which appears to them perfectly ideal  nevertheless  it is certain   that the action of this soul  which has been made spiritual  makes  impressions that are extremely marked upon the exterior of the body   these impressions  continually reiterated  their image remains  thus the  habitual passions of man paint themselves on his countenance  by which  the attentive observer  who is endowed with acute feeling  is enabled to  judge with great rapidity of his mode of existence  and even to foresee  his actions  his inclinations  his desires  his predominant passions    c  although the science of physiognomy appears chimerical to a great  number of persons  yet there are few who have not a clear idea of  a tender regard  of a cruel eye  of an austere aspect  of a false   dissimulating look  of an open countenance   c  keen practised optics  acquire without doubt the faculty of penetrating the concealed motion  of the soul  by the visible traces it leaves upon features that it has  continually modified  above all  the eyes of man very quickly undergo  changes according to the motion which is excited in him  these delicate  organs are visibly altered by the smallest shock communicated to his  brain  serene eyes announce a tranquil soul  wild eyes indicate a  restless mind  fiery eyes pourtray a choleric  sanguine temperament   fickle or inconstant eyes give room to suspect a soul either alarmed or  dissimulating  it is the study of this variety of shades that renders  man practised and acute  upon the spot he combines a multitude of  acquired experience  in order to form his judgment of the person he  beholds  his judgment  thus rapidly formed  partakes in nothing of  the supernatural  in nothing of the wonderful  such a man is only  distinguished by the fineness of his organs  and by the celerity with  which his brain performs its functions     it is the same with some beings of the human species  in whom may be  discovered an extraordinary sagacity  which  to the uninformed  appears  miraculous  the most skilful practitioners in medicine  are  no  doubt  men endowed with very acute feelings  similar to that of the  physiognomists  by the assistance of which they judge with great  facility of diseases  and very promptly draw their prognostics  indeed   we see men who are capable of appreciating in the twinkling of an eye a  multitude of circumstances  who have sometimes the faculty of foreseeing  the most distant events  yet  this species of prophetic talent has  nothing in it of the supernatural  it indicates nothing more than great  experience  with an extremely delicate organization  from which they  derive the faculty of judging with extreme faculty of causes  of  foreseeing their very remote effects  this faculty  however  is also  found in animals  who foresee much better than man  the variations of  the atmosphere with the various changes of the weather  birds have long  been the prophets  and even the guides of several nations who pretend to  be extremely enlightened     it is  then  to their organization  exercised after a particular manner   that must be attributed those wonderous faculties which distinguish  some beings  that astonish others  to have  instinct   only signifies  to judge quickly  without requiring to make a long  reasoning on the  subject  man s ideas upon vice and upon virtue  are by no means innate   they are  like all others  acquired  the judgment he forms  is  founded upon experience  whether true or false   this depends upon his  conformation  and upon the habits that have modified him  the infant  has no ideas either of the divinity or of virtue  it is from those who  instruct him that he receives these ideas  he makes more or less use of  them  according to his natural organization  or as his dispositions have  been more or less exercised  nature gives man legs  the nurse teaches  him their use  his agility depends upon their natural conformation  and  the manner in which he exercises them     what is called  taste   in the fine arts  is to be attributed  in the  same manner  only to the acuteness of man s organs  practised by the  habit of seeing  of comparing  of judging certain objects  from whence  results  to some of his species  the faculty of judging with great  rapidity  in the twinkling of an eye  the whole with its various  relations  it is by the force of seeing  of feeling  of experiencing  objects  that he attains to a knowledge of them  it is in consequence of  reiterating this experience  that he acquires the power  that he gains  the habit of judging with celerity  but this experience is by no means  innate  he did not possess it before he was born  he is neither able to  think  to judge  nor to have ideas  before he has feeling  he is neither  in a capacity to love  nor to hate  to approve  nor to blame  before he  has been moved  either agreeably or disagreeably  nevertheless  this is  precisely what must be supposed by those who are desirous to make  man admit of innate ideas  of opinions  infused by nature  whether in  morals  metaphysics  or any other science  that his mind should have the  faculty of thought  that it should occupy itself with an object  it is  requisite it should be acquainted with its qualities  that it may have a  knowledge of these qualities  it is necessary some of his senses should  have been struck by them  those objects  therefore  of which he does not  know any of the qualities  are nullities  or at least they do not exist  for him     it will be asserted  perhaps  that the universal consent of man  upon  certain propositions  such as  the whole is greater than its part   upon  all geometrical demonstrations  appear to warrant the supposition  of certain primary notions that are innate  not acquired  it may be  replied  that these notions are always acquired  that they are the  fruit of an experience more or less prompt  that it is requisite to have  compared the whole with its part  before conviction can ensue  that the  whole is the greater of the two  man when he is born  does not bring  with him the idea that two and two make four  but he is  nevertheless   speedily convinced of its truth  before forming any judgment whatever   it is absolutely necessary to have compared facts     it is evident  that those who have gratuitously supposed innate ideas   or notions inherent in man  have confounded his organization  or his  natural dispositions  with the habit by which he is modified  with the  greater or less aptitude he has of making experience  and of applying  it in his judgment  a man who has taste in painting  has  without doubt   brought with him into the world eyes more acute  more penetrating than  another  but these eyes would by no means enable him to judge with  promptitude  if he had never had occasion to exercise them  much less   in some respects  can those dispositions which are called  natural   be  regarded as innate  man is not  at twenty years of age  the same as  he was when he came into the world  the physical causes that are  continually acting upon him  necessarily have an influence upon his  organization  and so modify it  that his natural dispositions themselves  are not at one period what they are at another  la motte le vayer says    we think quite otherwise of things at one time than at another  when  young than when old  when hungry than when our appetite is satisfied  in  the night than in the day  when peevish than when cheerful  thus   varying every hour  by a thousand other circumstances  which keep us in  a state of perpetual inconstancy and instability   every day may be seen  children  who  to a certain age  display a great deal of ingenuity  a  strong aptitude for the sciences  who finish by falling into stupidity   others may be observed  who  during their infancy  have shown  dispositions but little favourable to improvement  yet develope  themselves in the end  and astonish us by an exhibition of those  qualities of which we hardly thought them susceptible  there arrives  a moment in which the mind takes a spring  makes use of a multitude of  experience which it has amassed  without its having been perceived  and   if i may be allowed the expression  without their own knowledge     thus  it cannot be too often repeated  all the ideas  all the notions   all the modes of existence  and all the thoughts of man  are acquired   his mind cannot act  cannot exercise itself  but upon that of which it  has knowledge  it can understand either well or ill  only those things  which it has previously felt  such of his ideas that do not suppose some  exterior material object for their model  or one to which he is able to  relate them  which are therefore called  abstract ideas   are only modes  in which his interior organ considers its own peculiar modifications  of  which it chooses some without respect to others  the words which he uses  to designate these ideas  such as  bounty  beauty  order  intelligence   virtue    c  do not offer any one sense  if he does not relate them to   or if he does not explain them by  those objects which his senses have  shewn him to be susceptible of those qualities  or of those modes of  existence  of that manner of acting  which is known to him  what is it  that points out to him the vague idea of  beauty   if he does not attach  it to some object that has struck his senses in a peculiar manner   to which  in consequence  he attributes this quality  what is it that  represents the word  intelligence   if he does not connect it with a  certain mode of being and of acting  does the word  order  signify any  thing  if he does not relate it to a series of actions  to a chain of  motion  by which he is affected in a certain manner  is not the word   virtue  void of sense  if he does not apply it to those dispositions  of his fellows which produce known effects  different from those  which result from contrary inclinations  what do the words  pain  and   pleasure  offer to his mind in the moment when his organs neither  suffer nor enjoy  if it be not the modes in which he has been affected   of which his brain conserves the remembrance  of those impressions   which experience has shewn him to be either useful or prejudicial  but  when he bears the words spirituality  immateriality  incorporeality   c   pronounced  neither his senses nor his memory afford him any assistance   they do not furnish him with any means by which he can form an idea of  their qualities  or of the objects to which he ought to apply them  in  that which is not matter he can only see vacuum and emptiness  which as  long as he remains what he is  cannot  to his mind  be susceptible of  any one quality     all the errors  all the disputes of men  have their foundation in this   that they have renounced experience  have surrendered the evidence of  their senses  to give themselves up to the guidance of notions which  they have believed infused or innate  although in reality they are no  more than the effect of a distempered imagination  of prejudices  in  which they have been instructed from their infancy  with which habit  has familiarized them  which authority has obliged them to conserve   languages are filled with abstract words  to which are attached confused  and vague ideas  of which  when they come to be examined  no model can  be found in nature  no object to which they can be related  when man  gives himself the trouble to analyze things  he is quite surprised to  find  that those words which are continually in the mouths of men   never present any fixed or determinate idea  he hears them unceasingly  speaking of spirits  of the soul and its faculties  of duration  of  space  of immensity  of infinity  of perfection  of virtue  of  reason  of sentiment  of instinct  of taste   c  without his being  able to tell precisely  what they themselves understand by these words   nevertheless  they do not appear to have been invented  but for the  purpose of representing the images of things  or to paint  by the  assistance of the senses  those known objects on which the mind is able  to meditate  which it is competent to appreciate  to compare  and to  judge     for man to think of that which has not acted on any of his senses  is to  think on words  it is for his senses to dream  it is to seek in his own  imagination for objects to which he can attach his wandering ideas  to  assign qualities to these objects is  unquestionably  to redouble his  extravagance  to set no limits to his folly  if a word be destined to  represent to him an object that has not the capacity to act on any one  of his organs  of which  it is impossible for him to prove either the  existence or the qualities  his imagination  by dint of racking itself   will nevertheless  in some measure  supply him with the ideas he wants   he composes some kind of a picture  with the images or colours he is  always obliged to borrow  from the objects of which he has a knowledge   thus the divinity has been represented by some under the character of  a venerable old man  by others  under that of a puissant monarch  by  others  as an exasperated  irritated being   c  it is evident  however   that man  with some of his qualities  has served for the model of these  pictures  but if he be informed of objects that are represented as pure  spirits  that have neither body nor extent  that are not contained in  space  that are beyond nature   here then he is plunged into emptiness   his mind no longer has any ideas  it no longer knows upon what it  meditates  this  as will be seen in the sequel  no doubt  is the source  of those unformed notions which some men have formed of the divinity   they themselves frequently annihilate him  by assembling incompatible  and contradictory attributes  in giving him morals  in composing him of  known qualities   they make him a man   in assigning him the negative  attributes of every thing they know  they render him inaccessible to  their senses  they destroy all antecedent ideas  they make him a mere  nothing  from this it will appear  that those sublime sciences which are  called  theology  psychology  metaphysics   have been mere sciences of  words  morals and politics  with which they very frequently mix  have   in consequence  become inexplicable enigmas  which there is nothing  short of the study of nature can enable us to expound     man has occasion for truth  it consists in a knowledge of the true  relations he has with those beings competent to have an influence on  his welfare  these relations are to be known only by experience  without  experience there can be no reason  without reason man is only a blind  creature  who conducts himself by chance  but  how is he to acquire  experience upon ideal objects  which his senses neither enable him to  know nor to examine  how is he to assure himself of the existence  how  ascertain the qualities of beings he is not able to feel  how can he  judge whether there objects be favorable or prejudicial to him  how is  he to know  without the evidence of his senses  what he ought to love   what he should hate  what to seek after  what to shun  what to do  what  to leave undone  it is  however  upon this knowledge that his condition  in this world rests  it is upon this knowledge that morals is founded   from whence it may be seen  that  by causing him to blend vague  metaphysical notions with morals  or the science of the certain and  invariable relations which subsist between mankind  or by weakly  establishing them upon chimerical ideas  which have no existence but in  his imagination  these morals  upon which the welfare of society so much  depends  are rendered uncertain  are made arbitrary  are abandoned to  the caprices of fancy  are not fixed upon any solid basis     beings essentially different by their natural organization  by the  modifications they experience  by the habits they contract  by the  opinions they acquire  must of necessity think differently  his  temperament  as we have seen  decides the mental qualities of man   this temperament itself is diversely modified in him  from whence it  consecutively follows  his imagination cannot possibly be the same   neither can it create to him the same images  each individual is a  connected whole  of which all the parts have a necessary correspondence   different eyes must see differently  must give extremely varied ideas  of the objects they contemplate  even when these objects are real  what   then  must be the diversity of these ideas  if the objects meditated  upon do not act upon the senses  mankind have pretty nearly the same  ideas  in the gross  of those substances that act upon his organs with  vivacity  he is sufficiently in unison upon some qualities which he  contemplates very nearly in the same manner  i say  very nearly  because  the intelligence  the notion  the conviction of any one proposition   however simple  however evident  however clear it may be supposed  is  not  nor cannot be  strictly the same  in any two men  indeed  one man  not being another man  the first cannot  for example  have rigorously  and mathematically the same notion of unity as the second  seeing that  an identical effect cannot be the result of two different causes  thus   when men are in accord in their ideas  in their modes of thinking  in  their judgment  in their passions  in their desires  in  their tastes   their consent does not arise from their seeing or feeling the same  objects precisely in the same manner  but pretty nearly  language is  not  nor cannot be  sufficiently copious to designate the vast variety  of shades  the multiplicity of imperceptible differences  which is to be  found in their modes of seeing and thinking  each man  then  has  to say  thus  a language which is peculiar to himself alone  and this language  is incommunicable to others  what harmony  what unison  then  can  possibly exist between them  when they discourse with each other  upon  objects only known to their imagination  can this imagination in  one individual ever be the same as in another  how can they possibly  understand each other  when they assign to those objects qualities that  can only be attributed to the particular manner in which their brain is  affected     for one man to exact from another that he shall think like himself  is  to insist that he shall be organized precisely in the same manner  that  he shall have been modified exactly the same in every moment of his  existence  that he shall have received the same temperament  the same  nourishment  the same education  in a word  that he shall require that  other to be himself  wherefore is it not exacted that all men shall have  the same features  is man more the master of his opinions  are not his  opinions the necessary consequence of his nature  and of those peculiar  circumstances which  from his infancy  have necessarily had an influence  upon his mode of thinking  and his manner of acting  if man be a  connected whole  whenever a single feature differs from his own  ought  he not to conclude that it is not possible his brain can either think   associate ideas  imagine  or dream precisely in the same manner with  that other     the diversity in the temperament of man  is the natural  the necessary  source of the diversity of his passions  of his taste  of his ideas of  happiness  of his opinions of every kind  thus  this same diversity will  be the fatal source of his disputes  of his hatreds  of his injustice   every time he shall reason upon unknown objects  but to which he shall  attach the greatest importance  he will never understand either himself  or others  in speaking of a spiritual soul  or of immaterial substances  distinguished from nature  he will  from that moment  cease to speak  the same language  and he will never attach the same ideas to the same  words  what  then  shall be  the common standard that shall decide which  is the man that thinks with the greatest justice  what the scale by  which to measure who has the best regulated imagination  what balance  shall be found sufficiently exact to determine whose knowledge is most  certain  when he agitates subjects  which experience cannot enable him  to examine  that escape all his senses  that have no model  that are  above reason  each individual  each legislator  each speculator  each  nation  has ever formed to himself different ideas of these things  each  believes  that his own peculiar reveries ought to be preferred to those  of his neighbours  which always appear to him an absurd  ridiculous  and  false as his own can possibly have appeared to his fellow  each clings  to his own opinion  because each retains his own peculiar mode of  existence  each believes his happiness depends upon his attachment  to his prejudices  which he never adopts but because he believes them  beneficial to his welfare  propose to a man to change his religion  for yours  he will believe you a madman  you will only excite his  indignation  elicit his contempt  he will propose to you  in his turn   to adopt his own peculiar opinions  after much reasoning  you will treat  each other as absurd beings  ridiculously opiniated  pertinaciously  stubborn  and he will display the least folly  who shall first yield   but if the adversaries become heated in the dispute  which always  happens  when they suppose the matter important  or when they would  defend the cause of their own self love  from thence their passions  sharpen  they grow angry  quarrels are provoked  they hate each other   and end by reciprocal injury  it is thus  that for opinions  which no  man can demonstrate  we see the brahmin despised  the mahommedan hated   the pagan held in contempt  that they oppress and disdain each with the  most rancorous animosity  the christian burns the jew at what is called  an  auto de fe   because he clings to the faith of his fathers  the  roman catholic condemns the protestant to the flames  and makes a  conscience of massacring him in cold blood  this re acts in his turn   sometimes the various sects of christians league together against the  incredulous turk  and for a moment suspend their own bloody disputes  that they may chastise the enemies to the true faith  then  having  glutted their revenge  return with redoubled fury  to wreak over again  their infuriated vengeance on each other     if the imaginations of men were the same  the chimeras which they bring  forth would be every where the same  there would be no disputes among  them on this subject  if they all dreamt in the same manner  great  numbers of human beings would be spared  if man occupied his mind with  objects capable of being known  of which the existence was proved   of which he was competent to discover the true qualities  by sure   by reiterated experience   systems of philosophy  are not subject  to dispute but when their principles are not sufficiently proved   by degrees experience  in pointing out the truth and detecting  their errors  terminates these quarrels  there is no variance among   geometricians  upon the principles of their science  it is only  raised  when their suppositions are false  or their objects too much  complicated   theologians  find so much difficulty in agreeing among  themselves  simply  because  in their contests  they divide without  ceasing  not known and examined propositions  but prejudices with which  they have been imbued in their youth  in the schools  by each other s  books   c  they are perpetually reasoning  not upon real objects  of  which the existence is demonstrated  but upon imaginary systems of which  they have never examined the reality  they found these disputes   not upon averred experience  or constant facts  but upon gratuitious  suppositions  which each endeavours to convince the other are without  solidity  finding these ideas of long standing  that few people  refuse  to admit them  they take them for incontestible truths  that ought to  be received merely upon being announced  whenever they attach great  importance to them  they irritate themselves against the temerity of  those who have the audacity to doubt  or even to examine them     if prejudice had been laid aside  it would perhaps have been discovered  that many of those objects  which have given birth to the most shocking   the most sanguinary disputes among men  were mere phantoms  which a  little examination would have shown to be unworthy their notice   the  priests of apollo  would have been harmless  if man had examined for  himself  without prejudice  the tenets they held forth  he would have  found  that he was fighting  that he was cutting his neighbour s throat   for words void of sense  or  at the least  he would have learned to  doubt his right to act in the manner he did  he would have renounced  that dogmatical  that imperious tone he assumed  by which he would  oblige his fellow to unite with him in opinion  the most trifling  reflection would have shewn him the necessity of this diversity in his  notions  of this contrariety in his imagination  which depends upon  his natural conformation diversely modified  which necessarily has an  influence over his thoughts  over his will  and over his actions  in  short  if he had consulted morals  if he had fallen back upon reason   every thing would have conspired to prove to him  that beings who call  themselves rational  were made to think variously  on that account were  designed to live peaceable with each other  to love each other  to lend  each other mutual succours whatever may be their opinions upon subjects   either impossible to be known  or to be contemplated under the same  point of view  every thing would have joined in evidence to convince  him of the unreasonable tyranny  of the unjust violence  of the useless  cruelty of those men of blood  who persecute  who destroy mankind  in  order that they may mould him to their own peculiar opinions  every  thing would have conducted mortals to  mildness   to  indulgence   to   toleration   virtues  unquestionably of more real importance  much more  necessary to the welfare of society  than the marvellous speculations by  which it is divided  by which it is frequently hurried on to sacrifice  to a maniacal fury  the pretended enemies to these revered flights of  the imagination     from this it must be evident  of what importance it is to  morals  to  examine the ideas  to which it has been agreed to attach so much worth   to which man is continually sacrificing his own peculiar happiness  to  which he is immolating the tranquillity of nations  at the irrational  command of fanatical cruel guides  let him fall back on his experience   let him return to nature  let him occupy himself with reason  let him  consult those objects that are real  which are useful to his permanent  felicity  let him study nature s laws  let him study himself  let him  consult the bonds which unite him to his fellow mortals  let him examine  the fictitious bonds that enchain him to the most baneful prejudices   if his imagination must always feed itself with illusions  if he remains  steadfast in his own opinions  if his prejudices are dear to him  let  him at least permit others to ramble in their own manner  or seek after  truth as best suits their inclination  but let him always recollect   that all the opinions  all the ideas  all the systems  all the  wills  all the actions of man  are the necessary consequence of his  nature  of his temperament  of his organization  and of those causes   either transitory or constant  which modify hint  in short  that  man is  not more a free agent to think than to act   a truth that will be again  proved in the following chapter             chap  xi     of the system of man s free agency        those who have pretended that the  soul  is distinguished from the body   is immaterial  draws its ideas from its own peculiar source  acts by its  own energies without the aid of any exterior object  by a consequence  of their own system  have enfranchised it from those physical laws   according to which all beings of which we have a knowledge are obliged  to act  they have believed that the foul is mistress of its own conduct   is able to regulate its own peculiar operations  has the faculty to  determine its will by its own natural energy  in a word  they have  pretended man is a  free agent      it has been already sufficiently proved  that the soul is nothing more  than the body  considered relatively to some of its functions  more  concealed than others  it has been shewn  that this soul  even when it  shall be supposed immaterial  is continually modified conjointly with  the body  is submitted to all its motion  that without this it would  remain inert and dead  that  consequently  it is subjected to the  influence of those material  to the operation those physical causes   which give impulse to the body  of which the mode of existence  whether  habitual or transitory  depends upon the material elements by which it  is surrounded  that form its texture  that constitute its temperament   that enter into it by the means of the aliments  that penetrate it by  their subtility  the faculties which are called intellectual  and those  qualities which are styled moral  have been explained in a manner purely  physical  entirely natural  in the last place  it has been demonstrated   that all the ideas  all the systems  all the affections  all the  opinions  whether true or false  which man forms to himself  are to be  attributed to his physical powers  are to be ascribed to his material  senses  thus man is a being purely physical  in whatever manner he  is considered  he is connected to universal nature  submitted to the  necessary  to the immutable laws that she imposes on all the beings  she contains  according to their peculiar essences  conformable to the  respective properties with which  without consulting them  she endows  each particular species  man s life is a line that nature commands him  to describe upon the surface of the earth  without his ever being  able to swerve from it even for an instant  he is born without his own  consent  his organizations does in no wise depend upon himself  his  ideas come to him involuntarily  his habits are in the power of those  who cause him to contract them  he is unceasingly modified by causes   whether visible or concealed  over which he has no controul  give the  hue to his way of thinking  and determine his manner of acting  he  is good or bad  happy or miserable  wise or foolish  reasonable or  irrational  without his will going for anything in these various states   nevertheless  in despite of the shackles by which he is bound  it is  pretended he is a free agent  or that independent of the causes by which  he is moved  he determines his own will  regulates his own condition     however slender the foundation of this opinion  of which every thing  ought to point out to him the error  it is current at this day for  an incontestible truth  and believed enlightened  it is the basis or  religion  which has been incapable of imagining how man could either  merit reward or deserve punishment if he was not a free agent  society  has been believed interested in this system  because an idea has gone  abroad  that if all the actions of man were to be contemplated as  necessary  the right of punishing those who injure their associates  would no longer exist  at length human vanity accommodated itself to an  hypothesis which  unquestionable  appears to distinguish man from all  other physical beings  by assigning to him the special privilege of  a total independence of all other causes  but of which a very little  reflection would have shewn him the absurdity or even the impossibility     as a part  subordinate to the great whole  man is obliged to experience  its influence  to be a free agent it were needful that each individual  was of greater strength than the entire of nature  or  that he was out  of this nature  who  always in action herself  obliges all the beings  she embraces  to act  and to concur to her general motion  or  as it  has been said elsewhere  to conserve her active existence  by the motion  that all beings produce in consequence of their particular energies   which result from their being submitted to fixed  eternal  and immutable  laws  in order that man might be a free agent  it were needful that  all beings should lose their essences  it is equally necessary that  he himself should no longer enjoy physical sensibility  that he should  neither know good nor evil  pleasure nor pain  but if this was the case   from that moment he would no longer be in a state to conserve himself   or render his existence happy  all beings would become indifferent to  him  he would no longer have any choice  he would cease to know what he  ought to love  what it was right he should fear  he would not have any  acquaintance with that which he should seek after  or with that which it  is requisite he should avoid  in short  man would be an unnatural being   totally incapable of acting in the manner we behold  it is the actual  essence of man to tend to his well being  to be desirous to conserve  his existence  if all the motion of his machine springs as a necessary  consequence from this primitive impulse  if pain warns him of that which  he ought to avoid  if pleasure announces to him that which he should  desire  if it is in his essence to love that which either excites  delight  or  that from which he expects agreeable sensations  to hate  that which makes him either fear contrary impressions  or  that which  afflicts him with uneasiness  it must necessarily be  that he will be  attracted by that which he deems advantageous  that his will shall be  determined by those objects which he judges useful  that he will be  repelled by those beings which he believes prejudicial  either to his  habitual  or to his transitory mode of existence  by that which he  considers disadvantageous  it is only by the aid of experience  that man  acquires the faculty of understanding what he ought to love  of knowing  what he ought to fear  are his organs sound  his experience will be  true  are they unsound  it will be false  in the first instance he will  have reason  prudence  foresight  he will frequently foresee very remote  effects  he will know  that what he sometimes contemplates as a good   may possibly become an evil  by its necessary or probable consequences   that what must be to him a transient evil  may by its result procure him  a solid and durable good  it is thus experience enables him to foresee  that the amputation of a limb will cause him painful sensation  he  consequently is obliged to fear this operation  and he endeavours  to avoid the pain  but if experience has also shewn him  that the  transitory pain this amputation will cause him may be the means of  saving his life  the preservation  of his existence being of necessity  dear to him  he is obliged to submit himself to the momentary pain with  a view to procuring a permanent good  by which it will be overbalanced     the will  as we have elsewhere said  is a modification of the brain  by  which it is disposed to action or prepared to give play to the organs   this will is necessarily determined by the qualities  good or bad   agreeable or painful  of the object or the motive that acts upon his  senses  or of which the idea remains with him  and is resuscitated  by his memory  in consequence  he acts necessarily  his action is the  result of the impulse he receives either from the motive  from the  object  or from the idea  which has modified his brain  or disposed  his will  when he does not act according to this impulse  it is because  there comes some new cause  some new motive  some new idea  which  modifies his brain in a different manner  gives him a new impulse   determines his will in another way  by which the action of the former  impulse is suspended  thus  the sight of an agreeable object  or its  idea  determines his will to set him in action to procure it  but if a  new object or a new idea more powerfully attracts him  it gives a  new direction to his will  annihilates the effect of the former  and  prevents the action by which it was to be procured  this is the mode in  which reflection  experience  reason  necessarily arrests or suspends  the action of man s will  without this  he would  of necessity  have  followed the anterior impulse which carried him towards a then desirable  object  in all this he always acts according to necessary laws  from  which he has no means of emancipating himself     if  when tormented with violent thirst  he figures to himself an idea   or really perceives a fountain  whose limpid streams might cool his  feverish habit  is he sufficient master of himself to desire or not  to desire the object competent to satisfy so lively a want  it will no  doubt be conceded  that it is impossible he should not be desirous to  satisfy it  but it will be said   if at this moment it is announced  to him  the water he so ardently desires is poisoned  he will   notwithstanding his vehement thirst  abstain from drinking it  and it  has  therefore  been falsely concluded that he is a free agent  the  fact  however  is  that the motive in either case is exactly the same   his own conservation  the same necessity that determined him to drink   before he knew the water was deleterious  upon this new discovery   equally determines him not to drink  the desire of conserving himself   either annihilates or suspends the former impulse  the second motive  becomes stronger than the preceding  that is  the fear of death  or  the desire of preserving himself  necessarily prevails over the painful  sensation caused by his eagerness to drink  but   it will be said  if  the thirst is very parching  an inconsiderate man  without regarding  the danger  will risque swallowing the water  nothing is gained by this  remark  in this case  the anterior impulse only regains the ascendency   he is persuaded  that life may possibly be longer preserved  or that  he shall derive a greater good by drinking the poisoned water  than by  enduring the torment  which  to his mind  threatens instant dissolution   thus  the first becomes the strongest  and necessarily urges him on to  action  nevertheless  in either case  whether he partakes of the water   or whether he does not  the two actions will be equally necessary  they  will be the effect of that motive which finds itself most puissant   which consequently acts in a most coercive manner upon his will     this example will serve to explain the whole phaenomena of the human  will  this will  or rather the brain  finds itself in the same situation  as a bowl  which although it has received an impulse that drives it  forward in a straight line  is deranged in its course  whenever a force   superior to the first  obliges it to change its direction  the man who  drinks the poisoned water  appears a madman  but the actions of fools  are as necessary as those of the most prudent individuals  the motives  that determine the voluptuary  that actuate the debauchee to risk their  health  are as powerful  their actions are as necessary  as those  which decide the wise man to manage his  but  it will be insisted  the  debauchee may be prevailed on to change his conduct  this does not imply  that he is a free agent  but  that motives may be found sufficiently  powerful to annihilate the effect of those that previously acted upon  him  then these new motives determine his will to the new mode of  conduct he may adopt  as necessarily as the former did to the old mode     man is said to  deliberate  when the action of the will is suspended   this happens when two opposite motives act alternately upon him   to deliberate  is to hate and to love in succession  it is to be  alternately attracted and repelled  it is to be moved sometimes by one  motive  sometimes by another  man only deliberates when he does not  distinctly understand the quality of the objects from which he receives  impulse  or when experience has not sufficiently apprised him of the  effects  more or less remote  which his actions will produce  he  would take the air  but the weather is uncertain  he deliberates in  consequence  he weighs the various motives that urge his will to go out  or to stay at home  he is at length determined by that motive which is  most probable  this removes his indecision  which necessarily settles  his will either to remain within or to go abroad  this motive is always  either the immediate or ultimate advantage he finds or thinks he finds  in the action to which he is persuaded     man s will frequently fluctuates between two objects  of which either  the presence or the ideas move him alternately  he waits until he has  contemplated the objects or the ideas they have left in his brain  which  solicit him to different actions  he then compares these objects or  ideas  but even in the time of deliberation  during the comparison   pending these alternatives of love and hatred  which succeed each other  sometimes with the utmost rapidity  he is not a free agent for a single  instant  the good or the evil which he believes he finds successively in  the objects  are the necessary motives of these momentary wills  of  the rapid motion of desire or fear that he experiences as long as his  uncertainty continues  from this it will be obvious  that deliberation  is necessary  that uncertainty is necessary  that whatever part he  takes  in consequence of this deliberation  it will always necessarily  be that which he has judged  whether well or ill  is most probable to  turn to his advantage     when the soul is assailed by two motives that act alternately upon it   or modify it successively  it deliberates  the brain is in a sort of  equilibrium  accompanied with perpetual oscillations  sometimes towards  one object  sometimes towards the other  until the most forcible carries  the point  and thereby extricates it  from this state of suspense   in which consists the indecision of his will  but when the brain is  simultaneously assailed by causes equally strong  that move it in  opposite directions  agreeable to the general law of all bodies  when  they are struck equally by contrary powers  it stops  it is in  nisu    it is neither capable to will nor to act  it waits until one of the  two causes has obtained sufficient force to overpower the other  to  determine its will  to attract it in such a manner that it may prevail  over the efforts of the other cause     this mechanism  so simple  so natural  suffices to demonstrate  why  uncertainty is painful  why suspense is always a violent state for  man  the brain  an organ so delicate  so mobile  experiences such rapid  modifications  that it is fatigued  or when it is urged in contrary  directions  by causes equally powerful  it suffers a kind of  compression  that prevents the activity which is suitable to the  preservation of the whole  which is necessary to procure what is  advantageous to its existence  this mechanism will also explain the  irregularity  the indecision  the inconstancy of man  and account for  that conduct  which frequently appears an inexplicable mystery  which  indeed it is  under the received systems  in consulting experience  it  will be found that the soul is submitted to precisely the same physical  laws as the material body  if the will of each individual  during a  given time  was only moved by a single cause or passion  nothing would  be more easy than to foresee his actions  but his heart is frequently  assailed by contrary powers  by adverse motives  which either act on him  simultaneously or in succession  then his brain  attracted in opposite  directions  is either fatigued  or else tormented by a state of  compression  which deprives it of activity  sometimes it is in a state  of incommodious inaction  sometimes it is the sport of the alternate  shocks it undergoes  such  no doubt  is the state in which man finds  himself  when a lively passion solicits him to the commission of crime   whilst fear points out to him the danger by which it is attended  such   also  is the condition of him whom remorse  by the continued labour  of his distracted soul  prevents from enjoying the objects he has  criminally obtained     if the powers or causes  whether exterior or interior  acting on the  mind of man  tend towards opposite points  his soul  is well as all  other bodies  will take a mean direction between the two  in consequence  of the violence with which his soul is urged  his condition becomes  sometimes so painful that his existence is troublesome  he has no longer  a tendency to his own peculiar conservation  he seeks after death  as a  sanctuary against himself  as the only remedy to his despair  it is  thus we behold men  miserable and discontented  voluntarily destroy  themselves  whenever life becomes insupportable  man is competent to  cherish his existence  no longer than life holds out charms to him   when he is wrought upon by painful sensations  or drawn by contrary  impulsions  his natural tendency is deranged  he is under the necessity  to follow a new route  this conducts him to his end  which it even  displays to him as the most desirable good  in this manner may be  explained  the conduct of those melancholy beings  whose vicious  temperaments  whose tortured consciences  whose chagrin  whose  ennui    sometimes determine them to renounce life     the various powers  frequently very complicated  that act either  successively or simultaneously upon the brain of man  which modify him  so diversely in the different periods of his existence  are the true  causes of that obscurity in morals  of that difficulty which is found   when it is desired to unravel the concealed springs of his enigmatical  conduct  the heart of man is a labyrinth  only because it very rarely  happens that we possess the necessary gift of judging it  from whence  it will appear  that his circumstances  his indecision  his conduct   whether ridiculous  or unexpected  are the necessary consequences of  the changes operated in him  are nothing but the effect of motives that  successively determine his will  which are dependent on the frequent  variations experienced by his machine  according to these variations   the same motives have not  always  the same influence over his will   the same objects no longer enjoy the faculty of pleasing him  his  temperament has changed  either for the moment  or for ever  it follows  as a consequence  that his taste  his desires  his passions  will  change  there can be no kind of uniformity in his conduct  nor any  certitude in the effects to be expected     choice by no means proves the free agency of man  he only deliberates  when he does not yet know which to choose of the many objects that move  him  he is then in an embarrassment  which does not terminate  until his  will as decided by the greater advantage he believes be shall find in  the object he chooses  or the action he undertakes  from whence it may  be seen that choice is necessary  because he would not determine for an  object  or for an action  if he did not believe that he should find  in it some direct advantage  that man should have free agency  it were  needful that he should be able to will or choose without motive  or   that he could prevent motives coercing his will  action always being the  effect of his will once determined  as his will cannot be determined but  by a motive  which is not in his own power  it follows that he is  never the master of the determination of his own peculiar will  that  consequently he never acts as a free agent  it has been believed that  man was a free agent  because he had a will with the power of choosing   but attention has not been paid to the fact  that even his will is moved  by causes independent of himself  is owing to that which is inherent  in his own organization  or which belongs to the nature of the beings  acting on him  indeed  man passes a great portion of his life without  even willing  his will attends the motive by which it is determined  if  he was to render an exact account of every thing he does in the course  of each day  from rising in the morning to lying down at night  he would  find  that not one of his actions have been in the least voluntary  that  they have been mechanical  habitual  determined by causes he was not  able to foresee  to which he was either obliged to  yield  or with which  he was allured to acquiesce  he would discover  that all the motives of  his labours  of his amusements  of his discourses  of his thoughts  have  been necessary  that they have evidently either seduced him or drawn him  along  is he the master of willing  not to withdraw his hand from the  fire when he fears it will be burnt  or has he the power to take away  from fire the property which makes him fear it  is he the master of not  choosing a dish of meat which he knows to be agreeable  or analogous  to his palate  of not preferring it to that which he knows to be  disagreeable or dangerous  it is always according to his sensations  to  his own peculiar experience  or to his suppositions  that he judges of  things either well or ill  but whatever way be his judgment  it depends  necessarily on his mode of feeling  whether habitual or accidental   and the qualities he finds in the causes that move him  which exist in  despite of himself     all the causes which by his will is actuated  must act upon him in a  manner sufficiently marked  to give him some sensation  some perception   some idea  whether complete or incomplete  true or false  as soon as  his will is determined  he must have felt  either strongly or feebly  if  this was not the case he would have determined without motive  thus  to  speak correctly  there are no causes which are truly indifferent to the  will  however faint the impulse he receives  whether on the part of the  objects themselves  or on the part of their images or ideas  as soon  as his will acts  the impulse has been competent to determine him  in  consequence of a slight  of a feeble impulse  the will is weak  it is  this weakness of the will that is called  indifference   his brain with  difficulty perceives the sensation  it has received  it consequently  acts with less vigour  either to obtain or remove the object or the idea  that has modified it  if the impulse is powerful  the will is strong   it makes him act vigorously  to obtain or to remove the object which  appears to him either very agreeable or very incommodious     it has been believed man was a free agent  because it has been imagined  that his soul could at will recall ideas  which sometimes suffice  to check his most unruly desires  thus  the idea of a remote evil  frequently prevents him from enjoying a present and actual good  thus   remembrance  which is an almost insensible  a slight modification of his  brain  annihilates  at each instant  the real objects that act upon  his will  but he is not master of recalling to himself his ideas at  pleasure  their association is independent of him  they are arranged in  his brain  in despite of him  without his own knowledge  where they have  made an impression more or less profound  his memory itself depends upon  his organization  its fidelity depends upon the habitual or momentary  state in which he finds himself  when his will is vigorously determined  to some object or idea that excites a very lively passion in him  those  objects or ideas that would be able to arrest his action no longer  present themselves to his mind  in those moments his eyes are shut  to the dangers that menace him  of which the idea ought to make him  forbear  he marches forward headlong towards the object by whose image  he is hurried on  reflection cannot operate upon him in any way  he sees  nothing but the object of his desires  the salutary ideas which might be  able to arrest his progress disappear  or else display themselves either  too faintly or too late to prevent his acting  such is the case with  all those who  blinded by some strong passion  are not in a condition  to recal to themselves those motives  of which the idea alone  in cooler  moments  would be sufficient to deter them from proceeding  the disorder  in which they are  prevents their judging soundly  render them incapable  of foreseeing the consequence of their actions  precludes them from  applying to their experience  from making use of their reason  natural  operations  which suppose a justness in the manner of associating  their ideas  but to which their brain is then not more competent  in  consequence of the momentary delirium it suffers  than their hand is to  write whilst they are taking violent exercise     man s mode of thinking is necessarily determined by his manner of  being  it must  therefore  depend on his natural organization  and the  modification his system receives independently of his will  from this we  are obliged to conclude  that his thoughts  his reflections  his manner  of viewing things  of feeling  of judging  of combining ideas  is  neither voluntary nor free  in a word  that his soul is neither mistress  of the motion excited in it  nor of representing to itself  when wanted   those images or ideas that are capable of counterbalancing the impulse  it receives  this is the reason why man  when in a passion  ceases to  reason  at that moment reason is as impossible to be heard  as it is  during an extacy  or in a fit of drunkenness  the wicked are never more  than men who are either drunk or mad  if they reason  it is not until  tranquillity is re established in their machine  then  and not till  then  the tardy ideas that present themselves to their mind  enable them  to see the consequence of their actions  and give birth to ideas   that bring on them that trouble  which is designated  shame  regret   remorse      the errors of philosophers on the free agency of man  have arisen from  their regarding his will as the  primum mobile   the original motive  of his actions  for want of recurring back  they have not perceived the  multiplied  the complicated causes  which  independently of him  give  motion to the will itself  or which dispose and modify his brain  whilst  he himself is purely passive in the motion he receives  is he the master  of desiring or not desiring an object that appears desirable to him   without doubt it will be answered  no  but he is the master of resisting  his desire  if he reflects on the consequences  but  i ask  is he  capable of reflecting on these consequences when his soul is hurried  along by a very lively passion  which entirely depends upon his natural  organization  and the causes by which he is modified  is it in his power  to add to these consequences all the weight necessary to counterbalance  his desire  is he the master of preventing the qualities which render an  object desirable from residing in it  i shall be told  he ought to have  learned to resist his passions  to contract a habit of putting a curb on  his desires  i agree to it without any difficulty  but in reply  i again  ask  is his nature susceptible of this modification  does his boiling  blood  his unruly imagination  the igneous fluid that circulates in his  veins  permit him to make  enable him to apply true experience in the  moment when it is wanted  and  even when his temperament has capacitated  him  has his education  the examples set before him  the ideas with  which he has been inspired in early life  been suitable to make him  contract this habit of repressing his desires  have not all these things  rather contributed to induce him to seek with avidity  to make him  actually desire those objects which you say he ought to resist     the  ambitious man  cries out   you will have me resist my passion  but  have they not unceasingly repeated to me  that rank  honours  power   are the most desirable advantages in life  have i not seen my  fellow citizens envy them  the nobles of my country sacrifice every  thing to obtain them  in the society in which i live  am i not obliged  to feel  that if i am deprived of these advantages  i must expect to  languish in contempt  to cringe under the rod of oppression     the  miser  says   you forbid me to love money  to seek after the means  of acquiring it  alas  does not every thing tell me  that in this world  money is the greatest blessing  that it is amply sufficient to render  me happy  in the country i inhabit  do i not see all my fellow citizens  covetous of riches  but do i not also witness that they are little  scrupulous in the means of obtaining wealth  as soon as they are  enriched by the means which you censure  are they not cherished   considered  and respected  by what authority  then  do you object to my  amassing treasure  what right have you to prevent my using means   which although you call them sordid and criminal  i see approved by the  sovereign  will you have me renounce my happiness     the  voluptuary  argues   you pretend that i should resist my desires   but was i the maker of my own temperament  which unceasingly invites me  to pleasure  you call my pleasures disgraceful  but in the country in  which i live  do i not witness the most dissipated men enjoying the most  distinguished rank  do i not behold  that no one is ashamed of adultery  but the husband it has outraged  do not i see men making trophies  of their debaucheries  boasting of their libertinism  rewarded  with  applause     the  choleric  man vociferates   you advise me to put a curb on my  passions  to resist the desire of avenging myself  but can i conquer my  nature  can i alter the received opinions of the world  shall i not be  for ever disgraced  infallibly dishonoured in society  if i do not wash  out  in the blood of my fellow creature  the injuries i have received     the  zealous enthusiast  exclaims   you recommend to me mildness   you advise me to be tolerant  to be indulgent to the opinions of my  fellow men  but is not my temperament violent  do i not ardently love my  god  do they not assure me that zeal is pleasing to him  that sanguinary  inhuman persecutors have been his friends  that those who do not think  as i do are his enemies  i wish to render myself acceptable in his  sight  i therefore adopt the means you reprobate     in short  the actions of man are never free  they are always the  necessary consequence of his temperament  of the received ideas  of  the notions  either true or false  which he has formed to himself  of happiness  of his opinions  strengthened by example  forfeited  by education  consolidated by daily experience  so many crimes are  witnessed on the earth  only because every thing conspires to render man  vicious  to make him criminal  very frequently  the superstitions he  has adopted  his government  his education  the examples set before him   irresistibly drive him on to evil  under these circumstances morality  preaches virtue to him in vain  in those societies where vice is  esteemed  where crime is crowned  where venality is constantly  recompenced  where the most dreadful disorders are punished  only in  those who are too weak to enjoy the privilege of committing them with  impunity  the practice of virtue is considered nothing more than a  painful sacrifice of fancied happiness  such societies chastise  in the  lower orders  those excesses which they respect in the higher ranks  and  frequently have the injustice to condemn those in penalty of death   whom public prejudices  maintained by constant example  have rendered  criminal     man  then  is not a free agent in any one instant of his life  he is  necessarily guided in each step by those advantages  whether real or  fictitious  that he attaches to the objects by which his passions  are roused  these passions themselves are necessary in a being who   unceasingly tends towards his own happiness  their energy is necessary   since that depends on his temperament  his temperament is necessary   because it depends on the physical elements which enter into his  composition  the modification of this temperament is necessary  as it  is the infallible result  the inevitable consequence of the impulse he  receives from the incessant action of moral and physical beings     in despite of these proofs of the want of free agency in man  so clear  to unprejudiced minds  it will  perhaps  be insisted upon with no small  feeling of triumph  that if it be proposed to any one to move or not to  move his hand  an action in the number of those called  indifferent    he evidently appears to be the master of choosing  from which it is  concluded  evidence has been offered of his free agency  the reply is   this example is perfectly simple  man in performing some action which he  is resolved on doing  does not by any means prove his free agency  the  very desire of displaying this quality  excited by the dispute  becomes  a necessary motive which decides his will either for the one or the  other of these actions  what deludes him in this instance  or that which  persuades him he is a free agent at this moment  is  that he does not  discern the true motive which sets him in action  which is neither more  nor less than the desire of convincing his opponent  if in the heat of  the dispute he insists and asks   am i not the master of throwing myself  out of the window   i shall answer him  no  that whilst he preserves his  reason  there is not even a probability that the desire of proving his  free agency  will become a motive sufficiently powerful  to make him  sacrifice his life to the attempt  if  notwithstanding this  to prove he  is a free agent  he should actually precipitate himself from the window   it would not be a sufficient warrantry to conclude he acted freely  but  rather that it was the violence of his temperament which spurred him  on to this folly  madness is a state that depends upon the heat of  the blood  not upon the will  a fanatic or a hero  braves death as  necessarily as a more phlegmatic man or a coward flies from it  there  is  in point of fact  no difference between the man who is cast out of  the window by another  and the man who throws himself out of it  except  that the impulse in the first instance comes immediately from without   whilst that which determines the fall in the second case  springs from  within his own peculiar machine  having its more remote cause also  exterior  when mutius scaevola held his hand in the fire  he was as much  acting under the influence of necessity  caused by interior motives   that urged him to this strange action  as if his arm had been held by  strong men  pride  despair  the desire of braving his enemy  a wish  to astonish him  an anxiety to intimidate him   c  were the invisible  chains that held his hand bound to the fire  the love of glory   enthusiasm for their country  in like manner  caused codrus and decius  to devote themselves for their fellow citizens  the indian calanus and  the philosopher peregrinus were equally obliged to burn themselves  by  the desire of exciting the astonishment of the grecian assembly     it is said that free agency is the absence of those obstacles competent  to oppose themselves to the actions of man  or to the exercise of his  faculties  it is pretended that he is a free agent  whenever  making use  of these faculties  he produces the effect he has proposed to himself   in reply to this reasoning  it is sufficient to consider that it in no  wise depends upon himself to place or remove the obstacles that either  determine or resist him  the motive that causes his action is no more in  his own power than the obstacle that impedes him  whether this obstacle  or motive be within his own machine or exterior of his person  he is not  master of the thought presented to his mind which determines his will   this thought is excited by some cause independent of himself     to be undeceived on the system of his free agency  man has simply to  recur to the motive by which his will is determined  he will always find  this motive is out of his own controul  it is said  that in consequence  of an idea to which the mind gives birth  man acts freely if he  encounters no obstacle  but the question is  what gives birth to this  idea in his brain  has he the power either to prevent it from presenting  itself  or from renewing itself in his brain  does not this idea  depend either upon objects that strike him exteriorly and in despite of  himself  or upon causes that without his knowledge act within himself  and modify his brain  can he prevent his eyes  cast without design upon  any object whatever  from giving him an idea of this object  from  moving his brain  he is not more master of the obstacles  they are the  necessary effects of either interior or exterior causes  which always  act according to their given properties  a man insults a coward  who is  necessarily irritated against his insulter  but his will cannot vanquish  the obstacle that cowardice places to the object of his desire  which  is  to resent the insult  because his natural conformation  which does  not depend upon himself  prevents his having courage  in this case  the coward is insulted in despite of himself  and against his will is  obliged patiently to brook the insult he has received     the partizans of the system of free agency appear ever to have  confounded constraint with necessity  man believes he acts as a free  agent  every time he does not see any thing that places obstacles to his  actions  he does not perceive that the motive which causes him to will  is always necessary  is ever independent of himself  a prisoner loaded  with chains is compelled to remain in prison  but he is not a free  agent  he is not able to resist the desire to emancipate himself   his chains prevent him from acting  but they do not prevent him from  willing  he would save himself if they would loose his fetters  but he  would not save himself as a free agent  fear or the idea of punishment  would be sufficient motives for his action     man may therefore cease to be restrained  without  for that reason   becoming a free agent  in whatever manner he acts  he will act  necessarily  according to motives by which he shall be determined   he may be compared to a heavy body  that finds itself arrested in its  descent by any obstacle whatever  take away this obstacle  it will  gravitate or continue to fall  but who shall say this dense body is  free to fall or not  is not its descent the necessary effect of its own  specific gravity  the virtuous socrates submitted to the laws of his  country  although they were unjust  notwithstanding the doors of his  gaol were left open to him he would not save himself  but in this he  did not act as a free agent  the invisible chains of opinion  the secret  love of decorum  the inward respect for the laws  even when they were  iniquitous  the fear of tarnishing his glory  kept him in his prison   they were motives sufficiently powerful  with this enthusiast for  virtue  to induce him to wait death with tranquillity  it was not in  his power to save himself  because he could find no potential motive to  bring him to depart  even for an instant  from those principles to which  his mind was accustomed     man  says he  frequently acts against his inclination  from whence  he has falsely concluded he is a free agent  when he appears to act  contrary to his inclination  he is determined to it by some motive  sufficiently efficacious to vanquish this inclination  a sick man  with  a view to his cure  arrives at conquering his repugnance to the most  disgusting remedies  the fear of pain  the dread of death  then become  necessary and intelligent motives  consequently  this sick man cannot be  said  with truth  by any means  to act freely     when it is said  that man is not a free agent  it is not pretended to  compare him to a body moved by a simple impulsive cause  he contains  within himself causes inherent to his existence  he is moved by an  interior organ  which has its own peculiar laws  which is itself  necessarily determined  in consequence of ideas formed from perceptions   resulting from sensations  which it receives from exterior objects  as  the mechanism of these sensations  of these perceptions  and the manner  they engrave ideas on the brain of man  are not known to him  because he  is unable to unravel all these motions  because he cannot perceive  the chain of operations in his soul  or the motive principle that  acts within him  he supposes himself a free agent  which  literally  translated  signifies that he moves himself by himself  that he  determines himself without cause  when he rather ought to say  he is  ignorant how or for why he acts in the manner he does  it is true the  soul enjoys an activity peculiar to itself  but it is equally certain  that this activity would never be displayed if some motive or some cause  did not put it in a condition to exercise itself  at least it will not  be pretended that the soul is able either to love or to hate without  being moved  without knowing the objects  without having some idea of  their qualities  gunpowder has unquestionably a particular activity  but  this activity will never display itself  unless fire be applied to it   this  however  immediately sets in motion     it is the great complication of motion in man  it is the variety of  his action  it is the multiplicity of causes that move him  whether  simultaneously or in continual succession  that persuades him he is a  free agent  if all his motions were simple  if the causes that move him  did not confound themselves with each other  if they were distinct  if  his machine was less complicated  he would perceive that all his actions  were necessary  because he would be enabled to recur instantly to  the cause that made him act  a man who should be always obliged to  go towards the west would always go on that side  but he would feel  extremely well  that in so going he was not a free agent  if he had  another sense  as his actions or his motion augmented by a sixth would  be still more varied  much more complicated  he would believe himself  still more a free agent than he does with his five senses     it is  then  for want of recurring to the causes that move him  for  want of being able to analyse  from not being competent to decompose  the complicated motion of his machine  that man believes himself a free  agent  it is only upon his own ignorance that he founds the profound  yet deceitful notion he has of his free agency  that he builds those  opinions which he brings forward as a striking proof of his pretended  freedom of action  if  for a short time  each man was willing to examine  his own peculiar actions  to search out their true motives  to discover  their concatenation  he would remain convinced that the sentiment he has  of his natural free agency is a chimera that must speedily be destroyed  by experience     nevertheless  it must be acknowledged that the multiplicity  the  diversity of the causes which continually act upon man  frequently  without even his knowledge  render it impossible  or at least extremely  difficult  for him to recur to the true principles of his own peculiar  actions  much less the actions of others  they frequently depend  upon causes so fugitive  so remote from their effects  and which   superficially examined  appear to have so little analogy  so slender  a relation with them  that it requires singular sagacity to bring them  into light  this is what renders the study of the moral man a task of  such difficulty  this is the reason why his heart is an abyss  of which  it is frequently impossible for him to fathom the depth  he is  then   obliged to content himself with a knowledge of the general and necessary  laws by which the human heart is regulated  for the individuals of his  own species these laws are pretty nearly the same  they vary only in  consequence of the organization that is peculiar to each  and of the  modification it undergoes  this  however  is not  cannot be rigorously  the same in any two  it suffices to know that by his essence man tends  to conserve himself  to render his existence happy  this granted   whatever may be his actions  if he recurs back to this first principle   to this general  this necessary tendency of his will  he never can be  deceived with regard to his motives  man  without doubt  for want of  cultivating reason  being destitute of experience  frequently deceives  himself upon the means of arriving at this end  sometimes the means he  employs are unpleasant to his fellows  because they are prejudicial  to their interests  or else those of which he avails himself appear  irrational  because they remove him from the end to which he would  approximate  but whatever may be these means  they have always  necessarily and invariably for object  either an existing or imaginary  happiness  are directed to preserve himself in a state analogous to his  mode of existence  to his manner of feeling  to his way of thinking   whether durable or transitory  it is from having mistaken this truth   that the greater number of moral philosophers have made rather the  romance  than the history of the human heart  they have attributed the  actions of man to fictitious causes  at least they have not sought out  the necessary motives of his conduct  politicians and legislators have  been in the same state of ignorance  or else impostors have found it  much shorter to employ imaginary motive powers  than those which really  have existence  they have rather chosen to make man wander out of his  way  to make him tremble under incommodious phantoms  than guide him to  virtue by the direct road to happiness  notwithstanding the conformity  of the latter with the natural desires of his heart  so true it is  that   error can never possibly be useful  to the human species      however this may be  man either sees or believes he sees  much more  distinctly  the necessary relation of effects with their causes in  natural philosophy than in the human heart  at least he sees in the  former sensible causes constantly produce sensible effects  ever the  same  when the circumstances are alike  after this  he hesitates not  to look upon physical effects as necessary  whilst he refuses to  acknowledge necessity in the acts of the human will  these he has   without any just foundation  attributed to a motive power that acts  independently by its own peculiar energy  that is capable of modifying  itself without the concurrence of exterior causes  and which is  distinguished from all material or physical beings   agriculture  is  founded upon the assurance afforded by experience  that the earth   cultivated and sown in a certain manner  when it has otherwise the  requisite qualities  will furnish grain  fruit  and flowers  either  necessary for subsistence or pleasing to the senses  if things were  considered without prejudice  it would be perceived  that in morals  education is nothing more than  the agriculture of the mind   that like  the earth  by reason of its natural disposition  of the culture bestowed  upon it  of the seeds with which it is sown  of the seasons  more or  less favorable  that conduct it to maturity  we may be assured that  the soul will produce either virtue or vice   moral fruit  that will be  either salubrious for man or baneful to society   morals  is the science  of the relations that subsist between the minds  the wills  and the  actions of men  in the same manner that  geometry  is the science of the  relations that are found between bodies  morals would be a chimera   it would have no certain principles  if it was not founded upon the  knowledge of the motives which must necessarily have an influence upon  the human will  and which must necessarily determine the actions of  human beings     if in the moral as well as in the physical world  a cause of which the  action is not interrupted be necessarily followed by a given effect  it  flows consecutively that a  reasonable education   grafted upon truth   founded upon wise laws   that honest principles instilled during youth   virtuous examples continually held forth  esteem attached solely to  merit  recompense awarded to none but good actions  contempt regularly  visiting vice  shame following falsehood as its shadow  rigorous  chastisements applied without distinction to crime  are causes that  would necessarily act on the will of man  that would determine the  greater number of his species to exhibit virtue  to love it for its own  sake  to seek after it as the most desirable good  as the surest road  to the happiness he so ardently desires  but if  on the contrary   superstition  politics  example  public opinion  all labour to  countenance wickedness  to train man viciously  if  instead of fanning  his virtues  they stifle good principles  if  instead of directing his  studies to his advantage  they render his education either useless or  unprofitable  if this education itself  instead of grounding him in  virtue  only inoculates him with vice  if  instead of inculcating  reason  it imbues him with prejudice  if  instead of making him  enamoured of truth  it furnishes him with false notions  if  instead  of storing his mind with just ideas drawn from experience  it fills  him with dangerous opinions  if  instead of fostering mildness and  forbearance  it kindles in his breast only those passions which are  incommodious to himself and hurtful to others  it must be of necessity   that the will of the greater number shall determine them to evil  shall  render them unworthy  make them baneful to society  many authors have  acknowledged the importance of a good education  that youth was the  season to feed the human heart with wholesome diet  but they have not  felt  that a good education is incompatible  nay  impossible  with the  superstition of man  since this commences with giving his mind a false  bias  that it is equally inconsistent with arbitrary government  because  this always dreads lest he should become enlightened  and is ever  sedulous to render him servile  mean  contemptible  and cringing  that  it is incongruous with laws that are not founded in equity  that are  frequently bottomed on injustice  that it cannot obtain with those  received customs that are opposed to good sense  that it cannot exist  whilst public opinion is unfavourable to virtue  above all  that it is  absurd to expect it from incapable instructors  from masters with weak  minds  who have only the ability to infuse into their scholars those  false ideas with which they are themselves infected  here  without  doubt  is the real source from whence springs that universal corruption   that wide spreading depravity  of which moralists  with great justice   so loudly complain  without  however  pointing out those causes of the  evil  which are true as they are necessary  instead of this  they search  for it in human nature  say it is corrupt  blame man for loving himself   and for seeking after his own happiness  insist that he must have  supernatural assistance  some marvellous interference  to enable him to  become good  this is a very prejudicial doctrine for him  it is directly  subversive of his true happiness  by teaching him to hold himself in  contempt  it tends necessarily to discourage him  it either makes him  sluggish  or drives him to despair whilst waiting for this grace  is it  not easy to be perceived  that he would always have it if he was well  educated  if he was honestly governed  there cannot well exist a  wilder or a stranger system of morals  than that of the theologians who  attribute all moral evil to an original sin  and all moral good to the  pardon of it  it ought not to excite surprise if such a system is of no  efficacy  what can reasonably be the result of such an hypothesis  yet   notwithstanding the supposed  the boasted free agency of man  it  is insisted that nothing less than the author of nature himself is  necessary to destroy the wicked desires of his heart  but  alas  no  power whatever is found sufficiently efficacious to resist those unhappy  propensities  which  under the fatal constitution of things  the most  vigorous motives  as before observed  are continually infusing into  the will of man  no agency seems competent to turn the course of that  unhappy direction these are perpetually giving to the stream of his  natural passions  he is  indeed  incessantly exhorted to resist these  passions  to stifle them  and to root them out of his heart  but is it  not evident they are necessary to his welfare  can it not be perceived  they are inherent in his nature  does not experience prove them to be  useful to his conservation  since they have for object  only to avoid  that which may be injurious to him  to procure that which may be  advantageous to his mode of existence  in short  is it not easy to  be seen  that these passions  well directed  that is to say  carried  towards objects that are truly useful  that are really interesting  to himself  which embrace the happiness of others  would necessarily  contribute to the substantial  to the permanent well being of society   theologians themselves have felt  they have acknowledged the necessity  of the passions  many of the fathers of the church have broached this  doctrine  among the rest father senault has written a book expressly on  the subject  the passions of man are like fire  at once necessary to  the wants of life  suitable to ameliorate the condition of humanity   and equally capable of producing the most terrible ravages  the most  frightful devastation     every thing becomes an impulse to the will  a single word frequently  suffices to modify a man for the whole course of his life  to decide  for ever his propensities  an infant who has burned his finger by having  approached it too near the flame of a lighted taper  is warned from  thence  that he ought to abstain from indulging a similar temptation  a  man  once punished and despised for having committed a dishonest  action  is not often tempted to continue so unfavourable a course  under  whatever point of man is considered  he never acts but after the impulse  given to his will  whether it be by the will of others  or by more  perceptible physical causes  the particular organization decides  the nature of the impulse  souls act upon souls that are analogous   inflamed  fiery imaginations  act with facility upon strong passions   upon imaginations easy to be inflamed  the surprising progress of  enthusiasm  the hereditary propagation of superstition  the transmission  of religious errors from race to race  the excessive ardour with which  man seizes on the marvellous  are effects as necessary as those which  result from the action and re action of bodies     in despite of the gratuitous ideas which man has formed to himself on  his pretended free agency  in defiance of the illusions of this suppose  intimate sense  which  contrary to his experience  persuades him that  he is master of his will   all his institutions are really founded upon  necessity  on this  as on a variety of other occasions  practice throws  aside speculation  indeed  if it was not believed that certain motives  embraced the power requisite to determine the will of man  to arrest the  progress of his passions  to direct them towards an end  to modify him   of what use would be the faculty of speech  what benefit could arise  from education itself  what does education achieve  save give the first  impulse to the human will  make man contract habits  oblige him to  persist in them  furnish him with motives  whether true or false  to  act after a given manner  when the father either menaces his son with  punishment  or promises him a reward  is he not convinced these things  will act upon his will  what does legislation attempt  except it be  to present to the citizens of a state those motives which are supposed  necessary to determine them to perform some actions that are considered  worthy  to abstain from committing others that are looked upon as  unworthy  what is the object of morals  if it be not to shew man that  his interest exacts he should suppress the momentary ebullition of  his passions  with a view to promote a more certain happiness  a more  lasting well being  than can possibly result from the gratification of  his transitory desires  does not the religion of all countries suppose  the human race  together with the entire of nature  submitted to the  irresistible will of a necessary being  who regulates their condition  after the eternal laws of immutable wisdom  is not god the absolute  master of their destiny  is it not this divine being who chooses and  rejects  the anathemas fulminated by religion  the promises it holds  forth  are they not founded upon the idea of the effects they will  necessarily produce upon mankind  is not man brought into existence  without his own knowledge  is he not obliged to play a part against his  will  does not either his happiness or his misery depend on the part he  plays     all religion has been evidently founded upon  fatalism   among the  greeks they supposed men were punished for their necessary faults   as may be seen in orestes  in oedipus   c  who only committed crimes  predicted by the oracles  it is rather singular that the theological  defenders of the doctrine of  free agency   which they endeavour  to oppose to that of  predestination    which according to them is  irreconcileable with  christianity   inasmuch as it is a false and  dangerous system   should not have been aware that the doctrines of  the  fall of angels  original sin  the small number of the elect  the system  of grace   c   were most incontestibly supporting  by the most cogent  arguments  a  true system of fatalism       education   then  is only necessity shewn to children   legislation   is necessity shewn to the members of the body politic   morals  is the  necessity of the relations subsisting between men  shewn to reasonable  beings  in short  man grants  necessity  in every thing for which he  believes he has certain  unerring experience  that of which he does  not comprehend the necessary connection of causes with their effects  he styles  probability   he would not act as he does  if he was not  convinced  or  at least  if he did not presume he was  that certain  effects will necessarily follow his actions  the  moralist  preaches  reason  because he believes it necessary to man  the  philosopher   writes  because he believes truth must  sooner or later  prevail over  falsehood   tyrants  and  fanatical priests  necessarily hate truth   despise reason  because they believe them prejudicial to their  interests  the  sovereign   who strives to terrify crime by the  severity of his laws  but who nevertheless  from motives of state policy  sometimes renders it useful and even necessary to his purposes  presumes  the motives he employs will be sufficient to keep his subjects within  bounds  all reckon equally upon the power or upon the necessity of the  motives they make use of  each individual flatters himself  either with  or without reason  that these motives will have an influence on the  conduct of mankind  the education of man is commonly so defective  so  inefficacious  so little calculated to promote the end he has in view   because it is regulated by prejudice  even when this education is good   it is but too often speedily counteracted  by almost every thing that  takes place in society  legislation and politics are very frequently  iniquitous  and serve no better purpose than to kindle passions in the  bosom of man  which once set afloat  they are no longer competent to  restrain  the great art of the moralist should be  to point out to man   to convince those who are entrusted with the sacred office of regulating  his will  that their interests are identified  that their reciprocal  happiness depends upon the harmony of their passions  that the safety   the power  the duration of empires  necessarily depend on the good  sense diffused among the individual members  on the truth of the notions  inculcated in the mind of the citizens  on the moral goodness that  is sown in their hearts  on the virtues that are cultivated in their  breasts  religion should not be admissible  unless it truly fortified   unless it really strengthened these motives  but in the miserable  state into which error has plunged a considerable portion of the human  species  man  for the most part  is seduced to be wicked  he injures his  fellow creature as a matter of conscience  because the strongest motives  are held out to him to be persecuting  because his institutions invite  him to the commission of evil  under the lure of promoting his own  immediate happiness  in most countries superstition renders him a  useless being  makes him an abject slave  causes him to tremble under  its terrors  or else turns him into a furious fanatic  who is at once  cruel  intolerant  and inhuman  in a great number of states arbitrary  power crushes him  obliges him to become a cringing sycophant  renders  him completely vicious  in those despotic states the law rarely visits  crime with punishment  except in those who are too feeble to oppose  its course  or when it has become incapable of restraining the violent  excesses to which a bad government gives birth  in short  rational  education is neglected  a prudent culture of the human mind is despised   it depends  but too frequently  upon bigotted  superstitious priests   who are interested in deceiving man  and who are sometimes impostors   or else upon parents or masters without understanding  who are devoid  of morals  who impress on the ductile mind of their scholars those vices  with which they are themselves tormented  who transmit to them the false  opinions  which they believe they have an interest in making them adopt     all this proves the necessity of falling back to man s original errors   and recurring to the primitive source of his wanderings  if it be  seriously intended to furnish him with suitable remedies for such  enormous maladies  it is useless to dream of correcting his mistakes   of curing him of his depravity  until the true causes that move his will  are unravelled  until more real  more beneficial  more certain motives  are substituted for those which are found so inefficacious  which prove  so dangerous both to society and to himself  it is for those who guide  the human will  who regulate the condition of nations  who hold the  real happiness of man in their grasp  to seek after these motives   with  which reason will readily furnish them  which experience will enable  them to apply with success  even a good book  by touching the heart of  a great prince  may become a very powerful cause that shall necessarily  have an influence over the conduct of a whole people  and decide upon  the felicity of a portion of the human race     from all that has been advanced in this chapter  it results  that in no  one moment of his existence man is a free agent  he is not the architect  of his own conformation  this he holds from nature  he has no controul  over his own ideas  or over the modification of his brain  these are  due to causes  that  in despite of him  very frequently without his own  knowledge  unceasingly act upon him  he is not the master of not loving  that which he finds amiable  of not coveting that which appears to  him desirable  he is not capable of refusing to deliberate  when he  is uncertain of the effects certain objects will produce upon him  he  cannot avoid choosing that which he believes will be most advantageous  to him  in the moment when his will is determined by his choice  he is  not competent to act otherwise than he does  in what instance  then  is  he the master of his own actions  in what moment is he a free agent     that which a man is about to do is always a consequence of that which  he has been  of that which he is  of that which he has done up to the  moment of the action  his total and actual existence  considered under  all its possible circumstances  contains the sum of all the motives  to the action he is about to commit  this is a principle  the truth of  which no thinking  being will be able to refuse accrediting  his life  is a series of necessary moments  his conduct  whether good or bad   virtuous or vicious  useful or prejudicial  either to himself or to  others  is a concatenation of action  a chain of causes and effects  as  necessary as all the moments of his existence  to  live   is to exist in  a necessary mode during the points of its duration  which succeed each  other necessarily  to  will   is to acquiesce or not in remaining such  as he is  to be  free   is to yield to the necessary motives that he  carries within himself     if he understood the play of his organs  if he was able to recal to  himself all the impulsions they have received  all the modifications  they have undergone  all the effects they have produced  he would  perceive  that all his actions are submitted to that  fatality  which  regulates his own particular system  as it does the entire system of the  universe  no one effect in him  any more than in nature  produce itself  by  chance   this  as has been before proved  is a word void of sense   all that passes in him  all that is done by him  as well as all that  happens in nature  or that is attributed to her  is derived from  necessary laws  which produce necessary effects  from whence necessarily  flow others      fatality  is the eternal  the immutable  the necessary order  established in nature  or the indispensible connection of causes that  act with the effects they operate  conforming to this order  heavy  bodies fall  light bodies rise  that which is analogous in matter   reciprocally attracts  that which is heterogeneous  mutually repels  man  congregates himself in society  modifies each his fellow  becomes either  virtuous or wicked  either contributes to his mutual happiness  or  reciprocates his misery  either loves his neighbour  or hates his  companion necessarily  according to the manner in which the one acts  upon the other  from whence it may be seen  that the same necessity  which regulates the physical  also regulates the moral world  in which  every thing is in consequence submitted to fatality  man  in running  over  frequently without his own knowledge  often in despite of himself   the route which nature has marked out for him  resembles a swimmer who  is obliged to follow the current that carries him along  he believes  himself a free agent  because he sometimes consents  sometimes does  not consent  to glide with the stream  which  notwithstanding  always  hurries him forward  he believes himself the master of his condition   because he is obliged to use his arms under the fear of sinking     the false ideas he has formed to himself upon free agency  are  in general thus founded  there are certain events which he judges   necessary   either because he sees they are effects that are  constantly  are invariably linked to certain causes  which nothing seems  to prevent  or because he believes he has discovered the chain of causes  and effects that is put in play to produce those events  whilst he  contemplates as  contingent   other events  of whose causes he is  ignorant  the concatenation of which he does not perceive  with whose  mode of acting he is unacquainted  but in nature  where every thing is  connected by one common bond  there exists no effect without a cause  in  the moral as well as in the physical world  every thing that happens is  a necessary consequence of causes  either visible or concealed  which  are  of necessity  obliged to act after their peculiar essences    in man  free agency is nothing more than necessity contained within  himself              chap  xii      an examination of the opinion which pretends that the system of  fatalism is dangerous        for a being whose essence obliges him to have a constant tendency to  his own conservation  to continually seek to render himself happy   experience is indispensible  without it he cannot discover truth  which  is nothing more  as has been already said  than a knowledge of the  constant relations which subsist between man  and those objects that  act upon him  according to his experience he denominates those that  contribute to his permanent welfare useful and salutary  those that  procure him pleasure  more or less durable  he calls agreeable  truth  itself becomes the object of his desires  only when he believes it is  useful  he dreads it  whenever he presumes it will injure him  but has  truth the power to injure him  is it possible that evil can result to  man from a correct understanding of the relations he has with other  beings  can it be true  that he can be harmed by becoming acquainted  with those things  of which  for his own happiness  he is interested in  having a knowledge  no  unquestionably not  it is upon its utility that  truth founds its worth  upon this that it builds its rights  sometimes  it may be disagreeable to individuals  it may even appear contrary to  their interests  but it will ever be beneficial to them in the end   it will always be useful to the whole human species  it will eternally  benefit the great bulk of mankind  whose interests must for ever remain  distinct from those of men  who  duped by their own peculiar passions   believe their advantage consists in plunging others into error      utility   then  is the touchstone of his systems  the test of his  opinions  the criterion of the actions of man  it is the standard of the  esteem  the measure of the love he owes to truth itself  the most useful  truths are the most estimable  those truths which are most interesting  for his species  he styles  eminent   those of which the utility limits  itself to the amusement of some individuals who have not correspondent  ideas  similar modes of feeling  wants analogous to his own  he either  disdains  or else calls them  barren      it is according to this standard  that the principles laid down in this  work  ought to be judged  those who are acquainted with the immense  chain of mischief produced on the earth by erroneous systems of  superstition  will acknowledge the importance of opposing to them  systems more accordant with truth  schemes drawn from nature  sciences  founded on experience  those who are  or believe they are  interested in  maintaining the established errors  will contemplate  with horror  the  truths here presented to them  in short  those infatuated mortals  who  do not feel  or who only feel very faintly  the enormous load of misery  brought upon mankind by metaphysical speculation  the heavy yoke of  slavery under which prejudice makes him groan  will regard all our  principles as useless  or  at most  as sterile truths  calculated to  amuse the idle hours of a few speculators     no astonishment  therefore  need be excited at the various judgments  formed by man  his interests never being the same  any more than his  notions of utility  he condemns or disdains every thing that does not  accord with his own peculiar ideas  this granted  let us examine  if  in the eyes of the disinterested man  who is not entangled by  prejudice  who is sensible to the happiness of his species  who delights  in truth  the  doctrine of fatalism  be useful or dangerous  let us  see if it is a barren speculation  that his not any influence upon the  felicity of the human race  at has been already shewn  that it will  furnish morals with efficacious arguments  with real motives to  determine the will  supply politics with the true lever to raise the  proper activity in the mind of man  it will also be seen that it  serves to explain in a simple manner the mechanism of man s actions  to  develope in an easy way the arcana of the most striking phenomena of  the human heart  on the other hand  if his ideas are only the result of  unfruitful speculations  they cannot interest the happiness of the  human species  whether he believes himself a free agent  or whether  he acknowledges the necessity of things  he always equally follows the  desires imprinted on his soul  which are to preserve his existence and  render himself happy  a rational education  honest habits  wise systems   equitable laws  rewards uprightly distributed  punishments justly  inflicted  will conduct man to happiness by making him virtuous  while  thorny speculations  filled with difficulties  can at most only have an  influence over persons unaccustomed to think     after these reflections  it will be very easy to remove the difficulties  that are unceasingly opposed to the system of fatalism  which so many  persons  blinded by their superstitious prejudices  are desirous to have  considered as dangerous  as deserving of punishment  as calculated  to disturb public tranquility  as tending to unchain the passions  to  undermine the opinions man ought to have  and to confound his ideas of  vice and of virtue     the opposers of necessity  say  that if all the actions of man are  necessary  no right whatever exists to punish bad ones  or even to he  angry with those who commit them  that nothing ought to be imputed to  them  that the laws would be unjust if they should decree punishment for  necessary actions  in short  that under this system man could neither  have merit nor demerit  in reply  it may be argued  that  to impute an  action to any one  is to attribute that action to him  to acknowledge  him for the author  thus  when even an action was supposed to be the  effect of an agent  and that agent  necessity   the imputation would  lie  the merit or demerit  that is ascribed to an action are ideas  originating in the effects  whether favourable or pernicious  that  result to those who experience its operation  when  therefore  it should  be conceded  that the agent was necessity  it is not less certain  that  the action would be either good or bad  estimable or contemptible  to  those who must feel its influence  in short that it would be capable of  either eliciting their love  or exciting their anger  love and anger  are modes of existence  suitable to modify  beings of the human species   when  therefore  man irritates himself against his fellow  he intends  to excite his fear  or even to punish him  in order to deter him from  committing that which is displeasing to him  moreover his anger is  necessary  it is the result of his nature  the consequence of his  temperament  the painful sensation produced by a stone that falls on the  arm  does not displease the less  because it comes from a cause deprived  of will  which acts by the necessity of its nature  in contemplating  man as acting necessarily  it is impossible to avoid distinguishing that  mode of action or being which is agreeable  which elicits approbation   from that which is afflicting  which irritates  which nature obliges him  to blame and to prevent  from this it will be seen  that the system of  fatalism  does not in any manner change the actual state of things  and  is by no means calculated to confound man s ideas of virtue and vice     man s nature always revolts against that which opposes it  there are men  so choleric  that they infuriate themselves even against insensible and  inanimate objects  reflection on their own impotence to modify these  objects ought to conduct them back to reason  parents are frequently  very much to be blamed for correcting their children with anger  they  should be contemplated as beings who are not yet modified  or who have   perhaps  been very badly modified by themselves  nothing is more common  in life  than to see men punish faults of which they are themselves the  cause     laws are made with a view to maintain society  to uphold its existence   to prevent man associated  from injuring his neighbour  they are  therefore competent to punish those who disturb its harmony  or those  who commit actions that are injurious to their fellows  whether these  associates may be the agents of necessity  or whether they are free  agents  it suffices to know they are susceptible of modification  and  are therefore submitted to the operation of the law  penal laws are   or ought to be  those motives which experience has shewn capable of  restraining the inordinate passions of man  or of annihilating the  impulse these passions give to his will  from whatever necessary cause  man may derive these passions  the legislator proposes to arrest their  effect  when he takes suitable means  when he adopts proper methods   he is certain of success  the judge  in decreeing to crime  gibbets   tortures  or any other chastisement whatever  does nothing more than is  done by the architect  who in building a house  places gutters to carry  off the rain  and prevent it from sapping the foundation     whatever may be the cause that obliges man to act  society possesses  the right to crush the effects  as much as the man whose land would be  ruined by a river  has to restrain its waters by a bank  or even  if he  is able  to turn its course  it is by virtue of this right that society  has the power to intimidate  the faculty to punish  with a view to its  own conservation  those who may be tempted to injure it  or those who  commit actions which are acknowledged really to interrupt its repose  to  be inimical to its security  repugnant to its happiness     it will  perhaps  be argued  that society does not  usually  punish  those faults in which the will has no share  that  in fact  it punishes  the will alone  that this it is which decides the nature of the crime   and the degree of its atrocity  that if this will be not free  it ought  not to be punished  i reply  that society is an assemblage of sensible  beings  susceptible of reason  who desire their own welfare  who fear  evil  and seek after good  these dispositions enable their will to be so  modified or determined  that they are capable of holding such a conduct  as will conduce to the end they have in view  education  the laws   public opinion  example  habit  fear  are the causes that must modify  associated man  influence his will  regulate his passions  restrain the  actions of him who is capable of injuring the end of his association   and thereby make him concur to the general happiness  these causes are  of a nature to make impressions on every man  whose organization  whose  essence  whose sanity  places him in a capacity to contract the habits   to imbibe the modes of thinking  to adopt the manner of acting  with  which society is willing to inspire him  all the individuals of the  human species are susceptible of fear  from whence it flows as a natural  consequence  that the fear of punishment  or the privation of the  happiness he desires  are motives that must necessarily more or less  influence his will  and regulate his actions  if the man is to be found  who is so badly constituted as to resist  whose organization is so  vicious as to be insensible to those motives which operate upon all his  fellows  he is not fit to live in society  he would contradict the very  end of his association  he would be its enemy  he would place obstacles  to its natural tendency  his rebellious disposition  his unsociable  will  not being susceptible of that modification which is convenient  to his own true interests and to the interests of his fellow citizens   these would unite themselves against such an enemy  and the law which  is  or ought to be the expression of the general will  would visit with  condign punishment that refractory individual upon whom the motives  presented to him by society  had not the effect which it had been  induced to expect  in consequence  such an unsociable man would be  chastised  he would be rendered miserable  and according to the nature  of his crime he would be excluded from society as a being but little  calculated to concur in its views     if society has the right to conserve itself  it has also the right  to take the means  these means are the laws which present or ought to  present to the will of man those motives which are most suitable to  deter him from committing injurious actions  if these motives fail of  the proper effect  if they are unable to influence him  society  for its  own peculiar good  is obliged to wrest from him the power of doing it  further injury  from whatever source his actions may arise  therefore   whether they are the result of free agency  or whether they are the  offspring of necessity  society coerces him if  after having furnished  him with motives  sufficiently powerful to act upon reasonable beings   it perceives that these motives have not been competent to vanquish his  depraved nature  it punishes him with justice  when the actions from  which it dissuades him are truly injurious to society  it has an  unquestionable right to punish  when it only commands those things  that are conformable to the end proposed by man in his association  or  defends the commission of those acts  which are contrary to this  end  which are hostile to the nature of beings associated for their  reciprocal advantage  but  on the other hand  the law has not acquired  the right to punish him  if it has failed to present to him the motives  necessary to have an influence over his will  it has not the right to  coerce him if the negligence of society has deprived him of the means  of subsisting  of exercising his talents  of exerting his industry  of  labouring for its welfare  it is unjust  when it punishes those to whom  it has  neither given an education  nor honest principles  whom it has  not enabled to contract habits necessary to the maintenance of society   it is unjust when it punishes them for faults which the wants of their  nature  or the constitution of society has rendered necessary to them   it is unjust  it is irrational  whenever it chastises them for having  followed those propensities  which example  which public opinion  which  the institutions  which society itself conspires to give them  in short   the law is defective when it does not proportion the punishment to the  real evil which society has sustained  the last degree of injustice  the  acme of folly is  when society is so blinded as to inflict punishment on  those citizens who have served it usefully     the  penal  laws  in exhibiting terrifying objects to man  who must be  supposed susceptible of fear  presents him with motives calculated to  have an influence over his will  the idea of pain  the privation of  liberty  the fear of death  are  to a being well constituted  in the  full enjoyment of his faculties  very puissant obstacles  that strongly  oppose themselves to the impulse of his unruly desires  when these do  not coerce his will  when they fail to arrest his progress  he is  an irrational being  a madman  a being badly organized  against whom  society has the right to guarantee itself  against whom it has a right  to take measures for its own security  madness is  without doubt  an  involuntary  a necessary state  nevertheless  no one feels it unjust to  deprive the insane of their liberty  although their actions can only  be imputed to the derangement of their brain  the wicked are men whose  brain is either constantly or transitorily disturbed  still they must be  punished by reason of the evil they commit  they must always be placed  in the impossibility of injuring society  if no hope remains of bringing  them back to a reasonable conduct  if every prospect of recalling them  to their duty has vanished  if they cannot be made to adopt a mode of  action conformable to the great end of association  they must be for  ever excluded its benefits     it will not be requisite to examine here  how far the punishments which  society inflicts upon those who offend against it  may be reasonably  carried  reason should seem to indicate that the law ought to shew to  the necessary crimes of man  all the indulgence that is compatible with  the conservation of society  the system of fatalism  as we have seen   does not leave crime unpunished  but it is  at least  calculated to  moderate the barbarity with which a number of nations punish the victims  to their anger  this cruelty becomes still more absurd  when experience  has shewn its inutility  the habit of witnessing ferocious punishments  familiarizes criminals with the idea  if it be true that society  possesses the right of taking away the life of its members  if it be  really a fact  that the death of a criminal  thenceforth useless  can  be advantageous for society  which it will be necessary to examine   humanity  at least  exacts that this death should not be accompanied  with useless tortures  with which laws  perhaps in this instance too  rigorous  frequently seem to delight in overwhelming their victim  this  cruelty seems to defeat its own end  it only serves to make the culprit   who is immolated to the public vengeance  suffer without any advantage  to society  it moves the compassion of the spectator  interests him  in favor of the miserable offender who groans under its weight  it  impresses nothing upon the wicked  but the sight of those cruelties  destined for himself  which but too frequently renders him more  ferocious  more cruel  more the enemy of his associates  if the  example of death was less frequent  even without being accompanied with  tortures  it would be more efficacious  if experience was consulted  it  would be found that the greater number of criminals only look upon death  as a  bad quarter of an hour   it is an unquestionable fact  that a  thief seeing one of his comrades  display a want of firmness under the  punishment  said to him    is not this what i have often told you   that in our business  we have one evil more than the rest of mankind     robberies are daily committed  even at the foot of the scaffolds where  criminals are punished  in those nations  where the penalty of death is  so lightly inflicted  has sufficient attention been paid to the fact   that society is yearly deprived of a great number of individuals who  would be able to render it very useful service  if made to work  and  thus indemnify the community for the injuries they have committed   the facility with which the lives of men are taken away  proves  the incapacity of counsellors  is an evidence of the negligence of  legislators  they find it a much shorter road  that it gives them less  trouble to destroy the citizens than to seek after the means to render  them better     what shall be said for the unjust cruelty of some nations  in which  the law  that ought to have for its object the advantage of the whole   appears to be made only for the security of the most powerful  how shall  we account for the inhumanity of those societies  in which punishments  the most disproportionate to the crime  unmercifully take away the lives  of men  whom the most urgent necessity  the dreadful alternative of  famishing in a land of plenty  has obliged to become criminal  it  is thus that in a great number of civilized nations  the life of the  citizen is placed in the same scales with money  that the unhappy wretch  who is perishing from hunger  who is writhing under the most abject  misery  is put to death for having taken a pitiful portion of the  superfluity of another whom he beholds rolling in abundance  it is this  that  in many otherwise very enlightened societies  is called  justice    or making the punishment commensurate with the crime     let the man of humanity  whose tender feelings are alive to the welfare  of his species  let the moralist  who preaches virtue  who holds out  forbearance to man  let the philosopher  who dives into the secrets of  nature  let the theologian himself say  if this dreadful iniquity  this  heinous sin  does not become yet more crying  when the laws decree the  most cruel tortures for crimes to which the most irrational customs gave  birth  which bad institutions engender  which evil examples multiply  is  not this something like building a sorry  inconvenient hovel  and then  punishing the inhabitant  because he does not find all the conveniences  of the most complete mansion  of the most finished structure  man  as  at cannot be too frequently repeated  is so prone to evil  only because  every thing appears to urge him on to the commission of it  by too  frequently shewing him vice triumphant  his education is void in a great  number of states  perhaps defective in nearly all  in many places  he receives from society no other principles  save those of an  unintelligible superstition  which make but a feeble barrier against  those propensities that are excited by dissolute manners  which are  encouraged by corrupt examples  in vain the law cries out to him    abstain from the goods of thy neighbour   his wants  more powerful   loudly declare to him that he must live  unaccustomed to reason  having  never been submitted to a wholesome discipline  he conceives he must  do it at the expence of a society who has done nothing for him  who  condemns him to groan in misery  to languish in indigence  frequently  deprived of the common necessaries requisite to support his existence   which his essence  of which he is not the master  compels him to  conserve  he compensates himself by theft  he revenges himself by  assassination  he becomes a plunderer by profession  a murderer by  trade  he plunges into crime  and seeks at the risque of his life  to  satisfy those wants  whether real or imaginary  to which every thing  around him conspires to give birth  deprived of education  he has  not been taught to restrain the fury of his temperament  to guide his  passions with discretion  to curb his inclinations  without ideas of  decency  destitute of the true principles of honour  he engages in  criminal pursuits that injure his country  which at the same time has  been to him nothing more than a step mother  in the paroxysm of his  rage  in the exacerbation of his mind  he loses sight of his neighbour s  rights  he overlooks the gibbet  he forgets the torture  his unruly  desires have become too potent  they have completely absorbed his mind   by a criminal indulgence they have given an inveteracy to his habits  which preclude him from changing them  laziness has made him torpid   remorse has gnawed his peace  despair has rendered him blind  he rushes  on to death  and society is compelled to punish him rigorously  for  those fatal  those necessary dispositions  which it has perhaps itself  engendered in his heart by evil example  or which at least  it has not  taken the pains seasonably to root out  which it has neglected to  oppose by suitable motives  by those calculated to give him honest  principles  to excite him to industrious habits  to imbue him with  virtuous inclinations  thus  society frequently punishes those  propensities of which it is itself the author  or which its negligence  has suffered to spring up in the mind of man  it acts like those  unjust fathers  who chastise their children for vices which they have  themselves made them contract     however unjust  however unreasonable this conduct may be  or appear to  be  it is not the less necessary  society  such as it is  whatever may  be its corruption  whatever vices may pervade its institutions  like  every thing else in nature  is willing to subsist  tends to conserve  itself  in consequence  it is obliged to punish those excesses which  its own vicious constitution has produced  in despite of its peculiar  prejudices  notwithstanding its vices  it feels cogently that its own  immediate security demands that it should destroy the conspiracies of  those who make war against its tranquillity  if these  hurried on by the  foul current of their necessary propensities  disturb its repose  if   borne on the stream of their ill directed desires  they injure its  interests  this following the natural law  which obliges it to labour  to its own peculiar conservation  removes them out of its road  punishes  them with more or less rigor  according to the objects to which it  attaches the greatest importance  or which it supposes best suited to  further its own peculiar welfare  without doubt  it deceives itself  frequently  both upon these objects and the means  but it deceives  itself necessarily  for want of the knowledge calculated to enlighten  it  with regard to its true interests  for want of those  who regulate  its movements possessing proper vigilance  suitable talents  the  requisite virtue  from this it will appear  that the injustice of  a society badly constituted  and blinded by its prejudices  is as  necessary  as the crimes of those by whom it is hostilely attacked  by  whose vices it is distracted  the body politic  when in a state of  insanity  cannot act more consistently with reason  than one of its  members whose brain is disturbed by madness     it will still be said that these maxims  by submitting every thing  to necessity  must confound  or even destroy the notions man forms of  justice and injustice  of good and evil  of merit and demerit  i deny  it  although man  in every thing he does  acts necessarily  his actions  are good  they are just  they are meritorious  every time they tend  to the real utility of his fellows  of the society of which he makes a  part  they are  of necessity  distinguished from those which are really  prejudicial to the welfare of his associates  society is just  it is  good  it is worthy our reverence  when it procures for all its members   their physical wants  when it affords them protection  when it secures  their liberty  when it puts them in possession of their natural rights   it is ill this that consists all the happiness of which the social  compact is susceptible  society is unjust  it is bad  it is unworthy  our esteem  when it is partial to a few  when it is cruel to the greater  number  it is then that it multiplies its enemies  obliges them to  revenge themselves by criminal actions which it is under the necessity  to punish  it is not upon the caprices of political society that depend  the true notions of justice and injustice  the right ideas of moral  good and evil  a just appreciation of merit and demerit  it is upon   utility   upon the necessity of things  which always forces man to feel  that there exists a mode of acting on which he implicitly relies  which  he is obliged to venerate  which he cannot help approving either in  his fellows  in himself  or in society  whilst there is another mode to  which he cannot lend his confidence  which his nature makes him to hate   which his feelings compel him to condemn  it is upon his own peculiar  essence that man founds his ideas of pleasure and of pain  of right and  of wrong  of vice and of virtue  the only difference between these is   that pleasure and pain make them instantaneously felt in his brain   he becomes conscious of their existence upon the spot  in the place of  which  the advantages that accrue to him from justice  the benefit that  he derives from virtue  frequently do not display themselves but after  a long train of reflections  after multiplied experience and complicated  attention  which many  either from a defect in their conformation  or  from the peculiarity of the circumstances under which they are placed   are prevented from making  or at least from making correctly     by a necessary consequence of this truism  the system of fatalism   although it has frequently been so accused  does not tend to encourage  man in crime  to make remorse vanish from his mind  his propensities are  to be ascribed to his nature  the use he makes of his passions depends  upon his habits  upon his opinions  upon the ideas he has received in  his education  upon the examples held forth by the society in which he  lives  these things are what necessarily decide his conduct  thus   when his temperament renders him susceptible of strong passions  he is  violent in his desires  whatever may be his speculations      remorse  is the painful sentiment excited in him by grief  caused  either by the immediate or probable future effect of his indulged  passions  if these effects were always useful to him  he would not  experience remorse  but  as soon as he is assured that his actions  render him hateful  that his passions make him contemptible  or  as  soon as he fears he shall be punished in some mode or other  he becomes  restless  discontented with himself  he reproaches himself with his own  conduct  he feels ashamed  he fears the judgement of those beings whose  affection he has learned to esteem  in whose good will he finds his own  comfort deeply interested  his experience proves to him that the wicked  man is odious to all those upon whom his actions have any influence   if these actions are concealed at the moment of commission  he knows  it very rarely happens they remain so for ever  the smallest reflection  convinces him that there is no wicked man who is not ashamed of his  own conduct  who is truly contented with himself  who does not envy the  condition of the good man  who is not obliged to acknowledge that he has  paid very dearly for those advantages he is never able to enjoy  without  experiencing the most troublesome sensations  without making the most  bitter reproaches against himself  then he feels ashamed  despises  himself  hates himself  his conscience becomes alarmed  remorse follows  in it train  to be convinced of the truth of this principle it is only  requisite to cast our eyes on the extreme precautions that tyrants  and villains  who are otherwise sufficiently powerful not to dread the  punishment of man  take to prevent exposure   to what lengths they push  their cruelties against some  to what meannesses they stoop to others of  those who are able to hold them up to public scorn  have they not  then   a consciousness of their own iniquities  do they not know that they  are hateful and contemptible  have they not remorse  is their condition  happy  persons well brought up acquire these sentiments in their  education  which are either strengthened or enfeebled by public opinion   by habit  or by the examples set before them  in a depraved society   remorse either does not exist  or presently disappears  because  in  all his actions  it is ever the judgment of his fellow man that man is  obliged necessarily to regard  he never feels either shame or remorse  for actions he sees approved  that are practised by the world   under corrupt governments  venal souls  avaricious being  mercenary  individuals  do not blush either at meanness  robbery  or rapine  when  it is authorized by example  in licentious nations  no one blushes  at adultery except the husband  at whose expence it is committed  in  superstitious countries  man does not blush to assassinate his fellow  for his opinions  it will be obvious  therefore  that his remorse  as  well as the ideas  whether right or wrong  which man has of decency   virtue  justice   c  are the necessary consequence of his temperament   modified by the society in which he lives  assassins and thieves  when  they live only among themselves  have neither shame nor remorse     thus  i repeat  all the actions of man are necessary those which are  always useful  which constantly contribute to the real  tend to the  permanent happiness of his species  are called  virtues   and are  necessarily pleasing to all who experience their influence  at least   if their passions or false opinions do not oblige them to judge in that  manner which is but little accordant with the nature of things  each man  acts  each individual judges  necessarily  according to his own peculiar  mode of existence  after the ideas  whether true or false  which he has  formed with regard to his happiness  there are necessary actions  which man is obliged to approve  there are others  that  in despite of  himself  he is compelled to censure  of which the idea generates shame  when his reflection permits him to contemplate them under the same point  of view that they are regarded by his associates  the virtuous man and  the wicked man act from motives equally necessary  they differ simply in  their organization  in the ideas they form to themselves of happiness   we love the one necessarily  we detest the other from the same  necessity  the law of his nature  which wills that a sensible being  shall constantly labour to preserve himself  has not left to man the  power to choose  or the free agency to prefer pain to pleasure  vice to  utility  crime to virtue  it is  then  the essence of man himself that  obliges him to discriminate those actions which are advantageous to him   form those which are prejudicial to his interest  from those which are  baneful to his felicity     this distinction subsists even in the most corrupt societies  in which  the ideas of virtue  although completely effaced from their conduct   remain the same in their mind  let us suppose a matt  who had decidedly  determined for villainy  who should say to himself   it is folly to  be virtuous in a society that is depraved  in a community that is  debauched   let us suppose also  that he has sufficient address  the  unlooked for good fortune to escape censure or punishment  during a  long series of years  i say  that in despite of all these circumstances   apparently so advantageous for himself  such a man has neither been  happy nor contented with his own conduct  he has been in continual  agonies  ever at war with his own actions  in a state of constant  agitation  how much pain  how much anxiety  has he not endured in this  perpetual conflict with himself  how many precautions  what excessive  labour  what endless solicitude  has he not been compelled to employ in  this continued struggle  how many embarrassments  how many cares  has  he not experienced in this eternal wrestling with his associates  whose  penetration he dreads  whose scorn he fears will follow a true knowledge  of his pursuits  demand of him what he thinks of himself  he will shrink  from the question  approach the bedside of this villain at the moment  he is dying  ask him if he would be willing to recommence  at the same  price  a life of similar agitation  if he is ingenuous  he will avow  that he has tasted neither repose nor happiness  that each crime filled  him with inquietude  that reflection prevented him from sleeping  that  the world has been to him only one continued scene of alarm  an  uninterrupted concatenation of terror  an everlasting  anxiety of  mind   that to live peaceably upon bread and water  appears to him to be  a much happier  a more easy condition  than to possess riches  credit   reputation  honours  on the same terms that he has himself acquired  them  if this villain  notwithstanding all his success  finds his  condition so deplorable  what must be thought of the feelings of those  who have neither the same resources nor the same advantages to succeed  in their criminal projects     thus  the system of necessity is a truth not only founded upon certain  experience  but  again  it establishes morals upon an immoveable basis   far from sapping the foundations of virtue  it points out its necessity   it clearly shows the invariable sentiments it must excite  sentiments  so necessary  so strong  so congenial to his existence  that all the  prejudices of man  all the vices of his institutions  all the effect of  evil example  have never been able entirely to eradicate them from his  mind  when he mistakes the advantages of virtue  it ought to be ascribed  to the errors that are infused into him  to the irrationality of  his institutions  all his wanderings are the fatal consequences of  error   the necessary result of prejudices which have identified  themselves with his existence  let it not  therefore  any longer be  imputed to his nature that he has become wicked  but to those baneful  opinions which he has imbibed with his mother s milk   that have  rendered him ambitious  avaricious  envious  haughty  arrogant   debauched  intolerant  obstinate  prejudiced  incommodious to his  fellows  mischievous to himself  it is education that carries into his  system the germ of those vices which necessarily torment him during the  whole course of his life      fatalism  is reproached with discouraging man  with damping the ardour  of his soul  with plunging him into apathy  with destroying the bonds  that should connect him with society  its opponents say   if every thing  is necessary  we must let things go on  and not be disturbed by any  thing   but does it depend on man to be sensible or not  is he master  of feeling or not feeling pain  if nature has endowed him with a humane   with a tender soul  is it possible he should not interest himself in a  very lively manner  in the welfare of beings whom he knows are necessary  to his own peculiar happiness  his feelings are necessary  they depend  on his own peculiar nature  cultivated by education  his imagination   prompt to concern itself with the felicity of his race  causes his  heart to be oppressed at the sight of those evils his fellow creature is  obliged to endure   makes his soul tremble in the contemplation of  the misery arising from the despotism that crushes him  from the  superstition that leads him astray  from the passions that distract  him in a state of warfare against his neighbour  although he knows that  death is the fatal  the necessary period to the form of all beings  his  soul is not affected in a less lively manner at the loss of a beloved  wife   at the demise of a child calculated to console his old age   at  the final separation from an esteemed friend who had become dear to his  heart  although he is not ignorant that it is the essence of fire to  burn  he does not believe he is dispensed from using his utmost efforts  to arrest the progress of a conflagration  although he is intimately  convinced that the evils to which he is a witness  are the necessary  consequence of primitive errors with which his fellow citizens are  imbued  he feels he ought to display truth to them  if nature has given  him the necessary courage  under the conviction  that if they listen to  it  it will  by degrees  become a certain remedy for their sufferings   that it will produce those necessary effects which it is of its essence  to operate     if the speculations of man modify his conduct  if they change his  temperament  he ought not to doubt that the system of necessity would  have the most advantageous influence over him  not only is it suitable  to calm the greater part of his inquietude  but it will also contribute  to inspire him with a useful submission  a rational resignation  to the  decrees of a destiny with which his too great sensibility frequently  causes him to be overwhelmed  this happy apathy  without doubt  would  be  desirable to those whose souls  too tender to brook the inequalities  of life  frequently render them the deplorable sport of their fate  or  whose organs  too weak to make resistance to the buffettings of fortune   incessantly expose them to be dashed in pieces under the rude blows of  adversity     but  of all the important advantages the human race would be enabled  to derive from the doctrine of fatalism  if man was to apply it to  his conduct  none would be of greater magnitude  none of more happy  consequence  none that would more efficaciously corroborate his  happiness  than that general indulgence  that universal toleration  that  must necessarily spring from the opinion  that  all is necessary   in  consequence  of the adoption of this principle  the fatalist  if he  had a sensible soul  would commisserate the prejudices of his  fellow man  would lament over his wanderings  would seek to undeceive  him  would try by gentleness to lead him into the right path  without  ever irritating himself against his weakness  without ever insulting  his misery  indeed  what right have we to hate or despise man for his  opinions  his ignorance  his prejudices  his imbecility  his vices   his passions  his weakness  are they not the inevitable consequence of  vicious institutions  is he not sufficiently punished by the multitude  of evils that afflict him on every side  those despots who crush him  with an iron sceptre  are they not continual victims to their own  peculiar restlessness  mancipated to their perpetual diffidence  eternal  slaves to their suspicions  is there one wicked individual who enjoys  a pure  an unmixed  a real happiness  do not nations unceasingly  suffer from their follies  are they not the incessant dupes to their  prejudices  is not the ignorance of chiefs  the ill will they bear to  reason  the hatred they have for truth  punished by the imbecility of  their citizens  by the ruin of the states they govern  in short  the  fatalist would grieve to witness necessity each moment exercising its  severe decrees upon mortals who are ignorant of its power  or who feel  its castigation  without being willing to acknowledge the hand from  whence it proceeds  he will perceive that ignorance is necessary  that  credulity is the necessary result of ignorance  that slavery and bondage  are necessary consequences of ignorant credulity  that corruption of  manners springs necessarily from slavery  that the miseries of society   the unhappiness of its members  are the necessary offspring of this  corruption  the fatalist  in consequence  of these ideas  will neither  be a gloomy misanthrope  nor a dangerous citizen  he will pardon in  his brethren those wanderings  he will forgive them those errors  which  their vitiated nature  by a thousand causes  has rendered necessary  he  will offer them consolation  he will endeavour to inspire them with  courage  he will be sedulous to undeceive them in their idle notions   in their chimerical ideas  but he will never display against them  bitterness of soul  he will never show them that rancorous animosity  which is more suitable  to make them revolt from his doctrines  than to  attract them to reason   he will not disturb the repose of society  he  will not raise the people to insurrection against the sovereign  authority  on the contrary  he will feel that the miserable blindness of  the great  and the wretched perverseness  the fatal obstinacy of so many  conductors of the people  are the necessary consequence of that flattery  that is administered to them in their infancy  that feeds their hopes  with allusive falsehoods  of the depraved malice of those who surround  them  who wickedly corrupt them  that they may profit by their  folly  that they may take advantage of their weakness  in short  that  these things are the inevitable effect of that profound ignorance of  their true interest  in which every thing strives to keep them     the fatalist has no right to be vain of his peculiar talents  no  privilege to be proud of his virtues  he knows that these qualities  are only the consequence of his natural organization  modified by  circumstances that have in no wise depended upon himself  he will  neither have hatred nor feel contempt for those whom nature and  circumstances have not favoured in a similar manner  it is the fatalist  who ought to be humble  who should be modest from principle  is he  not obliged to acknowledge  that he possesses nothing that he has not  previously received     in fact  will not every thing conduct to indulgence the fatalist whom  experience has convinced of the necessity of things  will he not see  with pain  that it is the essence of a society badly constituted   unwisely governed  enslaved to prejudice  attached to unreasonable  customs  submitted to irrational laws  degraded under despotism   corrupted by luxury  inebriated by false opinions  to be filled with  trifling members  to be composed of vicious citizens  to be made up  of cringing slaves  who are proud of their chains  of ambitious men   without idea of true glory  of misers and prodigals  of fanatics and  libertines  convinced of the necessary connection of things  he will  not be surprised to see that the supineness of their chiefs carries  discouragement into their country  or that the influence of their  governors stirs up bloody wars by which it is depopulated  and causes  useless expenditures that impoverish it  that all these excesses united   is the reason why so many nations contain only men wanting happiness   without understanding to attain it  who are devoid of morals  destitute  of virtue  in all this he will contemplate nothing more than the  necessary action and re action of physics upon morals  of morals upon  physics  in short  all who acknowledge fatality  will remain persuaded  that a nation badly governed is a soil very fruitful in venomous  reptiles  very abundant in poisonous plants  that these have such a  plentiful growth as to crowd each other and choak themselves  it is in a  country cultivated by the hands of a lycurgus  that he will witness  the production of intrepid citizens  of noble minded individuals   of disinterested men  who are strangers to irregular pleasures  in a  country cultivated by a tiberius  he will find nothing but villains with  depraved hearts  men with mean contemptible souls  despicable informers   execrable traitors  it is the soil  it is the circumstances in which  man finds himself placed  that renders him either a useful object or  a prejudicial being  the wise man avoids the one  as he would those  dangerous reptiles whose nature it is to sting and communicate their  deadly venom  he attaches himself to the other  esteems him  loves him   as he does those delicious fruits with whose rich maturity his palate  is pleasantly gratified  with whose cooling juices he finds himself  agreeably refreshed  he sees the wicked without anger  he cherishes the  good with pleasure  he delights in the bountiful  he knows full well  that the tree which is languishing without culture in the arid  sandy  desert  that is stunted for want of attention  leafless for want of  moisture  that has grown crooked from neglect  become barren from  want of loam  whose tender bark is gnawed by rapacious beasts of prey   pierced by innumerable insects  would perhaps have expanded far and wide  its verdant boughs from a straight and stately stem  have brought forth  delectable fruit  have afforded from its luxuriant foliage under its  lambent leaves an umbrageous refreshing retreat from the scorching rays  of a meridian sun  have offered beneath its swelling branches  under  its matted tufts a shelter from the pitiless storm  it its seed had  been fortunately sown in a more fertile soil  placed in a more congenial  climate  had experienced the fostering cares of a skilful cultivator     let it not then be said  that it is degrading man reduce his functions  to a pure mechanism  that it is shamefully to undervalue him   scandalously to abuse him  to compare him to a tree  to an abject  vegetation  the philosopher devoid of prejudice does not understand this  language  invented by those who are ignorant of what constitutes the  true dignity of man  a tree is an object which  in its station  joins  the useful with the agreeable  it merits our approbation when it  produces sweet and pleasant fruit  when it affords a favourable shade   all machines are precious  when they are truly useful  when they  faithfully perform the functions for which they are designed  yes  i  speak it with courage  reiterate it with pleasure  the honest man  when  he has talents  when he possesses virtue  is  for the beings of his  species  a tree that furnishes them with delicious fruit  that affords  them refreshing shelter  the honest man is a machine of which the  springs are adapted to fulfil its functions in a manner that must  gratify the expectation of all his fellows  no  i should not blush  i  should not feel degraded  to be a machine of this sort  and my heart  would leap with joy  if i could foresee that the fruit of my reflections  would one day be useful to my race  consoling to my fellow man     is not nature herself a vast machine  of which the human species is but  a very feeble spring  i see nothing contemptible either in her or her  productions  all the beings who come out of her hands are good  are  noble  are sublime  whenever they co operate to the production of  another  to the maintenance of harmony in the sphere where they must  act  of whatever nature the soul may be  whether it is made mortal  or  whether it be supposed immortal  whether it is regarded as a spirit   or whether it be looked upon as a portion of the body  it will be found  noble  it will be estimated great  it will be ranked good  it will be  considered sublime  in a socrates  in an aristides  in a cato  it will  be thought abject  it will be viewed as despicable  it will be called  corrupt  in a claudius  in a sejanus  in a nero  its energies will be  admired  we shall be delighted with its manner  fascinated with  its efforts  in a shakespeare  in a corneille  in a newton  in a  montesquieu  its baseness will be lamented  when we behold mean   contemptible men  who flatter tyranny  or who servilely cringe at the  foot of superstition     all that has been said in the course of this work  proves clearly  that every thing is necessary  that every thing is always in order   relatively to nature  where all beings do nothing more than follow the  laws that are imposed on their respective classes  it is part of her  plan  that certain portions of the earth shall bring forth delicious  fruits  shall blossom beauteous flowers  whilst others shall only  furnish brambles  shall yield nothing but noxious vegetables  she has  been willing that some societies should produce wise men  great heroes   that others should only give birth to abject souls  contemptible  men  without energy  destitute of virtue  passions  winds  tempests   hurricanes  volcanoes  wars  plagues  famines  diseases  death  are as  necessary to her eternal march as the beneficent heat of the sun  the  serenity of the atmosphere  the gentle showers of spring  plentiful  years  peace  health  harmony  life  vice and virtue  darkness and  light  and science are equally necessary  the one are not benefits   the other are not evils  except for those beings whose happiness they  influence by either favouring or deranging their peculiar mode of  existence   the whole cannot be miserable  but it may contain unhappy  individuals      nature  then  distributes with the same hand that which is called   order   and that which is called  disorder   that which is called   pleasure   and that which is called  pain   in short  she diffuses by  the necessity of her existence  good and evil in the world we inhabit   let not man  therefore  either arraign her bounty  or tax her  with malice  let him not imagine that his feeble cries  his weak  supplications  can never arrest her colossal power  always acting after  immutable laws  let him submit silently to his condition  and when he  suffers  let him not seek a remedy by recurring to chimeras that his  own distempered imagination has created  let him draw from the stores  of nature herself  the remedies which she offers for the evil she brings  upon him  if she sends him diseases  let him search in her bosom for  those salutary productions to which she has given birth  which will cure  them  if she gives him errors  she also furnishes him with experience to  counteract them  in truth  she supplies him with an antidote suitable  to destroy their fatal effects  if she permits man to groan under the  pressure of his vices  beneath the load of his follies  she also shews  him in virtue  a sure remedy for his infirmities  if the evils that  some societies experience are necessary  when they shall have become  too incommodious they will be irresistibly obliged to search for those  remedies which nature will always point out to them  if this nature has  rendered existence insupportable  to some unfortunate beings  whom she  appears to have selected for her victims  still death  is a door  that will surely be opened to them  that will deliver them from their  misfortunes  although in their puny  imbecile  wayward judgment  they  may be deemed impossible of cure     let not man  then  accuse nature with being inexorable to him  since  there does not exist in her whole circle an evil for which she has not  furnished the remedy  to those who have the courage to seek it  who have  the fortitude to apply it  nature follows general and necessary laws  in all her operations  physical calamity and moral evil are not to  be ascribed to her want of kindness  but to the necessity of things   physical calamity is the derangement produced in man s organs by  physical causes which he sees act  moral evil is the derangement  produced in him by physical causes of which the action is to him a  secret  these causes always terminate by producing sensible effects   which are capable of striking his senses  neither the thoughts nor the  will of man ever shew themselves  but by the marked effects they  produce either in himself or upon those beings whom nature has rendered  susceptible of feeling their impulse  he suffers  because it is of the  essence of some beings to derange the economy of his machine  he enjoys   because the properties of some beings are analogous to his own mode of  existence  he is born  because it is of the nature of some matter to  combine itself under a determinate form  he lives  he acts  he thinks   because it is of the essence of certain combinations to maintain  themselves in existence by given means for a season  at length he dies   because a necessary law prescribes that all the combinations which are  formed  shall either be destroyed or dissolve themselves  from all this  it results  that nature is impartial to all its productions  she submits  man  like all other beings  to those eternal laws from which she has  not even exempted herself  if she was to suspend these laws  even for  an instant  from that moment disorder would reign in her  system  her  harmony would be disturbed     those who wish to study nature  must take experience for their guide   this  and this only  can enable them to dive into her secrets  to  unravel by degrees  the frequently imperceptible woof of those slender  causes  of which she avails herself to operate the greatest phenomena   by the aid of experience  man often discovers in her properties   perceives modes of action entirely unknown to the ages which have  preceded him  those effects which his grandfathers contemplated as  marvellous  which they regarded as supernatural efforts  looked upon  as miracles  have become familiar to him in the present day  and are at  this moment contemplated as simple and natural consequences  of which he  comprehends the mechanism  of which he understands the cause  of which  he can unfold the manner of action  man  in fathoming nature  has  arrived at discovering the true causes of earthquakes  of the periodical  motion of the sea  of subterraneous conflagrations  of meteors  of the  electrical fluid  the whole of which were considered by his ancestors   and are still so by the ignorant  by the uninformed  as indubitable  signs of heaven s wrath  his posterity  in following up  in rectifying  the experience already made  will perhaps go further  and discover those  causes which are totally veiled from present eyes  the united efforts of  the human species will one day perhaps penetrate even into the sanctuary  of nature  and throw into light many of those mysteries which up to the  present time she seems to have refused to all his researches     in contemplating man under his true aspect  in quitting authority  to follow experience  in laying aside error to consult reason  in  submitting every thing to physical laws  from which his imagination has  vainly exerted its utmost power to withdraw them  it will be found that  the phenomena of the moral world follow exactly the same general rules  as those of the physical  that the greater part of those astonishing  effects  which ignorance  aided by his prejudices  make him consider as  inexplicable  and regard as wonderful  are natural consequences flowing  from simple causes  he will find that the eruption of a volcano and the  birth of a tamerlane are to nature the same thing  in recurring to  the primitive causes of those striking events which he beholds with  consternation  which he contemplates with fearful alarm  in falling  back to the sources of those terrible revolutions  those frightful  convulsions  those dreadful explosions that distract mankind  lay waste  the fairest works of nature  ravage nations  and tear up society by  the roots  he will find the wills that compassed the most surprising  changes  that operated the most extensive alterations in the state of  things  that brought about the most unlooked for events  were moved  by physical causes  whose exility made him treat them as contemptible   whose want of consequence in his own purblind eyes led him to believe  them utterly incapable to give birth to the phenomena whose magnitude  strikes him with such awe  whose stupendous range fills him with such  amazement     if man was to judge of causes by their effects  there would be no small  causes in the universe  in a nature where every thing is connected   where every thing acts and re acts  moves and changes  composes and  decomposes  forms and destroys  there is not an atom which does not play  an important part  that does not occupy a necessary station  there  is not an imperceptible particle  however minute  which  placed in  convenient circumstances  does not operate the most prodigious effects   if man was in a capacity to follow the eternal chain  to pursue the  concatenated links  that connect with their causes all the effects he  witnesses  without losing sight of any one of its rings   if he could  unravel the ends of those insensible threads that give impulse to the  thoughts  decision to the will  direction to the passions of those men  who are called mighty  according to their actions  he would find  they  are true atoms which nature employs to move the moral world  that it is  the unexpected but necessary function of these indiscernible particles  of matter  it is their aggregation  their combination  their proportion   their fermentation  which modifying the individual by degrees  in  despite of himself  frequently without his own knowledge  make him  think  will  and act  in a determinate  but necessary mode  if  then   the will and the actions of this individual have an influence over a  great number of other men  here is the moral world in a state of the  greatest combustion  and those consequences ensue which man contemplates  with fearful wonder  too much acrimony in the bile of a fanatic  blood  too much inflamed in the heart of a conqueror  a painful indigestion in  the stomach of a monarch  a whim that passes in the mind of a woman  are  sometimes causes sufficient to bring on war  to send millions of men  to the slaughter  to root out an entire people  to overthrow walls  to  reduce cities into ashes  to plunge nations into slavery  to put a  whole people into mourning  to breed famine in a land  to engender  pestilence  to propagate calamity  to extend misery  to spread  desolation far and wide upon the surface of our globe  through a long  series of ages     the dominant passion of an individual of the human species  when it  disposes of the passions of many others  arrives at combining their  will  at uniting their efforts  and thus decides the condition of man   it is after this manner that an ambitious  crafty  and voluptuous  arab  gave to his countrymen an impulse of which the effect was the  subjugation and desolation of vast countries in asia  in africa  and in  europe  whose consequences were sufficiently potential to erect a new   extensive  but slavish empire  to give a novel system of religion to  millions of human beings  to overturn the altars of their former gods   in short  to alter the opinions  to change the customs of a considerable  portion of the population of the earth  but in examining the primitive  sources of this strange revolution  what were the concealed causes that  had an influence over this man  that excited his peculiar passions  and  modified his temperament  what was the matter from the combination of  which resulted a crafty  ambitious  enthusiastic  and eloquent man  in  short  a personage competent to impose on his fellow creatures  capable  of making them concur in his most extravagant views  they were   undoubtedly  the insensible particles of his blood  the imperceptible  texture of his fibres  the salts  more or less acrid  that stimulated  his nerves  the proportion of igneous fluid that circulated in his  system  from whence came these elements  it was from the womb of his  mother  from the aliments which nourished him  from the climate in which  he had his birth  from the ideas he received  from the air which  he respired  without reckoning a thousand inappreciable  a thousand  transitory causes  that in the instance given had modified  had  determined the passions of this importent being  who had thereby  acquired the capacity to change the face of this mundane sphere     to causes so weak in their principles  if in the origin the slightest  obstacle had been opposed  these wonderful events  which have astounded  man  would never have been produced  the fit of an ague  the consequence  of bile a little too much inflamed  had sufficed  perhaps  to have  rendered abortive all the vast projects  of the legislator of the  mussulmen  spare diet  a glass of water  a sanguinary evacuation  would  sometimes have been sufficient to have saved kingdoms     it will be seen  then  that the condition of the human species  as well  as that of each of its individuals  every instant depends on insensible  causes  to which circumstances  frequently fugitive  give birth  that  opportunity developes  that convenience puts in action  man attributes  their effects to chance  whilst these causes operate necessarily  act  according to fixed rules  he has frequently neither the sagacity nor  the honesty to recur to their true principles  he regards such feeble  motives with contempt  because he has been taught to consider them as  incapable of producing such stupendous events  they are  however  these  motives  weak as they may appear to be  these springs  so pitiful in his  eyes  is which according to her necessary laws  suffice in the hands of  nature to move the universe  the conquests of a gengis khan have nothing  in them that is more strange to the eye of a philosopher than the  explosion of a mine  caused in its principle by a feeble spark  which  commences with setting fire to a single grain of powder  this presently  communicates itself to many millions of other contiguous grains  of  which the united force  the multiplied powers  terminate by blowing  up mountains  overthrowing fortifications  or converting populous   well built cities  into heaps of ruins     thus  imperceptible causes  concealed in the bosom of nature  until the  moment their action is displayed  frequently decide the fate of man   the happiness or the wretchedness  the prosperity or the misery of each  individual  as well as that of whole nations  are attached to powers  which it is impossible for him to foresee  which he cannot appreciate   of which he is incapable to arrest the action  perhaps at this moment  atoms are amassing  insensible particles are combining  of which the  assemblage shall form a sovereign  who will be either the scourge or the  saviour of a mighty empire  man cannot answer for his own destiny one  single instant  he has no cognizance of what is passing within himself   he is ignorant of the causes which act in the interior of his machine   he knows nothing of the circumstances that will give them activity   he is unacquainted with what may develope their energy  it is   nevertheless  on these causes  impossible to be unravelled by him  that  depends his condition in life  frequently  an unforeseen rencontre  gives birth to a passion in his soul  of which the consequences shall   necessarily  have an influence over his felicity  it is thus that  the most virtuous man  by a whimsical combination of unlooked for  circumstances  may become in an instant the most criminal of his  species     this truth  without doubt  will be found frightful  this fact will  unquestionably appear terrible  but at bottom  what has it more  revolting than that which teaches him that an infinity of accidents  as  irremediable as they are unforeseen  may every instant wrest from him  that life to which he is so strongly attached  fatalism reconciles the  good man easily to death  it makes him contemplate it as a certain means  of withdrawing himself from wickedness  this system shews death  even  to the happy man himself  as a medium between him and those misfortunes  which frequently terminate by poisoning his happiness  that end with  embittering the most fortunate existence     let man  then  submit to necessity  in despite of himself it will always  hurry him forward  let him resign himself to nature  let him accept the  good with which she presents him  let him oppose to the necessary evil  which she makes him experience  those necessary remedies which she  consents to afford him  let him not disturb his mind with useless  inquietude  let him enjoy with moderation  because he will find that  pain is the necessary companion of excess  let him follow the paths of  virtue  because every thing will prove to him  even in this world of  perverseness  that it is absolutely necessary to render him estimable in  the eyes of others  to make him contented with himself     feeble  vain mortal  thou pretendest to be a free agent  alas  dost thou  not see all the threads which enchain thee  dost thou not perceive that  they are atoms which form thee  that they are atoms which move thee   that they are circumstances independent of thyself  that modify  thy being  that they are circumstances over which thou hast not any  controul  that rule thy destiny  in the puissant nature that environs  thee  shalt thou pretend to be the only being who is able to resist her  power  dost thou really believe that thy weak prayers will induce her  to stop in her eternal march  that thy sickly desires can oblige her to  change her everlasting course             chap  xiii      of the immortality of the soul   of the doctrine of a future state   of  the fear of death        the reflections presented to the reader in this work  tend to shew what  ought to be thought of the human soul  as well as of its operations and  faculties  every thing proves  in the most convincing manner  that it  acts  that it moves according to laws similar to those prescribed to the  other beings of nature  that it cannot be distinguished from the body   that it is born with it  that it grows up with it  that it is modified  in the same progression  in short  every thing ought to make man  conclude that it perishes with it  this soul  as well as the body   passes through a state of weakness and infancy  it is in this stage of  its existence  that it is assailed by a multitude of modifications  that  it is stored with an infinity of ideas  which it receives from exterior  objects through the medium of the organs  that it amasses facts  that  it collects experience  whether true or false  that it forms to itself  a system of conduct  according to which it thinks  in conformity with  which it acts  from whence results either its happiness or its misery   its reason or its delirium  its virtues or its vices  arrived with the  body at its full powers  having in conjunction with it reached maturity   it does not cease for a single instant to partake in common of its  sensations  whether these are agreeable or disagreeable  it participates  in all its pleasures  it shares in all its pains  in consequence it  conjointly approves or disapproves its state  like it  it is either  sound or diseased  active or languishing  awake or asleep  in old age  man extinguishes entirely  his fibres become rigid  his nerves loose  their elasticity  his senses are obtunded  his sight grows dim  his ears  lose their quickness  his ideas become unconnected  his memory fails   his imagination cools  what then becomes of his soul  alas  it sinks  down with the body  it gets benumbed as this loses its feeling  becomes  sluggish as this decays in activity  like it  when enfeebled by years  it fulfils its functions with pain  this substance  which is deemed  spiritual  which is considered immaterial  which it is endeavoured to  distinguish from matter  undergoes the same revolutions  experiences the  same vicissitudes  submits to the same modifications  as does the body  itself     in despite of this proof of the materiality of the soul  of its identity  with the body  so convincing to the unprejudiced  some thinkers have  supposed  that although the latter is perishable  the former does  not perish  that this portion of man enjoys the especial privilege  of  immortality   that it is exempt from dissolution  free from those  changes of form all the beings in nature undergo  in consequence of  this  man has persuaded himself  that this privileged soul does not die   its immortality  above all  appears indubitable to those who suppose it  spiritual  after having made it a simple being  without extent  devoid  of parts  totally different from any thing of which he has a knowledge   he pretended that it was not subjected to the laws of decomposition  common to all beings  of which experience shews him the continual  operation     man  feeling within himself a concealed force  that insensibly produced  action  that imperceptibly gave direction to the motion of his machine   believed that the entire of nature  of whose energies he is ignorant   with whose modes of acting he is unacquainted  owed its motion to an  agent analogous to his own soul  who acted upon the great macrocosm  in  the same manner that this soul acted upon his body  man  having supposed  himself double  made nature double also  he distinguished her from her  own peculiar energy  he separated her from her mover  which by degrees  he made spiritual  thus nature  distinguished from herself  was regarded  as the soul of the world  and the soul of man was considered as opinions  emanating from this universal soul  this notion upon the origin of the  soul is of very remote antiquity  it was that of the egyptians  of the  chaldeans  of the hebrews  of the greater number of the  wise men of  the east   it should appear that moses believed with the egyptians the  divine emanation of souls  according to him    god formed man of the  dust of the ground  and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life   and man became a living soul    nevertheless  the catholic  at this day   rejects this system of  divine emanation   seeing that it supposes the  divinity divisible  which would have  been inconvenient to the romish  idea of purgatory  or to the system of everlasting punishment  although  moses  in the above quotation  seems to indicate that the soul was a  portion of the divinity  it does not appear that the doctrine of the   immortality of the soul  was established in any one of the books  attributed to him  it was during the babylonish captivity  that the  jews learned the doctrine of future rewards and punishments  taught  by zoroaster to the persians  but which the hebrew legislator did not  understand  or  at least  he left his people ignorant on the subject  it  was in those schools  that pherecydes  pythagoras  and plato  drew up a  doctrine so flattering to the vanity of human nature  so gratifying to  the imagination of mortals  man thus believed himself a portion of  the divinity  immortal  like the godhead  in one part of himself   nevertheless  subsequent religions have renounced these advantages   which they judged incompatible with the other parts of their systems   they held forth that the sovereign of nature  or her contriver was not  the soul of man  but  that  in virtue of his omnipotence  he created  human souls  in proportion as he produced the bodies which they must  animate  and they taught  that these souls once produced  by an effect  of the same omnipotence  enjoyed immortality     however it may be with these variations upon the origin of souls  those  who supposed them emanating from the divinity  believed that after the  death of the body  which served them for an envelope  they returned  by  refunding to their first source  those who  without adopting the opinion  of divine emanation  admired the spirituality  believed the immortality  of the soul  were under the necessity to suppose a region  to find out  an abode for these souls  which their imagination painted to them  each  according to his fears  his hopes  his desires  and his prejudices     nothing is more popular than the doctrine of the  immortality of the  soul   nothing is more universally diffused than the expectation of  another life  nature having inspired man with the most ardent love for  his existence  the desire of preserving himself for ever was a necessary  consequence  this desire was presently converted into certainty  from  that desire of existing eternally which nature has implanted in him  he  made an argument  to prove that man would never cease to exist  abady  says   our soul has no useless desires  it naturally desires an eternal  life   and by a very strange logic  he concludes that this desire  could not fail to be fulfilled  cicero  before abady  had declared the  immortality of the soul to be an innate idea in man  yet  strange  to tell  in another part of his works he considers pherecydes as the  inventor of the doctrine  however this may be  man  thus disposed   listened with avidity to those who announced to him systems so  conformable to his wishes  nevertheless  he ought not to regard as  supernatural the desire of existing  which always was  and always will  be  of the essence man  it ought not to excite surprise  if he received  with eagerness an hypothesis that flattered his hopes  by promising  that his desire would one day be gratified  but let him beware how he  concludes that this desire itself is an indubitable proof of the reality  of this future life  with which at present he seems to be so much  occupied  the passion for existence is in man only a natural consequence  of the tendency of a sensible being  whose essence it is to be willing  to conserve himself  in the human being it follows the energy of his  soul  keeps pace with the force of his imagination  always ready to  realize that which he strongly desires  he desires the life of the body   nevertheless this desire is frustrated  wherefore should not the desire  for the life of the soul be frustrated like the other  the partizans of  the doctrine of the immortality of the soul reason thus   all men  desire to live for ever  therefore they will live for ever   suppose  the argument retorted on them  would it be believed  if it was asserted    all men naturally desire to be rich  therefore all men will one day be  rich   how many partizans would this doctrine find     the most simple reflection upon the nature of his soul  ought to  convince man that the idea of its immortality is only an illusion of the  brain  indeed what is his soul  save the principle of sensibility  what  is it  to think  to enjoy  to suffer  is it not to feel  what is life   except it be the assemblage of modifications  the congregation of  motion  peculiar to an organized being  thus  as soon as the body  ceases to live  its sensibility can no longer exercise itself  when its  sensibility is no more  it can no longer have ideas  nor in consequence  thoughts  ideas  as we have proved  can only reach man through his  senses  now  how will they have it  that once deprived of his senses   he is yet capable of receiving sensations  of having perceptions  of  forming ideas  as they have made the soul of man a being separated  from the animated body  wherefore have they not made life a being  distinguished from the living body  life in a body is the totality of  this motion  feeling and thought make a part of this motion  thus it is  reasonable to suppose  that in the dead man these motions will cease   like all the others     indeed  by what reasoning will it be proved  that this soul  which  cannot feel  think  will  or act  but by aid of man s organs  can suffer  pain  be susceptible of pleasure  or even have a consciousness of its  own existence  when the organs which should warn it of their presence  are decomposed or destroyed  is it not evident  that the soul depends  on the arrangement of the various parts of the body  on the order with  which these parts conspire to perform their functions  on the combined  motion of the whole  thus the organic structure once destroyed  can it  be reasonably doubted the soul will be destroyed also  is it not seen   that during the whole course of human life this soul is stimulated   changed  deranged  disturbed  by all the changes man s organs  experience  and yet it will be insisted  that this soul acts  thinks   subsists  when these same organs have entirely disappeared     an organized being may be compared to a clock  which once broken  is no  longer suitable to the use for which it was designed  to say  that the  soul shall feel  shall think  shall enjoy  shall suffer after the  death of the body  is to pretend that a clock  shivered into a thousand  pieces  will continue to strike the hour  shall yet have the faculty  of marking the progress of time  those who say  that the soul of man is  able to subsist  notwithstanding the destruction of the body  evidently  support the position  that the modification of a body will be enabled  to conserve itself after the subject is destroyed  this on any other  occasion would be considered as completely absurd     it will be said that the conservation of the soul after the death of the  body  is an effect of the divine omnipotence  but this is supporting an  absurdity by a gratuitous hypothesis  it surely is not meant by divine  omnipotence  of whatever nature it may be supposed  that a thing shall  exist and not exist at the same time  unless this be granted  it will be  rather difficult to prove  that a soul shall feel and think without the  intermediates necessary to thought     let them then  at least  forbear asserting  that reason is not wounded  by the doctrine of the immortality of the soul  or by the expectation  of a future life  these notions  formed to flatter man  to disturb the  imagination of the uninformed  who do not reason  cannot appear either  convincing or probable to enlightened minds  reason  exempted from the  illusions of prejudice  is  without doubt  wounded by the supposition of  a soul  that feels  that thinks  that is afflicted  that rejoices  that  has ideas  without having organs  that is to say  destitute of the only  known medium  wanting all the natural means  by which  according to  what we can understand  it is possible for it to feel sensations  have  perceptions  or form ideas  if it be replied  other means are able to  exist  which are  supernatural  or  unknown   it may be answered  that  these means of transmitting ideas to the soul  separated from the body   are not better known to  or more within the reach of  those who suppose  it  that they are of other men  it is  at least  very certain  it cannot  admit even of a controversy  that all those who reject the system of  innate ideas  cannot  without contradicting their own principles  admit  the doctrine of the immortality of the soul     in defiance of the consolation that so many persons pretend to find in  the notion of an eternal existence  in despite of that firm persuasion  which such numbers of men assure us they have  that their souls will  survive their bodies  they seem so very much alarmed at the dissolution  of this body  that they do not contemplate their end  which they ought  to desire as the period of so many miseries  but with the greatest  inquietude  so true it is  that the real  the present  even accompanied  with pain  has much more influence over mankind  than the most beautiful  chimeras of the future  which he never views but through the clouds  of uncertainty  indeed the most religious men  notwithstanding the  conviction they express of a blessed eternity  do not find these  flattering hopes sufficiently consoling to repress their fears  to  prevent their trembling  when they think on the necessary dissolution of  their bodies  death was always  for mortals  the most frightful point of  view  they regard it as a strange phenomenon  contrary to the order  of things  opposed to nature  in a word  as an effect of the celestial  vengeance  as the  wages of sin   although every thing proves to man  that death is inevitable  he is never able to familiarize himself with  its idea  he never thinks on it without shuddering  the assurance of  possessing an immortal soul but feebly indemnifies him for the grief he  feels in the deprivation of his perishable body  two causes contribute  to strengthen his fears  to nourish his alarm  the one is  that this  death  commonly accompanied with pain  wrests from him an existence that  pleases him  with which he is acquainted  to which he is accustomed   the other is the uncertainty of the state that must succeed his actual  existence     the illustrious bacon has said  that  men fear death for the same reason  that children dread being alone in darkness   man naturally challenges  every thing with which he is unacquainted  he is desirous to see clearly  to the end  that he may guarantee himself against those objects which  may menace his safety  that he may also be enabled to procure for  himself those which may be useful to him  the man who exists cannot form  to himself any idea of non existence  as this circumstance disturbs him   for want of experience  his imagination sets to work  this points out to  him  either well or ill  this uncertain state  accustomed to think  to  feel  to be stimulated into activity  to enjoy society  he contemplates  as the greatest misfortune  a dissolution that will strip him of these  objects  that will deprive him of those sensations which his present  nature has rendered necessary to him  he views with dismay a situation  that will prevent his being warned of his own existence  that shall  bereave him of his pleasures  to plunge him into nothing  in supposing  it even exempt from pain  he always looks upon this nothing as an  afflicting solitude  as an heap of profound darkness  he sees himself in  a state of general desolation  destitute of all assistance  and he  feels keenly all the rigour of this frightful situation  but does not  a profound sleep help to give him a true idea of this nothing  does not  that deprive him of every thing  does it not appear to annihilate the  universe to him  and him to the universe  is death any thing more than  a profound  a permanent steep  it is for want of being able to form an  idea of death that man dreads it  if he could figure to himself a true  image of this state of annihilation  he would from thence cease to fear  it  but he is not able to conceive a state in which there is no feeling   he therefore believes  that when he shall no longer exist  he will have  the same feelings  the same consciousness of things  which  during his  existence  appear so sad to his mind  which his fancy paints in such  gloomy colours  imagination pictures to him his funeral pomp  the grave  they are digging for him  the lamentations that will accompany him to  his last abode the epicedium that surviving friendship may dictate   he persuades himself that these melancholy objects will affect him as  painfully even after his decease  as they do in his present condition   in which he is in full possession of his senses     mortal  led astray by fear  after thy death thine eyes will see no more   thine ears will hear no longer  in the depth of thy grave thou wilt  no more be witness to this scene  which thine imagination  at present   represents to thee under such dismal colours  thou wilt no longer take  part in what shall be done in the world  thou wilt no more be occupied  with what may befal thine inanimate remains  than thou wast able to  be the day previous to that which ranked thee among the beings of thy  species  to die is to cease to think  to lack feeling  no longer to  enjoy  to find a period to suffering  thine ideas will perish with thee   thy sorrows will not follow thee to the silent tomb  think of death   not to feed thy fears  not to nourish thy melancholy  but to accustom  thyself to look upon it with a peaceable eye  to cheer thee up against  those false terrors with which the enemies to thy repose labour to  inspire thee  the fears of death are vain illusions  that must disappear  as soon as we learn to contemplate this necessary event under its true  point of view  a great man has defined philosophy to be  a meditation on  death   he is not desirous by that to have it understood that man ought  to occupy himself sorrowfully with his end  with a view to nourish his  fears  on the contrary  he wishes to invite him to familiarize himself  with an object that nature has rendered necessary to him  to accustom  himself to expect it with a serene countenance  if life is a benefit  if  it be necessary to love it  it is no less necessary to quit it  reason  ought to teach him a calm resignation to the decrees of fate  his  welfare exacts that he should contract the habit of contemplating with  placidity  of viewing without alarm  an event that his essence has  rendered inevitable  his interest demands that he should not brood  gloomily over his misfortune  that he should not  by continual dread   embitter his life  the charms of which he must inevitably destroy  if  he can never view its termination but with trepidation  reason and his  interest then  concur to assure him against those vague terrors with  which his imagination inspires him  in this respect  if he was to call  them to his assistance  they would reconcile him to an object that only  startles him  because he has no knowledge of it  because it is only  shewn to him with those hideous accompaniments with which it is clothed  by superstition  let him then  endeavour to despoil death of these vain  illusions  and he will perceive that it is only the sleep of life   that this sleep will not be disturbed with disagreeable dreams  that an  unpleasant awakening is never likely to follow it  to die is to sleep   it is to enter into that state of insensibility in which he was previous  to his birth  before he had senses  before he was conscious of his  actual existence  laws  as necessary as those which gave him birth  will  make him return into the bosom of nature  from whence he was drawn  in  order to reproduce him afterwards under some new form  which it would be  useless for him to know  without consulting him  nature places him for  a season in the order of organized beings  without his consent  she will  oblige him to quit it  to occupy some other order     let him not complain then  that nature is callous  she only makes him  undergo a law from which she does not exempt any one being she contains   man complains of the short duration of life  of the rapidity with which  time flies away  yet the greater number of men do not know how to employ  either time or life  if all are born and perish  if every thing is  changed and destroyed  if the birth of a being is never more than the  first step towards its end  how is it possible to expect that man  whose  machine is so frail  of which the parts are so complicated  the whole  of which possesses such extreme mobility  should be exempted from the  common law  which decrees  that even the solid earth he inhabits shall  experience change  shall undergo alteration  perhaps be destroyed   feeble  frail mortal  thou pretendest to exist for ever  whit thou   then  that for thee alone eternal nature shall change her undeviating  course  dost thou not behold in those eccentric comets with which thine  eyes are sometimes astonished  that the planets themselves are subject  to death  live then in peace for the season that nature permits thee  if  thy mind be enlightened by reason thou wilt die without terror     notwithstanding the simplicity of these reflections  nothing is more  rare than the sight of men truly fortified against the fears of death   the wise man himself turns pale at its approach  he has occasion to  collect the whole force of his mind  to expect it with serenity  it  cannot then  furnish matter for surprise  if the idea of death is so  revolting to the generality of mortals  it terrifies the young  it  redoubles the chagrin of the middle aged  it even augments the sorrow  of the old  who are worn down with infirmity  indeed the aged  although  enfeebled by time  dread it much more than the young  who are in the  full vigour of life  the man of many lustres is more accustomed to live  years as they roll over his head  confirm his attachment to existence   nevertheless  long unwearied exertions weaken the powers of his mind   labour  sickness  and pain  waste his animal strength  he has less  energy  his volition becomes faint  superstitious terrors easily  appal him  at length disease consumes him  sometimes with excruciating  tortures  the unhappy wretch  thus plunged into misfortune  has   notwithstanding  scarcely ever dared to contemplate death  which he  ought to consider as the period to all his anguish     if the source of this pusillanimity be sought  it will be found in his  nature  which attaches him to life  in that deficiency of energy in his  soul  which hardly any thing tends to corroborate  but which every  thing strives to enfeeble  which superstition  instead of strengthening   contributes to bruise  almost all human institutions  nearly all the  opinions of man  conspire to augment his fears  to render his ideas  of death more terrible  to make them more revolting to his feelings   indeed  superstition pleases itself with exhibiting death under the  most frightful traits  it represents it to man under the most disgusting  colours  as a dreadful moment  which not only puts an end to his  pleasures  but gives him up without defence to the strange rigour of  a pitiless decree  which nothing can soften  according to this  superstition  the most virtuous man has reason to tremble for the  severity of his fate  is never certain of being happy  the most dreadful  torments  endless punishments  await the victim to involuntary weakness   to the necessary faults of a short lived existence  his infirmities   his momentary offences  the propensities that have been planted in his  heart  the errors of his mind  the opinions he has imbibed  even in the  society in which he was born without his own consent  the ideas he has  formed  the passions he has indulged above all  his not being able to  comprehend all the extravagant dogmas offered to his acceptance  are to  be implacably avenged with the most severe and never ending penalties   ixion is for ever fastened to his wheel  sisyphus must to all eternity  roll his stone without ever being able to reach the apex of his  mountain  the vulture must perpetually prey on the liver of the  unfortunate prometheus  those who dare to think for themselves  those  who have refused to listen to their enthusiastic guides  those who have  not reverenced the oracles  those who have had the audacity to consult  their reason  those who have boldly ventured to detect impostors  those  who have doubted the divine mission of the phythonissa  those who  believe that jupiter violated decency in his visit to danae  those who  look upon apollo as no better than a strolling musician  those who think  that mahomet was an arch knave  are to smart everlastingly in flaming  oceans of burning sulpher  are to float to all eternity in the most  excruciating agonies on seas of liquid brimstone  wailing and gnashing  their teeth  what wonder  then  if man dreads to be cast into these  hideous gulfs  if his mind loathes the horrific picture  if he wishes  to defer for a season these dreadful punishments  if he clings to an  existence  painful as it may be  rather than encounter such revolting  cruelties     such  then  are the afflicting objects with which superstition occupies  its unhappy  its credulous disciples  such are the fears which the  tyrant of human thoughts points out to them as salutary  in defiance of  the exility of the effect which these notions produce oil the greater  number  even of those who say they are  or who believe themselves  persuaded  they are held forth as the most powerful rampart that can  be opposed to the irregularities of man  nevertheless  as will be  seen presently  it will be found that these systems  or rather these  chimeras  so terrible to behold  operate little or nothing on the larger  portion of mankind  who dream of them but seldom  never in the moment  that passion  interest  pleasure  or example  hurries them along  if  these fears act  it is commonly on those  who have but little occasion  to abstain from evil  they make honest hearts tremble  but fail of  effect on the perverse  they torment sensible souls  but leave those  that are hardened in repose  they disturb tractable  gentle minds  but  cause no trouble to rebellious spirits  thus they alarm none but those  who are already sufficiently alarmed  they coerce only those who are  already restrained     these notions  then  impress nothing on the wicked  when by accident  they do act on them  it is only to redouble the wickedness of their  natural character  to justify them in their own eyes  to furnish them  with pretexts to exercise it without fear  to follow it without scruple   indeed  the experience of a great number of ages has shewn to what  excess of wickedness  to what lengths  the passions of man have carried  him  when they have been authorized by the priesthood  when they have  been unchained by superstition  or  at least  when he has been enabled  to cover himself with its mantle  man has never been more ambitious   never more covetous  never more crafty  never more cruel  never  more seditious  than when he has persuaded himself that superstition  permitted or commanded him to be so  thus  superstition did nothing more  than lend an invincible force to his natural passions  which under  its sacred auspices he could exercise with impunity  indulge without  remorse  still more  the greatest villains  in giving free vent to the  detestable propensities of their natural wickedness  have under its  influence believed  that  by displaying an over heated zeal  they  merited well of heaven  that they exempted themselves by new crimes   from that chastisement which they thought their anterior conduct had  richly merited     these  then  are the effects which what are called the  salutary   notions of superstition  produce on mortals  these reflections will  furnish an answer to those who say that   if heaven was promised equally  to the wicked as to the righteous  there would be found none incredulous  of another life   we reply  that  in point of fact  superstition does  accord heaven to the wicked  since it frequently places in this happy  abode the most useless  the most depraved of men  is not mahomet himself  enthroned in the empyrean by this superstition  if the calendar of  the romish saints was examined  would it be found to contain none but  righteous  none but good men  does not mahometanism cut off from all  chance of future existence  consequently from all hope of reaching  heaven  the female part of mankind  have the jews exalted no one to the  celestial regions  save the virtuous  when the jew is condemned to the  devouring flames  do not the men who thus torture an unhappy wretch   whose only crime is adherence to the religion of his forefathers  expect  to be rewarded for the deed with everlasting happiness  are they not  promised eternal salvation for their orthodoxy  was constantine  was st   cyril  was st  athanasius  was st  dominic  worthy beatification  were  jupiter  thor  mercury  woden  and a thousand others  deserving of  celestial diadems  is erring  feeble man  with all his imbecilities   competent to form a judgment of the heavenly deserts of his fellows   can be  with his dim optics  with his limited vision  fathom the human  heart  can he sound its depths  trace its meanderings  dive into its  recesses  with sufficient precision  to determine who amongst his  race is or is not possessed of the requisite merit to enjoy a blessed  eternity  thus wicked men are held up as models by superstition   which as we shall see  sharpens the passions of evil disposed men  by  legitimating those crimes  at which  without this sanction  they would  shudder  which they would fear to commit  or for which  at least  they  would feel shame  for which they would experience remorse  in short  the  ministers of superstition furnish to the most profligate men the power  of indulging their inflamed passions  and then hold forth to them means  of diverting from their own heads the thunderbolt that should strike  their crimes  by spreading before them fresh incentives to intolerant  persecution  with the promise of a never fading happiness     with respect to the incredulous  without doubt  there may be amongst  them wicked men  as well as amongst the most credulous  but incredulity  no more supposes wickedness  than credulity supposes righteousness  on  the contrary  the man who thinks  who meditates  knows far better the  true motives to goodness  than he who suffers himself to be blindly  guided by uncertain motives  or by the interest of others  sensible men  have the greatest advantage in examining opinions  which it is pretended  must have an influence over their eternal happiness  if these are found  false  if they appear injurious to their present life  they will not  therefore conclude  that they have not another life either to fear or to  hope  that they are permitted to deliver themselves up with impunity to  vice  which would do an injury to themselves  that would draw upon them  the contempt of their neighbour  which would subject them to the anger  of society  the man who does not expect another life  is only more  interested in prolonging his existence in this  in rendering himself  dear to his fellows  by cultivating virtue  by performing all his duties  with more strictness  in the only life of which he has any knowledge   he has made a great stride towards felicity  in disengaging himself  from those terrors which afflict others  which frequently prevent their  acting  such a man has nothing to fear  but every thing to hope  if   contrary to what he is able to judge  there should be an hereafter  existence  will not his actions have been so regulated by virtue  will  he not have so comported himself in his present existence  as to stand  a fair chance of enjoying in their fullest extent those felicities  prepared for his species      superstition   in fact  takes a pride in rendering man slothful   in moulding him to credulity  in making him pusillanimous  it is its  principle to afflict him without intermission  to redouble in him the  horrors of death  ever ingenious in tormenting him  it has extended  his inquietudes beyond even his own existence  its ministers  the more  securely to dispose of him in this world  invented  in future regions   a variety of rewards and punishments  reserving to themselves the  privilege of awarding these heavenly recompences to those who yielded  most implicitly to their arbitrary laws  of decreeing punishment  to those refractory beings who rebelled against their power  thus   according to them  tantalus for divulging their secrets  must eternally  fear  engulphed in burning sulphur  the stone ready to fall on his  devoted head  whilst romulus was beatified and worshipped as a god  under the name of quirinus  the same system of superstition caused the  philosopher callisthenes to be put to death  for opposing the worship of  alexander  and elevated the monk athanasius to be a saint in heaven  far  from holding forth consolation to mortals  far from cultivating man s  reason  far from teaching him to yield under the hands of necessity   superstition  in a great many countries  strives to render death still  more bitter to him  to make its yoke sit heavy  to fill up its retinue  with a multitude of hideous phantoms  to paint it in the most frightful  colours  to render its approach terrible  by this means it has crowded  the world with enthusiasts  whom it seduces by vague promises  with  contemptible slaves  whom it coerces with the fear of imaginary evils   it has at length persuaded man  that his actual existence is only  a journey  by which he will arrive at a more important life  this  doctrine  whether it be rational or irrational  prevents him from  occupying himself with his true happiness  from even dreaming of  ameliorating his institutions  of improving his laws  of advancing the  progress of science  of perfectioning his morals  vain and gloomy  ideas have absorbed his attention  he consents to groan under fanatical  tyranny  to writhe under political inflictions  to live in error  to  languish in misfortune  in the hope  when he shall be no more  of being  one day happier  in the firm confidence  that after he has disappeared   his calamities  his patience  will conduct him to a never ending  felicity  he has believed himself submitted to cruel priests  who are  willing to make him purchase his future welfare at the expence of every  thing most dear to his peace  most valuable to his existence here below   they have pictured heaven as irritated against him  as disposed to  appease itself by punishing him eternally  for any efforts he should  make to withdraw himself from  their power  it is thus the doctrine of  a future life has been made fatal to the human species  it plunged whole  nations into sloth  made them languid  filled them with indifference to  their present welfare  or else precipitated them  into the most furious  enthusiasm  which hurried them on to such lengths that they tore each  other in pieces in order to merit the promised heaven     it will be asked  perhaps  by what road has man been conducted to form  to himself these gratuitous ideas of another world  i reply  that it is  a truth man has no idea of a future life  they are the ideas of the past  and the present that furnish his imagination with the materials of which  he constructs the edifice of the regions of futurity  hobbes says   we  believe that  that which is will always be  and that the same causes  will have the same effects   man in his actual state  has two modes  of feeling  one that he approves  another that he disapproves  thus   persuaded that these two modes of feeling must accompany him  even  beyond his present existence  he placed in the regions of eternity two  distinguished abodes  one destined to felicity  the other to misery  the  one must contain those who obey the calls of superstition  who believe  in its dogmas  the other is a prison  destined to avenge the cause of  heaven  on all those who shall not faithfully believe the doctrines  promulgated by the ministers of a vast variety of superstitions  has  sufficient attention been paid to the fact that results as a necessary  consequence from this reasoning  which on examination will be found  to have rendered the first place entirely useless  seeing  that by the  number and contradiction of these various systems  let man believe which  ever he may  let him follow it in the most faithful manner  still he  must be ranked as an infidel  as a rebel to the divinity  because  he cannot believe in all  and those from which he dissents  by a  consequence of their own creed  condemn him to the prison house     such is the origin of the ideas upon a future life  so diffused among  mankind  every where may be seen an elysium and a tartarus  a paradise  and a hell  in a word  two distinguished abodes  constructed according  to the imagination of the enthusiasts who have invented them  who have  accommodated them to their own peculiar prejudices  to the hopes  to the  fears  of the people who believe in them  the indian figures the first  of these abodes as one of in action  of permanent repose  because  being  the inhabitant of a hot climate  he has learned to contemplate rest  as the extreme of felicity  the mussulman promises himself corporeal  pleasures  similar to those that actually constitute the object of his  research in this life  each figures to himself  that on which he has  learned to set the greatest value     of whatever nature these pleasures may be  man apprehended that a  body was needful  in order that his soul might be enabled to enjoy the  pleasures  or to experience the pains in reserve for him  from hence the  doctrine of the  resurrection   but as he beheld this body putrify  as  he saw it dissolve  as he witnessed its decomposition  after death  he  was at a loss how to form anew what he conceived so necessary to his  system he therefore had recourse to the divine omnipotence  by whose  interposition he now believes it will be effected  this opinion  so  incomprehensible  is said to have originated in persia  among the magi   and finds a great number of adherents  who have never given it a serious  examination  but the doctrine of the resurrection appears perfectly  useless to all those  who believe in the existence of a soul that feels   thinks  suffers  and enjoys  after a separation from the body  indeed   there are already sects who begin to maintain  that the body is not  necessary  that therefore it will not be resurrected  like berkeley   they conceive that  the soul has need neither of body nor any exterior  being  either to experience sensations  or to have ideas   the  malebranchists  in particular  must suppose that the rejected souls  will see every thing in the divinity  will feel themselves burn  without  having occasion for bodies for that purpose  others  incapable of  elevating themselves to these sublime notions  believed  that under  divers forms  man animated successively different animals of various  species  that he never ceased to be an inhabitant of the earth  such was  the opinion of those who adopted the doctrine of metempsychosis     as for the miserable abode of souls  the imagination of fanatics  who  were desirous of governing the people  strove to assemble the most  frightful images  to render it still more terrible  fire is of all  beings that which produces in man the most pungent sensation  not  finding any thing more cruel  the enemies to the several dogmas were to  be everlastingly punished with this torturing element  fire  therefore   was the point at which their imagination was obliged to stop  the  ministers of the various systems agreed pretty generally  that fire  would one day avenge their offended divinities  thus they painted the  victims to the anger of the gods  or rather those who questioned their  own creeds  as confined in fiery dungeons  as perpetually rolling in a  vortex of bituminous flames  as plunged in unfathomable gulphs of  liquid sulphur  making the infernal caverns resound with their useless  groanings  with their unavailing gnashing of teeth     but it will  perhaps  be enquired  how could man reconcile himself to  the belief of an existence accompanied with eternal torments  above all   as many according to their own superstitions had reason to fear it for  themselves  many causes have concurred to make him adopt so revolting  an opinion  in the first place  very few thinking men have ever believed  such an absurdity  when they have deigned to make use of their reason   or  when they have accredited it  this notion was always counterbalanced  by the idea of the goodness  by a reliance on the mercy  which they  attributed to their respective divinities  in the second place  those  who were blinded by their fears  never rendered to themselves any  account of these strange doctrines  which they either received with  awe from their legislators  or which were transmitted to them by their  fathers  in the third place  each sees the object of his terrors only at  a favourable distance  moreover  superstition promises him the means of  escaping the tortures he believes he has merited  at length  like those  sick people whom we see cling with fondness  even to the most painful  life  man preferred the idea of an unhappy  though unknown existence  to  that of non existence  which he looked upon as the most frightful evil  that could befal him  either because he could form no idea of it  or  because his imagination painted to him this non existence this nothing   as the confused assemblage of all evils  a known evil  of whatever  magnitude  alarmed him less  above all  when there remained the hope  of being able to avoid it   than an evil of which he knew nothing  upon  which  consequently  his imagination was painfully employed  but to  which he knew not how to oppose a remedy     it will be seen  then  that  superstition   far from consoling man upon  the necessity of death  only redoubles his terrors  by the evils with  which it pretends his decease will be followed  these terrors are  so strong  that the miserable wretches who believe strictly in these  formidable doctrines  pass their days in affliction  bathed in the  most bitter tears  what shall be said of an opinion so destructive to  society  yet adopted by so many nations  which announces to them  that  a severe fate may at each instant take them unprovided  that at each  moment they are liable to pass under the most rigorous judgment  what  idea can be better suited to terrify man  what more likely to discourage  him  what more calculated to damp the desire of ameliorating his  condition  than the afflicting prospect of a world always on the brink  of dissolution  of a divinity seated upon the ruins of nature  ready to  pass judgment on the human species  such are  nevertheless  the fatal  opinions with which the mind of nations has been fed for thousands of  years  they are so dangerous  that if by a happy want of just inference   he did not derogate in his conduct from these afflicting ideas  he would  fall into the most abject stupidity  how could man occupy himself with a  perishable world  ready every moment to crumble into atoms  how dream  of rendering himself happy on earth  when it is only the porch to an  eternal kingdom  is it then  surprising  that the superstitions to which  similar doctrines serve for a basis  have prescribed to their disciples  a total detachment from things below  an entire renunciation of the  most innocent pleasures  have given birth to a sluggishness  to a  pusillanimity  to an abjection of soul  to an insociability  that  renders him useless to himself  dangerous to others  if necessity  did not oblige man to depart in his practice from these irrational  systems  if his wants did not bring him back to reason  in despite of  these superstitious doctrines  the whole world would presently become a  vast desert  inhabited by some few isolated savages  who would not even  have courage to multiply themselves  what are these  but notions which  he must necessarily put aside  in order that human association may  subsist     nevertheless  the doctrine of a future life  accompanied with rewards  and punishments  has been regarded for a great number of ages as the  most powerful  or even as the only motive capable of coercing the  passions of man  as the sole means that can oblige him to be virtuous   by degrees  this doctrine has become the basis of almost all religions  and political systems  so much so  that at this day it is said  this  prejudice cannot be attacked without absolutely rending asunder the  bonds of society  the founders of superstition have made use of it to  attach their credulous disciples  legislators have looked upon it as  the curb best calculated to keep mankind under discipline  religion  considers it necessary to his happiness  many philosophers themselves  have believed with sincerity  that this doctrine was requisite  to terrify man  was the only means to divert him from crime   notwithstanding  when the doctrine of the immortality of the soul first  came out of the school of plato  when it first diffused itself among  the greeks  it caused the greatest ravages  it determined a multitude  of men  who were discontented with their condition  to terminate their  existence  ptolemy philadelphus  king of egypt  seeing the effect  this doctrine  which at the present day is looked upon as so salutary   produced on the brains of his subjects  prohibited the teaching of it  under the penalty of death     it must  indeed  be allowed that this doctrine has been of the greatest  utility to those who have given superstitions to nations  who at the  same time made themselves its ministers  it was the foundation of  their power  the source of their wealth  the permanent cause of that  blindness  the solid basis of those terrors  which it was their interest  to nourish in the human race  it was by this doctrine the priest became  first the rival  then the master of kings  it is by this dogma that  nations are filled with enthusiasts inebriated with superstition  always  more disposed to listen to its menaces  than to the counsels of reasons   to the orders of the sovereign  to the cries of nature  or to the laws  of society  politics itself was enslaved to the caprice of the priest   the temporal monarch was obliged to bend under the yoke of the monarch  of superstition  the one only disposed of this perishable world  the  other extended his power into the world to come  much more important  for man than the earth  on which he is only a pilgrim  a mere passenger   thus the doctrine of another life placed the government itself in a  state of dependance upon the priest  the monarch was nothing more than  his first subject  he was never obeyed  but when the two were in accord   nature in vain cried out to man  to be careful of his present happiness   the priest ordered him to be unhappy  in the expectation of future  felicity  reason in vain exhorted him to be peaceable  the priest  breathed forth fanaticism  fulminated fury  obliged him to disturb the  public tranquillity  every time there was a question of the supposed  interests of the invisible monarch of another life  and the real  interests of his ministers in this     such is the fruit that politics has gathered from the doctrine of  a future life  the regions of the world to come have enabled the  priesthood to conquer the present world  the expectation of celestial  happiness  and the dread of future tortures  only served to prevent man  from seeking after the means to render himself happy here below  thus  error  under whatever aspect it is considered  will never be more than a  source of evil for mankind  the doctrine of another life  in presenting  to mortals an ideal happiness  will render them enthusiasts  in  overwhelming them with fears  it will make useless beings  generate  cowards  form atrabilarious or furious men  who will lose sight of their  present abode  to occupy themselves with the pictured regions of a world  to come  with those dreadful evils which they must fear after their  death     if it be insisted that the doctrine of future rewards and punishments is  the most powerful curb to restrain the passions of man  we shall reply  by calling in daily experience  if we only cast our eyes around  if for  a moment we examine what passes in review before us  we shall see this  assertion contradicted  we shall find that these marvellous speculations  do not in any manner diminish the number of the wicked  because they  are incapable of changing the temperament of man  of annihilating those  passions which the vices of society engender in his heart  in those  nations who appear the most thoroughly convinced of this future  punishment  may be seen assassins  thieves  crafty knaves  oppressors   adulterers  voluptuaries  all these pretend they are firmly persuaded of  the reality of an hereafter  yet in the whirlwind of dissipation  in the  vortex of pleasure  in the fury of their passions  they no longer behold  this formidable future existence  which in those moments has no kind of  influence over their earthly conduct     in short  in many of those countries where the doctrine of another life  is so firmly established  that each individual irritates himself against  whoever may have the temerity to combat the opinion  or even to doubt  it  we see that it is utterly incapable of impressing any thing on  rulers who are unjust  who are negligent of the welfare of their people   who are  debauched  on courtezans who are lewd in their habits  on  covetous misers  on flinty extortioners who fatten on the substance of  a nation  on women without modesty  on a vast multitude of drunken   intemperate  vicious men  on great numbers even amongst those priests   whose function it is to preach this future state  who are paid to  announce the vengeance of heaven  against vices which they themselves  encourage by their example  if it be enquired of them  how they dare to  give themselves up to such scandalous actions  which they ought to know  are certain to draw upon them eternal punishment  they will reply  that  the madness of their passions  the force of their habits  the contagion  of example  or even the power of circumstances  have hurried them along   have made them forget the dreadful consequences in which their conduct  is likely to involve them  besides  they will say  that the treasures  of the divine mercy are infinite  that repentance suffices to efface the  foulest transgressions  to cleanse the blackest guilt  to blot out the  most enormous crimes  in this multitude of wretched beings  who each  after his own manner desolates society with his criminal pursuits  you  will find only a small number who are sufficiently intimidated by the  fears of the miserable hereafter  to resist their evil propensities   what did i say  these propensities are in themselves too weak to carry  them forward without the aid of the doctrine of another life  without  this  the law and the fear of censure would have been motives sufficient  to prevent them from rendering themselves criminal     it is indeed  fearful  timorous souls  upon whom the terrors of another  life make a profound impression  human beings of this sort come into the  world with moderate passions  are of a weakly organization  possess a  cool imagination  it is not therefore surprising  that in such men  who  are already restrained by their nature  the fear of future punishment  counterbalances the weak efforts of their feeble passions  but it is  by no means the same with those determined sinners  with those hardened  criminals  with those men who are habitually vicious  whose unseemly  excesses nothing can arrest  who in their violence shut their eyes to  the fear of the laws of this world  despising still more those of the  other  nevertheless  how many persons say they are  and even believe  themselves  restrained by the fears of the life to come  but  either  they deceive us  or they impose upon themselves  by attributing to these  fears  that which is only the effect of motives much nearer at  hand  such as the feebleness of their machine  the mildness of their  temperament  the slender energy of their souls  their natural timidity   the ideas imbibed in their education  the fear of consequences  immediately resulting from criminal actions  the physical evils  attendant on unbridled irregularities  these are the true motives that  restrain them  not the notions of a future life  which men  who say they  are most firmly persuaded of its existence  forget whenever a powerful  interest solicits them to sin  if for a time man would pay attention to  what passes before his eyes  he would perceive that he ascribes to the  fear of the gods that which is in reality only the effect of peculiar  weakness  of pusillanimity  of the small interest found to commit evil   these men would not act otherwise than they do  if they had not this  fear before them  if  therefore he reflected  he would feel that it is  always necessity that makes men act as they do     man cannot be restrained  when he does not find within himself motives  sufficiently powerful to conduct him back to reason  there is nothing   either in this world or in the other  that can render him virtuous   when an untoward organization  a mind badly cultivated  a  violent imagination  inveterate habits  fatal examples  powerful  interests  invite him from every quarter to the commission of crime   no speculations are capable of restraining the man who braves public  opinion  who despises the law  who is careless of its censure  who turns  a deaf ear to the cries of conscience  whose power in this world places  him out of the reach of punishment  in the violence of his transports   he will fear still less a distant futurity  of which the idea always  recedes before that which he believes necessary to his immediate  interests  consistent with his present happiness  all lively passions  blind man to every thing that is not its immediate object  the terrors  of a future life  of which his passions always possess the secret to  diminish to him the probability  can effect nothing upon the wicked man   who does not fear even the much nearer punishment of the law  who sets  at nought the assured hatred of those by whom he is surrounded  man   when he delivers himself up to crime  sees nothing certain except the  supposed advantage which attends it  the rest always appear to him  either false or problematical     if man would but open his eyes  even for a moment  he would clearly  perceive  that to effect any thing upon hearts hardened by crime  he  must not reckon upon the chastisement of an avenging divinity  which the  self love natural to man always shews him as pacified in the long run   he who has arrived at persuading himself he cannot be happy without  crime  will always readily deliver himself up to it  notwithstanding  the menaces of religion  whoever is sufficiently blind not to read his  infamy in his own heart  to see his own vileness in the countenances of  his associates  his own condemnation in the anger of his fellow men  his  own unworthiness in the indignation of the judges established to punish  the offences he may commit  such a man  i say  will never feel the  impression his crimes shall make on the features of a judge  that is  either hidden from his view  or that he only contemplates at a distance   the tyrant who with dry eyes can hear the cries of the distressed  who  with callous heart can behold the tears of a whole people  of whose  misery he is the cause  will not see the angry countenance of a more  powerful master  like another menippus  he may indeed destroy himself  from desperation  to avoid reiterated reproach  which only proves   that when a haughty  arrogant despot pretends to be accountable for his  actions to the divinity alone  it is because he fears his nation more  than he does his god     on the other hand  does not superstition itself  does not even religion   annihilate the effects of those fears which it announces as salutary   does it not furnish its disciples with the means of extricating  themselves from the punishments with which it has so frequently menaced  them  does it not tell them  that a steril repentance will  even at the  moment of death  disarm the celestial wrath  that it will purify the  filthy souls of sinners  do not even the priests  in some superstitions   arrogate to themselves the right of remitting to the dying the  punishment due to the crimes committed during the course of a disorderly  life  in short  do not the most perverse men  encouraged in iniquity   countenanced in debauchery  upheld in crime  reckon  even to the last  moment  either upon the assistance of superstition  or upon the aid  of religion  that promises them the infallible means of reconciling  themselves to the divinity  whom they have irritated  of avoiding the  rigorous punishments pronounced against their enormities     in consequence of these notions  so favourable to the wicked  so  suitable to tranquillize their fears  we see that the hope of an easy  expiation  far from correcting man  engages him to persist  until death   in the most crying disorders  indeed  in despite of the numberless  advantages which he is assured flows from the doctrine of a life to  come  in defiance of its pretended efficacy to repress the passions  of men  do not the priests themselves  although so interested in the  maintenance of this system  every day complain of its insufficiency   they acknowledge  that mortals  who from their infancy they have  imbued with these ideas  are not less hurried forward by their evil  propensities  less sunk in the vortex of dissipation  less the slaves to  their pleasures  less captivated by bad habits  less driven along by the  torrent of the world  less seduced by their present interest  which  make them forget equally the recompense and the chastisement of a future  existence  in a word  the interpreters of superstition  the ministers of  religion themselves  allow that their disciples  for the greater part   conduct themselves in this world as if they had nothing either to hope  or fear in another     in short  let it be supposed for a moment  that the doctrine of eternal  punishments was of some utility  that it really restrained a small  number of individuals  what are these feeble advantages compared to the  numberless evils that flow from it  against one timid man whom this idea  restrains  there are thousands upon whom it operates nothing  there are  thousands whom it makes irrational  whom it renders savage persecutors   whom it converts into fanatics  there are thousands whose mind it  disturbs  whom it diverts from their duties towards society  there  are an infinity whom it grievously afflicts  whom it troubles without  producing any real good for their associates     notwithstanding so many are inclined to consider those who do not fall  in with this doctrine as the enemies of society  it will be found on  examination that the wisest the most enlightened men of antiquity  as  well as many of the moderns  have believed not only that the soul is  material and perishes with the body  but also that they have attacked  without subterfuge the opinion of future everlasting punishments  it  will also be found that many of the systems  set up to establish the  immortality of the soul  are in themselves the best evidence that can be  adduced of the futility of this doctrine  if for a moment we only follow  up the natural the just inferences that are to be drawn from them  this  sentiment was far from being  as some have supposed  peculiar to  the epicureans  it has been adopted by philosophers of all sects  by  pythagoreans  by stoics  by peripatetics  by academics  in short by the  most godly the most virtuous men of greece and of rome     pythagoras  according to ovid  speaks strongly to the fact  timaeus  of locris  who was a pythagorean  admits that the doctrine of future  punishments was fabulous  solely destined for the imbecility of the  uninformed  but little calculated for those who cultivate their reason     aristotle expressly says  that  man has neither good to hope nor evil to  fear after death      zeno  according to cicero  supposed the soul to be an igneous substance   from whence he concluded it destroyed itself     cicero  the philosophical orator  who was of the sect of academics   although he is not on all occasions  in accord with himself  treats  openly as fables the torments of hell  and looks upon death as the end  of every thing for man     seneca  the philosopher  is filled with passages which contemplate death  as a state of total annihilation  particularly in speaking of it to his  brother  and nothing can be more decisive of his holding this opinion   than what he writes to marcia  to console him     seneca  the tragedian  explains himself in the same manner as the  philosopher     the platonists  who made the soul immortal  could not have an idea of  future punishments  because the soul according to them was a portion  of the divinity which after the dissolution of the body it returned to  rejoin     epictetus has the same idea  in a passage reported by arrian  he says    but where are you going  it cannot be to a place of suffering  you will  only return to the place from whence you came  you are about to be again  peaceably associated with the elements from which you are derived  that  which in your composition  is of the nature of fire  will return to  the element of fire  that which is of the nature of earth  will rejoin  itself to the earth  that which is air  will re unite itself with air   that which is water  will resolve itself into water  there is no hell   no acheron  no cocytus  no phlegethon      in another place he says   the hour of death approaches  but do not  aggravate your evil  nor render things worse than they are  represent  them to yourself under their true point of view  the time is come when  the materials of which you are composed  go to resolve themselves into  the elements from whence they were originally borrowed  what is there  that is terrible or grievous in that  is there any thing in the world  that perishes totally      the sage and pious antoninus says   he who fears death  either fears  to be deprived of all feeling  or dreads to experience different  sensations  if you lose all feeling  you will no longer be subject  either to pain or to misery  if you are provided with other senses of  a different nature  you will become a creature of a different species    this great emperor further says   that we must expect death with  tranquillity  seeing  that it is only a dissolution of the elements of  which each animal is composed      to the evidence of so many great men of  pagan antiquity   may be  joined  that of the author of ecclesiastes  who speaks of death  and of  the condition of the human soul  like an  epicurean   he says   for  that which befalleth the sons of men  befalleth beasts  even one thing  befalleth them  as the one dieth  so dieth the other  yea  they have all  one breath  so that a man hath no pre eminence above a beast  for all is  vanity  all go unto one place  all are of the dust  and all turn to dust  again   and further   wherefore i perceive that there is nothing  better than that a man should rejoice in his own works  for that is his  portion  for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him      in short  how can the utility or the necessity of this doctrine be  reconciled with the fact  that the great  legislator of the jews   who  is supposed to have been inspired by the divinity  should have remained  silent on a subject  that is said to be of so much importance  in the  third chapter of genesis it  is said   in the sweat of thy face shalt  thou eat bread  till thou return unto the ground  for out of it wast  thou taken  for dust thou art  and unto dust shalt thou return              chap  xiv      education  morals  and the laws suffice to restrain man   of the desire  of immortality   of suicide        it is not then in an ideal world  existing no where perhaps  but in the  imagination of man  that he must seek to collect motives calculated to  make him act properly in this  it is in the visible world that will be  found incitements to divert him from crime  to rouse him to virtue   it is in nature   in experience   in truth  that he must search out  remedies for the evils of his species  for motives suitable to infuse  into the human heart  propensities truely useful to society  calculated  to promote its advantage  to conduce to the end for which it was  designed     if attention has been paid to what has been said in the course of this  work  it will be seen that above all it is  education  that will best  furnish the true means of rectifying the errors  of recalling the  wanderings of mankind  it is this that should scatter the seeds in  his heart  cultivate the tender shoots  make a profitable use of his  dispositions  turn to account those faculties  which depend on his  organization  which should cherish the fire of his imagination  kindle  it for useful objects  damp it  or extinguish it for others  in short   it is this which should make sensible souls contract habits which are  advantageous for society and beneficial to the individual  brought up in  this manner  man would not have occasion for celestial punishments   to teach him the value of virtue  he would not need to behold burning  gulphs of brimstone under his feet  to induce him to feel horror for  crime  nature without these fables  would teach much better what he owes  to himself  the law would point out what he owes to the body politic  of  which he is a member  it is thus  that education grounded upon utility   would form valuable citizens to the state  the depositaries of power  would distinguish those whom education should have thus formed  by  reason of the advantages which they would procure for their country   they would punish those who should be found injurious to it  it would  make the citizens see  that the promises of reward which education held  forth  the punishments denounced by morals  are by no means vain  that  in a state well constituted   virtue  is the true  the only road to  happiness   talents  the way to gain respect  that  inutility  conducts  to misfortune  that  crime  leads to contempt     a just  enlightened  virtuous  and vigilant government  who should  honestly propose the public good  would have no occasion either for  fables or for falsehoods  to govern reasonable subjects  it would blush  to make use of imposture  to deceive its citizens  who  instructed in  their duties  would find their interest in submitting to equitable laws   who would be capable of feeling the benefit these have the power of  conferring on them  it would feel  that habit is sufficient to inspire  them with horror  even for those concealed crimes that escape the eyes  of society  it would understand that the visible punishments of this  world impose much more on the generality of men  than those of an  uncertain and distant futurity  in short  it would ascertain that  the sensible benefits within the compass of the sovereign power to  distribute  touch the imagination of mortals more keenly  than those  vague recompences which are held forth to them in a future existence   above all  it would discover that those on whom these distant advantages  do operate  would be still more attached to virtue by receiving their  reward both here and hereafter     man is almost every where so wicked  so corrupt  so rebellious to  reason  only because he is not governed according to his nature  nor  properly instructed in her necessary laws  he is almost in every climate  fed with superstitious chimeras  submitted to masters who neglect his  instruction or who seek to deceive him  on the face of this globe  may  be frequently witnessed unjust sovereigns  who  enervated by luxury   corrupted by flattery  depraved by licentiousness  made wicked by  impunity  devoid of talents  without morals  destitute of virtue  are  incapable of exerting any energy for the benefit of the states they  govern  they are consequently but little occupied with the welfare of  their people  indifferent to their duties  of which indeed they are  often ignorant  such governors suffer their whole attention to be  absorbed by frivolous amusement  stimulated by the desire of continually  finding means to feed their insatiable ambition they engage in useless  depopulating wars  and never occupy their mind with those objects which  are the most important to the happiness of their nation  yet these weak  men feel interested in maintaining the received prejudices  and visit  with severity those who consider the means of curing them  in short  themselves deprived of that understanding  which teaches man that it is  his interest to be kind  just  and virtuous  they ordinarily reward  only those crimes which their imbecility makes them imagine as useful to  them  they generally punish those virtues which are opposed to their own  imprudent passions  but which reason would point out as truly beneficial  to their interests  under such masters is it surprising that society  should be ravaged  that weak beings should be willing to imitate them   that perverse men should emulate each other in oppressing its members   in sacrificing its dearest interests  in despoiling its happiness   the state of society in such countries  is a state of hostility of the  sovereign against the whole  of each of its members the one against  the other  man is wicked  not because he is born so  but because he is  rendered so  the great  the powerful  crush with impunity the indigent  and the unhappy  these  at the risk of their lives seek to retaliate  to  render back the evil they have received  they attack either openly or in  secret a country  who to them is a step mother  who gives all to some of  her children  and deprives the others of every thing  they punish it for  its partiality  and clearly shew that the motives borrowed from a life  hereafter are impotent against the fury of those passions to which  a corrupt administration has given birth  that the terror of the  punishments in this world are too feeble against necessity  against  criminal habits  against dangerous organization uncorrected by  education     in many countries the morals of the people are neglected  the government  is occupied only with rendering them timid  with making them miserable   man is almost every where a slave  it must then follow of necessity   that he is base  interested  dissimulating  without honour  in a word  that he has the vices of the state of which he is a citizen  almost  every where he is deceived  encouraged in ignorance  prevented from  cultivating his reason  of course he must be stupid  irrational  and  wicked almost every where he sees vice applauded  and crime honoured   thence he concludes vice to be a good  virtue  only a useless sacrifice  of himself  almost every where he is miserable  therefore he injures his  fellow men in a fruitless attempt to relieve his own anguish  it is in  vain to shew him heaven in order to restrain him  his views presently  descend again to earth  he is willing to be happy at any price   therefore  the laws which have neither provided for his instruction  for  his morals  nor his happiness  menace him uselessly  he plunges on in  his pursuits  and these ultimately punish him  for the unjust negligence  of his legislators  if politics more enlightened  did seriously occupy  itself with the instruction  with the welfare of the people  if laws  were more equitable  if each society  less partial  bestowed on its  members the care  the education  and the assistance which they have a  right to expect  if governments less covetous  and more vigilant  were  sedulous to render their subjects more happy  there would not be seen  such numbers of malefactors  of robbers  of murderers  who every where  infest society  they would not be obliged to destroy life  in order to  punish wickedness  which is commonly ascribable to the vices of their  own institutions  it would be unnecessary to seek in another life for  fanciful chimeras  which always prove abortive against the infuriate  passions  against the real wants of man  in short  if the people were  instructed  they would be more happy  politics would no longer be  reduced to the exigency of deceiving them  in order to restrain them   nor to destroy so many unfortunates  for having procured necessaries  at  the expence of their hard hearted fellow citizens     when it shall be desired to enlighten man  let him always have truth  laid before him  instead of kindling his imagination by the idea of  those punishments that a future state has in reserve for him  let him  be solaced  let him be succoured  or  at least  let him be permitted to  enjoy the fruit of his labour  let not his substance be ravished from  him by cruel imposts  let him not be discouraged from work  by finding  all his labour inadequate to support his existence  let him not be  driven into that idleness  that will surely lead him on to crime  let  him consider his present existence  without carrying his views to that  which may attend him after his death  let his industry be excited  let  his talents be rewarded  let him be rendered active  laborious   beneficent  and virtuous  in the world he inhabits  let it be shewn  to him  that his actions are capable of having an influence over  his fellow men  let him not be menaced with the tortures of a future  existence when he shall be no more  let him behold society armed against  those who disturb its repose  let him see the consequence of the hatred  of his associates  let him learn to feel the value of their affection   let him be taught to esteem himself  let him understand  that to obtain  it  he must have virtue  above all  that the virtuous man in society has  nothing to fear  but every thing to hope     if it be desired to form honest  courageous  industrious citizens  who  may be useful to their country  let them beware of inspiring man  from his infancy with an ill founded dread of death  of amusing his  imagination with marvellous fables  of occupying his mind with his  destiny in a future life  quite useless to be known  which has nothing  in common with his real felicity  let them speak of immortality to  intrepid  noble souls  let them shew it as the price of their labours  to energetic minds  who are solely occupied with virtue  who springing  forward beyond the boundaries of their actual existence  who  little  satisfied with eliciting the admiration  with gaining the love of  their contemporaries  are will also to wrest the homage  to secure  the affection of future races  indeed  this is an immortality to which  genius  talents  above all virtue  has a just right to pretend  do not  therefore let them censure  do not let them endeavour to stifle so  noble a passion in man  which is founded upon his nature  which is  so calculated to render him happy  from which society gather the most  advantageous fruits     the idea of being buried in total oblivion  of having nothing in  common after his death with the beings of his species  of losing all  possibility of again having any influence over them  is a thought  extremely painful to man  it is above all afflicting to those who  possess an ardent imagination  the  desire of immortality   or of living  in the memory of his fellow men  was always the passion of great souls   it was the motive to the actions of all those who have played a great  part on the earth   heroes  whether virtuous or criminal   philosophers   as well as  conquerors  men of genius  and  men of talents   those  sublime personages who have done honor to their species  as well as  those illustrious villains who have debased and ravaged it  have had  an eye to posterity in all their enterprises  have flattered themselves  with the hope of acting upon the souls of men  even when they themselves  should no longer exist  if man in general does not carry his views so  far  he is at least sensible to the idea of seeing himself regenerated  in his children  whom he knows are destined to survive him  to transmit  his name  to preserve his memory  to represent him in society  it is  for them that he rebuilds his cottage  it is for them that he plants the  tree which his eyes will never behold in its vigour  it is that they may  be happy that he labours  the sorrow which embitters the life of those  rich men  frequently so useless to the world  when they have lost the  hope of continuing their race  has its source in the fear of being  entirely forgotten  they feel that the useless man dies entirely  the  idea that his name will be in the mouths of men  the thought that it  will be pronounced with tenderness  that it will be recollected with  kindness  that it will excite in their hearts favourable sentiments  is  an illusion that is useful  is a vision suitable to flatter even those  who know that nothing will result from it  man pleases himself with  dreaming that he shall have power  that he shall pass for something in  the universe  even after the term of his human existence  he partakes  by imagination in the projects  in the actions  in the discussions  of future ages  and would be extremely unhappy if he believed himself  entirely excluded from their society  the laws in all countries have  entered into these views  they have so far been willing to console  their citizens for the necessity of dying  by giving them the means  of exercising their will  even for a long time after their death  this  condescension goes to that length  that the dead frequently regulate the  condition of the living during a long series of years     every thing serves to prove the desire in man of surviving himself    pyramids  mausoleums  monuments  epitaphs   all shew that he is willing  to prolong his existence even beyond his decease  he  is not insensible  to the judgment of posterity  it is for him the philosopher writes  it  is to astonish him that the monarch erects sumptuous edifices  gorgeous  palaces  it is his praises  it is his commendations  that the great man  already hears echo in his ears  it is to him that the virtuous citizen  appeals from unjust laws  from prejudiced contemporaries  happy chimera   generous illusion  mild vision  its power is so consoling  so bland   that it realizes itself to ardent imaginations  it is calculated to give  birth  to sustain  to nurture  to mature enthusiasm of genius  constancy  of courage  grandeur of soul  transcendency of talent  its force is so  gentle  its influence so pleasing  that it is sometimes able to repress  the vices  to restrain the excesses of the most powerful men  who  are  as experience has shewn  frequently very much disquieted for the  judgment of their posterity  from a conviction that this will sooner or  later avenge the living of the foul injustice which they may be inclined  to make them suffer     no man  therefore  can consent to be entirely effaced from the  remembrance of his fellows  some men have not the temerity to place  themselves above the judgment of the future human species  to degrade  themselves in his eyes  where is the being who is insensible to the  pleasure of exciting the tears of those who shall survive him  of again  acting upon their souls  of once more occupying their thoughts  of  exercising upon them his power even from the bottom of his grave  let  then eternal silence be imposed upon those superstitious beings  upon  those melancholy men  upon those furious bigots  who censure a sentiment  from which society derives so many real advantages  let not mankind  listen to those passionless philosophers who are willing to smother  this great  this noble spring of his soul  let him not be seduced by the  sarcasms of those voluptuaries  who pretend to despise an immortality   towards which they lack the power to set forward  the desire of pleasing  posterity  of rendering his name agreeable to generations yet to come   is a respectable  a laudable motive  when it causes him to undertake  those things  of which the utility may be felt  of which the advantages  may have an influence not only over his contemporaries  but also over  nations who have not yet an existence  let him not treat as irrational   the enthusiasm of those beneficent beings  of those mighty geniuses  of  those stupendous talents  whose keen  whose penetrating regards  have  foreseen him even in their day  who have occupied themselves for him   for his welfare  for his happiness  who have desired his suffrage  who  have written for him  who have enriched him by their discoveries  who  have cured him of some of his errors  let him render them the homage  which they have expected at his hands  let him  at least  reverence  their memory for the benefits he has derived from them  let him treat  their mouldering remains with respect  for the pleasure he receives  from their labours  let him pay to their ashes a tribute of grateful  recollection  for the happiness they have been sedulous to procure  for him  let him sprinkle with his tears  let him hallow with his  remembrance  let him consecrate with his finest sensibilities  the urns  of socrates  of phocion  of archimedes  of anaxarchus  let him wash out  the stain that their punishment has made on the human species  let him  expiate by his regret the athenian ingratitude  the savage barbarity  of nicocreon  let him learn by their example to dread superstitious  fanaticism  to hold political intolerance in abhorrence  let him fear to  harrass merit  let him be cautious how he insults virtue  in persecuting  those who may happen to differ from him in his prejudices     let him strew flowers over the tombs of an homer  of a tasso  of a  shakespeare  of a milton  of a goldsmith  let him revere the immortal  shades of those happy geniuses  whose songs yet vibrate on his ears   whose harmonious lays excite in his soul the most tender sentiments  let  him bless the memory of all those benefactors to the people  who were  the delight of the human race  let him adore the virtues of a titus  of  a trajan  of an antoninus  of a julian  let him merit in his sphere  the  eulogies of future ages  let him always remember  that to carry with  him to the grave the regret of his fellow man  he must display talents   evince integrity  practice virtue  the funeral ceremonies of the most  powerful monarchs  have rarely been wetted with the tears of the people   they have commonly drained them while living  the names of tyrants  excite the horror of those who bear them pronounced  tremble then cruel  kings  ye who plunge your subjects into misery  who bathe them with  bitter tears  who ravage nations  who deluge the land with the vital  stream  who change the fruitful earth into a barren cemetery  tremble  for the sanguinary traits under which the future historian will paint  you  to generations yet unborn  neither your splendid monuments  your  imposing victories  your innumerable armies  nor your sycophant  courtiers  can prevent posterity from avenging their grandfathers  from  insulting your odious manes  from treating your execrable memories with  scorn  from showering their contempt on your transcendant crimes     not only man sees his dissolution with pain  but again  he wishes his  death may be an interesting event for others  but  as we have already  said  he must have talents  he must have beneficence  he must have  virtue  in order  that those who surround him  may interest themselves  in his condition  that those who survive him  may give regret to his  ashes  is it  then  surprising if the greater number of men  occupied  entirely with themselves  completely absorbed by their own vanity   devoted to their own puerile objects  for ever busied with the care of  gratifying their vile passions  at the expence  perhaps  of their family  happiness  unheedful of the wants of a wife  unmindful of the necessity  of their children  careless of the calls of friendship  regardless of  their duty to society  do not by their death excite the sensibilities of  their survivors  or that they should be presently forgotten  there is an  infinity of monarchs of which history does not tell us any thing  save  that they have lived  in despite of the inutility in which men for the  most part pass their existence  maugre the little care they bestow  to  render themselves dear to the beings who environ them  notwithstanding  the numerous actions they commit to displease their associates  the  self love of each individual  persuades him  that his death must be  an interesting occurrence  few men but think themselves an euryalus in  friendship  all expect to find a nisus  thus man s over weening philauty  shews him to say thus the order of things are overturned at his decease   o mortal  feeble and vain  dost thou not know the sesostris s  the  alexanders  the caesars are dead  yet the course of the universe is not  arrested  the demise of those famous conquerors  afflicting to some few  favoured slaves  was a subject of delight for the whole human race   dost thou then foolishly believe that thy talents ought to interest thy  species  that they are of sufficient extent to put it into mourning at  thy decease  alas  the corneilles  the lockes  the newtons  the boyles   the harveys  the montesquieus  the sheridans are no more  regretted by a  small number of friends  who have presently consoled themselves by their  necessary avocations  their death was indifferent to the greater number  of their fellow citizens  darest thou then flatter thyself  that  thy reputation  thy titles  thy riches  thy sumptuous repasts  thy  diversified pleasures  will make thy funeral a melancholy event  it will  be spoken of by some few for two days  and do not be at all surprised   learn that there have died in former ages  in babylon  in sardis  in  carthage  in athens  in rome  millions of citizens more illustrious   more powerful  more opulent  more voluptuous  than thou art  of whom   however  no one has taken care to transmit to thee even the names  be  then virtuous  o man  in whatever station thy destiny assigns thee  and  thou shalt be happy in thy life time  do thou good and thou shalt be  cherished  acquire talents and thou shalt be respected  posterity  shall admire thee  if those talents  by becoming beneficial to their  interests  shall bring them acquainted with the name under which they  formerly designated thy annihilated being  but the universe will not be  disturbed by thy loss  and when thou comest to die  whilst thy wife  thy  children  thy friends  fondly leaning over thy sickly couch  shall be  occupied with the melancholy task of closing thine eyes  thy nearest  neighbour shall perhaps be exulting with joy     let not then man occupy himself with his condition that may be to come   but let him sedulously endeavour to make himself useful  to those with  whom he lives  let him for his own peculiar happiness render himself  dutiful to his parents  faithful to his wife  attentive to his  children  kind to his relations   true to his friends  lenient to his  servants  let him strive to become estimable in the eyes of his fellow  citizens  let him faithfully serve a country which assures to him his  welfare  let the desire of pleasing posterity  of meriting its applause   excite him to those labours that shall elicit their eulogies  let a  legitimate self love  when he shall be worthy of it  make him taste  in advance those commendations which he is willing to deserve  let him  learn to love himself  to esteem himself  but never let him consent that  concealed vices  that sacred crimes  shall degrade him in his own eyes   shall oblige him to be ashamed of his own conduct     thus disposed  let him contemplate his own decease with the same  indifference  that it will be looked upon by the greater number of his  fellows  let him expect death with constancy  wait for it with calm  resignation  let him learn to shake off those vain terrors with which  superstition  would overwhelm him  let him leave to the enthusiast his  vague hopes  to the fanatic his mad brained speculations  to the bigot  those fears with which he ministers to his own melancholy  but let his  heart  fortified by reason  corroborated by a love of virtue  no longer  dread a dissolution that will destroy all feeling     whatever may be the attachment man has to life  whatever may be his  fear of death  it is every day witnessed  that habit  that opinion   that prejudice  are motives sufficiently powerful to annihilate these  passions in his breast  to make him brave danger  to cause him to hazard  his existence  ambition  pride  jealousy  love  vanity  avarice  the  desire of glory  that deference of opinion which is decorated with the  sounding title of  a point of honour   have the efficacy to make him  shut his eyes to danger  to laugh at peril  to push him on to death   vexation  anxiety of mind  disgrace  want of success  softens to him  its hard features  makes him regard it as a door that will afford him  shelter from the injustice of mankind  indigence  trouble  adversity   familiarizes him with this death  so terrible to the happy  the poor  man  condemned to labour  inured to privations  deprived of the comforts  of life  views its approach with indifference  the unfortunate  when  he is unhappy  when he is without resource  embraces it in despair  the  wretched accelerates its march as soon as he sees that happiness is no  longer within his grasp     man in different ages  in different countries  has formed opinions  extremely various upon the conduct of those  who have had the temerity  to put an end to their own existence  his ideas upon this subject  as  upon all others  have taken their tone from his religion  have been  governed by his superstitious systems  have been modified by his  political institutions  the greeks  the romans  and other nations  which  every thing conspired to make intrepid  to render courageous  to lead  to magnanimity  regarded as heroes  contemplated as gods  those who  voluntarily cut the thread of life  in hindoostan  the brahmin yet knows  how to inspire even women with sufficient fortitude to burn themselves  upon the dead bodies of their husbands  the japanese  upon the most  trifling occasion  takes no kind of difficulty in plunging a dagger into  his bosom     among the people of our own country  religion renders man less prodigal  of life  it teaches that it is offensive to the deity that he should  destroy himself  some moralists  abstracting the height of religious  ideas  have held that it is never permitted to man to break the  conditions of the covenant that he has made with society  others  have looked upon suicide as cowardice  they have thought that it was  weakness  that it displayed pusillanimity  to suffer  himself to be  overwhelmed with the shafts of his destiny  and have held that there  would be much more courage  more elevation of soul  in supporting his  afflictions  in resisting the blows of fate     if nature be consulted upon this point  it will be found that all the  actions of man  that feeble plaything in the hands of necessity  are  indispensable  that they depend on causes which move him in despite of  himself  that without his knowledge  make him accomplish at each moment  of his existence some one of its decrees  if the same power that obliges  all intelligent beings to cherish their existence  renders that of  man so painful  so cruel  that he finds it insupportable he quits his  species  order is destroyed for him  he accomplishes a decree of nature   that wills he shall no longer exist  this nature has laboured during  thousands of years  to form in the bowels of the earth the iron that  must number his days     if the relation of man with nature be examined  it will be found that  his engagement was neither voluntary on his part  nor reciprocal on the  part of nature  the volition of his will had no share in his birth   it is commonly against his will that he is obliged to finish life  his  actions are  as we have proved  only the necessary effects of unknown  causes which determine his will  he is  in the hands of nature  that  which a sword is in his own hands  he can fall upon it without its being  able to accuse him with breaking his engagements  or of stamping with  ingratitude the hand that holds it  man can only love his existence on  condition of being happy  as soon as the entire of nature refuses him  this happiness  as soon as all that surrounds him becomes incommodious  to him  as soon as his melancholy ideas offer nothing but afflicting  pictures to his imagination  he already exists no longer  he is  suspended in the void  he quits a rank which no longer suits him  in  which he finds no one interest  which offers him no protection  which  overwhelms him with calamity  in which he can no more be useful either  to himself or to others     if the covenant which unites man to society be considered  it will be  obvious that every contract is conditional  must be reciprocal  that is  to say  supposes mutual advantages between the contracting parties  the  citizen cannot be bound to his country  to his associates  but by the  bonds of happiness  are these bonds cut asunder  he is restored to  liberty  society  or those who represent it  do they use him with  harshness  do they treat him with injustice  do they render his  existence painful  does disgrace hold him out to the finger of scorn   does indigence menace him in an obdurate world  perfidious friends  do  they forsake him in adversity  an unfaithful wife  does she outrage his  heart  rebellious  ungrateful children  do they afflict his old age   has he placed his happiness exclusively on some object which it is  impossible for him to procure  chagrin  remorse  melancholy  and  despair  have they disfigured to him the spectacle of the universe  in  short  for whatever cause it may be  if he is not able to support  his evils  he quits a world  which from henceforth  is for him only a  frightful desert he removes himself for ever from a country he thinks  no longer willing to reckon him amongst the number of her children  he  quits a house that to his mind is ready to bury him under its ruins  he  renounces a society  to the happiness of which he can no longer  contribute  which his own peculiar felicity alone can render dear to  him  and could the man be blamed  who  finding himself useless  who  being without resources  in the town where destiny gave him birth   should quit it in chagrin  to plunge himself in solitude  death appears  to the wretched the only remedy for despair  it is then the sword seems  the only friend  the only comfort that is left to the unhappy  as long  as hope remains the tenant of his bosom  as long as his evils appear to  him at all supportable  as long as he flatters himself with seeing them  brought to a termination  as long as he finds some comfort in existence   however slender  he will not consent to deprive himself of life  but  when nothing any longer sustains in him the love of this existence  then  to live  is to him the greatest of evils  to die  the only mode by which  he can avoid the excess of despair  this has been the opinion of many  great men  seneca  the moralist  whom lactantius calls the divine pagan   who has been praised equally by st  austin and st  augustine  endeavours  by every kind of argument to make death a matter of indifference to man   cato has always been commended  because he would not survive the cause  of liberty  for that he would not live a slave  curtius  who rode  voluntarily into the gap  to save his country  has always been held  forth as a model of heroic virtue  is it not evident  that those martyrs  who have delivered themselves up to punishment  have preferred quitting  the world to living in it contrary to their own ideals of happiness   when samson wished to be revenged on the philistines  did he not consent  to die with them as the only means  if our country is attacked  do we  not voluntarily sacrifice our lives in its defence     that society who has not the ability  or who is not willing to procure  man any one benefit  loses all its rights over him  nature  when it has  rendered his existence completely miserable  has in fact  ordered him to  quit it  in dying he does no more than fulfil one of her decrees  as  he did when he first drew his breath  to him who is fearless of death   there is no evil without a remedy  for him who refuses to die  there  yet exists benefits which attach him to the world  in this case let him  rally his powers  let him oppose courage to a destiny that oppresses  him  let him call forth those resources with which nature yet furnishes  him  she cannot have totally abandoned him  while she yet leaves him the  sensation of pleasure  the hopes of seeing a period to his pains     man regulates his judgment on his fellows  only by his own peculiar  mode of feeling  he deems as folly  he calls delirium all those violent  actions which he believes but little commensurate with their causes  or  which appear to him calculated to deprive him of that happiness  towards  which he supposes a being in the enjoyment of his senses  cannot cease  to have a tendency  he treats his associate as a weak creature  when he  sees him affected with that which touches him but lightly  or when he is  incapable of supporting those evils  which his self love flatters him   he would himself be able to endure with more fortitude  he accuses with  madness whoever deprives himself of life  for objects that he thinks  unworthy so dear a sacrifice  he taxes him with phrenzy  because he has  himself learned to regard this life as the greatest blessing  it is  thus that he always erects himself into a judge of the happiness of  others  of their mode of seeing  of their manner of feeling  a miser who  destroys himself after the loss of his treasure  appears a fool in  the eyes of him who is less attached to riches  he does not feel  that  without money  life to this miser is only a continued torture  that  nothing in the world is capable of diverting him from his painful  sensations  he will proudly tell you  that in his place he had not done  so much  but to be exactly in the place of another man  it is needful to  have his organization  his temperament  his passions  his ideas  it  is in fact needful to be that other  to be placed exactly in the same  circumstances  to be moved by the same causes  and in this case all men   like the miser  would sacrifice their life  after being deprived of the  only source of their happiness     he who deprives himself of his existence  does not adopt this extremity   so repugnant to his natural tendency  but when nothing in this world has  the faculty of rejoicing him  when no means are left of diverting his  affliction  when reason no longer acts  his misfortune whatever it may  be  for him is real  his organization  be it strong  or be it weak  is  his own  not that of another  a man who is sick only in imagination   really suffers considerably  even troublesome dreams place him in a very  uncomfortable situation  thus when a man kills himself  it ought to be  concluded  that life  in the room of being a benefit  had become a very  great evil to him  that existence had lost all its charms in his eyes   that the entire of nature was to him destitute of attraction  that it  no longer contained any thing that could seduce him  that after the  comparison which his disturbed imagination had made of existence with  non existence  the latter appeared to him preferable to the first     many will consider these maxims as dangerous  they certainly account why  the unhappy cut the thread of life  in a manner not corresponding with  the received prejudices  but  nevertheless  it is a temperament soured  by chagrin  a bilious constitution  a melancholy habit  a defect in the  organization  a derangement in the mind  it is in fact necessity and  not reasonable speculations  that breed in man the design of destroying  himself  nothing invites him to this step so long as reason remains  with him  or whilst he yet possesses hope  that sovereign balm for every  evil  as for the unfortunate  who cannot lose sight of his sorrows  who  cannot forget his pains  who has his evils always present to his  mind  he is obliged to take counsel from these alone  besides  what  assistance  what advantage can society promise to himself  from a  miserable wretch reduced to despair  from a misanthrope overwhelmed  with grief  from a wretch tormented with remorse  who has no longer  any motive to render himself useful to others  who has abandoned  himself  who finds no more interest in preserving his life  frequently   those who destroy themselves are such  that had they lived  the offended  laws must have ultimately been obliged to remove them from a society  which they disgraced  from a country which they had injured     as life is commonly the greatest blessing for man  it is to be presumed  that he who deprives himself of it  is compelled to it by an invincible  force  it is the excess of misery  the height of despair  the  derangement of his brain  caused by melancholy  that urges man on to  destroy himself  agitated by contrary impulsions  he is  as we have  before said  obliged to follow a middle course that conducts him to his  death  if man be not a free agent  in any one instant of his life  he is  again much less so in the act by which it is terminated     it will be seen then  that he who kills himself  does not  as it is  pretended  commit an outrage on nature  he follows an impulse which  has deprived him of reason  adopts the only means left him to quit his  anguish  he goes out of a door which she leaves open to him  he cannot  offend in accomplishing a law of necessity  the iron hand of this having  broken the spring that renders life desirable to him  which urged him to  self conservation  shews him he ought to quit a rank or system where he  finds himself too miserable to have the desire of remaining  his country  or his family have no right to complain of a member  whom it has no  means of rendering happy  from whom consequently they have nothing more  to hope  to be useful to either  it is necessary he should cherish his  own peculiar existence  that he should have an interest in conserving  himself  that he should love the bonds by which he is united to  others  that he should be capable of occupying himself with their  felicity  that he should have a sound mind  that the suicide should  repent of his precipitancy  he should outlive himself  he should carry  with him into his future residence  his organs  his senses  his memory   his ideas  his actual mode of existing  his determinate manner of  thinking     in short  nothing is more useful for society  than to inspire man with  a contempt for death  to banish from his mind the false ideas he has of  its consequences  the fear of death can never do more than make  cowards  the fear of its consequences will make nothing but fanatics  or melancholy beings  who are useless to themselves  unprofitable to  others  death is a resource that ought not by any means to be taken away  from oppressed virtue  which the injustice of man frequently reduces  to despair  if man feared death less  he would neither be a slave nor  superstitious  truth would find defenders more zealous  the rights of  mankind would be more hardily sustained  virtue would be intrepidly  upheld  error would be more powerfully opposed  tyranny would be  banished from nations  cowardice nourishes it  fear perpetuates it  in  fact   man can neither be contented nor happy whilst his opinions shall  oblige him to tremble              chap  xv      of man s true interest  or of the ideas he forms to himself of  happiness   man cannot be happy without virtue        utility  as has been before observed  ought to be the only standard of  the judgment of man  to be useful  is to contribute to the happiness  of his fellow creatures  to be prejudicial  is to further their  misery  this granted  let us examine if the principles we have hitherto  established be prejudicial or advantageous  useful or useless  to the  human race  if man unceasingly seeks after his happiness  he can only  approve of that which procures for him his object  or furnishes him the  means by which it is to be obtained     what has been already said will serve in fixing our ideas upon what  constitutes this happiness  it has been already shewn that it is only  continued pleasure  but in order that an object may please  it is  necessary that the impressions it makes  the perceptions it gives   the ideas which it leaves  in short  that the motion it excites in man  should be analogous to his organization  conformable to his temperament   assimilated to his individual nature   modified as it is by habit   determined as it is by an infinity of circumstances  it is necessary  that the action of the object by which he is moved  or of which the idea  remains with him  far from enfeebling him  far from annihilating his  feelings  should tend to strengthen him  it is necessary  that without  fatiguing his mind  exhausting his faculties  or deranging his organs   this object should impart to his machine that degree of activity for  which it continually has occasion  what is the object that unites  all these qualities  where is the man whose organs are susceptible  of continual agitation without being fatigued  without experiencing a  painful sensation  without sinking  man is always willing to be warned  of his existence in the most lively manner  as long as he can be so  without pain  what do i say  he consents frequently to suffer  rather  than not feel  he accustoms himself to a thousand things which at first  must have affected him in a disagreeable manner  but which frequently  end either by converting themselves into wants  or by no longer  affecting him any way  of this truth tobacco  coffee  and above all  brandy furnish examples  this is the reason he runs to see tragedies   that he witnesses the execution of criminals  in short  the desire  of feeling  of being powerfully moved  appears to be the principle of  curiosity  of that avidity with which man seizes on the marvellous   of that earnestness with which he clings to the supernatural  of the  disposition he evinces for the incomprehensible  where  indeed  can  he always find objects in nature capable of continually supplying  the stimulus requisite to keep him in activity  that shall be ever  proportioned to the state of his own organization  which his extreme  mobility renders subject to perpetual variation  the most lively  pleasures are always the least durable  seeing they are those which  exhaust him most     that man should be uninterruptedly happy  it would be requisite that his  powers were infinite  it would require that to his mobility he joined  a vigor  attached a solidity  which nothing could change  or else it is  necessary that the objects from which he receives impulse  should either  acquire or lose properties  according to the different states through  which his machine is successively obliged to pass  it would need that  the essences of beings should be changed in the same proportion as  his dispositions  should be submitted to the continual influence of a  thousand causes  which modify him without his knowledge  and in despite  of himself  if  at each moment  his machine undergoes changes more  or less marked  which are ascribable to the different degrees of  elasticity  of density  of serenity of the atmosphere  to the portion  of igneous fluid circulating through his blood  to the harmony of his  organs  to the order that exists between the various parts of his body   if  at every period of his existence  his nerves have not the same  tensions  his fibres the same elasticity  his mind the same activity   his imagination the same ardour   c  it is evident that the same causes  in preserving to him only the same qualities  cannot always affect him  in the same manner  here is the reason why those objects that please  him in one season displease him in another  these objects have not  themselves sensibly changed  but his organs  his dispositions  his  ideas  his mode of seeing  his manner of feeling  have changed   such is  the source of man s inconstancy     if the same objects are not constantly in that state competent to form  the happiness of the same individual  it is easy to perceive that they  are yet less in a capacity to please all men  or that the same happiness  cannot be suitable to all  beings already various by their temperament   unlike in their faculties  diversified in their organization  different  in their imagination  dissimilar in their ideas  of distinct opinions   of contrary habits  which an infinity of circumstances  whether physical  or moral  have variously modified  must necessarily form very different  notions of happiness  those of a miser cannot be the same as those of  a prodigal  those of a voluptuary  the same as those of one who is  phlegmatic  those of an intemperate  the same as those of a rational  man  who husbands his health  the happiness of each  is in consequence  composed of his natural organization  and of those circumstances  of  those habits  of those ideas  whether true or false  that have modified  him  this organization and these circumstances  never being the same  in any two men  it follows  that what is the object of one man s views   must be indifferent  or even displeasing to another  thus  as we  have before said  no one can be capable of judging of that which may  contribute to the felicity of his fellow man      interest  is the object to which each individual according to his  temperament and his own peculiar ideas  attaches his welfare  from which  it will be perceived that this interest is never more than that which  each contemplates as necessary to his happiness  it must  therefore  be  concluded  that no man is totally without interest  that of the miser to  amass wealth  that of the prodigal to dissipate it  the interest of the  ambitious is to obtain power  that of the modest philosopher to enjoy  tranquillity  the interest of the debauchee is to give himself up   without reserve  to all sorts of pleasure  that of the prudent man  to  abstain from those which may injure him  the interest of the wicked is  to gratify his passions at any price  that of the virtuous to merit  by his conduct the love  to elicit by his actions the approbation of  others  to do nothing that can degrade himself in his own eyes     thus  when it is said that  interest is the only motive of human  actions   it is meant to indicate that each man labours after his own  manner  to his own peculiar happiness  that he places it in some object  either visible or concealed  either real or imaginary  that the whole  system of his conduct is directed to its attainment  this granted  no  man can be called disinterested  this appellation is only applied to  those of whose motives we are ignorant  or whose interest we approve   thus the man who finds a greater pleasure in assisting his friends in  misfortune than preserving in his coffers useless treasure  is called  generous  faithful  and disinterested  in like manner all men are  denominated disinterested  who feel their glory far more precious than  their fortune  in short  all men are designated disinterested who place  their happiness in making sacrifices which man considers costly  because  he does not attach the same value to the object for which the sacrifice  is made     man frequently judges very erroneously of the interest of others  either  because the motives that animate them are too complicated for him to  unravel  or because to be enabled to judge of them fairly  it is needful  to have the same eyes  the same organs the same passions  the same  opinions  nevertheless  obliged to form his judgment of the actions  of mankind  by their effect on himself  he approves the interest that  actuates them whenever the result is advantageous for his species   thus  he admires valour  generosity  the love of liberty  great talents   virtue   c  he then only approves of the objects in which the beings  he applauds have placed their happiness  he approves these dispositions  even when he is not in a capacity to feel their effects  but in this  judgment he is not himself disinterested  experience  reflection  habit   reason  have given him a taste for morals  and he finds as much pleasure  in being witness to a great and generous action  as the man of  virtu   finds in the sight of a fine picture of which he is not the proprietor   he who has formed to himself a habit of practising virtue  is a man who  has unceasingly before his eyes the interest that he has in meriting  the affection  in deserving the esteem  in securing the assistance of  others  as well as to love and esteem himself  impressed with these  ideas which have become habitual to him  he abstains even from concealed  crimes  since these would degrade him in his own eyes  he resembles a  man who having from his infancy contracted the habit of cleanliness   would be painfully affected at seeing himself dirty  even when no one  should witness it  the honest man is he to whom truth has shewn his  interest or his happiness in a mode of acting that others are obliged  to love  are under the necessity to approve for their own peculiar  interest     these principles  duly developed  are the true basis of morals  nothing  is more chimerical than those which are founded upon imaginary motives  placed out of nature  or upon innate sentiments  which some speculators  have regarded as anterior to man s experience  as wholly independant of  those advantages which result to him from its use  it is the essence of  man to love himself  to tend to his own conservation  to seek to render  his existence happy  thus interest  or the desire of happiness  is the  only real motive of all his actions  this interest depends upon his  natural organization  rests itself upon his wants  is bottomed upon his  acquired ideas  springs from the habits he has contracted  he is without  doubt in error  when either a vitiated organization or false opinions  shew him his welfare in objects either useless or injurious to himself   as well as to others  he marches steadily in the paths of virtue when  true ideas have made him rest his happiness on a conduct useful to  his species  in that which is approved by others  which renders him an  interesting object to his associates   morals  would be a vain science  if it did not incontestibly prove to man that  his interest consists in  being virtuous   obligation of whatever kind  can only be founded upon  the probability or the certitude of either obtaining a good or avoiding  an evil     indeed  in no one instant of his duration  can a sensible  an  intelligent being  either lose sight of his own preservation or forget  his own welfare  he owes happiness to himself  but experience quickly  proves to him  that bereaved of assistance  quite alone  left entirely  to himself  he cannot procure all those objects which are requisite to  his felicity  he lives with sensible  with intelligent beings  occupied  like himself with their own peculiar happiness  but capable of assisting  him  in obtaining those objects he most desires  he discovers that these  beings will not be favorable to his views  but when they find their  interest involved  from which he concludes  that his own happiness  demands  that his own wants render it necessary he should conduct  himself at all times in a manner suitable to conciliate the attachment   to obtain the approbation  to elicit the esteem  to secure the  assistance of those beings who are most capacitated to further his  designs  he perceives  that it is man who is most necessary to the  welfare of man  that to induce him to join in his interests  he ought to  make him find real advantages in recording his projects  but to procure  real advantages to the beings of the human species  is to have virtue   the reasonable man  therefore  is obliged to feel that it is his  interest to be virtuous   virtue is only the art of rendering  himself happy  by the felicity of others   the virtuous man is he who  communicates happiness to those beings who are capable of rendering his  own condition happy  who are necessary to his conservation  who have the  ability to procure him a felicitous existence     such  then  is the true foundation of all morals  merit and virtue are  founded upon the nature of man  have their dependance upon his wants  it  is virtue alone that can render him truly happy  without virtue society  can neither be useful nor indeed subsist  it can only have real utility  when it assembles beings animated with the desire of pleasing each  other  and disposed to labour to their reciprocal advantage  there  exists no comfort in those families whose members are not in the  happy disposition to lend each other mutual succours  who have not a  reciprocity of feeling that stimulates them to assist one another  that  induces them to cling to each other  to support the sorrows of life   to unite their efforts  to put away those evils to which nature has  subjected them  the conjugal bonds  are sweet only in proportion as they  identify the interest of two beings  united by the want of legitimate  pleasure  from whence results the maintenance of political society  and  the means of furnishing it with citizens  friendship has charms only  when it more particularly associates two virtuous beings  that is to  say  animated with the sincere desire of conspiring to their reciprocal  happiness  in short  it is only by displaying virtue  that man can merit  the benevolence  can win the confidence  can gain the esteem  of all  those with whom he has relation  in a word  no man can be independently  happy     indeed  the happiness of each human individual depends on those  sentiments to which he gives birth  on those feelings which he nourishes  in the beings amongst whom his destiny has placed him  grandeur may  dazzle them  power may wrest from them an involuntary homage  force may  compel an unwilling obedience  opulence may seduce mean  may attract  venal souls  but it is humanity  it is benevolence  it is compassion  it  is equity  that unassisted by these  can without efforts obtain for  him  from those by whom he is surrounded  those delicious sentiments of  attachments  those soothing feelings of tenderness  those sweet ideas of  esteem  of which all reasonable men feel the necessity  to be virtuous  then  is to place his interest in that which accords with the interest  of others  it is to enjoy those benefits  to partake of that pleasure  which he himself diffuses over his fellows  he whom  his nature  his  education  his reflections  his habits  have rendered susceptible of  these dispositions  and to whom his circumstances have given him the  faculty of gratifying them  becomes an interesting object to all those  who approach him  he enjoys every instant  he reads with satisfaction  the contentment  he contemplates with pleasure the joy which he has  diffused over all countenances  his wife  his children  his friends  his  servants greet him with gay  serene faces  indicative of that content   harbingers of that peace  which he recognizes for his own work  every  thing that environs him is ready to partake his pleasures  to share  his pains  cherished  respected  looked up to by others  every thing  conducts him to agreeable reflections  he knows the rights he has  acquired over their hearts  he applauds himself for being the source  of a felicity that captivates all the world  his own condition  his  sentiments of self love  become an hundred times more delicious when he  sees them participated by all those with whom his destiny has connected  him  the habit of virtue creates for him no wants but those which virtue  itself suffices to satisfy  it is thus that  virtue is always its own  peculiar reward   that it remunerates itself with all the advantages  which it incessantly procures for others     it will be said  and perhaps even proved  that under the present  constitution of things  virtue far from procuring the welfare of those  who practice it frequently plunges man into misfortune  often places  continual obstacles to his felicity  that almost every where it is  without recompence  what do i say  a thousand examples could be adduced  as evidence  that in almost every country it is hated  persecuted   obliged to lament the ingratitude of human nature  i reply with avowing   that by a necessary consequence of the errors of his race  virtue  rarely conducts man to those objects in which the uninformed make their  happiness consist  the greater number of societies  too frequently ruled  by those whose ignorance makes them abuse their power   whose prejudices  render them enemies of virtue   who flattered by sycophants  secure in  the impunity their actions enjoy  commonly lavish their esteem  bestow  their kindness  on none but the most unworthy objects  reward only the  most frivolous  recompence none but the most prejudicial qualities  and  hardly ever accord that justice to merit which is unquestionably its  due  but the truly honest man  is neither ambitious of renumeration  nor  sedulous of the suffrages of a society thus badly constituted  contented  with domestic happiness  he seeks not to augment relations  which would  do no more than increase his danger  he knows that a vitiated community  is a whirlwind  with which an honest man cannot co order himself  he  therefore steps aside  quits the beaten path  by continuing in which he  would infallibly be crushed  he does all the good of which he is capable  in his sphere  he leaves the road free to the wicked  who are willing  to wade through its mire  he laments the heavy strokes they inflict on  themselves  he applauds mediocrity that affords him security  he pities  those nations made miserable by their errors   rendered unhappy by those  passions which are the fatal but necessary consequence  he sees they  contain nothing but wretched citizens  who far from cultivating their  true interest  far from labouring to their mutual felicity  far from  feeling the real value of virtue  unconscious how dear it ought to be  to them  do nothing but either openly attack  or secretly injure it   in short  who detests a quality which would restrain their disorderly  propensities     in saying that virtue is its own peculiar reward  it is simply meant to  announce  that in a society whose views were guided by truth  trained  by experience  conducted by reason  each individual would be acquainted  with his real interests  would understand the true end of association   would have sound motives to perform his duties  find real advantages in  fulfilling them  in fact  it would be convinced  that to render himself  solidly happy  he should occupy his actions with the welfare of his  fellows  by their utility merit their esteem  elicit their kindness  and  secure their assistance  in a well constituted society  the government   the laws  education  example  would all conspire to prove to the  citizen  that the nation of which he forms a part  is a whole that  cannot be happy  that cannot subsist without virtue  experience would   at each step  convince him that the welfare of its parts can only result  from that of the whole body corporate  justice would make him feel  that  no society  can be advantageous to its members  where the volition of  wills in those who act  is not so conformable to the interests of the  whole  as to produce an advantageous re action     but  alas  by the confusion which the errors of man have carried into  his ideas  virtue disgraced  banished  and persecuted  finds not one  of those advantages it has a right to expect  man is indeed shewn those  rewards for it in a future life  of which he is almost always deprived  in his actual existence  it is thought necessary to deceive  considered  proper to seduce  right to intimidate him  in order to induce him to  follow that virtue which every thing renders incommodious to him  he  is fed with distant hopes  in order to solicit him to practice virtue   while contemplation of the world makes it hateful to him  he is  alarmed by remote terrors  to deter him from committing evil  which his  associates paint as amiable  which all conspires to render necessary   it is thus that politics  thus that superstition  by the formation of  chimeras  by the creation of fictitious interests pretend to supply  those true  those real motives which nature furnishes   which  experience would point out   which an enlightened government should  hold forth   which the law ought to enforce   which instruction should  sanction   which example should encourage  which rational opinions would  render pleasant  man  blinded by his passions  not less dangerous than  necessary  led away by precedent  authorised by custom  enslaved by  habit  pays no attention to these uncertain promises  is regardless of  the menaces held out  the actual interests of his immediate pleasures   the force of his passions  the inveteracy of his habits  always rise  superior to the distant interests pointed out in his future welfare   or the remote evils with which he is threatened  which always appear  doubtful  whenever he compares them with present advantages     thus  superstition  far from making man virtuous by principle  does  nothing more than impose upon him a yoke as severe as it is useless   it  is borne by none but enthusiasts  or by the pusillanimous  who  without  becoming better  tremblingly champ the feeble bit put into their mouth   who are either rendered unhappy by their opinions  or dangerous by their  tenets  indeed  experience  that faithful monitor  incontestibly  proves  that superstition is a dyke inadequate to resist the torrent  of corruption  to which so many accumulated causes give an irresistible  force  nay more  does not this superstition itself augment the public  disorder  by the dangerous passions which it lets loose  by the conduct  which it sanctions  by the actions which it consecrates  virtue  in  almost every climate  is confined to some few rational souls  who have  sufficient strength of mind to resist the stream of prejudice  who are  contented by remunerating themselves with the benefits they difuse over  society  whose temperate dispositions are gratified with the suffrages  of a small number of virtuous approvers  in short  who are detached  from those frivolous advantages which the injustice of society but too  commonly accords only to baseness  which it rarely bestows  except to  intrigue  with which in general it rewards nothing but crime     in despite of the injustice that reigns in the world  there are   however  some virtuous men in the bosom even of the most degenerate  nations  notwithstanding the general depravity  there are some  benevolent beings  still enamoured of virtue  who are fully acquainted  with its true value  who are sufficiently enlightened to know that  it exacts homage even from its enemies  who to use the language of  ecclesiastes    rejoice in their own works    who are  at least  happy in  possessing contented minds  who are satisfied with concealed pleasures   those internal recompences of which no earthly power is competent to  deprive them  the honest man acquires a right to the esteem  has a just  claim to the veneration  wins the confidence  gains the love  even of  those whose conduct is exposed by a contrast with his own  in short   vice is obliged to cede to virtue  of which it blushingly  though  unwillingly  acknowledges the superiority  independent of this  ascendancy so gentle  of this superiority so grand  of this pre eminence  so infallible  when even the whole universe should be unjust to him   when even every tongue should cover him with venom  when even every arm  should menace him with hostility  there yet remains to the honest man  the sublime advantage of loving his own conduct  the ineffable pleasure  of esteeming himself  the unalloyed gratification of diving with  satisfaction into the recesses of his own heart  the tranquil delight  of contemplating his own actions with that delicious complacency that  others ought to do  if they were not hood winked  no power is adequate  to ravish from him the merited esteem of himself  no authority is  sufficiently potent to give it to him when he deserves it not  the  mightiest monarch cannot lend stability to this esteem  when it is  not well founded  it is then a ridiculous sentiment  it ought to be  considered  it really is   vanity and vexation of spirit    it is  not wisdom  but folly in the extreme  it ought to be censured when it  displays itself in a mode that is mortifying to its neighbour  in a  manner that is troublesome to others  it is then called arrogance  it  is called vanity  but when it cannot be condemned  when it is known for  legitimate when it is discovered to have a solid foundation  when it  bottoms itself upon talents  when it rises upon great actions that are  useful to the community  when it erects its edifice upon virtue  even  though society should not set these merits at their just price  it is  noble pride  elevation of mind  and grandeur of soul     of what consequence then  is it to listen to those superstitious beings   those enemies to man s happiness  who have been desirous of destroying  it  even in the inmost recesses of his heart  who have prescribed to him  hatred of his follower  who have filled him with contempt for himself   who pretend to wrest from the honest man that self respect which is  frequently the only reward that remains to virtue  in a perverse world   to annihilate in him this sentiment  so full in justice  this love  of himself  is to break the most powerful spring  to weaken the most  efficacious stimulus  that urges him to act right  that spurs him on to  do good to his fellow mortals  what motive  indeed  except it be this   remains for him in the greater part of human societies  is not  virtue discouraged  is not honesty contemned  is not audacious crime  encouraged  is not subtle intrigue eulogized  is not cunning vice  rewarded  is not love of the public weal taxed as folly  exactitude in  fulfilling duties looked upon as a bubble  is not compassion laughed  to scorn  are not traitors distinguished by public honors  is not  negligence of morals applauded   sensibility derided   tenderness  scoffed   conjugal fidelity jeered   sincerity despised   enviolable  friendship treated with ridicule  while seduction  adultery   hard heartedness  punic faith  avarice  and fraud  stalk forth  unabashed  decked in gorgeous array  lauded by the world  man must have  motives for action  he neither acts well nor ill  but with a view to his  own happiness  that which he judges will conduce to this   consummation  so devoutly to be wished    he thinks his interest  he does nothing  gratuitously  when reward for useful actions is withheld from him  he is  reduced either to become as abandoned as others  or else to remunerate  himself with his own applause     this granted  the honest man can never be completely unhappy  he can  never be entirely deprived of the recompence which is his due  virtue is  competent to repay him for all the benefits he may bestow on others   can amply make up to him all the happiness denied him by public opinion    but nothing can compensate to him the want of virtue   it does not  follow that the honest man will be exempted from afflictions  like  the  wicked  he is subject to physical evils  he may pine in indigence  he  may be deprived of friendship  he may be worn down with disease  he may  frequently be the subject of calumny  he may be the victim to injustice   he may be treated with ingratitude  he may be exposed to hatred  but in  the midst of all his misfortunes  in the very bosom of his sorrows   in the extremity of his vexation  he finds support in himself  he is  contented with his own conduct  he respects himself  he feels his own  dignity  he knows the equity of his rights  he consoles himself with  the confidence inspired by the justness of his cause  he cheers himself  amidst the most sullen circumstances  these supports are not calculated  for the wicked  they avail him nothing  equally liable with the honest  man to infirmities  equally submitted to the caprices of his destiny   equally the sport of a fluctuating world  he finds the recesses of his  own heart filled with dreadful alarms  diseased with care  cankered  with solitude  corroded with regret  gnawed by remorse  he dies within  himself  his conscience sustains him not but loads him with reproach   his mind  overwhelmed  sinks beneath its own turpitude  his reflection  is the bitter dregs of hemlock  maddening anguish holds him to the  mirror that shews him his own deformity  that recalls unhallowed deeds   gloomy thoughts rush on his too faithful memory  despondence benumbs  him  his body  simultaneously assailed on all sides  bends under the  storm of  his own unruly passions  at last despair grapples him to her  filthy bosom  he flies from himself  the honest man is not an insensible  stoic  virtue does not procure impassibility  honesty gives no exemption  from misfortune  but it enables him to bear cheerly up against it  to  cast off despair  to keep his own company  if he is infirm  if he is  worn with disease  he has less to complain of than the vicious being  who is oppressed with sickness  who is enfeebled by years  if he is  indigent  he is less unhappy in his poverty  if he is in disgrace  he  can endure it with fortitude  he is not overwhelmed by its pressure   like the wretched slave to crime     thus the happiness of each individual depends on the cultivation of his  temperament  nature makes both the happy and the unhappy  it is culture  that gives value to the soil nature has formed  it is instruction that  makes the fruit it produces palatable  it is reflection that makes it  useful  for man to be happily born  is to have received from nature a  sound body  organs that act with precision  a just mind  a heart  whose passions are analogous  whose desires are conformable to the  circumstances in which his destiny has placed him  nature  then  has  done every thing for him  when she has joined to these faculties the  quantum of vigour  the portion of energy  sufficient to enable him to  obtain those proper things  which his station  his mode of thinking   his temperament  have rendered desirable  nature has made him a fatal  present  when she has filled his sanguinary vessels with an over heated  fluid  when she has given him an imagination too active  when she has  infused into him desires too impetuous  when he has a hankering  after objects either impossible or improper to be obtained under  his circumstances  or which at least he cannot procure without those  incredible efforts  that either place his own welfare in danger or  disturb the repose of society  the most happy man  is commonly he who  possesses a peaceful soul  who only desires those things which he can  procure by labour  suitable to maintain his activity  which he can  obtain without causing those shocks  that are either too violent for  society  or troublesome to his associates  a philosopher whose wants are  easily satisfied  who is a stranger  to ambition  who is contented with  the limited circle of a small number of friends  is  without doubt a  being much more happily constituted than an ambitious conqueror  whose  greedy imagination is reduced to despair by having only one world to  ravage  he who is happily born  or whom nature has rendered susceptible  of being conveniently modified  is not a being injurious to society  it  is generally disturbed by men who are unhappily born  whose organization  renders them turbulent  who are discontented with their destiny  who are  inebriated with their own licentious passions  who are infatuated with  their own vile schemes  who are smitten with difficult enterprises  who  set the world in combustion  to gather imaginary benefits in order to  attain which they must inflict he heaviest curses on mankind  but in  which they make their own happiness consist  an alexander requires the  destruction of empires  nations to be deluged with blood  cities to  be laid in ashes  its inhabitants to be exterminated  to content that  passion for glory  of which he has formed to himself a false idea   but which his too ardent imagination  his too vehement mind anxiously  thirsts after  for a diogenes there needs only a tub with the liberty  of appearing whimsical  a socrates wants nothing but the pleasure of  forming disciples to virtue     man by his organization is a being to whom motion is always necessary   he must therefore always desire it  this is the reason why too much  facility in procuring the objects of his search  renders them quickly  insipid  to feel happiness  it is necessary to make efforts to obtain  it  to find charms in its enjoyment  it is necessary that the desire  should be whetted by obstacles  he is presently disgusted with those  benefits which have cost him but little pains  the expectation of  happiness  the labour requisite to procure it  the varied prospects it  holds forth  the multiplied pictures which his imagination forms to him   supply his brain with that motion for which it has occasion  this gives  impulse to his organs  puts his whole machine into activity  exercises  his faculties  sets all his springs in play  in a word  puts him  into that agreeable activity  for the want of which the enjoyment of  happiness itself cannot compensate him  action is the true element of  the human mind  as soon as it ceases to act  it falls into disgust   sinks into lassitude  his soul has the same occasion for ideas  his  stomach has for aliment     thus the impulse given him by desire  is itself a great benefit  it is  to the mind what exercise is to the body  without it he would not derive  any pleasure in the aliments presented to him  it is thirst that renders  the pleasure of drinking so agreeable  life is a perpetual circle of  regenerated desires and wants satisfied  repose is only a pleasure to  him who labours  it is a source of weariness  the cause of sorrow   the spring of vice to him who has nothing to do  to enjoy without  interruption is not to enjoy any thing  the man who has nothing to  desire is certainly more unhappy than he who suffers     these reflections  grounded upon experience  drawn from the fountain of  truth  ought to prove to man  that good as well as evil depends on the  essence of things  happiness to be felt cannot be continued  labour  is necessary  to make intervals between his pleasures  his body has  occasion for exercise  to co order him with the beings who surround him   his heart must have desires  trouble alone can give him the right  relish of his welfare  it is this which puts in the shadows  this which  furnishes the true perspective to the picture of human life  by an  irrevocable law of his destiny  man is obliged to be discontented with  his present condition  to make efforts to change it  to reciprocally  envy that felicity which no individual enjoys perfectly  thus the  poor man envies the opulence of his richer neighbour  although this is  frequently more unhappy than his needy maligner  thus the rich man views  with pain the advantages of a poverty  which he sees active  healthy   and frequently jocund  even in the bosom of penury     if man was perfectly contented  there would no longer be any activity in  the world  it is necessary that he should desire  it is requisite that  he should act  it is incumbent he should labour  in order that he may  be happy  such is the course of nature of which the life consists in  action  human societies can only subsist  by the continual exchange of  those things in which man places his happiness  the poor man is obliged  to desire  he is necessitated to labour  that he may procure what he  knows is requisite to the preservation of his existence  the primary  wants given to him by nature  are to nourish himself  clothe himself   lodge himself  and propagate his species  has he satisfied these  he  is quickly obliged to create others entirely new  or rather  his  imagination only refines upon the first  he seeks to diversify them  he  is willing to give them fresh zest  arrived at opulence  when he has run  over the whole circle of wants  when he has completely exhausted their  combinations  he falls into disgust  dispensed from labour  his body  amasses humours  destitute of desires  his heart feels a languor   deprived of activity  he is obliged to participate his riches  with  beings more active  more laborious than himself  these  following their  own peculiar interests  take upon themselves the task of labouring  for his advantage  of procuring for him means to satisfy his want   of ministering to his caprices  in order to remove the languor that  oppresses him  it is thus the great  the rich excite the energies  give  play to the activity  rouse the faculties  spur on the industry of the  indigent  these labour to their own peculiar welfare by working for  others  thus the desire of ameliorating his condition  renders man  necessary to his fellow man  thus wants  always regenerating  never  satisfied  are the principles of life   the soul of activity   the  source of health   the basis of society  if each individual was  competent to the supply of his own exigencies  there would be no  occasion for him to congregate in society  but it is his wants  his  desires  his whims  that place him in a state of dependence on others   these are the causes that each individual  in order to further his  own peculiar interest  is obliged to be useful to those  who have the  capability of procuring for him the objects which he himself has not  a  nation is nothing more than the union of a great number of individuals   connected with each other by the reciprocity of their wants  by their  mutual desire of pleasure  the most happy man is he who has the fewest  wants  and who has the most numerous means of satisfying them  the  man who would be truly rich  has no need to increase his fortune  it  suffices he should diminish his wants     in the individuals of the human species  as well as in political  society  the progression of wants  is a thing absolutely necessary  it  is founded upon the essence of man  it is requisite that the natural  wants once satisfied  should be replaced by those which he calls   imaginary  or wants of the fancy   these become as necessary to his  happiness as the first  custom  which permits the native american to go  quite naked  obliges the more civilized inhabitant of europe to clothe  himself  the poor man contents himself with very simple attire  which  equally serve him for winter and for summer  for autumn and for spring   the rich man desires to have garments suitable to each mutation of  these seasons  he would experience pain if he had not the convenience  of changing his raiment with every variation of his climate  he would be  wretched if he was obliged to wear the same habiliments in the heat of  summer  which he uses in the winter  in short  he would be unhappy  if the expence and variety of his costume did not display to the  surrounding multitude his opulence  mark his rank  announce his  superiority  it is thus habit multiplies  the wants of the wealthy  it  is thus that vanity itself becomes a want which sets a thousand hands  in  motion  a thousand heads to work  who are all eager to gratify its  cravings  in short  this very vanity procures for the necessitous man   the means of subsisting at the expense of his opulent neighbours he  who is accustomed to pomp  who is used to ostentatious splendour  whose  habits are luxurious  whenever he is deprived of these insignia of  opulence  to which he has attached the idea of happiness  finds himself  just as unhappy as the needy wretch who has not wherewith to cover his  nakedness  the civilized nations of the present day were in their origin  savages composed of erratic tribes   mere wanderers who were occupied  with war  employed in  the chace  painfully obliged to seek precarious  subsistence by hunting in those woods which the industry of their  successors has cleared  which their labour has covered with yellow  waving ears of nutritious corn  in time they have become stationary   they first applied themselves to agriculture  afterwards to commerce   by degrees they have refined on their primitive wants  extended their  sphere of action  given birth to a thousand new wants  imagined a  thousand new means to satisfy them  this is the natural course  the  necessary progression  the regular march of active beings  who cannot  live without feeling  who to be happy  must of necessity diversify their  sensations  in proportion as man s wants multiply the means to satisfy  them becomes more difficult  he is obliged to depend on a greater  number of his fellow creatures  his interest obliges him to rouse their  activity  to engage them to concur with his views  consequently he is  obliged to procure for them those objects by which they can be excited   he is under the necessity of contenting their desires  which increase  like his own  by the very food that satisfies them  the savage  needs only put forth his hand to gather the fruit that offers  itself spontaneously to his reach  this he finds sufficient for his  nourishment  the opulent citizen of a flourishing society is obliged to  set innumerable hands to work to produce the sumptuous repast  the four  quarters of the globe are ransacked to procure the far fetched viands  become necessary to revive his languid appetite  the merchant   the sailor  the mechanic  leave nothing unattempted to flatter his  inordinate vanity  from this it will appear  that in the same proportion  the wants of man are multiplied  he is obliged to augment the means to  satisfy them  riches are nothing more than the measure of a convention   by the assistance of which man is enabled to make a great number of  his fellows concur in the gratification of his desires  by which he  is capacitated to invite them  for their own peculiar interests  to  contribute to his pleasures  what  in fact  does the rich man do   except announce to the needy  that he can furnish him with the means of  subsistence if he consents to lend himself to his will  what does the  man in power  except shew to others  that he is in a state to supply  the requisites to render them happy  sovereigns  nobles  men of wealth   appear to be happy  only because they possess the ability  are masters  of the motives sufficient to determine a great number of individuals to  occupy themselves with their respective felicity     the more things are considered the more man will be convinced that his  false opinion are the true source of his misery  the clearer it will  appear to him that happiness is so rare  only because he attaches it  to objects either indifferent or useless to his welfare  which  when  enjoyed  convert themselves into real evils  which afflict him  which  become the cause of his misfortune      riches  are indifferent in themselves  it is only by their application   by the purposes they compass  that they either become objects of utility  to man  or are rendered prejudicial to his welfare      money   useless to the savage who understands not its value  is amassed  by the miser  for fear it should be employed uselessly  lest it should  be squandered by the prodigal  or dissipated by the voluptuary  who make  no other use of it than to purchase infirmities  to buy regret     pleasures are nothing for the man who is incapable of feeling them   they become real evils when they are too freely indulged  when they  are destructive to his health   when they derange the economy of  his machine   when they entail diseases on himself and on his  posterity   when they make him neglect his duties   when they render him  despicable in the eyes of others     power is nothing in itself  it is useless to man if he does not avail  himself of it to promote his own peculiar felicity  by augmenting the  happiness of his species  it becomes fatal to him as soon as he abuses  it  it becomes odious whenever he employs it to render others miserable   it is always the cause of his own misery whenever he stretches it beyond  the due bounds prescribed by nature     for want of being enlightened on his true interest  the man who enjoys  all the means of rendering himself completely happy  scarcely ever  discovers the secret of making those means truly subservient to his own  peculiar felicity  the art of enjoying  is that which of all others is  least understood  man should learn this art before he begins to desire   the earth is covered with individuals who only occupy themselves with  the care of procuring the means without ever being acquainted with the  end  all the world desire fortune  solicit power  seek after pleasure   yet very few  indeed  are those whom objects render truly happy     it is quite natural in man  it is extremely reasonable  it is absolutely  necessary  to desire those things which can contribute to augment the  sum of his felicity   pleasure  riches  power   are objects worthy his  ambition  deserving his most strenuous efforts  when he has learned how  to employ them  when he has acquired the faculty of making them render  his existence really more agreeable  it is impossible to censure him who  desires them  to despise him who commands them  but when to obtain them  he employs odious means  or when after he has obtained them he makes a  pernicious use of them  injurious to himself  prejudicial to others  let  him wish for power  let him seek after grandeur  let him be ambitious  of reputation  when he can shew just pretensions to them  when he can  obtain them  without making the purchase at the expence of his own  repose  or that of the beings with whom he lives  let him desire riches   when he knows how to make a use of them that is truly advantageous for  himself  really beneficial for others  but never let him employ those  means to procure them of which he may be ashamed  with which he may be  obliged to reproach himself  which may draw upon him the hatred of his  associates  or which may render him obnoxious to the castigation of  society  let him always recollect  that his solid happiness should rest  its foundations upon its own esteem   upon the advantages he procures  for others  above all  never let him for a moment forget  that of all  the objects to which his ambition may point  the most impracticable for  a being who lives in society  is that of  attempting to render himself  exclusively happy              chap  xvi     the errors of man   upon what constitutes happiness   the true source  of his evil   remedies that may be applied        reason by no means forbids man from forming capacious desires  ambition  is a passion useful to his species when it has for  its object the  happiness of his race  great minds  elevated souls  are desirous of  acting on an extended sphere  geniuses who are powerful  beings who are  enlightened  men who are beneficent  distribute very widely their benign  influence  they must necessarily  in order to promote their own peculiar  felicity  render great numbers happy  so many princes fail to enjoy true  happiness only  because their feeble  narrow souls  are obliged to act  in a sphere too extensive for their energies  it is thus that by the  supineness  the indolence  the incapacity of their chiefs  nations  frequently pine in misery  are often submitted to masters  whose  exility of mind is as little calculated to promote their own immediate  happiness  as it is to further that of their miserable subjects  on  the other hand  souls too vehement  too much inflamed  too active  are  themselves tormented by the narrow sphere that confines them  their  ardour misplaced  becomes the scourge of the human race  alexander was  a monarch who was equally injurious to the earth  equally discontented  with his condition  as the indolent despot whom he dethroned  the souls  of neither were by any means commensurate with their sphere of action     the happiness of man will never be more than the result of the harmony  that subsists between his desires and his circumstances  the sovereign  power to him who knows not how to apply it to the advantage of his  citizens  is as nothing  it cannot even conduce to his own peculiar  happiness  if it renders him miserable  it is a real evil  if it  produces the misfortune of a portion of the human race  it is a  detestable abuse  the most powerful princes are ordinarily such  strangers to happiness  their subjects are commonly so unfortunate  only  because the first possess all the means of rendering themselves happy  without ever giving them activity  or because the only knowledge they  have of them  is their abuse  a wise man seated on a throne  would be  the most happy of mortals  a monarch is a man for whom his power  let  it be of whatever extent  cannot procure other organs  other modes of  feeling  than the meanest of his subjects  if he has an advantage  over them  it is by the grandeur  the variety  the multiplicity of the  objects with which he can occupy himself  which by giving perpetual  activity to his mind  can prevent it from decay  from falling into  sloth  if his soul is virtuous  if his mind is expansive  his ambition  finds continual food in the contemplation of the power he possesses   to unite by gentleness  to consolidate by kindness  the will of his  subjects with his own  to interest them in his own conservation  to  merit their affections   to draw forth the respect of strangers   to  render luminous the page of history  to elicit the eulogies of all  nations  to clothe the orphan   to dry the widow s tears  such are  the conquests that reason proposes to all those whose destiny it is to  govern the fate of empires  they are sufficiently grand to satisfy the  most ardent imagination  of a sublimity to gratify the most capacious  ambition  for a monarch they are paramount duties   kings are the most  happy of men  only because they have the power of making others happy   because they possess the means of multiplying the causes of legitimate  content with themselves     the advantages of the sovereign power are participated by all those who  contribute to the government of states  thus grandeur  rank  reputation   are desirable  are legitimate objects for all who are acquainted with  the means of rendering them subservient to their own peculiar felicity   they are useless  they are illegitimate to those ordinary men who  have neither the energy nor the capacity to employ them in a mode  advantageous to themselves  they are detestable whenever to obtain them  man compromises his own happiness  when he implicates the welfare of  society  this society itself is in an error every time it respects men  who only employ to its destruction  a power  the exercise of which it  ought never to approve but when it reaps from it substantial benefits     riches  useless to the miser  who is no more than their miserable  gaoler  prejudicial to the debauchee  for whom they only procure  infirmities  injurious to the voluptuary  to whom they only bring  disgust  whom they oppress with satiety  can in the hands of the honest  man produce unnumbered means of augmenting the sum of his happiness  but  before man covets wealth it is proper he should know how to employ it   money is only a token  a representative of happiness  to enjoy it is so  to use it as to make others happy  this is the great secret  this is the  talisman  this is the reality  money  according to the compact of man   procures for him all those benefits he can desire  there is only one   which it will not procure  that is   the knowledge how to apply it  properly   for man to have money  without the true secret how to  enjoy it  is to possess the key of a commodious palace to which he is  interdicted entrance  to lavish it  prodigally  is to throw the key  into the river  to make a bad use of it  is only to make it the means of  wounding himself  give the most ample treasures to the enlightened man   he will not be overwhelmed with them  if he has a capacious mind  if he  has a noble soul  he will only extend more widely his benevolence  he  will deserve the affection of a greater number of his fellow men  he  will attract the love  he will secure the homage  of all those who  surround him  he will restrain himself in his pleasures  in order that  he may be enabled truly to enjoy them  he will know that money  cannot re establish a soul worn out with enjoyment  cannot give fresh  elasticity to organs enfeebled by excess  cannot give fresh tension to  nerves grown flaccid by abuse  cannot invigorate a body enervated  by debauchery  cannot corroborate a machine  from thenceforth become  incapable of sustaining him  except by the necessity of privations  he  will know that the licentiousness of the voluptuary stifles pleasure in  its source  that all the treasure in the world cannot renew his senses     from this  it will be obvious  that nothing is more frivolous than the  declamations of a gloomy philosophy against the desire of power   nothing more absurd than the rant of superstition against the pursuit  of grandeur  nothing more inconsistent than homilies against the  acquisition of riches  nothing more unreasonable than dogmas that forbid  the enjoyment of pleasure  these objects are desirable for man  whenever  his situation allows him to make pretensions to them  they are useful  to society  conducive to public happiness  whenever he has acquired the  knowledge of making them turn to his own real advantage  reason cannot  censure him  virtue cannot despise him  when in order to obtain them   he never travels out of the road of truth  when in their acquisition   he wounds no one s interest  when he pursues only legitimate means  his  associates will applaud him  his contemporaries will esteem him  he will  respect himself  when he only employs their agency to secure his own  happiness  and that of his fellows  pleasure is a benefit  it is of  the essence of man to love  it is even rational when it renders his  existence really valuable to himself  when it does not injure him in his  own esteem  when its consequences are not grievous to others   riches   are the symbols of the great majority of the benefits of this life  they  become a reality in the hands of the man who has the clew to their just  application   power  is the most sterling of all benefits  when he who  is its depositary has received from nature a soul sufficiently noble  a  mind sufficiently elevated  a heart sufficiently benevolent  faculties  sufficiently energetic  above all  when he has derived from education a  true regard for virtue  that sacred love for truth which enables him to  extend his happy influence over whole nations  which by this means  he places in  a state of legitimate dependence on his will   man only  acquires the right of commanding men  when he renders them happy      the right of man over his fellow man can only be founded either upon the  actual happiness he secures to him  or that which he gives him reason to  hope he will procure for him  without this  the power he exercises would  be violence  usurpation  manifest tyranny  it is only upon the faculty  of rendering him happy  that legitimate authority builds its structure   without this it is the   baseless fabric of a vision   no man derives  from nature the right of commanding another   but it is voluntarily  accorded to those  from whom he expects his welfare   government  is the  right of commanding  conferred on the sovereign only for the advantage  of those who are governed  sovereigns are the defenders of the persons   the guardians of the property  the protectors of the liberty of their  subjects  this is the price of their obedience  it is only on this  condition these consent to obey  government would not be better than  a robbery whenever it availed itself of the powers confided to it   to render society unhappy   the empire of religion  is founded on the  opinion man entertains of its having power to render nations happy   government and religion are reasonable institutions  but only so   inasmuch as they equally contribute to the felicity of man  it would  be folly in him to submit himself to a yoke from which there resulted  nothing but evil  it would be folly to expect that man should bind  himself to misery  it would be rank injustice to oblige him to renounce  his rights without some corresponding advantage     the authority which a father exercises over his family is only founded  on the advantages which he is supposed to procure for it  rank  in  political society  has only for its basis the real or imaginary utility  of some citizens for which the others are willing to distinguish  them  agree to respect them  consent to obey them  the rich acquire  rights over the indigent  the wealthy claim the homage of the needy   only by virtue of the welfare they are conditioned to procure  them  genius  talents  science  arts  have rights over man  only  in consequence of their utility  of the delight they confer  of the  advantages they procure for society  in a word  it is happiness  it is  the expectation of happiness  it is its image that man cherishes  that  he esteems  that he unceasingly adores  monarchs  the rich  the great   may easily impose on him  may dazzle him  may intimidate him  but they  will never be able to obtain the voluntary submission of his heart   which alone can confer upon them legitimate rights  without they make  him experience real benefits  without they display virtue  utility is  nothing more than true happiness  to be useful is to be virtuous  to be  virtuous is to make others happy     the happiness which man derives from them is the invariable  the  necessary standard of his sentiments  for the beings of his species  for  the objects he desires  for the opinions he embrases  for those actions  on which he decides  he is the dupe of his prejudices every time he  ceases to avail himself of this standard to regulate his judgment  he  will never run the risk of deceiving himself  when he shall examine  strictly what is the real utility resulting to his species from the  religion  from the superstition  from the laws  from the institutions   from the inventions  from the various actions of all mankind     a superficial view may sometimes seduce him  but experience  aided  by reflection  will reconduct him to reason  which is incapable of  deceiving him  this teaches him that pleasure is a momentary happiness   which frequently becomes an evil  that evil is a fleeting trouble that  frequently becomes a good  it makes him understand the true nature of  objects  enables him to foresee the effects he may expect  it makes  him distinguish those desires to which his welfare permits him to lend  himself  from those to whose seduction he ought to make resistance  in  short  it will always convince him that the true interest of intelligent  beings  who love happiness  who desire to render their own existence  felicitous  demands that they should root out all those phantoms   abolish all those chimerical ideas  destroy all those prejudices  which  by traducing virtue  obstruct their felicity in this world     if he consults experience  he will perceive that it is in illusions  in  false opinions  rendered sacred by time  that he ought to search out the  source of that multitude of evils which almost every where overwhelms  mankind  from ignorance of natural causes  man has created imaginary  causes  not knowing to what cause to attribute thunder  he ascribed it  to an imaginary being whom he called jupiter  imposture availing itself  of this disposition  rendered these causes terrible to him  these fatal  ideas haunted him without rendering him better  made him tremble without  either benefit to himself or to others  filled his mind with chimeras  that opposed themselves to the progress of his reason  that prevented  him from really seeking after his happiness  his vain fears rendered him  the slave of those who deceived him  under pretence of consulting his  welfare  he committed evil  because they persuaded him his gods demanded  sacrifices  he lived in misfortune  because they made him believe these  gods condemned him to be miserable  the slave of beings  to which his  own imagination had given birth  he never dared to disentangle himself  from his chains  the artful ministers of these divinities gave him to  understand that stupidity  the renunciation of reason  sloth of mind   abjection of soul  were the sure means of obtaining eternal felicity     prejudices  not less dangerous  have blinded man upon the true nature of  government  nations in general are ignorant of the true foundations  of authority  they dare not demand happiness from those kings who are  charged with the care of procuring it for them  some have believed their  sovereigns were gods disguised  who received with their birth the right  of commanding the rest of mankind  that they could at their pleasure  dispose of the felicity of the people  that they were not accountable  for the misery they engendered  by a necessary consequence of these  erroneous opinions  politics have almost every where degenerated into  the fatal art of sacrificing the interests of the many  either to the  caprice of an individual  or to some few privileged irrational beings   in despite of the evils which assailed them  nations fell down in  adoration before the idols they themselves had made  foolishly respected  the instruments of their misery  had a stupid veneration for those who  possessed the sovereign power of injuring them  obeyed their unjust  will  lavished their blood  exhausted their treasure  sacrificed their  lives  to glut the ambition  to feed the cupidity to minister to the  regenerated phantasms  to gratify the never ending caprices of these  men  they bend the knee to established opinion  bowed to rank  yielded  to title  to opulence  to pageantry  to ostentation  at length victims  to their prejudices  they in vain expected their welfare at the hands of  men who were themselves unhappy from their own vices  whose neglect of  virtue  had rendered them incapable of enjoying true felicity  who are  but little disposed to occupy themselves with their prosperity  under  such chiefs their physical and moral happiness were equally neglected or  even annihilated     the same blindness may be perceived in the science of morals   superstition  which never had any thing but ignorance for its basis   which never had more than a disordered imagination for its guide  did  not found ethics upon man s nature  upon his relations with his fellows   upon those duties which necessarily flow from these relations  it  preferred  as more in unison with itself  founding them upon imaginary  relations which it pretended subsisted between him and those invisible  powers it had so gratuitously imagined  that were delivered by oracles  which their priests had the address to make him believe spoke the will  of the divinity  thus  trophonius  from his cave made affrightened  mortals tremble  shook the stoutest nerves  made them turn pale with  fear  his miserable  deluded supplicants  who were obliged to sacrifice  to him  anointed their bodies with oil  bathed in certain rivers  and  after they had offered their cake of honey and received their destiny   became so dejected  so wretchedly forlorn  that to this day their  descendants  when they behold a malencholy man  exclaim    he has  consulted the oracle of trophonius    it was these invisible gods  which  superstition always paints as furious tyrants  who were declared the  arbiters of man s destiny  the models of his conduct  when he was  willing to imitate them  when he was willing to conform himself to  the lessons of their interpreters  he became wicked  was an unsociable  creature  an useless being or else a turbulent maniac  a zealous  fanatic  it was these alone who profited by superstition  who advantaged  themselves by the darkness in which they contrived to involve the human  mind  nations were ignorant of nature  they knew nothing of reason  they  understood not truth  they had only a gloomy superstition  without one  certain idea of either morals or virtue  when man committed evil against  his fellow creature  he believed he had offended these gods  but he also  believed himself forgiven  as soon as he had prostrated himself before  them  as soon as he had by costly presents gained over the priest to his  interest  thus superstition  far from giving a sure  far from affording  a natural  far from introducing a known basis to morals  only rested it  on an unsteady foundation  made it consist in ideal duties impossible  to be accurately understood  what did i say  it first corrupted him   and his expiations finished by ruining him  thus when superstition was  desirous to combat the unruly passions of man it attempted it in vain   always enthusiastic  ever deprived of experience  it knew nothing of the  true remedies  those which it applied were disgusting  only suitable to  make the sick revolt against them  it made them pass for divine  because  they were not made of man  they were inefficacious  because chimeras  could effectuate nothing against those substantive passions to which  motives more real  impulsions more powerful  concurred to give birth   which every thing conspired  to flourish in his heart  the voice of  superstition or of the gods  could not make itself heard amidst the  tumult of society  where all was in confusion  where the priest cried  out to man  that he could not render himself happy without injuring his  fellow creatures  who happened to differ from him in opinion  these  vain clamours only made virtue hateful to him  because they always  represented it as the enemy to his happiness  as the bane of human  pleasures  he consequently failed in the observation of his duties   because real motives were never held forth to induce him to make the  requisite sacrifice  the present prevailed over the future  the visible  over the invisible  the known over the unknown  man became wicked  because every thing informed him he must be so  in order to obtain the  happiness after which he sighed     thus the sum of human misery was never diminished  on the contrary  it  was accumulating either by his superstition  by his government  by his  education  by his opinions or by the institutions he adopted under  the idea of rendering his condition more pleasant  it not unfrequently  happened that the whole of these acted upon him simultaneously  he was  then completely wretched  it cannot be too often repeated   it is in  error that man will find the true spring of those evils with which the  human race is afflicted   it is not nature that renders him miserable   it is not nature that makes him unhappy  it is not an irritated  divinity who is desirous he should live in tears  it is not hereditary  depravation that has caused him to be wicked  it is to error  to  long cherished  consecrated error  to error identified with his very  existence  that these deplorable effects are to be ascribed     the sovereign good  so much sought after by some philosophers  announced  with so much emphasis by others  may be considered as a chimera  like  unto that marvellous panacea which some adepts have been willing to pass  upon mankind for an universal remedy  all men are diseased  the moment  of their birth delivers them over to the contagion of error  but  individuals are variously affected by it by a consequence of their  natural organization  of their peculiar circumstances  if there is a  sovereign remedy  which can be indiscriminately applied to the diseases  of man  there is without doubt only one  this catholic balsam is truth   which he must draw from nature     at the afflicting sight of those errors which blind the greater number  of mortals  of those delusions which man is doomed to suck in with his  mother s milk  viewing with painful sensations those irregular desires   those disgusting propensities  by which he is perpetually agitated   seeing the terrible effect of those licentious passions which torment  him  of those lasting inquietudes which gnaw his repose  of those  stupendous evils  as well physical as moral  which assail him on every  side  the contemplator of humanity would be tempted to believe that  happiness was not made for this world  that any effort to cure those  minds which every thing unites to poison  would be a vain enterprize   that it was an augean stable  requiring the strength of another  hercules  when he considers those numerous superstitions by which man  is kept in a continual state of alarm  that divide him from his  fellow  that render him vindictive  persecuting  and irrational  when he  beholds the many despotic governments that oppress him  when he examines  those multitudinous  unintelligible  contradictory laws that torture  him  the manifold injustice under which he groans  when he turns his  mind to the barbarous ignorance in which he is steeped  almost over the  whole surface of the earth  when he witnesses those enormous crimes that  debase society  when he unmasks those rooted vices that render it so  hateful to almost every individual  he has great difficulty to prevent  his mind from embracing the idea that misfortune is the only appendage  of the human species  that this world is made solely to assemble the  unhappy  that human felicity is a chimera  or at least a point so  fugitive  that it is impossible it can be fixed     thus superstitious mortals  atrabilious men  beings nourished in  melancholy  unceasingly see either nature or its author exasperated  against the human race  they suppose that man is the constant object  of heaven s wrath  that he irritates it even by his desires  that he  renders himself criminal by seeking a felicity which is not made for  him  struck with beholding that those objects which he covets in the  most lively manner  are never competent to content his heart  they have  decried them as abominations  as things prejudicial to his interest  as  odious to his gods  they prescribe him abstinence from all search after  them  that he should entirely shun them  they have endeavoured to put to  the rout all his passions  without any distinction even of those which  are the most useful to himself  the most beneficial to those beings with  whom he lives  they have been willing that man should render himself  insensible  should become his own enemy  that he should separate himself  from his fellow creatures  that he should renounce all pleasure  that  he should refuse happiness  in short   that he should cease to be a man   that he should become unnatural    mortals   have they said   ye were  born to be unhappy  the author of your existence has destined ye for  misfortune  enter then into his views  and render yourselves miserable   combat those rebellious desires which have felicity for their object   renounce those pleasures which it is your essence to love  attach  yourselves to nothing in this world  by a society that only serves to  inflame your imagination  to make you sigh after benefits you ought not  to enjoy  break up the spring of your souls  repress that activity that  seeks to put a period to your sufferings  suffer  afflict yourselves   groan  be wretched  such is for you the true road to happiness      blind physicians  who have mistaken for a disease the natural state  of man  they have not seen that his desires were necessary  that  his passions were essential to him  that to defend him from loving  legitimate pleasures  to interdict him from desiring them  is to deprive  him of that activity which is the vital principle of society  that to  tell him to hate  to desire him to despise himself  is to take from him  the most substantive motive  that can conduct him to virtue  it is thus   by its supernatural remedies  by its wretched panacea  superstition  far  from curing those evils which render man decrepid  which bend him almost  to the earth  has only increased them  made them more desperate  in the  room of calming his passions  it gives them inveteracy  makes them more  dangerous  renders them more venomous  turns that into a curse which  nature has given him for his preservation  to be the means of his own  happiness  it is not by extinguishing the passions of man that he is  to be rendered happier  it is by turning them into proper channels  by  directing them towards useful objects  which by being truly advantageous  to himself  must of necessity be beneficial to others     in despite of the errors which blind the human race  in despite of  the extravagance of man s superstition  maugre the imbecility of his  political institutions  notwithstanding the complaints  in defiance of  the murmurs he is continually breathing forth against his destiny  there  are yet happy individuals on the earth  man has sometimes the felicity  to behold sovereigns animated by the noble passion to render nations  flourishing  full of the laudable ambition to make their people happy   now and then he encounters an antoninus  a trajan  a julian  an alfred   a washington  he meets with elevated minds who place their glory in  encouraging merit  who rest their happiness in succouring indigence  who  think it honourable to lend a helping hand to oppressed virtue  he sees  genius occupied with the desire of meriting the eulogies of posterity   of eliciting the admiration of his fellow citizens by serving them  usefully  satisfied with enjoying that happiness he procures for others     let it not be believed that the man of poverty himself is excluded  from happiness  mediocrity and indigence frequently procure for him  advantages that opulence and grandeur are obliged to acknowledge  which  title and wealth are constrained to envy  the soul of the needy man   always in action  never ceases to form desires which his activity places  within his reach  whilst the rich  the powerful  are frequently in the  afflicting embarrassment  of either not knowing what to wish for  or  else of desiring those objects which their listlessness renders it  impossible for them to obtain  the poor man s body  habituated to  labour  knows the sweets of repose  this repose of the body  is the most  troublesome fatigue to him who is wearied with his idleness  exercise   and frugality  procure for the one vigour  health  and contentment  the  intemperance and sloth of the other  furnish him only with disgust  load  him with infirmities  indigence sets all the springs of the soul to  work  it is the mother of industry  from its bosom arises genius  it is  the parent of talents  the hot bed of that merit to which opulence is  obliged to pay tribute  to which grandeur bows its homage  in short the  blows of fate find in the poor man a flexible reed  who bends without  breaking  whilst the storms of adversity tear the rich man like the  sturdy oak in the forest  up by the very roots     thus nature is not a step mother to the greater number of her children   he whom fortune has placed in an obscure station is ignorant of that  ambition which devours the courtier  knows nothing of the inquietude  which deprives the intriguer of his rest  is a stranger to the remorse   an alien to the disgust  is unconscious of the weariness of the man   who  enriched with the spoils of a nation  does not know how to turn  them to his profit  the more the body labours  the more the imagination  reposes itself  it is the diversity of the objects man runs over that  kindles it  it is the satiety of those objects that causes him disgust   the imagination of the indigent is circumscribed by necessity  he  receives but few ideas  he is acquainted with but few objects  in  consequence  he has but little to desire  he contents himself with that  little  whilst the entire of nature with difficulty suffices to satisfy  the insatiable desires  to gratify the imaginary wants of the man   plunged in luxury  who has run over and exhausted all common objects   those  whom prejudice contemplates  as the most unhappy of men   frequently enjoy advantages more real  happiness much greater  than  those who oppress them  who despise them  but who are nevertheless  often reduced to the misery of envying them  limited desires are a real  benefit  the man of meaner condition  in his humble fortune  desires  only bread  he obtains it by the sweat of his brow  he would eat it with  pleasure if injustice did not sometimes render it bitter to him  by the  delirium of some governments  those who roll in abundance  without  for that reason being more happy  dispute with the cultivator even the  fruits which the earth yields to the labour of his hands   princes   sometimes sacrifice their true happiness  as well as that of their  states  to these passions  to those caprices which discourage the  people  which plunge their provinces in misery  which make millions  unhappy  without any advantage to themselves   tyrants  oblige the  subjects to curse their existence  to abandon labour  take from them  the courage of propagating a progeny who would be as unhappy as their  fathers  the excess of oppression sometimes obliges them to revolt   makes them avenge themselves by wicked outrages of the injustice it  has heaped on their devoted heads  injustice  by reducing indigence to  despair  obliges it to seek in crime  resources  against its misery  an  unjust government  produces discouragement in the soul  its vexations  depopulate a country  under its influence  the earth remains without  culture  from thence is bred frightful famine  which gives birth to  contagion and plague  the misery of a people produce revolutions   soured by misfortunes  their minds get into a state of fermentation   the overthrow of an empire  is the necessary effect  it is thus that   physics  and  morals  are always connected  or rather are the  same  thing      if the bad morals of chiefs do not always produce such marked effects   at least they generate slothfulness  of which their effect is to fill  society with mendicants  to crowd it with malefactors  whose vicious  course neither superstition nor the terror of the laws can arrest  which  nothing can induce to remain the unhappy spectators of a welfare they  are not permitted to participate  they seek a fleeting happiness at the  expence even of their lives  when injustice has shut up to them the road  of labour  those paths of industry which would have rendered them both  useful and honest     let it not then be said that no government can render all its subjects  happy  without doubt it cannot flatter itself with contenting the  capricious humours of some idle citizens who are obliged to rack their  imagination  to appease the disgust arising from lassitude  but it can   and it ought to occupy itself with ministering to the real wants of the  multitude  with giving a useful activity to the whole body politic  a  society enjoys all the happiness of which it is susceptible whenever the  greater number of its members are wholesomely fed  decently cloathed   comfortably lodged  in short when they can without an excess of toil  beyond their strength  procure wherewith to satisfy those wants which  nature has made necessary to their existence  their mind rests contented  as soon as they are convinced no power can ravish from them the fruits  of their industry  that they labour for themselves  that the sweat of  their brow is for the immediate comfort of their own families  by a  consequence of human folly in some regions  whole nations are obliged to  toil incessantly  to waste their strength  to sweat under their burdens  to undulate the air with their sighs  to drench the earth with their  tears  in order to maintain the luxury  to gratify the whims  to support  the corruption of a small number of irrational beings  of some few  useless men to whom happiness has become impossible  because their  bewildered imaginations no longer know any bounds  it is thus that  superstitious  thus that political errors have changed the fair face of  nature into a valley of tears     for want of consulting reason  for want of knowing the value of virtue   for want of being instructed in their true interest  for want of being  acquainted with what constitutes solid happiness  in what consists real  felicity  the prince and the people  the rich and the poor  the great  and the little  are unquestionably  frequently very far removed from  content  nevertheless if an impartial eye be glanced over the human  race  it will be found to comprise a greater number of benefits than of  evils  no man is entirely happy  but he is so in detail  those who make  the most bitter complaints of the rigour of their fate  are however   held in existence by threads frequently imperceptible  are prevented  from the desire of quitting it by circumstances of which they are not  aware  in short  habit lightens to man the burden of his troubles  grief  suspended becomes true enjoyment  every want is a pleasure in the moment  when it is satisfied  freedom from chagrin  the absence of disease  is a  happy state which he enjoys secretly  without even perceiving it  hope   which rarely abandons him entirely  helps him to support the most  cruel disasters  the prisoner laughs in his irons  the wearied villager  returns singing to his cottage  in short  the man who calls himself the  most unfortunate  never sees death approach without dismay  at least  if  despair has not totally disfigured nature in his eyes     as long as man desires the continuation of his being  he has no right  to call himself completely unhappy  whilst hope sustains him  he still  enjoys a great benefit  if man was more just  in rendering to himself an  account of his pleasures  in estimating his pains  he would acknowledge  that the sum of the first exceeds by much the amount of the last  he  would perceive that he keeps a very exact ledger of the evil  but a very  unfaithful journal of the good  indeed he would avow  that there are but  few days entirely unhappy during the whole course of his existence  his  periodical wants procure for him the pleasure of satisfying them  his  soul is perpetually moved by a thousand objects  of which  the variety   the multiplicity  the novelty  rejoices him  suspends his sorrows   diverts his chagrin  his physical evils  are they violent  they are not  of long duration  they conduct him quickly to his end  the sorrows of  his mind  when too powerful  conduct him to it equally  at the same time  nature refuses him every happiness  she opens to him a door by which he  quits life  does he refuse to enter it  it is that he yet finds pleasure  in existence  are nations reduced to despair  are they completely  miserable  they have recourse to arms  at the risque of perishing  they  make the most violent efforts to terminate there sufferings     thus because he sees so many of his fellows cling to life  man ought  to conclude they are not so unhappy as he thinks  then let him not  exaggerate the evils of the human race  but let him impose silence on  that gloomy humour that persuades him these evils are without remedy   let him only diminish by degrees the number of his errors  his  calamities will vanish in the same proportion  he is not to conclude  himself infelicitous because his heart never ceases to form new desires   which he finds it difficult  sometimes impossible to gratify  since his  body daily requires nourishment  let him infer that it is sound  that it  fulfils its functions  as long as he has desires  the proper deduction  ought to be  that his mind is kept in the necessary activity  he should  gather from all this that passions are essential to him  that they  constitute the happiness of a being who feels  are indispensable to a  man who thinks  are requisite to furnish him with ideas  that they are  a vital principle with a creature who must necessarily love that which  procures him comfort  who must equally desire that which promises him  a mode of existence analogous to his natural energies  as long as he  exists  as long as the spring of his soul maintains its elasticity  this  soul desires  as long as it desires  he experiences the activity which  is necessary to him  as long as he acts  so long he lives  human life  may be compared to a river  of which the waters succeed each other   drive each other forward  and flow on without interruption  these  waters  obliged to roll over an unequal bed  encounter at intervals  those obstacles which prevent their stagnation  they never cease  to undulate  sometimes they recoil  then again rush forward  thus  continuing to run with more or less velocity  until they are restored to   the ocean of nature              chap  xvii      those ideas which are true  or founded upon nature  are the only  remedies for the evils of man   recapitulation   conclusion of the first  part        whenever man ceases to take experience for his guide  he falls into  error  his errors become yet more dangerous  assume a more determined  inveteracy  when they are clothed with the sanction of superstition  it  is then that he hardly ever consents to return into the paths of truth   he believes himself deeply interested in no longer seeing clearly that  which lies before him  he fancies he has an essential advantage in no  longer understanding himself  he supposes his happiness exacts that he  should shut his eyes to truth  if the majority of moral philosophers  have mistaken the human heart  if they have deceived themselves upon its  diseases  if they have miscalculated the remedies that are suitable  if  the remedies they have administered have been inefficacious or even  dangerous  it is because they have abandoned nature  because they have  resisted experience  because they have not had sufficient steadiness to  consult their reason  because they have renounced the evidence of their  senses  because they have only followed the caprices of an imagination  either dazzled by enthusiasm or disturbed by fear  because they have  preferred the illusions it has held forth to the realities of nature    who never deceives      it is for want of having felt that an intelligent being cannot for an  instant lose sight of his own peculiar conservation  of his particular  interests  either real or fictitious  of his own welfare  whether  permanent or transitory  in short  of his happiness  either true or  false  it is for want of having considered that desires are natural   that passions are essential  that both the one and the other are motions  necessary to the soul of man   that the physicians of the  human mind  have supposed supernatural causes for his wanderings  have only applied  to his evils topical remedies  either useless or dangerous  indeed   in desiring him to stifle his desires  to combat his propensities  to  annihilate his passions  they have done no more than give him sterile  precepts  at once vague and impracticable  these vain lessons have  influenced no one  they have at most restrained some few mortals whom a  quiet imagination but feebly solicited to evil  the terrors with which  they have accompanied them have disturbed the tranquillity of those  persons who were moderate by their nature  without ever arresting the  ungovernable temperament of those who were inebriated by their passions   or hurried along  by the torrent of habit  in short  the promises of  superstition  as well as the menaces it holds forth  have only formed  fanatics  given birth to enthusiasts  who are either dangerous or  useless to society  without ever making man truly virtuous  that is to  say  useful to his fellow creatures     these  empirics guided by a blind routine have  not seen that man as  long as he exists  is obliged to feel  to desire  to have passions   to satisfy them in proportion to the energy which his organization has  given him  they have not perceived that education planted these desires  in his heart  that habit rooted them  that his government  frequently  vicious  corroborated their growth  that public opinion stamped them  with its approbation  that  experience render them necessary  that  to tell men thus constituted to destroy their passions  was either to  plunge them into despair or else to order them remedies too revolting  for their temperament  in the actual state of opulent societies  to say  to a man who knows by experience that riches procure every pleasure   that he must not desire them  that he must not make any efforts to  obtain them  that he ought to detach himself from them  is to persuade  him to render himself miserable  to tell an ambitious man not to desire  grandeur  not to covet power  which every thing conspires to point out  to him as the height of felicity  is to order him to overturn at one  blow the habitual system of his ideas  it is to speak  to a deaf man  to  tell a lover of an impetuous temperament to stifle his passions for the  object that enchants him  is to make him understand  that he ought to  renounce his happiness  to oppose superstition to such substantive  such  puissant interests is to combat realities by chimerical speculations     indeed  if things were examined without prepossession  it would be found  that the greater part of the precepts inculcated by superstition  which  fanatical dogmas hold forth  which  supernatural mortals give to man   are as ridiculous as they are impossible to be put into practice   to interdict passion to man  is to desire of him not to be a human  creature  to counsel an individual of a violent imagination to moderate  his desires  is to advise him to change his temperament  is to request  his blood to flow more sluggishly  to tell a man to renounce his habits   is to be willing that a citizen  accustomed to clothe himself  should  consent to walk quite naked  it would avail as much  to desire him  to change the lineament of his face  to destroy his configuration  to  extinguish his imagination  to alter the course of his fluids  as to  command him not to have passions which excite an activity analogous with  his natural energy  or to lay aside those which confirmed habit has made  him contract  which his circumstances  by a long succession of causes  and effects  have converted into wants  such are  however  the so much  boasted remedies which the greater number of moral philosophers apply to  human depravity  is it  then surprising they do not produce the desired  effect  or that they only reduce man to a state of despair by the  effervescence that results from the continual conflict which they excite  between the passions of his heart and these fanciful doctrines  between  his vices and his virtues  between his habits and those chimerical fears  with which superstition is at all times ready to overwhelm him  the  vices of society  aided by the objects of which it avails itself to what  the desires of man  the pleasures  the riches  the grandeur which  his government holds forth to him as so many seductive magnets  the  advantage which education  the benefits which example  the interests  which public opinion render dear to him  attract him on one side  whilst  a gloomy morality  founded upon superstitious illusions  vainly solicit  him on the other  thus  superstition plunges him into misery  holds  a violent struggle with his heart  without scarcely ever gaining the  victory  when by accident it does prevail against so many united forces   it renders him unhappy  it completely destroys the spring of his soul     passions are the true counterpoise to passions  then let him not seek  to destroy them  but let him endeavour to direct them  let him balance  those which are prejudicial  by those which are useful to society    reason   the fruit of experience  is only the art of choosing those  passions to which for his own peculiar happiness he ought to listen    education  is the true art of disseminating the proper method of  cultivating advantageous passions in the heart of man   legislation  is  the art of restraining dangerous passions  of exciting those which may  be conducive to the public welfare   superstition  is only the miserable  art of planting the unproductive labour  of nourishing in the soul  of man those chimeras  those illusions  those impostures  those  incertitudes from whence spring passions fatal to himself as well as to  others  it is only by bearing up with fortitude against these that he  can securely place himself on the road to happiness   true religion   is the art of advocating truth  of renouncing error  of contemplating  reality  of drawing wisdom from experience  of cultivating man s nature  to his own felicity  by teaching him to contribute to that of his  associates  in short it is  reason  education   and  legislation    united to further the great end of human existence  by causing the  passions of man to flow in a current genial to his own happiness      reason  and  morals  cannot effect any thing on mankind if they do not  point out to each individual that his true interest is attached to a  conduct that is either useful to others or beneficial to himself  this  conduct to be useful must conciliate for him the benevolence  gain for  him the favor of these beings who are necessary to his happiness  it is  then for the interest of mankind  for the happiness of the human race   it is for the esteem of himself  for the love of his fellows  for the  advantages which ensue  that education in early life should kindle the  imagination of the citizen  this is the true means of obtaining those  happy results with which habit should familiarize him  which public  opinion should render dear to his heart  for which example ought  continually to rouse his faculties  after which he should be taught to  search with unceasing attention   government  by the aid of recompences   ought to encourage him to follow this plan  by visiting crime with  punishment it ought to deter those who are willing to interrupt it   thus the hope of a true welfare  the fear of real evil  will be passions  suitable to countervail those which by their impetuosity would injure  society  these last will at least become very rare  if instead of  feeding man s mind with unintelligible speculations  in lieu of  vibrating on his ears words void of sense  he is only spoken to of  realities  only shewn those interests which are in unison with truth     man is frequently so wicked  only  because he almost always feels  himself interested in being so  let him be more enlightened  more  familiarized with truth  more accustomed to virtue  he will be made more  happy  he will necessarily become better  an equitable government   a vigilant administration  will presently fill the state with honest  citizens  it will hold forth to them present reasons for benevolence   real advantages in truth  palpable motives to be virtuous  it will  instruct them in their duties  it will foster them with its cares  it  will allure them by the assurance of their own peculiar happiness  its  promises faithfully fulfilled  its menaces regularly executed   will unquestionably have much more weight than those of a gloomy  superstition  which never exhibits to their view other than illusory  benefits  fallacious punishments  which the man hardened in wickedness  will doubt every time he finds an interest in questioning them  present  motives will tell more home to his heart than those which are distant  and at best uncertain  the vicious and the wicked are so common upon  the earth  so pertinacious in their evil courses  so attached to their  irregularities  only because there are but few governments that make  man feel the advantage of being just  the pleasure of being honest  the  happiness of being benevolent on the contrary  there is hardly any  place where the most powerful interests do not solicit him to crime  by  favouring the propensities of a vicious organization  by countenancing  those appetencies which nothing has attempted to rectify or lead  towards virtue  a savage  who in his horde knows not the value of money   certainly would not commit a crime  if when transplanted into civilized  society  he should presently learn to desire it  should make efforts to  obtain it  and if he could without danger finish by stealing it  above  all  if he had not been taught to respect the property of the beings who  environ him  the savages and the child are precisely in the same  state  it is the negligence of society  of those entrusted with their  education  that renders both the one and the other wicked  the son of  a noble  from his infancy learns to desire power  at a riper age he  becomes ambitious  if he has the address to insinuate himself into  favor  he perhaps becomes wicked  because in some societies he has been  taught to know he may be so with impunity when he can command the ear  of his sovereign  it is not therefore nature that makes man wicked  they  are his institutions which determine him to vice  the infant brought up  amongst robbers  can generally become nothing but a malefactor  if he  had been reared with honest people  the chance is he would have been a  virtuous man     if the source be traced of that profound ignorance in which man is with  respect to his morals  to the motives that can give volition to his  will  it will be found in those false ideas which the greater number of  speculators have formed to themselves  of human nature  the science of  morals has become an enigma which it is impossible to unrevel  because  man has made himself double  has distinguished his soul from his body   supposed it of a nature different from all known beings  with modes of  action  with properties distinct from all other bodies  because he  has emancipated this soul from physical laws  in order to submit it to  capricious laws emanating from men who have pretended they are derived  from imaginary regions  placed at very remote distances  metaphysicians  seized upon these gratuitous suppositions  and by dint of subtilizing  them  have rendered them completely unintelligible  these moralists have  not perceived that motion is essential to the soul as well as to the  living body  that both the one and the other are never moved but  by material  by physical objects  that the want of each regenerate  themselves unceasingly  that the wants of the soul  as well as those of  the body are purely physical  that the most intimate  the most constant  connection subsists between the soul and the body  or rather they have  been unwilling to allow that they ate only the same thing considered  under different points of view  obstinate in their supernatural   unintelligible opinions  they have refused to open their eyes  which  would have convinced them that the body in suffering rendered the soul  miserable  that the soul afflicted undermined the body and brought it to  decay  that both the pleasures and agonies of the mind have an influence  over the body  either plunge it into sloth or give it activity  they  have rather chosen to believe  that the soul draws its thoughts  whether  pleasant or gloomy  from its own peculiar sources  while the fact is   that it derives its ideas only from material objects that strike on the  physical organs  that it is neither determined to gaiety nor led on to  sorrow  but by the actual state  whether permanent or transitory  in  which the fluids and solids of the body are found  in short  they have  been loath to acknowledge that the soul  purely passive  undergoes  the same changes which the body experiences  is only moved by its  intervention  acts only by its assistance  receives its sensations  its  perceptions  forms its ideas  derives either its happiness or its misery  from physical objects  through the medium of the organs of which the  body is composed  frequently without its own cognizance  often in  despite of itself     by a consequence of these opinions  connected with marvellous systems   or systems invented to justify them  they have supposed the human soul  to be a free agent  that is to say  that it has the faculty of moving  itself  that it enjoys the privilege of acting independent of the  impulse received from exterior objects  through the organs of the body   that regardless of these impulsions it can even resist them  and follow  its own directions by its own energies  that it is not only different in  its nature from all other beings  but has a separate mode of action  in  other words  that it is an insolated point which is  not submitted to  that uninterrupted chain of motion which bodies communicate to each  other in a nature  whose parts are always in action  smitten with  their sublime notions  these speculators were not aware that in thus  distinguishing the soul from the body and from all known beings  they  rendered it an impossibility to form any true ideas of it  either to  themselves or to others  they were unwilling to perceive the perfect  analogy which is found between the manner of the soul s action and that  by which the body is afflicted  they shut their eyes to the necessary  and continual correspondence which is found between the soul and the  body  they perhaps did not perceive that like the body it is subjected  to the motion of attraction and repulsion  has an aptitude to be  attracted  a disposition to repel  which is ascribable to qualities  inherent in those physical subsistances  which give play to the  organs of the body  that the volition of its will  the activity of its  passions  the continual regeneration of its desires  are never more than  consequences of that activity which is produced in the body by material  objects which are not under its controul  that these objects render  it either happy or miserable  active or languishing  contented or  discontented  in despite of itself   in defiance of all the efforts it  is capable of making to render it otherwise  they have rather chosen to  seek in the heavens for unknown powers to set it in motion  they have  held forth to man distant  imaginary interests  under the pretext of  procuring for him future happiness  he has been prevented from labouring  to his present felicity  which has been studiously withheld from his  knowledge  his regards have been fixed upon the heavens  that he might  lose sight of the earth  truth has been concealed from him  and it has  been pretended he would be rendered happy by dint of terrors  always at  an immense distance  by means of shadows  with whose substances he  could never come in contact  of chimeras formed by his own bewildered  imagination  which changed nearly as often as the governments to which  he was submitted  in short  hoodwinked by his fears  blinded by his own  credulity   he was only guided through the flexuous paths of life  by  men blind as himself  where both the one and the other were frequently  lost in the maze              conclusion       from every thing which has been hitherto said  it evidently results that  all the errors of mankind  of whatever nature they may be  arise from  man s having renounced reason  quitted experience  and refused  the evidence of his senses that he might be guided by imagination   frequently deceitful  by authority  always suspicious  man will ever  mistake his true happiness as long as he neglects to study nature  to  investigate her laws  to seek in her alone the remedies for those  evils which are the consequence of his errors  he will be an enigma to  himself  as long as he shall believe himself double  that he is moved by  an inconceivable spiritual power  of the laws and nature of which he is  ignorant  his intellectual  as well as his moral faculties  will remain  unintelligible to him if he does not contemplate them with the same  eyes as he does his corporeal qualities  if he does not view them as  submitted in every thing to the same impulse  as governed by the same  regulations  the system of his pretended free agency is without support   experience contradicts it every instant  and proves that he never ceases  to be under the influence of necessity in all his actions  this truth   far from being dangerous to man  far from being destructive of his  morals  furnishes him with their true basis by making him feel the  necessity of those relations which subsists between sensible beings  united in society  who have congregated with a view of uniting their  common efforts for their reciprocal felicity  from the necessity of  these relations  spring the necessity of his duties  these point out to  him the sentiments of love  which he should accord to virtuous conduct   that aversion he should have for what is vicious  the horror he should  feel for every thing criminal  from hence the true foundation of  moral  obligation  will be obvious  which is only the necessity of talking  means to obtain the end man proposes to himself by uniting in society   in which each individual for his own peculiar interest  his own  particular happiness  his own personal security  is obliged to display  dispositions requisite to conciliate the affections of his associates   to hold a conduct suitable to the preservation of the community  to  contribute by his actions to the happiness of the whole  in a word  it  is upon the necessary action and re action of the human will upon the  necessary attraction and repulsion of man s soul  that all his morals  are bottomed  it is the unison of his will  the concert of his actions   that maintains society  it is rendered miserable by his discordance  it  is dissolved by his want of union     from what has been said  it may be concluded that the names under which  man has designated the concealed causes acting in nature  and their  various effects  are never more than  necessity  considered under  different points of view  with the original cause of which  the great   cause of causes   he must ever remain ignorant  it will be found that  what he calls  order   is a necessary consequence of causes and effects   of which he sees  or believes he sees  the entire connection  the  complete routine  which pleases him as a whole  when he finds it  conformable to his existence  in like manner it will be seen that what  he calls  confusion   is a consequence of like necessary causes and  effects  of which he loses the concatenation  which he therefore thinks  unfavourable to himself  or but little suitable to his being  that he  has designated by the names of       intelligence   those necessary causes that necessarily operate the  chain of events which he comprises under the term  order       divinity   those necessary but invisible causes which give play to  nature  in which every thing acts according to immutable and necessary  laws      destiny  or  fatality   the necessary connection of those unknown  causes and  effects which he beholds in the world      chance   those effects which he is not able to foresee  or of which he  is ignorant of the necessary connection  with their causes      intellectual  and  moral faculties   those effects and those  modifications necessary to an organized being  whom he has supposed to  be moved by an inconceivable agent  who he has believed distinguished  from his body  of a nature totally different from it  and which he has  designated by the word soul  in consequence  he has believed this agent  immortal  not dissoluble like the body  it has been shewn that the  marvellous doctrine of another life  is founded upon gratuitous  suppositions  contradicted by reflections  unsupported by experience   that may or may not be  without man s knowing any thing on the subject   it has been proved  that the hypothesis is not only useless to man s  morals  but again  that it is calculated to palsy his exertions  to  divert him from actively pursuing the true road to his own happiness   to fill him with romantic caprices  to inebriate him with opinions  prejudicial to his tranquillity  in short  to lull to slumber the  vigilance of legislators  by dispensing them from giving to education   to the institutions  to the laws of society  all that attention  which  it is the duty and for his interest they should bestow  it must have  been felt  that  politics  has unaccountably rested itself upon wrong  opinions  upon ideas little capable of satisfying those passions  which  every thing conspires to kindle in the heart of man  who ceases to view  the future  while the present seduces and hurries him along  it has been  shewn  that contempt of death is an advantageous sentiment  calculated  to inspire man s mind with courage  to render him intrepid  to induce  him to undertake that which may be truly useful to society  in short   from what has preceded  it will be obvious  what is competent to conduct  man to happiness  and also what are the obstacles that error opposes to  his felicity     let us not then  be accused of demolishing prejudice  without edifying  the mind  with combating error without substituting truth  with  underrating the power of the great  cause of causes   with sapping  at one and the same time the foundations of superstition and of sound  morals  the last is necessary to man  it is founded upon his nature  its  duties are certain  they must last as long as the human race remains  it  imposes obligations on him  because  without it  neither individuals  nor society could be able to subsist  either obtain or enjoy those  advantages which nature obliges them to desire     listen then  o man  to those morals which are established upon   experience  which are grounded upon the necessity of things  do not  lend thine ear to those superstitions founded upon reveries  rested upon  imposture  built upon the capricious whims of a disordered imagination   follow the lessons of those humane  those gentle morals  which conduct  man to virtue  by the voice of happiness  turn a deaf ear to the  inefficacious cries of superstition  which renders man really unhappy   which can never make him reverence virtue  which renders truth hateful   which paints veracity in hideous colours  in short  let him see if  reason  without the assistance of a rival  who prohibits its use  will  not more surely conduct him towards that great end  which is the object  of his research  which is the natural tendency of all his views     indeed  what benefit has the human race hitherto drawn from those  sublime  those supernatural notions with which superstition has  fed mortals during so many ages  all those phantoms conjured  up by  ignorance  brooded by imagination  all those hypothesis  subtile as  they are irrational  from which experience is banished  all those  words devoid of meaning with which languages are crowded  all those  fantastical hopes  those panic terrors which have been brought to  operate on the will of man  what have they done  has any or the whole of  them rendered him better  more enlightened to his duties  more  faithful in their performance  have those marvellous systems  or those  sophistical inventions  by which they have been supported  carried  conviction to his mind  reason into his conduct  virtue into his heart   have they led him to the least acquaintance with the great  cause  of causes   alas  it is a lamentable fact  that cannot be too often  exposed  that all these things have done nothing more than plunge the  human understanding into that darkness from which it is difficult to be  withdrawn  sown in man s heart the most dangerous errors  of which it is  scarcely possible to divest him  given birth to those fatal passions   in which may be found the true source of those evils  with which his  species is afflicted  but have never enlightened his mind with truth   nor led him to that right healthy worship  which man best pays by a  rational enjoyment of the faculties with which he is gifted     cease then  o mortal  to let thyself he disturbed with chimeras  to  let thy mind be troubled with phantoms which thine own imagination has  created  or to which arch imposture has given birth  renounce thy vague  hopes  disengage thyself from thine overwhelming fears  follow without  inquietude the necessary routine which nature has marked out for thee   strew the road with flowers if thy destiny permits  remove  if thou art  able  the thorns scattered over it  do not attempt to plunge thy views  into an impenetrable futurity  its obscurity ought to be sufficient to  prove to thee  that it is either useless or dangerous to fathom  think  of making thyself happy in that existence which is known to thee  if  thou wouldst preserve thyself  be temperate  be moderate  be reasonable   if thou seekest to render thy existence durable  be not prodigal of  pleasure  abstain from every thing that can be hurtful to thyself   injurious to others  be truly intelligent  that is to say  learn to  esteem thyself  to preserve thy being  to fulfil that end which at each  moment thou proposest to thyself  be virtuous  to the end that thou  mayest render thyself solidly happy  that thou mayest enjoy the  affections  secure the esteem  partake of the assistance of those by  whom thou art surrounded  of those beings whom nature has made necessary  to thine own peculiar felicity  even when they should be unjust  render  thyself worthy of their applause  of thine own love  and thou shalt  live content  thy serenity shall not be disturbed  the end of thy career  shall not slander thy life  which will be exempted from remorse  death  will be to thee the door to a new existence  a new order  in which  thou wilt be submitted  as thou art at present  to the eternal laws of  nature  which ordains  that to live happy here below  thou must make  others happy  suffer thyself then  to be drawn gently along thy journey   until thou shalt sleep peaceable on that bosom which has given thee  birth  if contrary to thine expectation  there should be another life of  eternal felicity  thou canst not fail being a partaker     for thou  wicked unfortunate  who art found in continual contradiction  with thyself  thou whose disorderly machine can neither accord with  thine own peculiar nature  nor with that of thine associates  whatever  may be thy crimes  whatever may be thy fears of punishment in another  life  thou art at least already cruelly punished in this  do not thy  follies  thy shameful habits  thy debaucheries  damage thine health   dost thou not linger out life in disgust  fatigued with thine own  excesses  does not listlessness punish thee for thy satiated passions   has not thy vigour  thy gaiety  thy content  already yielded to  feebleness  crouched under infirmities  given place to regret  do not  thy vices every day dig thy grave  every time thou hast stained thyself  with crime  hast thou dared without horror to return into thyself  to  examine thine own conscience  hast thou not found remorse  error  shame   established in thine heart  hast thou not dreaded the scrutiny of thy  fellow man  hast thou not trembled when alone  unceasingly feared  that  truth  so terrible for thee  should unveil thy dark transgressions   throw into light thine enormous iniquities  do not then any longer  fear to part with thine existence  it will at least put an end to those  richly merited torments thou hast inflicted on thyself   death  in  delivering the earth from an incommodious burthen  will also deliver  thee from thy most cruel enemy  thyself        end of part i
