writer collaborated  may be welcomed by those many  persons whose interest in mission affairs is more or less limited to the  five here included  which are  probably  the most notable  historically  and architecturally  of the whole chain of these venerable monuments of  franciscan zeal     j  s  c           san juan capistrano  the penance of magdalena        slowly  very slowly  the greatest and most beautiful of the missions of  alta california had risen among the swelling lomas of the valley of the  san juan  brick by brick and stone by stone the simple indian laborers   under the tutelage of the fathers  had reared a structure which  in its  way and place  might not unfitly be compared with those great cathedrals  of europe in which we see  as in a parable  how inward love and faith  work out in material beauty  huge timbers of pine and sycamore  hewn on  palomar  the mountain of doves  many miles away  had been hauled by oxen  over trackless hill and valley  to form the joists and rafters that  one sees to day  after the lapse of more than a century  firm and  serviceable  fastened with wooden spikes and stout rawhide lashings     in all these labors te filo had taken a principal part  as a child he  had been christened with the name of lucas  and had carried it through  boyhood  but when about fourteen years of age  he had been transferred  from the duties of a herder to learn the simple crafts taught in the  workshops  and his industry and intelligence had so commended him to the  overseers and padre josef that one day the latter  praising him for some  task especially well performed  had said  half in jest   hijo mio  we  must christen you over again  you are excelent simo  as san lucas said  of san te filo in the superscription to his holy evangel  so i shall  call you te filo  excelent simo te filo  instead of lucas  why not   and  te filo the boy became from that day  though lucas he remained in the  record of baptisms kept in the tall sheepskin volume in the father s  closet     so useful and diligent was the boy that the father soon took him to be  his own body servant  and many an hour did te filo pass handling  with religious care the sacred vessels and vestments and books in the  sacristy and in the father s rooms  one day the father noticed with  displeasure that on the blank flyleaf of his best illuminated missal   lately sent to him by a friend in his old college at cordoba  in spain   there were some rough drawings in red and blue  evidently the person  who had drawn them had tried to obliterate his work  but had only partly  succeeded  the father could not help noticing  however  that  crude as  were the formal floral designs and sacred emblems that had been copied  by the culprit from the emblazoned letterings and chapter headings of  the missal  the work showed undoubted taste and talent  and this gave  him an idea  why should he not adorn with frescoes  in color  the  cornices  and perhaps even the dome  of the new church  it would be a  notable addition  and would give a finishing touch to the beauty of  the building  if it could be done  and here  evidently  was a hand that  might be trained to do it  the hand  probably  of his favorite  te filo   for he alone had access to the book shelves in the father s room     so when next he saw the boy he asked   te filo  who has been drawing  in my new missal   the boy hung his head  and the father  taking  his silence as an admission of guilt  added   that was wrong of you   te filo  and i must give you some penance to remind you not to do such  mischief again  do you know  boy  what that book is worth  not less than  twenty pesos  te filo  or even more  that is one year s wages of agust n  the mayordomo  so you can see such things must be left alone  but come  to me this evening after the doctrina  and i will set you your penance      when the boy  with downcast look  came to him in his room that evening   the father said to him   what made you do it  te filo   and the boy  answered  i did not mean to do harm  padre  but the pictures are so  beautiful  and i tried to make some like them  then i tried to rub them  out  but they would not come off   the father smiled indulgently   no   my son   he said   the wrong things we do  even innocently  do not come  off  you must remember that in future  but they can be forgiven by the  good god  te filo  and even so i forgive you for the book  and your  penance shall be to come each evening at this time and learn to draw  properly  what do you say       oh  padre   cried the boy  and he took the father s hand and put it   indian fashion  to his forehead in token of gratitude     agust n the mayordomo was  next to the father  the most important man  about the mission  he it was who  under the priest s supervision  had  charge not only of the labors and general governance of the indians  but  also of the business affairs of the establishment  even to the care  and sale of the cattle  hides  and tallow  which  produced in enormous  quantity  were almost the only  but a quite considerable  source of  revenue to all the california missions  agust n was a half breed  or  mestizo  the son of one of the spanish soldiers who had come to alta  california with serra and portola  his mother was an indian woman  to  whom his father had been married by father serra himself  that was in        the year of the establishment of the mission  and agust n  the  oldest son of the marriage  had risen before the age of thirty five to  his important post  partly by natural ability  and partly by the fact of  his mixed spanish blood  which of itself gave him prestige and authority  with the indians  he had quarters adjoining those of the father  on the  main corridor of the cuadro     his family consisted of his wife  juana  chief of the lavanderas  or  washwomen  and several children  the oldest of whom  magdalena  was  now growing into the fresh and early womanhood of these southern races   already she had lovers  who took such opportunities as the strict  discipline of the mission life allowed  and they were rare  to endeavor  to awake a response in her heart  but she held herself aloof from all   proud of the spanish blood in her veins  though that blood was but that  of a common soldier  she counted herself to be of the gente de razon   far above the level of the mere indians  her mother s people  and   indeed  in her finer features  quick glance  and more spirited bearing   the difference of strain was manifest  the latin admixture  though only  fractional  justified itself in evident supremacy over the aborigine     this proud element in magdalena s nature had the unfortunate effect of  bringing her into conflict with the father and the church  not that she  would  out of mere perverseness  have refused obedience  but the father   himself a spaniard  viewed all who were not of the sangre pura as  indians  all alike  this the girl felt and resented  and her resentment   though unexpressed  showed in numberless ways  while the father  on his  part  viewed her only as an obstinate indian child  naturally averse to  good influences     it chanced one day that agust n  overlooking the making of adobe bricks  at the clay pits a mile from the mission  needed to send a message to  the father on some point concerning the work  and  magdalena having been  sent to carry their midday meal to the brick makers  he entrusted her  with the errand  failing to find the father in his private room  she  went to the next door of the corridor  it was half open  and she glanced  in  the father was not there  but she saw  bending over a table set  against the window  a young man  his back was turned to her  and he was  so intent upon his occupation that he had not heard her step  she  should have turned and gone  for the rules were strict  and forbade  conversation between the girls and young men of the mission  but her  curiosity was keen to know what the indian boy  as she knew he must be   was doing in the father s quarters  and what it could be that kept him  so absorbed  moreover  a spirit of defiance was in her  if the father  found her loitering there he would reprimand her  well  she would break  the rules  she was no indian  and if he caught her there she would tell  him so  yes  she would see what the young man was doing  she wanted  to know  and she would know  quietly she stole into the room and edged  round to one side go that she could see partly across the table  the  young man was painting  in wonderful colors  on a sheet of parchment   painting wonderful things  beasts  and birds  and flowers  and even  angels  a wonder of wonders to the simple girl     at some involuntary sound that she made  the young man  it was  te filo  turned and saw her  her eyes were fixed upon him  wide with  wonder  and her hands half raised in childlike rapture  while her  slender figure  so different from the heavier forms of the indian girls   gave her  to his eyes  the look and bearing of one of the very angels  he had been copying  it was a marvel on his side  too  and for a few  moments the two regarded each other  while love  that is born so often  of sudden wonder in innocent hearts  awoke and stirred in both their  breasts  they had often met before  but it had been casually  and the  hour had not been ripe  now he saw her and loved her  she saw him   an indian  indeed  but transfigured  for he was an indian who worked  wonders  and the spaniard in her gave way  that moment  to the indian   and she loved an indian  as her father had done     he was the first to recover his self possession   the father is not  here   he said   he will be back soon  for he set me my task until he  should return  and i have almost done it    is that your task   she  asked   how beautiful  how wonderful   and she stepped nearer the table    show me  how do you make them  i never thought that indians could make  such things  i have heard my father say that holy men in spain could  make angels  but you are an indian  how can you do it    i cannot tell  you   he said slowly  then  yes  i will tell you   and a flush came on  his dark face  and a light into his eyes  as he looked at her   i do not  make them  these angels  they come to me because the father has taught  me to love them  he says the angels come to those who love them  and any  one can love them  and when i saw you   he went on  his eyes upon her  eager face   i thought you were the angel i was painting  for you are  like an angel  too  and now i shall always love you  and it will be easy  to paint  listen  the father is coming  you must go quickly  but now  i have seen you i must see you again  you are magdalena  agust n s  daughter  i shall find you to morrow when i take the orders for the work  to your father      magdalena slipped away  and thus was begun the short but happy love of  te filo and magdalena short  like the history of the beautiful mission  itself  happy  as all love is happy  let its end be what it may  many a  time they met in secret  for sweet interviews or even a hurried word  or glance  but love grows best in the shade  and meanwhile  the great  church had been growing too  and now it was te filo s proud task to  paint the frescoes on the walls and dome  as the father had hoped   simple designs they were to be at first   floral emblems and the symbols  used for ages by the church  but later te filo was to essay much  more ambitious things  perhaps even the archangels  and san juan  the  soldier saint  himself     it was the winter of       and te filo and magdalena had loved each  other for over a year  when te filo one day spoke to the father of  magdalena  and said that he wished to marry her  for months magdalena  had tried to be dutiful and to engage the father s interest  on her  side  in their favor  in preparation for te filo s broaching of  the subject to him  but she felt always that he remembered her old  hostility  and that he still considered her a mere disaffected indian  of his flock  they had often talked of this  but te filo  who loved the  father for the special kindness he had always shown him  believed that  he would agree to the marriage  why should he not  he said  it would  make no difference to him  and he  te filo  would work better than ever   to show his gratitude     when at last he spoke of the matter  the father peremptorily denied his  request  agust n s daughter was an obstinate  perverse child  and would  only lead te filo away too  he would give thought to the matter  and  would see what girl there was suitable for him  and then  if he wished  to marry  well and good  he would give them two rooms in the corridor   near his own  and would allow him pay as his body servant and for  his work  and perhaps other privileges as well  and that was all  for  te filo knew that he would not be moved from his decision  good man as  the father was  he had the spaniard s failing in dealing with a subject  race a certain hardness arising from a position of authority not allied  with responsibility  except to god  and that  indeed  the father felt   but he conceived that his duty to his indians  apart from his spiritual  ministrations  was entirely comprised in the teaching  feeding  and just  governing of them     when te filo told magdalena  at their next meeting  what the father had  said  the girl was enraged   so he thinks i am not good enough for you    she cried   and i have done everything to please him  but he is only a  priest  and has no heart  ah  those spaniards  i hate them   and then   with a woman s illogical turn   well  he shall see that i am spanish  too  we will go away to the mission at san diego  te filo  my father s  brother is there  and i have heard my father say that he has influence  with the priest  he will marry us  and you can work there as well as  here      but te filo was in doubt  his love for magdalena and his love and  reverence for the father contended  he was a simple  guileless soul  and  the thought of ingratitude to his benefactor was a misery to him  some  other way must be found  the saints would help them  he would pray to  san lucas  who  the father had told him  was his patron  for he had been  born on his day and christened by his name  and magdalena must pray   too     magdalena  however  took up now an attitude of open rebellion  and  absented herself entirely from the services of the church  this was  another trouble to te filo  and daily over his work he prayed to san  lucas  and pondered what was best to do  but days and weeks went on  and  his inward disquiet began to take effect in his appearance and behavior   the father  busy with the multitudinous affairs of the mission  had  entirely forgotten the matter of te filo s request  but one day he  chanced to notice his favorite s listless air  and it recalled the  affair to his mind  a day or two afterwards he said to te filo  as the  latter was with him in the sacristy   te filo  you are dull and not  yourself  you were right  it is time you were married  and i have the  very one for you  it is ana  the daughter of manuel  who works in the  smith s shop  she is a good girl  i will speak of it to her father       padre   said te filo   i cannot marry ana  nor any one else but  magdalena  for i love her  oh  padre    and he dropped on his knees  before the priest    let us be married  you do not know  she has tried  hard to be good  and to please you  and i will work for you all my life   i have been praying to san lucas ever since i told you  but he has not  done anything      the priest was moved by the earnestness of the boy  for boy he had  always considered him  and indeed he was little more in age   well  hijo  mio   he said   i do not know about that  the saints always hear us   as i have told you  and perhaps  who knows   san lucas may do something  yet  or  perhaps   he added with a smile   it is because we changed your  name  and he does not look on you as his son  well  that was my fault   but you say that magdalena has tried to please me  good  then we will  see  i will set her a penance  for she has not behaved well  then  i shall see if she wishes to please me  to morrow will be a day of  observance  and there will be early mass in the church  tell magdalena   te filo  that she must come to mass and carry a penitent s candle  let  her be in the front row of the women  if i see her there i shall know  she is obedient  and perhaps  yes  perhaps   well  we will see about the  rest       oh  padre   te filo exclaimed   you are my padre  indeed   and he put  the priest s hand to his forehead   i know she will come  and i know she  wishes to please you  and padre   he said   i have made a picture of the  angels of la navidad  i did it to please you   he was about to add   and  magdalena   but prudence stopped him in time    i thought  i thought        well  what did you think  hijo mio   asked the priest      i thought  padre  that if you liked it  and said it was done well  it  would be fine on the high roof  padre  the angels  four of them  in the  middle of the roof  like this  padre  see   an he raised his hands in  the attitude in which he had seen magdalena when she met him in the  father s room   i could do it  padre  if you like it       angels  te filo   said the father   hm  i do not know  it is hard to  paint the holy angels  and diligent as you have been  i hardly think you  are an angelico  but go and bring what you have done  and i will see   indeed  it is just what i would have  but it must be well done  or it  will spoil the rest      the boy ran off  and returned quickly with a large sheepskin on which  he had drawn in colors a really fine design  four angels in attitudes of  worship  with uplifted hands  and eyes that expressed  crudely yet well   the wonder that the holy ones might well feel at the miracle of the  manger      ah  and did you really draw this   asked the priest   it is excellent   te filo  we must make a painter of you in earnest  perhaps we might even  send you to mexico to be taught by a good artist  there is one of the  brothers at the college of san fernando who would train you well  i  think this is what san lucas has been doing for you  after all  but how  did you do it  te filo  what did you draw from       padre   said te filo tremblingly   i will tell you  but do not be  angry  it was magdalena  i saw her once  at first  and she was like  that  yes  exactly like that  with her hands up  so  she was like one of  the angels in your new missal  and i remembered  and drew it many times  over  and do you really think it will do for the church  padre   he  finished eagerly  his face aflush with excitement      yes  it is certainly good enough  te filo   said the father   we will  have gold round the heads and golden stars on the robes  and san juan s  church shall be the finest in california  though how it comes that the  girl magdalena can have been your model passes my understanding  indeed   i think it is the good san lucas  or san juan himself  who has helped  you  well  you deserve praise  te filo  and perhaps some reward  but go  now  and tell magdalena to come to first mass to morrow  as i said  you  may take a candle from the sacristy and give it to her      that evening te filo told magdalena all that had happened  but her  spanish blood was in hot rebellion  and in spite of her love and  te filo s entreaties  she would not give in  to carry a candle  as if  she were one of the indian girls  caught in disgrace  no  it was too  much  why  the whole pueblo would see her  and laugh  which  indeed  was  true for she had held herself above the girls of the mission  and was  not loved by them   in vain te filo told her of the father s words  about sending him to mexico to become a real painter  no  it would be  a victory for the father if she gave in  and he should see that she was  spanish as well as he  and contemptuously she tossed the candle aside  into the chia bushes in the courtyard  where they talked in the shadow  of the arches     it was with a heavy heart that te filo left her  yet with a faint hope  that she might repent and come to mass in the morning  it was a dull   oppressive night  such as comes rarely in california  even in the summer  heats  te filo slept but little  and twice during the night he got up  from his bench bed and prayed to san lucas  for this seemed to be the  final chance for his and magdalena s happiness  and after his interview  with the father all had seemed so bright that it was hard now to give  up hope  magdalena  on her part  slept not at all  but she did not  pray  instead  she lay with wide open eyes in the darkness of her little  windowless room  looking up at the low ceiling and fighting over in her  heart the old battle of love and pride  one might say that love stood  for the indian and pride for the spaniard in her  and that it was an  incident in the old feud that began with cortes and malinche  and then  she thought of what te filo had told her  how he had told the father  about painting the angels for the church because he had seen her  standing with upraised hands  like an angel  that day  poor te filo  how  he loved her  and how she loved him  too  it was hard  very hard   that there was so much trouble  how happy they might be  and he was so  clever  and might be a real painter  not working in the fields or at the  workshops  but only painting angels and beautiful things  and she was  the cause  in a way  of his being so clever she was proud of that  and  the thought made her glow  simple indian girl as she was  with a woman s  sweetest thrill  he was clever because of her  yet now she must spoil it  all  and all for the father s hardness     but then  must she   for she knew that it lay with her  after all  she  could make all so happy why not  ah  but the humiliation  no  she could  not  but could she not  the humiliation would soon be over  and the  prize was so great  they might be married  and even at once  yes and  no  yes and no  so the fight went on  as the hours dragged past and the  heavy air pressed upon her restless nerves and forbade sleep     it would soon be dawn  and now she must decide  then the thought came  to her  should she pray to san lucas  as te filo had been doing  perhaps  after all he would help them  she got up  and creeping quietly into the  adjoining room  where her father and mother were asleep  she knelt at  the little crucifix that hung on the wall  and tried to pray  but no  words would come  and she was about to rise and go back to her bed when  it seemed as if words were whispered in her ear  echoes carried in the  brain from something she had once heard  no doubt  in the church          levant  a los humildes       raised up the humble       she had noticed  the words  because they were so averse to her ways of thought  the  humble  why  that was like the indians whom she had always despised   but  after all  perhaps that was san lucas s answer  for she saw that it  would settle all her trouble  well  be it so she would be humble  if san  lucas told her  and she would obey the father  and then  at last  all  would be well     she rose  and  remembering the hateful candle  went into the quadrangle  and searched for it  there it lay among the chias  and she picked it up  and carried it to her room  light was dawning in the east  and she did  not lie down again  but stood in her door  making up her mind to the  humiliation she was to undergo for the sake of te filo and their love   she did not waver now  indeed  in her young  strong passion she gloried  in the sacrifice she would make for love s sake  she dressed herself  with care  they ate no meal that day before mass  which was to be at six  in the morning  if only  she thought  she could tell te filo that she  had resolved to do the penance  it would make it so much easier  but  there would be no way of seeing him until they were at the service   and then the men would be on one side and the women on the other  so he  would not know until he saw her  and perhaps he would not look  for she  had said she would not go  then a thought came to her with delicious  joy  she would make up to him  and punish herself  for having refused   by waiting till the people were all in the church  and then going in  alone  so that everybody would see her  and te filo would see what she  could do for him     solemnly the great bell sounded out the summons to prayer  it was  a special day  the feast of the immaculate conception  and all were  expected to come to mass  old and young  the morning was heavy and  airless  and the people  rising from sleepless or restless beds  moved  languidly and in hardly broken silence toward the church  and  entering   ranged themselves  men and women separately  on either side of the  building  facing the altar  te filo was in his usual place  near the  front  and on the margin of the open aisle that divided the sexes  all  had gathered before the bell ceased to sound  but magdalena was not  there  with a sinking heart te filo had watched  hoping against hope  that she would repent and come  he saw agust n and juana come in  and  agust n go to the place near the altar which he held as mayordomo  while  juana merged in the crowd of undistinguished indian women  so magdalena  was obstinate  and the prospect of happiness that had looked so bright  yesterday was all over and spoiled  but he must not blame her  she was  not just an indian  like him  and with a sigh he ceased to watch the  doorway and turned to face the altar     the father entered  and bent the knee before the altar in view of the  congregation  who also had knelt on his appearing  the church was in  darkness but for the illumination of candles about the altar and a gray  and sickly daylight that came in at the open door  as the father turned  to the people there was a stir among the women who had taken places near  the entrance  and a figure appeared  carrying a lighted candle  it was  magdalena  she walked steadily up the passageway between the men and the  women toward the priest  who stood facing her  a black shawl was thrown  over her head  and her face  pale with sleeplessness and trouble  and  lighted by the candle she carried  seemed to glow against its dark  background as if illuminated from within  te filo had turned at the  sound of her entrance  and watched her as if fascinated during her  passage up the aisle  she did not see him  for her eyes were on the  ground  but she knew his place  for he had often told her  and as she  came near to where he was kneeling she turned a little toward him  and  murmured  so that only he should understand   it is for thee  te filo      as she came close to the altar step  the father s eyes rested on her  with a glance that seemed to say   it is well  my daughter   then he  began the service  while magdalena knelt in the front row of the women   there was an unusual stillness among the people  for the incident of  magdalena s penance had not been known  and had taken all but te filo  and the father by surprise  while the sultry half darkness and the  stagnant air seemed to add to the feeling of awe  so the service  proceeded     suddenly  without warning  at the offertory  destruction broke  there  came a shock  a pause of terror  another shock  that made the solid  walls rock to and fro  a terrible cry   el temblor   and in panic the  people rose from their knees and rushed toward the door  a third shock  came  heavier than the other two  and cornices and masses of plaster  began to fall     at the first cry of the frightened people te filo had risen to his feet   he looked to where magdalena had been kneeling  and saw her standing   still holding her penitent s candle alight in her hand  as the people  rushed toward the door both he and magdalena were almost carried away by  the panic stricken throng  but he made his way to her  and they two were  for a few moments alone  but for the priest  near the altar  when the  third shock came he threw his arms about her  she seemed to have no  fear  nor had he  the spirits of both had been under strain  and one  thing only had been in their thoughts for hours before  so that they  were in great degree oblivious to the general terror  as te filo put  his arms about her  a bright smile came on her white face  and she said   pointing to the candle   it was hard  but i prayed to san lucas  and he  told me to do it  and now we can be married   the shock continued  and  became more violent  pointing to the candle she said again   i did it  for thee  te filo mio   as she spoke  there came a terrifying sound from  above  the great stone dome above them parted  and looking up they saw  for a moment the calm face of the sky through a jagged rent in the roof   then the ponderous structure crashed down in ruin upon them and the  huddled crowd of indians that still struggled for escape     they were found the next day  their bodies crushed together  in her hand  was still the penitent s candle     in one grave the father  who escaped the death that fell that day upon  twoscore of his flock  buried te filo and magdalena  for  said he   making over them the holy sign  they were married  indeed  though in  death  still may be seen on the shattered walls and roof of the mission  church some faded  simple frescoings  the unfinished task and the  memorial of te filo  the painter neophyte of san juan capistrano           san diego de alcala  padre urbano s umbrella        padre urbano  priest in charge of the mission of san diego  was in a bad  humor  if he had been asked what was the most necessary article in the  cargo of the supply ship santiago on the first of her half yearly visits  in the year       he would almost certainly have said  the umbrella  the  candles were important  no doubt  so was the new altar cloth  for the  present one had become shockingly worn under the unskillful treatment of  the indian lavanderas  so were the seeds  all the more so because he had  included in the list seeds for an onion bed  and onions were a delicacy  to which his soul had long been a stranger  and many others of the  articles he had named in his requisition had passed from a state of  shortage into one of absolute vacancy on the storeroom shelves  but  foremost in his thoughts was the umbrella  he had specified it with  care   such an umbrella as he had used in spain  before ever he came to  this destitute and heathen land  the size  a vara and a half across  the  material  silk  the color  yellow  and as the warm spring sun smote ever  more fervently upon his tonsured head  his thoughts had daily turned  with yearning towards the good  ample quitasol that was to shield him  from the fiery persecutions of his enemy  the prince of the power of the  air     well  the vessel had come that day  and with it the umbrella  and now   most cruelly dashing his long cherished hopes  one of his indians had  stolen it  moreover  to morrow he was to start on his annual visitation  of the outlying stations  and he had especially relied for comfort  on  that long  hot  dusty round  upon the umbrella   the fiend fly away with  the miscreant who had taken it  thought the father in his wrath     this is how it happened  the ship had sailed into the bay at early  morning  and the lieutenant at the fort had straightway sent a runner up  to the mission with the cheering news  adding that the articles for the  father s personal use had been thoughtfully packed separately from the  heavier goods  and the captain had obligingly kept the special package  in his own cabin  so that it could be delivered to the expectant  consignee at once on arrival  the father had immediately dispatched two  of his most trusted indians  pio and jose  to receive the goods  which  the captain had promised to have brought ashore in the first boat load     the sergeant who delivered the goods to the indians  in order to make  the unwieldy package easy of transportation by the two men over the two  leagues of road that lay between the bay and the mission  had unwisely  opened it in the presence of the indians  so as to arrange the contents  in two loads  the men had each taken one of the bundles and started for  the mission  in due course  jose had arrived with his load  but alone   and in explanation had reported that at a mile or two from the bay his  companion had fallen behind  to rest  as he supposed  while he continued  on his way  after a time he had waited for pio to come up  but the  latter had not rejoined him  jose had left his own load by the roadside  and gone back to see what had become of him  but no trace was to be  found of either pio or his burden  there was nothing for him  jose  to  do but to continue on his way with his own part of the padre s property   and here he was  pio would doubtless come soon with the remainder     but pio had not come  and the father s fears  born as he listened to  jose s story  grew into angry certainty as hours passed and no pio  appeared  examination of jose s bundle had revealed the altar cloth  the  ink  the sugar  the onionseed  some books  and a few of the articles  of clothing he expected  but the umbrella and part of the clothes were  numbered with the missing  and though the clothes were not only valuable  but much needed  somehow it was the umbrella that made the head and  front of the crime in the father s mind  calling the indians together  after vespers  he announced the theft  denounced the thief  and  pronounced his severest displeasure  with punishments proportionate   against any who should fail to do all in his or her power toward the  apprehension of that ungrateful sinner  pio     let us see what had become of the rascal from the time when he  disappeared  he had really dropped behind to rest  as jose had supposed   but while resting  the desire had come to him to look again at that  strange thing in his package  what could it be  he had seen the sergeant  take it out of the box  along  thin object  then he put his hand  somewhere on it  and pushed  and  wonderful  it had changed in an  instant into a huge flower  such a flower  yellow like a sunflower   nay  like a thousand sunflowers  or the sun itself  then he had done  something again  and all at once it was as it had been at first   talk about magic  all the things his father  old kla quitch  the  medicine man  used to do were nothing to this  he simply must have  another look at it  and now was his chance  while jose  who might tell  the padre  could not see  he slipped the cords from the bundle and took  out the thing of mystery  a long stick  with some yellow cloth rolled  round one end  but how to turn it into the other wonderful thing  he  could not resist trying  and he felt about the stick  pushing this way  and that  as he had seen the soldier do  and it began to open  he pushed  again  it was done  behold the magic sunflower  beautiful  wonderful   and turning it round and round he feasted his eyes on it  the most  astonishing thing he had ever seen  yes  and done  for he  pio  knew how  to make the big flower open     that is where the tempter caught him  what power that would give him  over the other indians  what was kla quitch  with his painted sticks and  bones  compared with him  if only he were the possessor of this marvel   he should need no other stock in trade as medicine man  the people would  pay well to have it opened  that would be good medicine   and simply  keeping it shut would be bad medicine   delightfully easy  how did  it shut  by the by  he fumbled at the stick  but it did not close  he  pushed and pulled  it made no difference  he pressed on the cloth  an  ominous creaking warned him that big flower objected to being shut by  force  and threatened to break     a nice fix he was in now  the genie he had raised would not down  he  grew hot and cold by turns  jose was far ahead by now  he ought to  overtake him  but he could not appear before the padre like this  he  did not know what the purpose of the thing was  but most likely it had  something to do with the church  and he knew how strict the padre was  about even the handling of such objects  what should he do  the tempter  had the answer ready   there was only one thing he could do   run away  with the magic thing and be a medicine man  as his father had been  only  he would be a much more powerful and cunning one  sly tempter  poor pio   he had only meant to nibble  and here he was  fairly hooked     well  since he was in for it  he had better get away before any one saw  him  he caught up the clothes and the umbrella and hurried off into  the brush  it was not easy for him to make his way along with the  obstreperous load  and he soon discovered that the best way to manage  the umbrella was to carry it over his head  very comforting he found it   too  though it did not for a moment occur to him that this was its real  purpose  his plan was to go to his father s tribe  the elcuanams  in the  mountains far away  there he should be safe from the padre  and should  also have the prestige of his father s reputation  if there were another  medicine man in the tribe pio could easily outrank him and capture the  business  so he made a long detour  and came back by evening to the  valley  but a mile or two above the mission  it would be easier to  travel with big flower by keeping to the river bed instead of going  through the brush  which constantly threatened to tear it  he had a  faint idea that it might close of its own accord at evening  and glanced  up anxiously several times to see if it was doing so  but evidently it  was not that kind of flower     he heard the bells of the mission ringing the angelus  and shuddered as  he thought of the wrathful padre  no doubt now denouncing him publicly  as a thief and renegade  and he hurried on till dark  when he found a  sheltered spot and lay down  the night was chilly  and after a time the  thought came to him that big flower would make a fine shelter  so he  got up and arranged it so as to keep off the wind  another idea  the  clothes  why not put them on and be warm  it seemed a terrible thing to  do  but he was running away from the padre anyhow  so he might as well  be comfortable as not  he got up again and spread out the clothes in the  dim light  two woolen undershirts  two pairs of unmentionables to  match  four large handkerchiefs of red silk  three pairs of blue woolen  stockings  and a queer  three cornered article  white  with strings   which he took to be some kind of pouch  but  by a happy thought  found  to make an agreeable protection for the head  also there was a pair of  thick slippers of dark felt  he rolled the handkerchiefs up in a  ball  and then drew on all the other garments except the slippers  not  troubling to first remove his own scanty clothes consisting of a cotton  jacket and pantaloons  he now felt pretty comfortable  and lying down  again was soon fast asleep     when he awoke it was early morning  it was still cold  and he kept the  clothes on  indeed  it occurred to him that this was just the thing to  do  it was much easier than carrying the bundle in one hand while big  flower occupied the other  he would still have the slippers to carry   for he saw that they would soon be worn out if he wore them  with a  few edible roots and berries he made a sort of breakfast  not without  pensive recollection of the warm atole now being dished out at the  mission  when he was ready to go on he thought of the morning prayers at  the mission  and believing big flower to be something connected with the  church  the natural thing to do was to say his prayers before it  which  he did  and then started on his way  after a few miles he knew he was  near the shut in valley  which we call el cajon  and he remembered that  there were indians there who might know him  it is doubtful  really   whether any of his acquaintances would have stopped to recognize him had  they caught sight of the figure he made  for it is safe to say that no  such spectacle had ever been seen thereabouts as our friend pio made   attired in the father s underclothes  adorned with a nightcap  and  carrying in one hand a vast yellow umbrella and in the other a pair of  slippers  the handkerchiefs  much too fine to be wasted  he had tied  together by the corners and made into a sash  such as he had seen the  mexican caballeros wear  and in his piebald of red  white  and blue  he  made altogether a decidedly striking appearance     as he was considering turning aside and making another detour  he had an  object lesson of the effect he produced upon his countrymen  an  indian appeared at a little distance  he was gathering wood  and as  he straightened from stooping his eyes fell upon pio  with a yell he  dropped his load and fled at topmost speed  emitting such sounds as  we try  but vainly  to utter in a nightmare  this  though a tribute to  pio s impressive aspect  and a gratifying omen of his success in the  role of medicine man  was also a warning of danger  he dived again  into the brush and devoted strenuous hours to threading his way through  thickets of chaparral until he emerged on the trail that led northeast  into the heart of the mountains  big flower was happily intact  and the  nightcap also except for a missing string  but the outer layer of the  other garments had paid toll to many an affectionate scrub oak and  manzanita  and the stockings that had stood the brunt were practically  footless  pio surveyed the damage ruefully  and rebuked himself for not  having preserved his new property by wearing his own clothes outside  he  would make the change now  and as it was getting hot he decided to  wear only one set of the undergarments  the damaged ones  under his own  clothes  and to carry the others  when the change was made  he hurried  on  he had made one or two more attempts to make big flower close  but  had not succeeded  so he now marched along in a businesslike way under  the great parasol  apparently an indian gentleman more than usually  careful of his complexion  taking a brisk walk     one thing  however  he had to attend to  the question of food  for he  was getting very hungry  he was now on a steep trail that led up to the  valley now known as the santa mar a  and there  he knew  was another  rancher a  or village  here  too  he might be known  but he must take  the chance  he must have food  and would boldly go and ask for it  as  he pushed his way through the trees he came unexpectedly upon three  fat squaws who were sitting beside the creek  pounding acorns and grass  seeds into meal  just as he saw them  they saw him  umbrella  nightcap   slippers  and all  there was one shriek  or rather  a trio of shrieks  that sounded like one  and the women rushed like deer  albeit very fat  deer  down the creek  and pio heard them gabbling at top voice to what  he knew must be the assembled and startled rancher a     our friend was a philosophical fellow  as we have seen  and as the  natural thing to do was to gather up the little piles of meal  tie them  up in the extra shirt  and make off with them  he did it  there was no  need now for him to trouble the village  so he quietly withdrew by the  way he had come  and  guided by the excited sounds that still reached  his ears  made a roundabout way back to the trail  striking it beyond  the village  at the next water  he mixed some of the meal into a gruel  and ate it  it was not very palatable  and again he thought of the good  food at the mission  from which he was now forever debarred  but a  look at big flower  gleaming like a great golden mushroom in the sun   consoled him  as he thought of the wealth and power he would enjoy among  his tribe by means of this unparalleled marvel     night found him halfway between the santa mar a valley and the next  higher one  to which the spaniards who had first seen it had given the  name of ballena  from the long mountain  like a whale in outline   that shuts it in on the northwest  he found water  made a fire in the  time honored indian way by rubbing two dry sticks together  and cooked  the remaining meal  there was enough for a good supper  and some over   which he made into little cakes  drying them hard on the hot stones   he put on all the clothes again to sleep in  and made a wind break as  before with the umbrella  it was really more comfortable than the hard  bed in his hut at the mission  and he felt more than contented  even  jubilant  over the change in his fortunes     in the morning he said his prayers again before big flower  and started  on his way early  he had pulled on the extra clothing at night over what  he was then wearing  and as the morning was cold  and the trail good  so  that the clothes would not be harmed  he did not take them off  except  the extra stockings  nor change so as to wear his own outside  thus he  again presented the tricolor aspect that had paralyzed the natives he  had met  it now occurred to him to make a little experiment  a sort  of trial canter  of his new profession  upon the indians in the next  valley  he was not far now from his own village of the elcuanams  and  might as well be getting into training  he would avoid surprising any  stragglers at the next village  and would get into touch with the head  men  explaining that he was the long lost son of kla quitch  who had  escaped after all these years from the mission  and had come back   learned in all the knowledge of the white men and armed further with  this most wonderful appliance of magic  to take his place as hereditary  medicine man of his tribe  he should see by that means what sort of  impression he would be likely to make on his own people  nominally they  were christians  but they were hardly ever visited by the priest  and he  knew that the bulk of them were still much as in his father s day  and  still placed reliance on the fetishes of the shamans     accordingly he made his approaches to the ballena village with  caution  it was about noon when he came near  and he could see  as he  reconnoitered  that a group of men were talking together in the  open space about which the houses were irregularly placed  that was  excellent  he crept cautiously near  having some trouble to keep the  umbrella out of sight till the psychological moment  and then  holding  it high overhead with one hand and the slippers and extra garments in  the other  in token of amity  he uttered the orthodox indian greeting  which answers to our  how d  ye do   and advanced upon them     they looked up all together  there was a yell that wakened echoes that  had slept for many a year  and in a twinkling the plaza  so to call it   was empty but for himself  and the braves were dodging about behind the  houses in mortal terror of the hideous monster  worse than the white  men  for he was an unheard of  polychromatic kind of being  not only  white  but red  blue  and yellow as well  it was no doubt the monster of  whom the priest had warned them  who would appear one day  if they were  not careful of their christian duties  and they could not say they had  been   and destroy them all and burn their village  the thing he had in  his hand was doubtless the torch  see how it shone  just like fire  in  vain poor pio declaimed his speech  it fell on ears too demoralized  to hear  and when one or two of them began to fit arrows to their  bowstrings  the best thing to do was plainly to beat a prompt retreat   this he did  holding big flower ignominiously behind him to catch the  arrows that he expected every moment to hear whizzing about him     he ran for some distance till he was out of sight of the inhospitable  village  and then sat down to rest and think  the adventure began to  take on an unpleasant complexion  if every one he came near acted like  this he could not be a medicine man  for there would be no one on whom  to practice  and the bow and arrow episode was really alarming  what if  his own people refused to hear him  no one would recognize him there   for he was a boy when he had been taken to the mission  and he had  never been chosen to accompany the padre on his rare visitations to the  elcuanams  as it had been thought wise not to allow him to return to the  old surroundings  what had he better do  of course he might discard  big flower and all the other fine things  and return to his people an  undistinguished runaway from the mission  as not a few others had done   to the scandal of good father urbano   but he could not bring himself  to that  not yet  at least  well  he would go on  probably the  well remembered name of kla quitch would make it all right     his discouragement over the ballena reception caused him to travel  slowly  and it was nearly sunset when he drew near the elcuanam village   it had been a cool day  so he had kept all the clothes on  except the  extra stockings   the village was in an open place  near the upper end  of a wide valley  and he could see it and be seen from it for a good  distance  he could not think of a better plan of operations than the  one he had tried at ballena  badly as it had worked there  namely  to  maneuver so as to make his first appearance when a number of the chief  men were together  and then get the name of kla quitch to their ears  as quickly as possible  that would arrest their attention  and further  particulars could follow     when he came in sight of the rancher a he stopped and sat down to bide  his time  only a few women and children and an old man or two were  about  the braves were probably out hunting  or  perhaps  bravely  sleeping until the squaws should announce that supper was served  so he  waited  hidden behind a rise of ground  at last the men  to the number  of ten or a dozen  had congregated for the evening lounge and pow wow   pio slipped into the shadow of one of the little houses whence he could  issue in full view of the conclave  he settled the nightcap on his head   grasped the umbrella in one hand and the slippers and stockings in the  other  and at a lull in the conversation advanced  he had decided to  dispense with the  how d  ye do   in order to play his best card at  once  so as he stepped into the light of the fire he merely uttered in a  loud tone the word  kla quitch   to catch their attention  he succeeded   a dozen startled heads turned toward him  and as he spoke his talisman  again  and moved toward them  there came a hysterical howl from a  dozen most unmusical throats  and his audience  followed by the women   children  and dogs of the village  all shrieking in chorus  vanished  into the night  it was a striking tribute to the memory and prowess of  kla quitch  who  it was naturally supposed  had appeared and announced  his return from the spirit world   but it was far from being what his  son and intending successor had hoped     this was the very dickens  or whatever the elcuanam equivalent may be    for poor pio  whatever was he to do now  he prowled about among the  houses trying to find some one to whom to explain  but the panic had  swept even the old men and women away  he could hear the people calling  to one another from their spots of refuge  and ever the burden of  the shout was either  kla quitch   or  yellow    that is to say  the  elcuanam word for that suddenly unpopular color  he began to feel  bitterly toward big flower  the cause  it seemed  of so much trouble   and even toward his departed parent  whose name  so long after his  death  was such very bad medicine as to wreck his son s chances  everywhere     he squatted down by the fire  hoping that some of the men would return  after a time  but none came  after sitting again by the fire for two  hours or so  hoping vainly for company and pondering on his doubtful  future  he felt sleepy  and stretched out with his feet to the blaze   not forgetting to set up his wind break  really the only thing  he began  to think  that big flower was good for     he did not wake till morning  when he looked round anxiously  he could  see the whole population gathered a quarter of a mile away  pointing  toward him and skirmishing for the best positions for viewing his  actions  evidently he was taboo for good and all  and the vision he had  had of himself  as the feared and prosperous medicine man of his tribe  had been a very fancy portrait  feared he certainly was  but there it  ended  it looked as if he had to choose between being a medicine man  all by himself  or abandoning all his paraphernalia and  after a day or  two s judicious absence  rejoining his tribe in the humble capacity of a  mere runaway from the mission     meanwhile he found some food  with difficulty  for the proprietors had  removed their valuables during the night and made a middling breakfast   he had not fully determined what to do  so he stayed where he was until  his next step should become clearer  the morning passed slowly  with no  developments  he kept an eye on the crowd of watchers  and once or twice  he was puzzled to see that they pointed not only at him  but along the  trail to the south  by which he had come     let us now go back a few hours  and take a look at padre urbano  we  shall find him  not at the mission  but only a few miles away  in fact   at ballena  he had started on his visitations the next day after pio s  defalcation  and in anything but good temper  he had come  with his  little party of half a dozen indians  by the same general route that pio  had traveled  and had been only a few hours behind him  he did not stop  at the cajon and santa mar a villages  as he meant to attend to his  pastoral duties in those places on his return  but rumors reached him  of some apparition having been seen by the natives  he knew these  superstitious people only too well  however  and smiled at their  credulity  at ballena he stayed for the night  and was entertained with  a more circumstantial account of a parti colored demon who had been  chased out of the village at arrow s point  but as he had not had time  to check up the shortage in his clothes before leaving home  he did not  recognize pio under the description  he told the indians  on general  principles  that it was  as they supposed  a monster who had scented  their slackness in religious affairs  and who would certainly call again  if they did not amend  and next time would not be so easily put off     he left the ballena rancher a early and started for elcuanam  this was  the farthest from headquarters of all his parishes  an outpost station  had been established there nine years before  under the name of santa  ysabel  but  with only yearly visits since then  it was in a moribund  condition and had not progressed beyond the architectural stage of a  ramada  or brush shelter  a message had been sent a few days before   without pio s knowledge  as it happened   telling the indians to get  the ramada ready for use  and giving the time of the padre s intended  arrival     the little procession  padre  six indians  and two burros carrying the  necessaries for the observance of mass  wound its way slowly up from the  lower to the higher valley  and just before noon arrived at the top of  the last rise before the elcuanam  or santa ysabel  village should be  reached  the father was in the lead  our early acquaintance jose close  behind  they halted for a moment to rest before going on to the village   the father noticed with gratification that the whole population was  stationed on a hillock just beyond the village  evidently in expectation  of his arrival  but he wondered why the foolish people waited there   instead of hastening to meet him  they had caught sight of him  for he  saw them gesticulate  and it seemed to him that they pointed toward the  houses  as if to draw his attention to something  so he looked  and his  eyes caught the gleam of a large yellow object  set up as if it were a  shrine  in the center of the village  very odd  he thought  what had the  silly indians been up to now  they moved on toward the village  and  as they approached  the elcuanams cautiously approached also  when the  father arrived pretty near  he stopped  gazed hard  rubbed his eyes   gazed again  and then said to jose   jose  your eyes are better than  mine  what is that in the village   jose s eyes were already starting  from his head  as if to get a better focus on what he saw   padre    he said  almost in a whisper   i think it is the yellow thing that pio  stole  the sergeant made it open when we went for the package  and it  was like that    holy saints   cried the father   it looks like that to  me  too  but it cannot be  how could my umbrella get to santa ysabel   and what has become of pio  if it is the umbrella  he must have brought  it here    padre   said jose   there he is  i think it is pio  but he  looks very funny  and he is kneeling in front of the yellow thing as if  he was saying his prayers    saying his prayers   said the priest with  warmth   indeed  he had better say his prayers if it is he   and the  party hurried forward     as we know  there was no mistake about its being pio  as for the  prayers   an unusual demonstration from the elcuanams had caused him to  glance again to the trail where they were pointing  there his horrified  eyes had seen what seemed a miracle  but a most unfortunate miracle for  him padre urbano himself  a sight as unmistakable as unbelievable   panic seized him  but on the instant he had an inspiration  too  he was  caught  and something awful was bound to happen  but why not at least  make an attempt to disarm the father s indignation by being caught in  the attitude of worship  which the padre was everlastingly inculcating   it might not mitigate his wrath  but then it might  he propped the  unlucky big flower up so that it would stand  hurriedly stuffed a pair  of stockings into each slipper  dropped them beside the umbrella  and  then fell on his knees and began to patter ave marias  faster  and  much more fervently  than he had ever said them before the altar at  the mission  in his haste he forgot to take off the nightcap  though   indeed  he hardly viewed it in the light of a hat  or cap     in this position the culprit was found by the padre and his escort   and also by the elcuanams  who  emboldened by the father s fearless  demeanor  had ventured back to the zone of danger   pio   cried the  father   get up and show yourself  if it is you  sancta mar a  what  is all this  why  those are my clothes you are wearing  you graceless  rascal  take them off instantly  and tell me what you mean by this  outrage  bring him to me in the ramada  jose  and be sure you bring  the umbrella  praise to the saints  i have found it  and it seems to be  undamaged  after all      on the way to the ramada the father could not help looking round once or  twice at the prisoner  who followed with hangdog look  escorted by the  scandalized indians from the mission and a mob of astounded elcuanams   his indignation began to melt as he thought of the miraculous recovery  of the umbrella  and  since he was a genial and lenient soul  each  glance he took at the wretched pio tickled his risibles more and more   until his shoulders shook with merriment  arrived at the court of  justice he managed to get up an aspect of terrific severity as the  malefactor was led in by jose  the umbrella and the other incriminating  evidence were deposited beside him  the elcuanams and the other indians   crowding about the entrance  crooked their necks with anxiety to  see what would happen  pio had not yet disrobed  and stood dolefully  awaiting the worst  from nightcap to stockings a clown like and  altogether incomprehensible figure  again the father s funny vein got  the better of him  he knew that he was compromising himself forever  but  for the life of him he could not help it  his lip trembled  he tried to  control it but failed  he chuckled  giggled  cackled  and burst into a  roar of laughter     it was no use to think of punishment after that  when father urbano  at last got the shreds of his dignity together  the whole history was  extorted from the trembling pio  who  however  was shrewd enough to say  nothing of his pagan dream of turning medicine man  gladly enough he  shed the unlucky clothing  vast quantities of water were brought from  the spring and blessed by the padre  the umbrella was sprinkled and  sprinkled till no taint could remain  and then pio  guarded by jose   spent the afternoon in scrubbing the desecrated garments with bucket  after bucket of holy water  while the assembled village  down to the  smallest papoose  jeered at that most ignominious of spectacles  a man   washing clothes like a squaw     to complete pio s penance  it was his task to carry the umbrella over  the padre during all the rest of the round of visitations  which  it  seemed to him  as he marched mile after mile with aching arms  would  never end  but end it did  and father urbano s umbrella at last arrived  at its original destination  san diego mission  finally  after many  and various further peregrinations  it ended its travels at the sister  mission of santa ines  where to day the reader may find it reposing   a treasured item in father alexander buckler s curious collection of  relics  it is but fair to say  however  that i am doubtful whether good  father alexander will vouch for my story of its early adventures           san gabriel arcangel  the bells of san gabriel      rather a desolate little spot is the campo santo of san gabriel  rather  desolate  and very dusty  the ramshackle wooden crosses stagger wildly  on the shapeless mounds  the dilapidated whitewashed railings  cracked  and blistered by the sun  look much as though they might be bleached  bones  tossed carelessly about  and the badly painted  misspelled  inscriptions yield up their brief announcements only to a very patient  reader  on the whole  depressing  but in a sleepy  careless way  like  the little tumbledown houses of the mexicans  across the road  like   also  the old mission itself  yellowing and crumbling in the warm  california sun into early decay     walking slowly about among the humble mounds  my mind lazily weaving  from the names and dates of seoelvedas and argyellos and yorbas  with  their romantic sound  a half sad  half delightful tapestry of fancy   i found myself at one inclosure of an appearance so different that i  stopped to regard it particularly  it was the grave of a poor person   clearly  and not in that way noteworthy  for poverty was the air of  the whole place  but it was carefully fenced with a high white railing   there were fresh flowers upon it  and it was evident that affectionate  hands tended it  the short inscription  translated from its spanish   recorded                    ysabel  wife of ramon enriquez           born july           died october                                  much moved    eighteen years old  married  and dead  a sad strand of color this   to run into my tapestry  gay with silver lace  coquettish fans  and  high heeled spanish slippers  eighteen years old  married  and dead  and  muy querida  much beloved  my thoughts stayed behind  as i moved on  and  the words  with their soft inflection  would recur dreamily to me  again  and again  muy querida  alas  muy querida     in the shade of a high remaining piece of the ancient mudbrick wall   three mexicans  with cigarettes and sombreros  and gaudy as tulips in  their striped serapes  were gambling  sleepily  at cards  from one of  the little houses came the sleepy tinkling of a mandolin  muy querida   i wandered over to the edge of the little cemetery  and  sitting down   leaned against the hot wall  under the sleepy  flickering shade of the  neglected olives and expiring walnuts of the mission garden  sleepily  i watched the anxious labors of a hornet  busily building its nest of  clay  a dragonfly hung for a moment before me  then alighted on a  leaf and was suddenly smitten asleep  everything drowsed  except the  everlasting sun  pouring down ceaselessly his shriveling rays  again   over and over  my mind dreamily repeated the words  only eighteen   married  and dead  muy querida       the bells of the mission are ringing  clear and strong  under the  practiced hand of old gregorio  who can ring like he  and to day  of  all days  he is doing his best  for it is the fiesta of the blessed san  gabriel himself  and there are people come from all the towns of the  valley  to say nothing of los angeles  to the fiesta  not but what the  saint has his day every year  but this particular day is a day of days   a fiesta of fiestas  for the padre has arranged a procession in san  gabriel s honor  and what mexican would not ride thirty miles to see  a procession  so to the hitching posts all up the long street are tied  tired horses that have come that hot morning from san fernando  and  calabasas  and farther still  and here and there is a wagon that has  brought a whole family  all to do honor to san gabriel  and to see the  sight of the day  and that is  pre minently  ysabel alvarado  the beauty  of the valley  who is to walk at the head of the procession to the  church     the heart of the beautiful ysabel is in commotion  somewhat like the  bells themselves  as she listens to them and to the clamor of the  children  who began to gather an hour ago before the cottage  and are  now shrilly calling   y sa bel   and she can hardly stand still while  her mother is busily putting the last touches to the wonderful array  in which she is to appear  never before has any girl of the village  had clothes so beautiful  entirely of white  yes  even to the shoes and  their rosettes and laces  all of white  so dear to the mexican heart   moreover  there was the thought of ramon  ramon  who she thought  loved her  to day would surely prove it  when he saw her so dressed   like  yes  indeed  like a grand senorita  ramon had been working in  los angeles  and there there were so many  she sighed to think how  many  girls for him to choose from  but to day he was to be here  old  marta  her mother  had found out  and told her  and to day would  surely tell  there were others  of course  ramon s friend  felipe  for  instance  he was clever  and sang well  and she knew he liked her  but  it was ramon s face that would come between her and the little square of  looking glass  and it was ramon  too  who came into her mind  the saints  forgive her   even when she turned for a moment to her little crucifix   to say a prayer for good fortune  special good fortune  that day     at last all was ready  even to the final brushing that her mother must  give to the glossy hair which  parted by the dark  beautiful face  fell  in a rippling shower almost to her knee  it is no wonder that marta  says  as she hovers  brush in hand  about her   thou art like the great  picture of the blessed santa barbara  child  that i used to see in the  mission where i lived when i was as young as you   and  to herself    ramon had best take care  such flowers are not to be plucked every day  as my ysabelita   and it is no wonder that when ysabel appears at the  door  carrying carefully upright the waxen  fragrant spire of white  lilies for san gabriel which the padre has sent to los angeles to  procure  the excited expectation of the village and its visitors  releases itself in a prolonged  ah   that nearly makes her laugh  outright with happy pride  least of all is it any wonder that ramon  enriquez  gazing with all his soul  says  under his breath   she is like  an angel of heaven  yes  truly an angel is she  my ysabel      the bells of the mission ring happily  happily  as the little procession  passes into the church  muy querida  muy querida       again the bells are swinging and ringing in the hot  sunny air  but it  is not old gregorio who rings now  one maybe sure  so irregular are  the strokes  loud  soft  quick  slow  as if the green old bells were  actually out of breath with laughing  no  gregorio has rung for thirty   yes  nearly forty years  and his ringing is as steady as the pendulum of  the padre s great clock  ah  it is juan  young scapegrace  that rings   and out of breath  truly  is he  so that for once he is ready to obey  when admonished by the padre to leave off   what a noise thou art  making  juanito  i think san gabriel will be stopping his ears  run  up the choir steps  boy  and call to me if thou seest them coming    willingly enough the bare legged urchin raced away  and  perched like an  acrobat on the narrow rail  holding by a trailing branch of the pepper  tree  shielded his merry black eyes as he gazed up the road  his slender  stock of patience was nearly exhausted before the sound of music reached  his ears  and started his feet shuffling   padre  oh  padre   he cried    they are coming  i can hear the violin  it is pedro that plays  i would  bet anything  ah  he can play  yes  and marta is coming first with the  holy water      down the road comes  again  a procession  one half of the village is in  it  and the other half views it with animated admiration from doorways  and verandas  marta  her old black dress for once cast aside  arrayed  in yellow and red  leads the van  as she has at every wedding for twenty  years  following her come three musicians  pedro  in the center  his  gray  thin hair straggling over the collar of his well brushed long  black coat  with young vicente and arturo  the bridegroom s brothers   one on either side  accompanying pedro s weird  thin blooded strain with  thrumming mandolins  next come  by two and two  six little girls  pretty  as angels  with little wild sunflowers in their glossy tresses  and  carrying  with conscious pride  large bunches of red roses  and here are  the bride and bridegroom  ysabel alvarado  the flower of san gabriel   and ramon enriquez  to whose proud  dark face hers is often lifted with  happy smiles at the words of admiration and friendly wishes that reach  their ears     now  juan  ring your loudest  and no one will complain  muy querida  muy  querida            it is the big bell  only  of the mission  that is ringing now  the  one in the top embrasure of the arched campanario  it rings steady  and clear  as gregorio always makes it  but slowly  and the sound that  trembles heavily out upon the heat laden air settles down upon the  village like a noonday shadow  again there are people gathered for a  simple procession  and horses are tied to the posts along the street   but this time it is not at old marta s house that the people are   gathered  but at the new  white cottage that ramon enriquez built   a year ago  for his bride  juan  merry and mischievous as a blue jay  generally  is sober as he hovers on the outskirts of the little group  of people  again the six little girls are waiting  two and two  but  they carry white flowers  lilies  roses  and jessamine  presently marta  appears  a creeping  somber figure  black from head to foot     the straggling group moves up the street  old marta at the head  talking  to herself  and shaking her head  as they near the mission the great  door opens  and the padre comes out  followed by four young men  who  carry  alas  my heart tells me what they carry  the brightness and  lightness of the face and form of ysabel enriquez  and there lies upon  her breast a tiny baby form  alas  muy querida  ramon walks behind  and  looks neither to right nor left  as they take their place at the head of  the little procession  and so they go  up the white  dusty road  to the  campo santo     muy querida  muy querida  says the great bell  slower and slower  muy  querida  muy       and so  ceases       the sun was going down  its warm light dying away up the ancient wall   far away sounded the faint thrumming of the mandolin in the cottage  across the road  the three mexicans were still silently gambling     yes  it is a desolate little spot  the campo santo of san gabriel            the foregoing sketch was written some short time ago  before  certain renovations were made about the cemetery which have changed the   atmosphere  of the place  i confess to an unreasonable wish that god s  acre might have been spared by the industrious hand of the whitewasher   when the zeal for  cleaning up  seized upon the village fathers of san  gabriel           san fernando  the buried treasure of sim        the idea of finding buried treasure has always exercised what seems  to me an unreasonable charm over people s minds  unreasonable  not  of  course  that there would not be charm in finding it  but because of the  disparity between the amount of attention that has been spent on the  quest and the real prospect  usually  of success  treasure islands   treasure ships  treasure graves  and many other such possibilities  have been many times exploited  both in fact and in story  so it is not  surprising that the california missions should also have had their vogue  as a supposed tom tiddler s ground  and as a matter of fact  a good many  of the buildings show plain traces of the ravages of pick and shovel   sometimes wielded boldly by parties of declared prospectors  but more  often in secret by knights of the dark lantern     why it should be supposed that riches were buried in these places is not  clear  but somehow the idea seems to arise automatically in connection  with old or ruined buildings  a recent writer remarks that  the foolish  notion that the fathers had unlimited wealth  nay  gold or silver mines   which they concealed  was common among the mexicans of that day  and it  exists among their descendants to the present time   so far as can be  known  the seekers have never found anything of value  it seems  indeed   unlikely that the fathers at any of the missions ever could have amassed  any sum of money that would be much worth secreting  saving anything out  of their meager stipend of four hundred dollars per year would have been  out of the question  even if the sum had been paid in money  in full   and regularly  none of which desirable conditions seems to have been  met  while as to hoarding from the proceeds of the industries carried on  at the missions  although the returns must have been large  the expense  of caring for a family of a thousand or so indians must have been  proportionately heavy  and in addition there are to be reckoned the  exactions of the provincial government  which seems to have looked upon  the missions generally as a sort of providential and inexhaustible  milch cow  so that the latest defender of the padres  the learned father  zephyrin engelhardt  is probably justified in holding that their  riches were all of unworldly metal  and consisted only in  their  conscientiousness  industry  economy  and abstemiousness   such  intangible valuables  it may be remarked  if they could be recovered  by delving  would certainly not have proved  in the estimation of the  delvers  a satisfactory reward     the mission of san fernando  some twenty miles northwest of los angeles   has more than once been the scene of these unhopeful quests  the  visitor  who might be curious concerning sundry excavations noticed in  the foundations of the massive adobe walls  would be told by the old  mexican who acted as custodian of the ruin  it is hardly more than  that  that they were made by  malos hombres  ladrones  que buscaban  dinero   and  with a shrug   tontos  no cogieron no mas que polvo  mucho  polvo  mucho trabajo   bad men  thieves  who were looking for money   fools  they got nothing but dust  plenty of dust and plenty of work    and with a chuckle  old tomas would lead the way up the next rickety  stairway     yet  one cannot tell  there may have been instances of treasure being  buried about the missions  on some emergency arising  since  in the  times we are thinking of  the only means of safekeeping sums of money  that were too large to be carried on the person was the secreting of  them in the walls of buildings or in the ground  be that as it may   perhaps the reader will have a better explanation of the facts of the  following narrative than the one with which i conclude it       on the afternoon of a warm day of june  some twenty summers since  i was  making my way from los angeles to the coast by way of the san fernando  valley and the road that runs through the simi hills  it was yet the  dawn of the automobile era  and direction signs did not then  as now   give the traveler on california roads the certainty of his route that he  now enjoys  and i found myself  at late afternoon  in considerable doubt  whether i had not mistaken my way  with the probability  if that were  the case  of having to camp for the night in the open  my horse would  not suffer  for there was forage in abundance  and water was not hard to  find thus early in the summer  but it was annoying for myself  for i had  but a scrap of food and no blankets  the road  well traveled at first   that i had been following for two hours past  had for some distance been  showing signs of degenerating into a trail  in that inexplicable way  that roads sometimes have   and now it seemed about to  peter out   finally on a hillside of yellowing grass  yet i knew i had been making  in the right direction  even if off my road  so i was loath to turn  back  the road  or trail  probably led somewhere  and i decided to keep  on as long as any track could be seen leading westerly     two miles or so farther brought me to the end of all tokens of travel   the track had dwindled to less and less  and now had dropped to the  bouldery bed of a canon stream  from which no woodcraft of mine  nor of  my good trail wise horse  could perceive that it made an exit  if the  trail continued  it must follow the bed of the stream  at any rate   here was water  the first requisite for a camp  i decided to go on for a  while  but to stick to the creek  for safety  dismounting  i led pancho  forward by the bridle among the slippery boulders  the sun was well out  of sight  and the chirping of crickets among the herbage announced that  soon the evening shades would prevail  evidently  camping was to be my  portion  so i kept my eyes open for a good spot for the purpose  the  canon appeared to widen out a little way ahead  there i should probably  find good grazing for the horse  though not  i ruefully reflected  for  myself   arriving at the opening  i found  as i expected  grassy slopes  rising from the creek  and resolved to make here my bivouac     taking off saddle and bridle i turned pancho loose to graze  while i  gathered wood for afire  the dusk was soon enlivened by a crackling  blaze  beside which i sat to eat a sandwich and a scrap of chocolate   reserving an equivalent banquet for the morning  pancho munched away  cheerfully  the stream tinkled and purred  the first star telegraphed  its friendly signal down through the ether  to be lost in the simi was  not half bad     my supper  since it must be so called  over  and pancho picketed for  the night  i walked a short way up the canon in the gloaming  some two  hundred yards from camp  at a point where the stream made a turn  i  stopped in sudden surprise at the sight of a light shining among a clump  of small live oaks near by to my right   well   i said to myself   so i  am on a trail  after all  can there be a house here  too   a few steps   and my question was answered  for i saw that the light shone through the  open window of a little house of adobe  what should i do  my appearance  at this lonely spot at night would cause so much surprise that i  hesitated  but i was quite conscious that i had made an unduly light  supper  and  moreover  that i was in the way of making no better a  breakfast  probably i could buy here a little food  and at any rate  i  could get information as to my road  so i approached the house  there  was an attempt at a garden  i saw  and growing against the window was  a bush of the red flowered sage which i have noted as being a general  favorite with mexicans  as i came up to the door i heard voices  and  caught a glimpse through the window of a woman sitting at a rough table   eating  at the same moment a dog within the room started up and barked  loudly  it seemed to be my cue to speak as well as knock  so  acting  on a vague assumption that the people were mexicans  i called   buenas  noches      the talking ceased abruptly  and with it the music of knife and fork on  crockery  i knocked and called again   buenas noches   a chair moved   and a man s voice said   abajo  perro   whereupon the bark was exchanged  for an equally uncomfortable growling  then the door was thrown open   and a man  standing in the doorway  asked in spanish   who is there   in  a few words i explained my presence  adding that i was short of food and  should be glad to purchase a little   enter  senor   he invited  and  as  i did so   carlota   he said to one of two well grown girls who sat by  the woman   carlota  give your seat to the caballero   the woman had  risen already  and in a matter of fact way was putting a plate and cup   evidently for me  my first impulse was to explain that i had had my  supper  but i have always found frank acceptance to be the best reply to  the frank hospitality of these courteous people  and with an expression  of thanks i took the offered place and was ready to share their meal     i now had an opportunity to notice my entertainers  the man was a  strongly built  good looking  middle aged mexican  the wife  as i  took her to be  placid looking  kindly featured  and of the national  middle aged stoutness  the two children were slender  attractive girls   verging on the early womanhood of their race  i think they were twins   this  i supposed  comprised the household  until  my glance following  the wife as she went to the stove  i saw another person  a man   apparently deformed  sat by the fire  bent forward  his hands resting  on a stick  but doubled over as he was  his eyes  black and piercing   followed every movement made by any of us  my host  by whom i sat  said  in a low voice   he is my brother  senor  he is very ill   i was on  the point of making some remark of condolence when he added   he cannot  speak  senor  he is dumb   feeling that it would be best not to refer  to the matter  and to turn the conversation  i inquired as to the road  i had missed  and whether i could get through to the coast without  returning  this i learned i could do  my host promising to put me in the  way in the morning     just as supper  which proved to be a cheerful meal  was over  the  invalid in the corner  rapping with his cane on the floor  gave notice  that he needed attention  carlota went quickly to him and helped him  to rise  and then led him  slowly and with no little trouble  into  an adjoining room  as he shuffled past where i sat  my eye caught the  glitter of some object of metal that swung by a cord from his neck  in  the fashion of a medal  this i later decided it to be  when i noticed  what seemed to be an exactly similar object on a little shelf or  bracket  fixed to the wall  on which stood a small figure of the virgin   the woman now rising to clear the table  i rose also  and  thanking my  kind entertainers for their hospitality  asked what i owed them  saying  also that i should be glad to buy a little food of them before leaving  in the morning  they would accept no money for the meal  however  and i  forbore to press them  as i took my hat to go  my host asked   will you  not sit a while by the fire  it is yet early  and it is cold outside   i  gladly assented  and  offering him my pouch  a friendly smoke began     the seats at the table were heavy benches  not easily moved  but in the  corner by the stove  where the sick man had sat  i saw a dark  box like  object which would serve for a chair  i was about to seat myself on  this when my host  whose name  i learned  was leandro rojas  hastily  interfered   not on that  senor   he said   it would be bad fortune   very bad fortune   at the same time pulling one of the benches forward   on this we both sat  and chatted  somewhat haltingly on my part  for my  spanish was no more fluent than his english  i was curious about that  bad omened seat in the corner  especially as i felt pretty  sure it was  on that that the invalid had been sitting  but  not wishing to violate  my friend s superstitions  i refrained from alluding to the matter  my  gaze  however  often reverted to the puzzling object  which in the dim  light appeared to be a small but solid chest of some dark wood  heavily  clamped with iron bands  and  i thought  having something carved on  the lid  i suppose senor rojas noticed me looking at the chest with  interest  and when  in the course of conversation  i asked whether his  brother had long been ill  he replied   yes  senor  many years  but my  wife does not like it talked of  it is ill fortune to talk of bad luck   she says  and the box is bad fortune  that is certain  i wish it were  not here  but i will tell you about it when we go out of the house      i spent with them a pleasant hour  finding topics of mutual  interest  among them the perennial one of rattlesnakes  of which i had  found the region unduly prolific  and the need of schooling for the  children  who  though attractive and well mannered  had never made the  acquaintance of even slate and pencil  on bidding them good night  i  asked whether i might breakfast with them  on the strict understanding  of payment for the meal   and was glad when they willingly agreed     when i left the house  leandro said he would walk with me to my camp   and i took the opportunity of asking about the chest   i will tell you   senor   he said   though it is bad fortune  and i wish i had never seen  it  see what it has done to my brother    was it the box that hurt your  brother   i asked   how  did it fall on him    oh  no  senor  nothing  like that   he replied   it was his horse that hurt him  but all the  same it was the box that did it  my wife says so  and i say so  too   pedro  i do not know what he thinks  but then  he is as you see  this is  how it happened  senor      it was many years ago  yes  nearly twenty years  we were both young  then  and we worked on the escorpion  for don guillermo  my father used  to work for him too  he was a foreman on the ranch  and when pedro and i  were old enough to ride after the cattle he made us vaqueros  pedro was  strong in those days  yes  stronger than i am now  and quite tall  there  was no one who could ride like pedro on the escorpion  to see him now   ay de mi  well  senor  one day some steers were missing  twelve or  fifteen or more  and my father sent us  pedro and me  to find them and  bring them in  we hunted for them one day  two days  and could not find  them  the range was getting poor on the escorpion  but it was still good  in the hills  and my father said the cattle must have gone up to the  sim   so the next morning we started toward the sim   and it was not  long before we found their tracks  coming toward the hills  we followed  them all that day  and nearly at night we found them  it was in a little  valley that is quite near here  you will go through it to morrow  senor      we had brought food with us  for we knew we might be more than one day  out  and when we had found the cattle we looked for a place to camp  we  headed the steers down the creek  and came out into this canon  and here  we saw the house  the same house  senor  so you see it is quite old  but  it was old then  too  we were surprised  for we did not know there was a  house there at all  and we had been born at san fernando  and we thought  we knew everybody that lived this way as far as ventura  it was nearly  dark  and there was no light in the house nor anybody about  though the  house did not look quite as if no one lived there  we should have liked  to use it to sleep in  but we thought some one must live there  and  might come in  so we made a camp on the creek  just about here  where  your camp is  is where we slept      in the morning  after we had eaten  pedro said he was going to look  inside the house  i was saddling the horses and did not go with him   in a few minutes i heard him call  so i went to the house  pedro was  standing at the door  and he looked white and frightened   there are  dead people here   he said   they are all dead   he went in and i went  in after him  in the back room there was a bad sight  a very bad sight   senor  a lot of bones lying all about the room  and there were three  skulls among them  in the middle of the room was that box you saw  with  the lid open  there was a big bone  like a leg bone  lying right across  it  i remember  zape  a bad sight that was      it must have been a long time since they had died  months  perhaps  years  two or three  from the look of the place and the bones  the  coyotes had been in  and nothing but the bones and some bits of clothing  was left  they had all been men  at least i think so  because there were  no women s clothes  in the box there were pieces of money  twenty or  thirty  or perhaps more  i did not like to touch it  with the dead men  all about there  but pedro  he was always one who cared for nothing  he  said it was lucky to find them  the money wasn t dead  he said  and he  laughed at me  he picked up one of the coins  it was a silver peso of  spain  very old  was it not strange  senor  all the money was the same   all pesos and all old  i  have never seen any more like them       well  pedro said we ought to take the money  the dead men could not  spend it  he said  so it was foolish to leave it  but i would not touch  it  not one piece  i wanted to burn the bones  and at last pedro helped  me  we picked them all up  the skulls and all  diantre  it was bad work   i wanted to put them in the box  and burn all together  and bury the  money  but pedro would not  he wanted the money  and he said he would  have the box too  so instead of burning them  we buried them  that is   the bones  we found an old spade  and dug a place behind the house   among the sycamores on the hill  you will see to morrow  and buried  them      then we had to go to take the cattle back to the ranch  pedro would  take the money  he put it in his clothes  it was quite heavy  and you  could hear it  so he put some in his shoes and in other places  i asked  him what he would do with the box  because he would not burn it  he said  he wanted it because it had been good luck to find it  he would get it  someday and keep it  then we went away with the cattle  pedro said we  should not tell anybody about what we had found  nor about the dead  people  and there was no one to tell  i mean the officers  unless we  went to los angeles  so i did not say anything  and pedro did not   because he had taken the money       it was not long before he had used it up  i don t know where he spent  it  for there was no money like it  and people would ask where he got  it  but somehow he spent it  all but two pesos  then one day he asked  me to come with him to the place again  he wanted to see if the box was  there  and if anybody lived in the house  i did not want to see the box   but i wanted to know if any one lived there  so i came with him  it was  about a year after we had found the dead men and the money  it was  a sunday  and we got to the place about noon  for we started early   everything was like we had left it  and it did not look as if any one  had been to the house  the box was there  and it was open  and then i  noticed that there was some writing on a piece of paper inside the  lid  it must have been there when we saw the box before  but we had not  noticed it  it was very old and yellow  and torn  too  and we could not  read it  they did not seem like spanish words  we stayed an hour  maybe   and then i said we should go  so as to get back before night  then pedro  said to me  why shouldn t we come and live here in the house  we each  had a few head of cattle of our own by that time  nearly twenty all  together  and the range here was very good  he was tired of working on  the escorpion  he said  the place didn t belong to anybody  as far as  we could tell  and we could make a good home here and do well with our  cattle      i forgot to say that i had got married a little time before  and i  said my wife would not come so far away from her people  they lived  at calabasas  i didn t like the idea of living in that house  though  i liked the land and wanted to have a place of my own  now that i was  married  so we were talking about it when we got on our horses to ride  back  we rode past the sycamore trees  where we had buried the bones of  the dead men  just when we passed the place  my brother s horse jumped  at something  and threw him off  he fell against a sharp rock that hurt  him in the back  he was quite still  and i thought he was dead  for a  long time he did not move  but i could see he was breathing  i got water  and threw it on him many times  and at last he opened his eyes  but he  could not move  senor  nor speak either  the rock had hurt his backbone   and his legs were like dead  he was a paral tico  and he has never been  able to move  any more than you saw him move  nor talk either      i did not know what to do  it was many miles to the ranch  and there  was no one that lived anywhere nearer  my brother was in much pain  so  i could not put him on his horse  i was afraid of hurting him more  he  could not talk  but he pointed at the house  for me to take him there   there was nothing else to do  and at last i got him there  then i said  i must go and get help to take him away  but he shook his head and  would not let me go  i think he thought he might as well die there as  anywhere  and he was half dead anyway  but i had to go to get food  and  i thought i could bring a doctor also  i left him some water  and got  on my horse and rode  cielo  how i rode   for i thought he might be dead  when i got back  it was dark most of the way  and it was midnight when  i got to the ranch  i got help  and sent for a doctor to come from los  angeles  my wife  she is a good woman  my wife  elena  senor  she said  she would come with me to nurse pedro if he could not be brought away   we were back at the house the next day early  two cousins of mine and my  wife and myself  pedro was lying where i had left him  but he was out of  his head  whenever he saw the box he would try to get up and go to it   so i put it where he could not see it  i had never told my wife about  the box and the money  i thought it would only do harm to talk about it      the doctor came the next day  he said pedro would never be able to  walk  he might be able to speak after a while  but he never has  the  doctor told us he ought not to be moved for a long while  and so we  stayed  senor  and we have never gone away  don guillermo was very good   i think god makes people good to one when one is in trouble  is it not  so  senor  he gave me ten more cattle  two of them were good milch  cows  that made thirty head we had all together  and he sent us a lot of  flour  and coffee and frijoles  and then he found who owned the land the  house was on  it was an american  who lived in san francisco and never  came here at all  and don guillermo told him about my brother getting  hurt  and he promised that we could have the house and the grazing for  nothing for three years  and then pay a little when we could  after  about ten years i bought the place  about fifty acres  and now it is my  own       so it was bad fortune the box brought us  as i said  senor  but good  fortune  too  did you see what my brother has round his neck  senor  it  is one of the pesos  he had two of them left when he was hurt  he had  always said he would keep those two for more luck  as he called it  one  day  after he was hurt  i saw him making a hole in one of them  and he  hung it round his neck  he gave me the other  i did not want to take it   so i put it on the shelf for our lady  you can see it in the morning   and you can see the box  too  my wife would like to burn it  and so  would i  but pedro will not let us  and he always sits on it  there  is carving on it  an  f  and a  y   i think  and there is the writing  inside  though much of it is gone now  perhaps you can tell what the  writing says  i should like to know  if there is enough left to tell  by       well  it is late  and elena will be going to bed  i am sorry that we  have no room for you to sleep in  senor  but the house is small  and we  are so many women and sick  buenas noches  senor      i was much interested in the strange story i had heard  and lay for some  time awake  trying to fit a working theory to the black chest and the  spanish dollars  but with no success  it was a puzzle that was worth a  good deal of trouble to unlock if it could be done  and i was eager for  daylight  to get a good view of the box  probably the invalid would  not be up so early as the rest of the family  who had breakfast  i had  learned  at six o clock  i was prompt upon the hour  and while waiting  a few minutes before the meal was ready  i examined the silver piece and  the chest  the coin was a large one  spanish  as my host had said  and  bore the inscription of carlos iii  with the date       and the arms  of castile and le n  the box i examined with special attention  it was  exceedingly heavy for its size  which was about thirty inches long by  fourteen wide and ten deep  and was made of the dark  hard wood of some  tropical tree that had withstood decay wonderfully  on the upper side  of the lid were cut the letters  f y  in plain  deep carving  encircled  with an elaborate scroll  this somewhat defaced and broken in  outline  three heavy strips of iron were fastened round the shorter  circumference  one near each end of the box and one at the middle  at  the ends were strong wrought iron handles  and there was a curious lock   also of wrought iron  i opened the lid  and there  as leandro had said   were the remains of a sheet of parchment  vellum  or heavy hand made  paper  which had been glued to the wood  but the greater part of which  was torn or worn away  it was evident that the writing was too much  defaced to allow of more than a mere guess at its purport  but by the  not very good light i copied what i could decipher of the inscription   this is what i made out         hac ar   osit    unt num    tria mi   et qu    enti qui    pert    anc mi         sanc            in cujus fini    utelam ob lat        hoc lito   atis com    arca absco   a est     rra       oc         i had hardly finished my transcription when my hostess entered saying  that breakfast was ready in the kitchen  so no attempt at working out  the puzzle could be made at the time  pedro s food was taken to him by  carlota  and he did not appear before i left  during the pleasant meal   i looked with added respect at the woman whose goodness of heart had led  her willingly to undertake  and to carry day by day for many years  the  burden of a hopeless  and i fear an ungrateful  invalid  though  indeed   from my experience of the kindliness  and especially the strength of the  family bond among the mexican people  i might well have been prepared  for such magnanimity      soon after breakfast i bade them farewell  leandro accompanying me a  short distance to show me my road  when we came to part  no further word  had been said regarding pedro or the mysterious chest  i said nothing   for i had no theory to offer  when we shook hands  after thanking him  heartily i remarked that i hoped we might meet again  adding  as an  afterthought   and in a luckier house    yes  senor   he said   but it  is not the house that is unlucky  our lady attends to that  it was the  money  and  you see   with a smile   i gave her the half of what was  left  do you know  senor  sometimes i think the money was stolen from  the church  that would account for all  is it not so  they say the  churches had much money once  quien sabe  adios senor      as i turned pancho into the trail that would bring me to the ventura  road  my mind was busy at a clue that leandro s parting words had  started   f y   the letters carved on the chest  somehow they seemed  to link up with something in my memory  who was that padre of whom  robinson  in his  life in california   spoke with a good deal of  disparagement  the surname initial was surely a  y   and it seemed to  me that san fernando was the mission where the depreciated father dwelt   yorba  ybarronda  ybaez  ybarra  yes  that was it  ybarra  sure enough   and the first name was francisco  it seemed to me  and i felt sure  now that it was at san fernando that robinson encountered him  all  circumstantial evidence  no doubt  but highly interesting  to try  another link  did the scraps of writing give any support to my idea   i took out my notebook  unmistakably there were the letters  rra   remaining where naturally the signature would be written  all the rest  of the name was gone except a fragment of rubric  but that embellishment  again made it plain that the letters were part of a name     with that i had to be satisfied  both then and now  matters of more  personal importance soon pushed the problem into the back of my mind   once  indeed  chancing on a copy of the torn inscription  i spent an  idle hour in trying to fashion the oddments into a possible connected  whole  in case the reader should be interested in such exercises  i will  give my tentative solution     i take the writing  as far as the signature  to have been in latin   and this is my guesswork rendering  the reader may perhaps improve upon  it       in hac arca depositi sunt nummi tria millia et quingenti qui pertinent  ad hanc missionem de sancto fernando  in cujus finibus ad cautelam ob  latrocinia hoc litore a piratis commissa haec arca abscondita est     francisco ybarra     oct           my chain of guesses  then  is that the old chest that i saw in that  house in the sim  hills may have once been the personal property of  fray francisco ybarra  sometime priest in charge of the mission of san  fernando  that he  on the approach of some marauders  buried the chest   with the stated sum of money in silver pesos of carlos iii  in some  hiding place about the mission precincts  that for some unguessable  reason the chest was never taken up by the priest or his successors  but  that long years afterwards  probably not less than fifty  some party of  treasure seekers  of whom there are evidences of there having been many  at that mission  came upon the buried chest  that it was transported by  them to the lonely house in the mountains  some twenty miles distant   that there  a quarrel occurred over the booty  and that the survivor  or survivors of the fatal affray  if any there were  did not  for some  reason  carry off in their flight all the treasure  the rest of my  theory is embodied in the foregoing narrative     but after all  as to the whole matter  probably there is little to be  said that is more to the point than the all embracing phrase of leandro   and of spain and mexico in general  quien sabe  who knows           santa barbara  love in the padre s garden      it was five years since i had seen my old chum  dick trevgern  back  in boston  while mrs  trevgern i had never seen at all  so when  last  winter  i found myself at santa barbara  where they lived  one of the  first things i did was to trace them in the telephone book and call up  dick  the result was an urgent invitation to dinner that evening  i was  quite keen to meet my friend s wife  and all the more so  since dick   who is one of the finest fellows in the world  is  or used to be  also  one of the oldest fashioned  and had seemed to be destined for bachelor  joys  so i wondered what could be the special charms that had subjugated  him     i found them as cozy as a married couple of two years  standing has a  right to be  in a rose embowered cottage on one of the hill streets near  the mission  mrs  trevgern i found to be a very pretty  vivacious  and  in every way attractive girl   she was only twenty   and as they were  evidently very fond of each other i rejoiced at dick s good sense and  good fortune  it was a very jolly little dinner  and altogether as  pleasant an evening as i have ever passed  at some indirect reference to  the topic  it is hard to find a name for it that is agreeable to every  one  but i will use a well worn phrase  the emancipated woman  i had  an opportunity of seeing that the lady clearly was of the affirmative  party  whereas i knew  from recollection of old times  and anyway  because dick was dick  that his view on the question was a decided no   this raised an interesting little speculation in my mind  and when   about eleven o clock  mrs  trevgern declared that she was going to leave  us two together for a good confabulation over old days  and retired for  the night  i made some half joking reference to the matter  and asked  dick how it happened that he  of all men  had chosen a wife out of the  emancipation camp      oh  well   he replied   she is a dear good girl   i hastened to say  that i was sure of it   and we have lots of fun out of our different  ideas on little things like that  the odd thing is  though  that it  was kitty s fad for woman s rights and that sort of thing that is  responsible for her being mrs  trevgern  i mean  that was what you might  call the exciting cause  pull your chair up to the fire and i ll tell  you all about it  it was really quite a joke       no doubt it will be news to you that i used to know kitty years ago   before either you or i came to california  all the time that you fellows  were ragging me about being an old bachelor  i knew my own mind and  meant to marry kitty some day  i don t think you knew her people  the  draytons  they lived down at quincy  close to us  and our families were  old friends  at the time that i got this appointment out here she was  only sixteen  but before i came away from boston i told her i loved her   and that when i had got on my feet i was going to ask her to marry me   i didn t want her to promise then  for it didn t seem square to ask her   but i had a pretty good idea that she liked me  and i figured that in  two or three years i could be so placed that i might fairly ask her   and  as young as she was  she would hardly have fallen in love with any  one else  after i came to california i wrote to her now and then  not  often  and no spooning  you know  but just to keep myself in her mind   and she answered with good  sensible  newsy letters       she was always a particularly bright girl  with a good idea of what  was going on in the world and a mind of her own about it  in one of  her letters she said she had been going to a set of lectures by some  confounded englishwoman  on the woman of to morrow  or the day after  to morrow  or something  and asked me what i thought about what she  called woman s awakening  i dare say you remember how we used to argue  all that stuff in our old debating club  didn t we just   and how i  always got sat upon for being a back number and not lining up with the  hatchet brigade  well  i hadn t changed my mind  haven t yet  for that  matter  but i didn t suppose she cared two hairpins about it  and i  replied with some old joke or other  and let it go  from other letters   though  i soon saw that kitty had got really keen on the suffrage  business  and that she knew i was a heretic  but we both had sense  enough not to let the subject get on the argumentative line       it ran on that way until two years ago  and then her people came to  spend the winter in california  in the early spring they came up to  santa barbara  and i saw kitty again  i hadn t weakened at all in my  loving her  and she was prettier than ever  almost as pretty as she is  now  bless her   yes  i knew you d think so  old man   by that time i  was doing quite well  and prospects were good enough so that i felt i  could ask her to marry me  one day  on a drive round by montecito  i  asked her  she wouldn t promise  said she liked me as much as ever  and  didn t care about any one else  but didn t think she ought to marry me   and so on  i couldn t get her to say why for a long time  but at last  it came out  some one  that idiotic englishwoman  i suppose  had put it  into the dear girl s head that it was her duty not to ally herself with   a reactionary   i think that was the word  and in this case that meant  poor harmless me  i argued till i must have been blue in the face  but  i couldn t get her to give in  she says now that she thought she would  make me give in  and so it had to stay  but my consolation was that i  knew she really cared for me  it was just head against heart  and though  i knew  as i said  that kitty s head was as good as anybody s  i thought  her heart was better yet  i told her  though  that i shouldn t let it  rest like that for long       a day or two later i had an engagement to go up with them to look  at the mission  one of the fathers showed us through  a dozen or  more people altogether  regular tourist style  and we had seen about  everything there was  when some one asked if we couldn t go into the  sacred garden  you know what i mean  there s a private garden that  most people don t get to see  and which  as the story goes  no woman  is allowed to enter  the priest said he was sorry  but it was only by  special permission that any visitor saw that garden and that permission  was never given for ladies to see it  kitty pricked up her ears at  that        do you mean to say   she said to me  as we walked on   that there is  a part of the mission where men may go and women mustn t    i don t mean  to say so   i told her  but the padre here does  and i m afraid that  settles it    indeed  it doesn t   she said   what does he mean  is  there something horrid there that is not nice for women to see    no    i replied   it s nice enough  just a garden  they call it sacred  but  i don t know why    oh  i see   remarked kitty   sacred from women  no  doubt  that s just like these monks  they think this is the middle ages  still  i suppose you think so too  you may go anywhere  because you are  a man  but a woman is to be shut out of this and that  they re sacred    i could see she was pretty much excited  and i tried to calm her down    now  kitty   i said   you know very well that as far as i m concerned  there s nothing on earth that i want so much as for you and me to be  together always and everywhere  let them keep their old garden  anyway   if it s too sacred for you it would certainly kill me on the spot     it s all very well to make fun   she returned   but it s the principle  that has to be fought  it s absurd  it s  it s mediaeval  and you re  mediaeval too   she wound up   well   i said   i always knew i was a bit  old fashioned  but i was never called a regular antique before   that  made her laugh  and we forgot all about the old garden till we got back  to the house       at least  i thought she had forgotten  but when i said good bye she  came with me to the door  and said   dick  i m going to see that garden  at the mission  it isn t that i care about the garden  but i do care  about the principle  i m going to get in somehow  and i want to know   will you help me    my dear kitty   i answered   i m your man  at least  you know i want to be  the only thing is  how do you mean to do it     that s for you to arrange   she said   you men think you can do things  better than women  so here s a chance to show what you can do    well    i remarked   it looks like a burglar s job  and i ve not done much in  that line  but you know what i said  that i want to go everywhere you  go  and if that means jail  i m game   she looked a bit serious when i  talked about jail  for she thought i was in earnest  but she didn t back  down  and i said i would see what plan i could think up       i easily found out whereabout the garden was  and the only way i could  see to get kitty in there was by climbing over the wall some evening  after dark  it was an adobe wall  and not very high  i could easily get  over it myself  but for kitty we ought to have a ladder  there was a  bright little mexican chap i knew  whom i had met one day up by the  mission  he lived near there  and one day i had seen him haunting about  and got him to pose in a picture  after that we d had chats now and  then  it occurred to me that julio could find a short ladder and  bring it to the place  and i had an idea  old fashioned  you see  as  usual  that he would make a kind of chaperon  too  to save a little bit  of the respectabilities  i told kitty my plan  and she thought it was  all right  jumped at it  in fact  so we set the time for two days after  the next full moon  we figured that as it was sundown soon after five  o clock  we could do our wall climbing when it got dark  say about half  past six  before the moon came up  it would rise about seven  and we  should have plenty of light to investigate the garden  kitty did pretty  much as she liked at home  as regards being in or out  so all she  would need to tell her people was that she was going to be with me that  evening       well  i arranged it with julio  he was a mischievous little rascal  and  it looked like a good joke to him  and a couple of dollars was good pay  for a joke  when the evening came  i called for kitty about six o clock   i had told her to dress in some kind of color that would not show too  much by moonlight  so she had on a big gray cloak of her mother s that  covered her all up  it had a hood  too  so she didn t need a hat  for  fun i had drawn a large placard  with  votes for women  on it in big  letters  i meant to tack it to a tree or something if i got a chance   but kitty didn t know anything about this       when we got to the place  julio was there with his ladder  it is very  quiet round there at night  and there was not much danger of any one  coming past  i got up first on the wall to make sure the coast was  clear  there were lights shining from two or three windows  but no one  was moving  so i beckoned kitty to come  and she climbed up and sat on  the wall while julio came up  then i quietly pulled up the ladder and  lowered it on the garden side  i went down first  and then kitty  she  was a bit excited  i could see  but as game as ever  i had told julio to  wait up on the wall by the ladder till we came back       it was about seven o clock and nearly moonrise when we started on our  tour  i took kitty s hand  she was rather trembly  but she said she  meant to see everything there was in this precious garden  i did  too   now we were in  we went along a path by the wall and found a seat  there  was no reason for hurrying  so we sat down to wait till the moon was  up  it was certainly pretty especially with kitty there  there were tall  black cypresses  and climbing roses  and orange trees just coming into  bloom  and when the moonlight touched the old belfries  and there came  the murmuring sound of chanting from some place within the mission   kitty whispered to me that the garden really was almost sacred  and i  quite agreed with her       after a few minutes we went on  the garden is laid out in beds of  shrubs and flowers  with winding walks between  we kept in the shade as  much as we could  as there were several windows that look on the garden   and some one might see us if we made ourselves conspicuous  but there  were lots of trees  and we skirmished about from one to another and had  no end of a good time  kitty was enjoying it immensely  and it did seem  a pretty good joke to be dodging about in the old garden right under  their noses  for we could see them now and then through the windows  we  were standing under a big cypress that had been trimmed up to ten feet  or so above the ground  when i remembered my placard  i unfolded it  and showed it to kitty  and then fixed it on the tree with thumb tacks   kitty was dancing about with joy at the placard  and almost clapping her  hands  but i made her stop for fear some one would hear her       we had nearly been all round the garden  taking it easily  and sitting  down now and then  we were laughing and joking under our breath  and i  was thinking that this would be a good place to propose to her  again  rather romantic  you know  to pop the question under those  circumstances  it was getting time to clear out  but we sat down again  for a few minutes before we went  kitty threw the cloak off  and in her  white dress and by the moonlight in that old garden  she looked  well   you can imagine  no  you can t  though  no one could who didn t see her   so i up and told her all i wanted to say  the darling took it like an  angel  but just out of mischief  i know  for she has said so herself  since then she hummed and hawed and began to talk about different points  of view and stuff like that  well  at that very moment  a door opened  and a man  one of the priests  came out  we were sitting in the shadow   but the door was right opposite  and i suppose the bright light coming  through the doorway shone on kitty s white dress  perhaps he heard us   too  for i guess we had forgotten about talking under our breath  i know  i had  anyhow  he spotted us  we saw him stop for a second and heard  him say something to himself  and then he came right toward us  i saw  we were in for it  so i caught kitty by the hand and we ran  i heard the  father  or brother or whatever they call themselves  coming after us  we  could hear his skirts flapping about and i think he must have been a fat  man from the way he puffed       we were right at the other end of the garden from where the ladder was   kitty is a good runner  and we had a good lead and were nearly there  when suddenly kitty almost stopped and exclaimed  in a horrified voice    the cloak  dick  we ve left it behind  and it has mother s name on it    whew  that s a bad mess  i thought  it must be got  that was certain    you run on   i told her   and get up the ladder  do you see it     yes   she said   but what about you    i m going back for the cloak    i answered   you get up the ladder and wait for me  i ll stop him  following you  quick  kitty  hurry up   i watched her get to the ladder  and then started back  i didn t know just where the priest was  as we  had lost him somewhere among the trees  but i ran back  got the cloak   and started again cautiously for the ladder  when i was halfway there i  caught sight of him staring at the placard  i can t understand to  this day why he hadn t raised a racket  i think that placard must have  hypnotized him  well  he saw me and called to me to stop  as he was  between me and the place where the ladder was  i saw i couldn t get past  him  so i ran back to the other end of the garden again  and he came  running after me  when he came to the door i saw him stop a moment and  then go in  evidently to get help  that was my time  i sprinted back as  fast as i could  for it was getting rather too interesting  kitty was  there all right  sitting on the wall  but i couldn t see julio nor any  ladder   dick   she called down to me   i ve let the ladder drop down  on the other side  can you get up without it    how on earth did you do  that   i asked   i was afraid that horrid monk might come along and see  me  and take the ladder away to keep you from getting up   kitty said    so i pulled it up after me  and then it slipped and went down the other  side    never mind   i replied   i can climb up  but where is julio    i  haven t seen him   she said   but never mind him  come along up        i threw the cloak up to her  and then jumped at the wall to clamber up   i caught the top all right  but the rotten adobe bricks came away  and i  tumbled down with half a dozen of them on top of me  and in falling  by  the worst kind of luck  i sprained my foot  i tried to get up  but found  i couldn t stand on the hurt foot   what s the matter  dick   asked  kitty   sprained foot   i said   i don t see how i m going to climb up  that wall now  i can t jump high enough with one foot  and the adobes  would most likely come down again  anyhow  confound that imp  julio   he would have saved all this mess if he had done as i told him  i guess  we re trapped  i am  anyway        every moment i expected to see the mission people coming  and there  was the chance of some one coming along the road  too  and finding kitty  playing humpty dumpty  the poor little thing was nearly crying   oh   dick   she said   does it hurt much  oh  i know it must  and it s all my  fault  what will they do to us  dick    well   i answered   they can t  skin us and eat us  you know  i shouldn t mind about myself  only that  it makes a fellow look like a fool  you ought to marry me now  kitty   for no one else will   i added  severely   don t you think so    oh  i  suppose so  dick   she said  half laughing and half crying   no one else  will marry me  either  for that matter  i wonder you want to  after  my getting you into this fix    all right  darling   i said   it s a  bargain  mind  they have n t got us yet  anyhow   i went on   here they  come  though   as half a dozen petticoated figures issued from the door   i saw them go toward the other end of the garden  where i had last been  seen  and begin searching about   now  kitty   i told her   when they  come this way you just let yourself down the other side as far as you  can  and then drop  you are lighter than i  and i think the bricks will  hold  then run home as quickly as you can  and lie low    dick   the  little trump replied  indignantly   do you suppose i m going to run away  and let you stand the blame  do you think i m one of those putty kind of  girls   i tried to argue with her but  well  you know what suffragists  are  she wouldn t budge   dick   she exclaimed at last   what am i  thinking of  i can drop down  as you said  and get the ladder over to  you   i d thought of that  of course  but i couldn t stand the idea  of her falling and perhaps getting hurt   you mustn t do it  kitty    i declared   if you get hurt as well  we shall be in a worse hole than  ever   my mind was working like lightning  and suddenly i thought of  the cloak   kitty  i said   throw the cloak down to me   it was a good  old fashioned cloak  with yards and yards of stuff in it  i twisted it  into a sort of rope  and then stood up against the wall on my good foot  and threw the end over as far as i could   how far does it reach   i  asked   plenty far enough   she answered  i didn t need to say any more   she took hold of it and let herself down  and i heard her drop to the  ground  in another moment she was up on the wall and puffing the ladder  after her  it made an awful row  and i saw some of the people stop and  listen  it was touch and go then  i could see  kitty lowered the ladder   and in half a jiffy i was up  as we were pulling the ladder up  they saw  us and began to come on the run  but they were just about half a minute  too late  i sent kitty down and then scrambled down myself  just then   along came that young scamp julio  as innocent as you please   take the  ladder and run that way   i ordered   and let it drag so as to make lots  of noise        kitty was shaking all over  what with excitement and fright  and pity  for my foot  we sat down against the wall and listened to the chaps  inside calling us awful names in spanish  irish  german  and about  everything

was anything more tender than all he says to me     toi  true     arg  and that there can be nothing more painful than the restraint  under which i am kept  for it prevents all sweet intercourse  and puts  an end to that mutual love with which heaven has inspired us     toi  you are right     ang  but  dear toinette  tell me  do you think that he loves me as  much as he says he does     toi  hum  that s a thing hardly to be trusted at any time  a show of  love is sadly like the real thing  and i have met with very good  actors in that line     ang  ah  toinette  what are you saying there  alas  judging by the  manner in which he speaks  is it possible that he is not telling the  truth     toi  at any rate  you will soon be satisfied on this point  and the  resolution which he says he has taken of asking you in marriage  is a  sure and ready way of showing you if what he says is true or not  that  is the all sufficient proof     ang  ah  toinette  if he deceives me  i shall never in all my life  believe in any man     toi  here is your father coming back       scene v   argan  angelique  toinette     arg  i say  angelique  i have a piece of news for yon which  perhaps   you did not expect  you have been asked of me in marriage  halloa  how  is that  you are smiling  it is pleasant  is it not  that word  marriage  there is nothing so funny to young girls  ah  nature   nature  so  from what i see  daughter  there is no need of my asking  you if you are willing to marry     ang  i ought to obey you in everything  father     arg  i am very glad to possess such an obedient daughter  the thing is  settled then  and i have promised you     ang  it is my duty  father  blindly to follow all you determine upon  for me     arg  my wife  your mother in law  wanted me to make a nun of you and  of your little sister louison also  she has always been bent upon  that     toi    aside    the excellent creature has her reasons     arg  she would not consent to this marriage  but i carried the day   and my word is given     toi    to  argan   really  i am pleased with you for that  and it  is the wisest thing you ever did in your life     arg  i have not seen the person in question  but i am told that i  shall be satisfied with him  and that you too will be satisfied     ang  most certainly  father     arg  how  have you seen him then     ang  since your consent to our marriage authorises me to open my heart  to you  i will not hide from you that chance made us acquainted six  days ago  and that the request which has been made to you is the  result of the sympathy we felt for one another at first sight     arg  they did not tell me that  but i am glad of it  it is much better  that things should be so  they say that he is a tall  well made young  fellow     ang

future son in law will be brought to  me by his father     what is the matter  you look all scared     ang  it is because  father  i see that you have been speaking of one  person  and i of another     toi  what  sir  you have formed such a queer project as that  and   with all the wealth you possess  you want to marry your daughter to a  doctor     arg  what business is it of yours  you impudent jade     toi  gently  gently  you always begin by abuse  can we not reason  together without getting into a rage  come  let us speak quietly  what  reason have you  if you please  for such a marriage     arg  my reason is  that seeing myself infirm and sick  i wish to have  a son in law and relatives who are doctors  in order to secure their  kind assistance in my illness  to have in my family the fountain head  of those remedies which are necessary to me  and to be within reach of  consultations and prescriptions     toi  very well  at least that is giving a reason  and there is a  certain pleasure in answering one another calmly  but now  sir  on  your conscience  do you really and truly believe that you are ill     arg  believe that i am ill  you jade  believe that i am ill  you  impudent hussy     toi  very well  then  sir  you are ill  don t let us quarrel about  that  yes  you are very ill  i agree with you upon that point  more  ill even than you think  now  is that settled  but your daughter is to  marry a husband for herself  and as she is not ill  what is the use of  giving her a doctor     arg  it is for my sake that i give her this doctor  and a good  daughter ought to be delighted to marry for the sake of her father s  health     toi  in good troth  sir  shall i  as a friend  give you a piece of  advice     arg  what is this advice     toi  not to think of this match     arg  and your reason     toi  the reason is that your daughter will never consent to it     arg  my daughter will not consent to it     toi  no     arg  my daughter     toi  your daughter  she will tell you that she has no need of mr   diafoirus  nor of his son  mr  thomas diafoirus  nor all the  diafoiruses in the world     arg  but i have need of them  besides  the match is more advantageous  than you think  mr  diafoirus has only this son for his heir  and   moreover  mr  purgon  who has neither wife nor child  gives all he has  in favour of this marriage  and mr  purgon is a man worth eight  thousand francs a year     toi  what a lot of people he must have killed to have become so rich     arg  eight thousand francs is something  without counting the property  of the father     toi  that is very well  sir  but  all the same  i advise you  between  ourselves  to choose another husband for her  she is not of a make to  become a mrs  diafoirus     arg  but i will have it so     toi  fie  nonsense  don t speak like that     arg  don t speak like that  why not     toi  dear me  no  don t     arg  and why should i not speak like that     toi

her  but i have to tell you that you can give  nothing to your wife by will     arg  but why so     mr  de bon  it is against custom  if you were in a district where  statute law prevailed  the thing could be done  but in paris  and in  almost all places governed by custom  it cannot be done  and the will  would be held void  the only settlement that man and wife can make on  each other is by mutual donation while they are alive  and even then  there must be no children from either that marriage or from any  previous marriage at the decease of the first who dies     arg  it s a very impertinent custom that a husband can leave nothing  to a wife whom he loves  by whom he is tenderly loved  and who takes  so much care of him  i should like to consult my own advocate to see  what i can do     mr  de bon  it is not to an advocate that you must apply  for they are  very particular on this point and think it a great crime to bestow  one s property contrary to the law  they are people to make  difficulties  and are ignorant of the bylaws of conscience  there are  others whom you may consult with advantage on that point  and who have  expedients for gently overriding the law  and for rendering just that  which is not allowed  these know how to smooth over the difficulties  of an affair  and to find the means of eluding custom by some indirect  advantage  without that  what would become of us every day  we must  make things easy  otherwise we should do nothing  and i wouldn t give  a penny for our business     arg  my wife had rightly told me  sir  that you were a very clever and  honest man  what can i do  pray  to give her my fortune and deprive my  children of it     mr  de bon  what you can do  you can discreetly choose a friend of  your wife  to whom you will give all you own in due form by your will   and that friend will give it up to her afterwards  or else you can  sign a great many safe bonds in favour of various creditors who will  lend their names to your wife  and in whose hands they will leave a  declaration that what was done was only to serve her  you can also in  your lifetime put in her hands ready money and bills which you can  make payable to bearer     bel  alas  you must not trouble yourself about all that  if i lose  you  my child  i will stay no longer in the world     arg  my darling     bel  yes  my pet  if i were

think you very  fortunate in being the father of such a fine young man     mr  dia  sir  it is not because i am his father  but i can boast that  i have reason to be satisfied with him  and that all those who see him  speak of him as of a youth without guile  he has not a very lively  imagination  nor that sparkling wit which is found in some others  but  it is this which has always made me augur well of his judgment  a  quality required for the exercise of our art  as a child he never was  what is called sharp or lively  he was always gentle  peaceful   taciturn  never saying a word  and never playing at any of those  little pastimes that we call children s games  it was found most  difficult to teach him to read  and he was nine years old before he  knew his letters  a good omen  i used to say to myself  trees slow of  growth bear the best fruit  we engrave on marble with much more  difficulty than on sand  but the result is more lasting  and that  dulness of apprehension  that heaviness of imagination  is a mark of a  sound judgment in the future  when i sent him to college  he found it  hard work  but he stuck to his duty  and bore up with obstinacy  against all difficulties  his tutors always praised him for his  assiduity and the trouble he took  in short  by dint of continual  hammering  he at last succeeded gloriously in obtaining his degree   and i can say  without vanity  that from that time till now there has  been no candidate who has made more noise than he in all the  disputations of our school  there he has rendered himself formidable   and no debate passes but he goes and argues loudly and to the last  extreme on the opposite side  he is firm in dispute  strong as a turk  in his principles  never changes his opinion  and pursues an argument  to the last recesses of logic  but  above all things  what pleases me  in him  and what i am glad to see him follow my example in  is that he  is blindly attached to the opinions of the ancients  and that he would  never understand nor listen to the reasons and the experiences of the  pretended discoveries of our century concerning the circulation of the  blood and other opinions of the same stamp        t  dia    pulling out of his pocket a long paper rolled up  and  presenting it to  angelique   i have upheld against these  circulators a thesis which  with the permission

ordinary  public  ordinary people are more convenient  you are accountable to  nobody for your actions  and as long as you follow the common rules  laid down by the faculty  there is no necessity to trouble yourself  about the result  what is vexatious among people of rank is that  when  they are ill  they positively expect their doctor to cure them     toi  how very absurd  how impertinent of them to ask of you doctors to  cure them  you are not placed near them for that  but only to receive  your fees and to prescribe remedies  it is their own look out to get  well if they can     mr  dia  quite so  we are only bound to treat people according to  form     arg    to  cleante   sir  please make my daughter sing before the  company     cle  i was waiting for your commands  sir  and i

to  angelique   don t refuse  pray  but let me  explain to you what is the scene we must sing    aloud   i have  no voice  but in this case it is sufficient if i make myself  understood  and you must have the goodness to excuse me  because i am  under the necessity of making the young lady sing     arg  are the verses pretty     cle  it is really nothing but a small extempore opera  and what you  will hear is only rhythmical prose or a kind of irregular verse  such  as passion and necessity make two people utter     arg  very well  let us hear     cle  the subject of the scene is as follows  a shepherd was paying  every attention to the beauties of a play  when he was disturbed by a  noise close to him  and on turning round he saw a scoundrel who  with  insolent language  was annoying a young shepherdess  he immediately  espoused the cause of a sex to which all men owe homage  and after  having chastised the brute for his insolence  he came near the  shepherdess to comfort her  he sees a young girl with the most  beautiful eyes he has ever beheld  who is shedding tears which he  thinks the most precious in the world  alas  says he to himself  can  any one be capable of insulting such charms  where is the unfeeling  wretch  the barbarous man to be found who will not feel touched by  such tears  he endeavours to stop those beautiful tears  and the  lovely shepherdess takes the opportunity of thanking him for the  slight service he has rendered her  but she does it in a manner so  touching  so tender  and so passionate that the shepherd cannot resist  it  and each word  each look is a burning shaft which penetrates his  heart  is there anything in the world worthy of such thanks  and what  will not one do  what service and what danger will not one be  delighted to run to attract upon oneself even for a moment the  touching sweetness of so grateful a heart  the whole play was acted  without his paying any more attention to it  yet he complains that it  was too short  since the end separates him from his lovely  shepherdess  from that moment  from that first sight  he carries away  with him a love which has the strength of a passion of many years  he  now feels all the pangs of absence  and is tormented in no longer  seeing what he beheld for so short a time  he tries every means to  meet again with a sight so dear to him  and the remembrance of which  pursues him day and night  but the great watch which is kept over his  shepherdess deprives him of all the power of doing so  the violence of  his passion urges him to ask in marriage the adorable beauty without  whom he can no longer live  and he obtains from her the permission of  doing so  by means of a note that he has succeeded in sending to her   but he is told in the meantime that the father of her whom he loves  has decided upon marrying her to another  and that everything is being  got ready to celebrate the wedding  judge what a cruel wound for the  heart of that poor shepherd  behold him suffering from this mortal  blow  he cannot bear the dreadful idea of seeing her he loves in the  arms of another  and in his despair he finds the means of introducing  himself into the house of his shepherdess  in order to learn her  feelings and to hear from her the fate he must expect  there he sees  everything ready for what he fears  he sees the unworthy rival whom  the caprice of a father opposes to the tenderness of his love  he sees  that ridiculous rival triumphant near the lovely shepherdess  as if  already assured of his conquest  such a sight fills him with a wrath  he can hardly master  he looks despairingly at her whom he adores  but  the respect he has for her and the presence of her father prevent him  from speaking except with his eyes  at last he breaks through all  restraint  and the greatness of his love forces him to speak as  follows       he sings         phyllis  too sharp a pain you bid me bear     break this stern silence  tell me what to fear     disclose your thoughts  and bid them open lie    to tell me if i live or die     ang     the marriage preparations sadden me     o erwhelmed with sorrow     my eyes i lift to heaven  i strive to pray     then gaze on you and sigh  no more i say     cle     tircis  who fain would woo     tell him  phyllis  is it true     is he so blest by your sweet grace    as in your heart to find a place     ang     i may not hide it  in this dire extreme     tircis  i own for you my love        cle     o blessed words  am i indeed so blest     repeat them  phyllis  set my doubts at rest

strain     ang     i love you  i love you     tircis  i love you     cle     ye kings and gods who  from your eternal seat     behold the world of men beneath your feet     can you possess a happiness more sweet         my phyllis  one dark haunting fear        our peaceful joy disturbs unsought         a rival may my homage share     ang     ah  worse than death is such a thought     its presence

cle  nothing     arg  then that father is a fool to put up with those silly things   without saying a word     cle    trying to go on singing       ah  my love        arg  no  no  that will do  an opera like that is in very bad taste   the shepherd tircis is an impertinent fellow  and the shepherdess  phyllis an impudent girl to speak in that way in the presence of her  father    to  angelique

it would be a  good thing to introduce a doctor here  having a full understanding of  our wishes  to disgust him with his mr  purgon  and abuse his mode of  treating him  but as we have nobody to act that part for us  i have  decided upon playing him a trick of my own     ber  in what way     toi  it is rather an absurd idea  and it may be more fortunate than  good  but act your own part  here is our man       scene iii   argan  beralde     ber  let me ask you  brother  above all things not to excite yourself  during our conversation     arg  i agree     ber  to answer without anger to

 brother  that  with all the wealth you possess  and  with only one daughter  for i do not count the little one  you speak  of sending her to a convent     arg  how is it  brother  that i am master of my family  and that i can  do all i think fit     ber  your wife doesn t fail to advise you to get rid  in that way  of  your two daughters  and i have no doubt that  through a spirit of  charity  she would be charmed to see them both good nuns     arg  oh  i see  my poor wife again  it is she who does all the harm   and everybody is against her     ber  no  brother  let us leave that alone  she is a woman with the  best intentions in the world for the good of your family  and is free  from all interested motives  she expresses for you the most  extraordinary tenderness  and shows towards your children an  inconceivable goodness  no  don t let us speak of her  but only of  your daughter  what can be your reason for wishing to give her in  marriage to the sort of a doctor     arg  my reason is that i wish to have a son in law who will suit my  wants     ber  but it is not what your daughter requires  and we have a more  suitable match for her     arg  yes  but this one is more suitable for me     ber  but does she marry a husband for herself or for you  brother     arg  he must do both for her and for me  brother  and i wish to take  into my family people of whom i have need     ber  so that  if your little girl were old enough  you would give her  to an apothecary     arg  why not     ber  is it possible that you should always be so infatuated with your  apothecaries and doctors  and be so determined to be ill  in spite of  men and nature     arg  what do you mean by that  brother     ber  i mean  brother  that i know of no man less sick than you  and  that i should be quite satisfied with a constitution no worse than  yours  one great proof that you are well  and that you have a body  perfectly well made  is that with all the pains you have taken  you  have failed as yet in injuring the soundness of your constitution  and  that you have not died of all the medicine they have made you swallow     arg  but are you aware  brother  that it is these medicines which keep  me in good health  mr  purgon says that i should go off if he were but  three days without taking care of me     ber  if you are not careful  he will take such care of you that he  will soon send you into the next world     arg  but let us reason together  brother  don t you believe at all in  medicine     ber  no  brother  and i do not see that it is necessary for our  salvation to believe in it     arg  what  do you not hold true a thing acknowledged by everybody  and  revered throughout all ages     ber  between ourselves  far from thinking it true  i look upon it as  one of the greatest follies which exist among men  and to consider  things from a philosophical point of view  i don t know of a more  absurd piece of mummery  of anything more ridiculous  than a man who  takes upon himself to cure another man     arg  why will you not believe that a man can cure another     ber  for the simple reason  brother  that the springs of our machines  are mysteries about which men are as yet completely in the dark  and  nature has put too thick a veil before our eyes for us to know  anything about it     arg  then  according to you  the doctors know nothing at all     ber  oh yes  brother  most of them have some knowledge of the best  classics  can talk fine latin  can give a greek name to every disease   can define and distinguish them  but as to curing these diseases   that s out of the question     arg  still  you must agree to this  that doctors know more than  others     ber  they know  brother  what i have told you  and that does not  effect many cures  all the excellency of their art consists in pompous  gibberish  in a specious babbling  which gives you words instead of  reasons  and promises instead of results     arg  still  brother  there exist men as wise and clever as you  and we  see that in cases of illness every one has recourse to the doctor     ber  it is a proof of human weakness  and not of the truth of their  art     arg  still  doctors must believe in their art  since they make use of  it for themselves     ber  it is because some of them share the popular error by which they  themselves profit  while others profit by it without sharing it  your  mr  purgon has no wish to deceive  he is a thorough doctor from head  to foot  a man who believes in his rules more than in all the  demonstrations of mathematics  and who would think it a crime to  question them  he sees nothing obscure in physic  nothing doubtful   nothing difficult  and through an impetuous prepossession  an  obstinate confidence  a coarse common sense and reason  orders right  and left purgatives and bleedings  and hesitates at nothing  we must  bear him no ill will for the harm he does us  it is with the best  intentions in the world that he will send you into the next world  and  in killing you he will do no more than he has done to his wife and  children  and than he would do to himself  if need be        arg  it is because you have a spite against him  but let us come to  the point  what is to be done when one is ill     ber  nothing  brother     arg  nothing     ber  nothing  only rest  nature  when we leave her free  will herself  gently recover from the disorder into which she has fallen  it is our  anxiety  our impatience  which does the mischief  and most men die of  their remedies  and not of their diseases     arg  still you must acknowledge  brother  that we can in certain  things help nature     ber  alas  brother  these are pure fancies  with which we deceive  ourselves  at all times  there have crept among men brilliant fancies  in which we believe  because they flatter us  and because it would be  well if they were true  when a doctor speaks to us of assisting   succouring nature  of removing what is injurious to it  of giving it  what it is defective in  of restoring it  and giving back to it the  full exercise of its functions  when he speaks of purifying the blood   of refreshing the bowels and the brain  of correcting the spleen  of  rebuilding the lungs  of renovating the liver  of fortifying the  heart  of re establishing and keeping up the natural heat  and of  possessing secrets wherewith to lengthen life of many years  he  repeats to you the romance of physic  but when you test the truth of  what he has promised to you  you find that it all ends in nothing  it  is like those beautiful dreams which only leave you in the morning the  regret of having believed in them     arg  which means that all the knowledge of the world is contained in  your brain  and that you think you know more than all the great  doctors of our age put together     ber  when you weigh words and actions  your great doctors are two  different kinds of people  listen to their talk  they are the  cleverest people in the world  see them at work  and they are the most  ignorant     arg  heyday  you are a great doctor  i see  and i wish that some one  of those gentlemen were here to take up your arguments and to check  your babble     ber  i do not take upon myself  brother  to fight against physic  and  every one at their own risk and peril may believe what he likes  what  i say is only between ourselves  and i should have liked  in order to  deliver you from the error into which you have fallen  and in order to  amuse you  to take you to see some of moliere s comedies on this  subject     arg  your moliere is a fine impertinent fellow with his comedies  i  think it mightily pleasant of him to go and take off honest people  like the doctors     ber  it is not the doctors themselves that he takes off  but the  absurdity of medicine     arg  it becomes him well  truly  to control the faculty  he s a nice  simpleton  and a nice impertinent fellow to laugh at consultations and  prescriptions  to attack the body of physicians  and to bring on his  stage such venerable people as those gentlemen     ber  what would you have him bring there but the different professions  of men  princes and kings are brought there every day  and they are of  as good a stock as your physicians     arg  no  by all the devils  if i were a physician  i would be revenged  of his impertinence  and when he falls ill  i would let him die  without relief  in vain would he beg and pray  i would not prescribe  for him the least little bleeding  the least little injection  and i  would tell him   die  die  like a dog  it will teach you to laugh at  us doctors      ber  you are terribly angry with him     arg  yes  he is an ill advised fellow  and if the doctors are wise   they will do what i say     ber  he will be wiser than the doctors  for he will not go and ask  their help     arg  so much the worse for him  if he has not recourse to their  remedies     ber  he has his reasons for not wishing to have anything to do with  them  he is certain that only strong and robust constitutions can bear  their remedies in addition to the illness  and he has only just enough  strength for his sickness     arg  what absurd reasons  here  brother  don t speak to me anymore  about that man  for it makes me savage  and you will give me his  complaint     ber  i will willingly cease  brother  and  to change the subject   allow me to tell you that  because your daughter shows a slight  repugnance to the match you propose  it is no reason why you should  shut her up in a convent  in your choice of a son in law you should  not blindly follow the anger which masters you  we should in such a  matter yield a little to the inclinations of a daughter  since it is  for all her life  and the whole happiness of her married life depends  on it       scene iv  mr  fleurant  argan  beralde     arg  ah  brother  with your leave     ber  eh  what are you going to do     arg

short time     toi  he doesn t deserve it     mr  pur  i was about to cleanse your body  and to clear it of its bad  humours     arg  ah  my brother     mr  pur  and it wanted only a dozen purgatives

compliment on the    belle mere   the only way out of the difficulty in english seems to   be to complete the sentence somewhat          harvey s treatise on the circulation of the blood was published in         his discovery was violently opposed for a long time afterwards          moliere seems to refer to dr  guenaut  who was said to have killed   with antimony  his favourite remedy  his wife  his daughter  his   nephew  and two of his sons in law   aime martin           oublies   now called  plaisirs    wafers  would perhaps have been   the right rendering in moliere s time          this piece is composed of a mixture of dog latin  french   c  and   is utterly untranslateable          it is said that it was when uttering this word that moliere gave   way to the illness from which he

xxxi  their works do follow them          chapter i      it may be that she is working still        it was raining drearily  and but few people were abroad  that is  few   comparatively speaking  though the streets seemed full of hurrying   dripping mortals  in the large dry goods store business was by no means  so brisk as on sunny days  and one of the younger clerks  whose station  was near a window looking out upon the thoroughfare  had time to  stand gazing at the passers by  they did not seem to interest him  particularly  or else they puzzled him  his young  handsome face wore  a thoughtful look  almost a troubled expression about the eyes  which  seemed to be gazing beyond the passers by  just across the aisle from  him  a lady  seated in one of the easy chairs set for the accommodation  of shoppers  waited and watched him   a young and pretty woman   tastefully  even elegantly dressed  yet her costume was quite in  keeping with the stormy day  the young man s face seemed to have special  interest for her  though he apparently was unaware of her existence   a close observer would have discovered that she was watching him with  deeply interested eyes  whatever served to hold the thoughts of  the young man apparently grew in perplexity  for the troubled look  continually deepened  at last  forgetting the possible listener  he  addressed the dripping clouds  perhaps   at least  he was looking at  them        i don t know how to do it  but something ought to be done  it is worse  than folly to expect good from the way that things are now managed   ester would have known just what  and how  and how interested she would  have been  i try to do her work  and to  redeem the time   but the  simple truth is  i don t know how  and nobody else seems to      these sentences were not given all at once  but murmured from time to  time at his unsympathetic audience outside     patter  patter  patter  drip  drip  drip  steady  uncompromising  business  it was all the answer the clouds vouchsafed him     with the listener inside it was different  the interested look changed  to an eager one  she left her seat and moved toward the absorbed young  man  breaking in on his reverie with the clearest of voices        i beg your pardon   but are you thinking of your sister  you are  mr  ried  i believe  i have heard of your sister s life  and of her  beautiful death  through a dear friend of my husband  who loved ester   i have always wanted to know more about her  i wanted to get acquainted  with you  so i might ask you things about her  i am waiting now for my  husband to come and introduce us  but perhaps it isn t necessary  do you  know who i am       it is mrs  roberts  i believe   the young man said  struggling with his  astonishment and embarrassment      yes  and you are mr  alfred ried  well  now we know each other without  any further ceremony  will you tell me a little about your sister  mr   ried  you were thinking of her just now       i was missing her just now   said he  trying to smile   as i very often  am  i was a little fellow when she died  but the older i grow the more  difficult i find it to see how the world can spare her  she was so full  of plans for work  and there are so few like her       it may be that she is working still  in the person of her brother      he shook his head energetically  though his face flushed      no  i can only blunder vaguely over work that i know she  with her  energetic ways and quick wits  could have done  and done well  it  happens that she was especially interested in a class of people of whom  i know something  they need help  and i don t know how to help them  it  seems to me that she could have done it       will you tell me who the people are       it is a set of boys for whom nobody cares   he said  speaking sadly    it hardly seems possible that there could ever have been a time when  anybody cared for them  though i suppose their mothers did when they  were little fellows      thus spoke the ignorant young man   ignorant of the depths to which sin  will sink human nature  but rich in the memory of mother love      i think of my sister ester in connection with them   he said  speaking  apologetically   because she was peculiarly interested in wild young  fellows like them  she thought they might be reached   that there might  be ways invented for reaching them  such as had not been yet  she had  plans  and they were good ones  i thought so then  little fellow that i  was  and i think so now  only nobody is at work carrying them out  and i  wonder sometimes if ester could have been needed in heaven half as much  as she is needed on earth  she used to talk to me a great deal about  what might be done  i think now that she wanted to put me in the way of  taking up some of the work that she would have done  but she mistook her  material  i can t do it       are you sure  you are young yet  and besides  you may be doing more  than you think  couldn t i help  what is there that needs doing for  these particular young men       everything   he said  excitedly   if you should see them you would get  a faint idea of it  they come occasionally down to the sabbath school  at the south end  in fact  they come quite frequently  though i m sure  i can t see why  it certainly isn t for any good that they get  their  actions  mrs  roberts  surpass anything that i ever imagined       who is their teacher       that would be a difficult question to answer  they have a different  teacher every sabbath  no one is willing to undertake the class twice   they have tried all the teachers who attend regularly  and several who  have volunteered for once  and never would attempt it a second time   just now  there is no one who will make a venture       have you tried      he shook his head emphatically      i know at least so much  why  mrs  roberts  some of them are as old as  i  and  indeed  i think one or two are older  no  we have secured the  best teachers that we could for them  but each one has been a failure  i  suppose they must go       go where      he shrugged his shoulders      what an awful question  where  will  they go  mrs  roberts  if we let  them slip now      he was tremendously in earnest  one could not help feeling that he had  studied the possibilities  and felt the danger      suppose i try to help  shall i come and take that class next sabbath      this simple  directly put question brought the young man suddenly from  the heights of his excitement into visible embarrassment  he looked down  on the small  fair lady  reaching hardly to his shoulder  attired in  that unmistakable way which bespeaks the lady of wealth and culture  and  could imagine nothing more incongruous than to have her seated before  that class of swearing  spitting  fighting boys  not that her wealth or  her culture was an objection  but she looked so utterly unlike what he  had imagined their teacher must be   she was so small  so frail  so  fair and sweet  and ignorant of the ways of the great wicked world  and  especially of those great wicked boys  what could he say to her     he was so manifestly embarrassed that the small lady laughed      you think i cannot do it   she said  almost gayly     he hastened to answer her      indeed  you have no idea of the sort of class it is  i have given you  no conception of it  i cannot  you would think yourself before a set of  uncaged animals       yes  and in case of failure i should only be where the others are  who  have tried and failed  if you will introduce me  and your superintendent  will let me  i mean to try  and that will relieve you of the dilemma of  being entirely without a teacher for them      young ried had nothing to say  he thought the attempt a piece of  folly   a worse than useless experiment  but how was he to say so to the  wife of his employer     that gentleman appeared just then  making haste      i was unavoidably detained   he explained   i feared you would grow  weary of waiting  ah  ried  my wife has introduced herself  i see  is he  the young man you were speaking of  mrs  roberts       the very young man   ester ried s brother  he doesn t know how glad  i am to have met him  some day when we are better acquainted  and you  trust me more fully  i am going to tell you how i became so deeply  interested in your dear sister  meantime this little matter should be  definitely settled  mr  roberts  i have invited myself to take a class  to morrow down at the south end mission       have you  indeed      mr  roberts spoke heartily  and seemed by no means dismayed   only a  trifle perplexed as to details      how can we manage it  flossy  my prison class takes me in an opposite  direction at the same hour  you know       yes  i thought of that  i propose to ask mr  ried to call for me  and  show me the way  and vouch for my good intentions after i reach there   do you suppose he will do it   she looked smilingly from her husband to  young ried  and both waited for his answer      i obey directions   he said  bowing respectfully to mr  roberts   am i  to have the honor of being detailed for that service to morrow       so mrs  roberts says   was the good humored reply  and then the  merchant took his wife away to their waiting carriage that had drawn up  before the door  leaving alfred ried  if the truth must be told  in a  fume      much she knows what she is talking about   he said  jerking certain  boxes out of their places on the shelves  and then banging them back  again  seeming to suppose that he was by this process putting his  department in order for closing   little bit of a dressed up doll  they  will tear her into ribbons  metaphorically  if not literally  before  this time to morrow  she thinks  because she is the wife of evan  roberts  the great merchant  she can go anywhere and do anything  and  that people will respect her  she has never had anything to do with  a set of fellows who care less than nothing about money and position   except to be ten times more insolent and outrageous in their conduct  than they would if she had less of it  i shall feel like a born idiot in  presenting this pretty little doll to teach that class  mr  durant will  think i have lost what few wits i had  what can possess the woman to  want to try  it is just because she has no conception of what she is  about  but mr  roberts must know  i wonder what he means by permitting  it      in very much the same state of mind did our young man pilot his new and  unsought for recruit into the crowded mission rooms of the south end on  the following sabbath afternoon  she looked not one whit less able to  compete with the terrors which awaited the teacher of the formidable  class     her dress was simplicity itself  according to mrs  roberts  ideas of  simplicity  yet  from the row of ostrich tips that bobbed and nodded at  each other  all around the front of her velvet hat  to the buttons of  her neat fitting boots  she seemed to bring a new atmosphere into the  room     yesterday s rain was over  and the pleasant south windows were aglow  with sunshine  as mrs  roberts sat down the sunbeams came and played  about her face  and she seemed in keeping with them  and with nothing  else around her     the superintendent bestowed curious glances on her during the opening  exercises  he had seen the shadow on young ried s face when he seated  her  and had found time to question      whom have we here       mrs  evan roberts  she wants to try the vacant class   i  did not ask  her  mr  durant  she invited herself      mr  durant looked over at her  and tried to keep his eyes from smiling      she looks very diminutive in every way for such an undertaking  they  will frighten her out before she commences  will they not       i presume so  but i didn t know what to do  she wanted to come  and i  could not tell her she must not       no  of course   the occasion is too rare to lose  very few people ask  the privilege of trying that class  there is no teacher for them to day   and your mrs  roberts must learn by experience that some things are more  difficult than others  i will let her try it      meantime   the boys  of the dreaded class were studying the new face   she was the only person not already seated before a class  and they  naturally judged that she was to be their next victim  they looked at  her and then at one another  and winked and coughed and sneezed and  nudged elbows and giggled outright  every one of them   meantime chewing  tobacco with all their might  and expectorating freely wherever he  judged it would be most offensive     alfred ried watched them  inwardly groaning  being used to their faces   he could plainly read that they anticipated a richer time than usual   and rejoiced greatly over the youth and beauty of their victim     but young ried was not the only one who watched  mrs  roberts  without  seeming to be aware of their presence  lost not a wriggle or a nudge   she was studying her material  and it must be confessed that they  startled her not a little  they represented a different type of  humanity from her chautauqua boys  or her boys in the old church at  home   rather  an advanced stage of both those types     when mr  durant came toward her  the look on his face was not  reassuring  it so plainly said that he expected failure  and was sorry  for her as well as for himself  however  with as good grace as he could  assume  he led her to the seat prepared for the teacher  and gave her a  formal introduction      boys  this is mrs  roberts  who is willing to try to teach you to day   i  wish  you would show her that you know how to behave yourselves      mrs  roberts wished that he had left her to introduce herself  or that  he had said almost anything rather than what he did  the mischievous  gleam in several pairs of eyes said that they meant to show her  something that they considered far more interesting than that     many were the sympathetic glances that were bestowed on the young and  pretty lady as she went to her task  as for alfred ried  there was more  than sympathy in his face  he was vexed with the young volunteer and  vexed with himself     he told himself savagely that this was what came of his silly habit of  thinking aloud  if only he had kept his anxieties about that class to  himself  mrs  roberts would never have heard of it  and been tempted to  put herself in such a ridiculous position  and if this episode did not  break him of the habit  he did not know what would     he was presently  however  given a class of small boys  with enough  of original and acquired depravity about them to keep him intensely  employed  and the entire school settled to work           chapter ii      what did it all amount to  anyhow        settled  that is  so far as the class of boys in the corner would permit  the use of that term   they  had not settled in the least  two of them  indulged in a louder burst of laughter than before  just as mrs  roberts  took her seat  yet her face was in no wise ruffled      good afternoon   she said  with as much courtesy as she would have used  in addressing gentlemen   i wonder if you know that i am a stranger in  this great city  you are almost the first acquaintances that i am making  among the young people  and i have a fancy that i would like to have you  all for my friends  suppose we enter into a compact to be excellent and  faithful friends to one another  what do you say      what were they to say  they were slightly taken back  surprised into  listening quietly to the close of the strange sentence  and then giving  no answer beyond violent nudges and aside looks  what did she mean   was she  chaffing  them  this was unlike the opening of any lesson  it  certainly could not be the first question on the lesson paper  nor did  it sound like certain well meant admonitions to  try to improve the  opportunity  and  learn all that they could   with each of these  commencements they were entirely familiar  but this was something new      do you agree to the compact   she asked  while they waited  her face  bright with smiles      dunno about that   said one whom she very soon discovered occupied the  position of a ringleader   as a general thing  we like to be kind of  careful about our friendships  we might strike something that wasn t  quite the thing with people in our position  you can t be too careful in  a big city  you know      it is impossible to give you an idea of the impishness with which this  impudent answer was jerked out  to the great amusement of the others   who laughed immoderately     it suited mrs  roberts to treat the reply with perfect seriousness and  composure      that is very true   she said  courteously   but at the same time i  venture to hope that since you know nothing ill of me as yet  you will  receive me into a sort of conditional friendship  with the understanding  that i remain your friend until i am guilty of some conduct that ought  to justify you in deserting me  i am sure you cannot object to that  and  now  if we are to be friends  we should know each other s names  i am  mrs  evan roberts  and i live at no     east fifty fifth street  i shall  be glad to see you at my house whenever you would like to call on me   now  will one of you be kind enough to introduce himself and the class   perhaps you will introduce me to your friends      she looked directly at the ringleader      certainly  certainly  mum   he replied  briskly   this is mr  carrot  pumpkins  at your service  mum  this fellow on my left  i mean  rather  a queer name  i dare say you think  it all came of his being fond of  sitting astride of a pumpkin when he was a little shaver  and of his  hair being exactly the color of carrots as you can see for yourself  and  this fellow on my right is mr  champion chawer  so called because he can  make the biggest run on tobacco of any of the set  taking him day in and  day out  that fellow at your elbow is  slippery jim   we don t call him   mister   because he doesn t stay long enough in one place to have it  tacked on to him  he is such a slippery scamp that an eel is nowhere   compared to him      during this rapid flow of words the listeners  who evidently admired  their leader  became so convulsed with laughter as to lose all vestige  of respectability  and mr  durant s disturbed face appeared in view      boys  this is perfectly disgraceful   he said  speaking in sharp and  highly excited tones    perfectly disgraceful  i don t know why you wish  to come here to disturb us in this way sabbath after sabbath  but we  have really endured enough  there is a policeman at the foot of the  stairs  and he can easily call others to his help  so now if you wish to  remain here you must behave yourselves      during the deliverance of this sentence some of the boys gave mimic  groans  one of them whistled  and others kept up a running comment        a policeman  oh good  that s little duffer  i know  we ve seen him  before  wouldn t mind giving him a chase to day  just for exercise  you  know  mum       i say  boys  let s cut and run  the whole caboodle of us  we can  jump these seats at one bound  and take the little woman along on our  shoulders for a ride  shall we do it   this from the leader  who in time  came to be known as  nimble dick       bah  no   replied a third   let s stick it out and see what she s got  to say  she s a new party  besides  we can t give her the slip in that  way  we re friends of hers  you know       mrs  roberts   said the distressed mr  durant  in a not very good  undertone   i think you will have to give it up  they are worse than  usual this morning  we have endured much from them  and i must say that  my patience is exhausted  will you not take the seat at the other end of  the room       not unless they wish me to      the people who had known flossy shipley well would have detected a  curious little quiver in her voice  which meant that she was making a  strong effort at self control  but a stranger would hardly have observed  it      do you wish me to go away  young gentlemen      the scamps thus appealed to  looked at one another again  as if in doubt  what to say  this again was new ground to them  policemen they were  accustomed to  at last nimble dick made answer        no  i m bound if we do  it comes the nearest to looking like a lark of  anything that we have had in a long time  i say  parson  go off about  your business and let us alone  we was having a good time getting  acquainted till you come and spoiled it  we ll be as sober as nine  deacons at a prayer meetin   and look out how you insult this young  woman  she s a friend of ours  and we re bound to protect her  no asking  of her to change her seat  she s going to sit right here to the end of  the chapter      mr  durant looked his willingness to summon the police at once  but mrs   roberts  voice  evenly poised now  took up the story        thank you  then i will stay  and since it is getting late  suppose we  lose no more time  there was something about which i wanted to tell  you  but a few evenings ago i attended a gathering where i saw some very  singular things  a gentleman in the party was tied with a strong rope   hands and feet  as firmly as two men could tie him   people who knew how  to tie knots  and they did their best  yet while we stood looking at him  he shook his hand free and held it out to them  how do you think it was  done       sham knots   said one      no  for my husband was one of the gentlemen who tied him  and he  assured me that he tied the rope as firmly as he could  besides  more  wonderful things than that were done  i tied my own handkerchief into at  least a dozen very hard knots  and gave it to him  and i saw him put it  in a glass of water  then seize it and shake it out  and the knots were  gone  i saw him take two clean glasses  and pour water from a pitcher  into one  and it seemed to turn instantly to wine  then he poured that  glass of wine into the other empty glass  and immediately it turned back  to water  or seemed to  dozens of other strange things he did  i should  really like to tell you about them all  i will  at some other time  but  just now i think you would like to know  how  he did them        how  he did them    as if you could tell     can  you tell    pitch  in  mum  i d like to hear that part myself   these were some of the  eager answers     had the little teacher  under the embarrassments of the occasion  taken  leave of her senses  actually she was bending forward  opened bible  turned face downward on her knee  engaged in describing in somewhat  minute detail the explanations of certain slight of hand performances  which she had recently seen  what idea of the sacredness of the office  of teacher  and the solemnity of the truths to be taught  had she     the boys were listening  their heads bent forward all around her  what  of that  they would have listened equally well to a graphically told  story of a fourth avenue riot  and been equally benefited  you think   they did not know just when the speaker slipped from the events of last  week to the events of more than three thousand years ago  indeed  so  ignorant were they of all past history  that they were not even aware  that she went back into the past  for aught they knew  she might have  gone  on wednesday of last week to see the man who could untie knots by  magic  and on thursday to see the men who could drop canes on the ground  that would appear to turn into wriggling serpents  but there was one  statement that proved too much for their credulity      you could not imagine what occurred next   said the bright faced  teacher   the cane or rod that the first man had dropped  actually  opened its mouth and swallowed the other rods that seemed to be  serpents  and was left there alone in its triumph       oh  bosh   said nimble dick  contempt expressed in the very curve of  his nose   that s too steep  i don t believe a word of it  these fellows  can do lots of queer things  i ve seen  em perform  myself  but they  never made a live thing yet  i ve heard folks that know  say so       precisely what i wanted to reach   said mrs  roberts  with animation    you are right  they never did  and you have discovered just the  difference between them and the one man of whom i have been telling you    he  worked by the power of god  he distinctly stated that he did  and  that god really turned his rod into a serpent  and allowed it to swallow  the imitations of life  and then turned it back again into a rod  to  show that nothing was beyond his power       did you see the thing done   questioned a young skeptic  running his  tongue into his cheek in a skillful way  and distorting his whole face  with a disagreeable leer  he began to suspect that he was being cheated  into listening to a bible story     mrs  roberts was prompt with her answer        oh  no  i did not  neither did i see the great fire that you had in  this city about a year ago  at that time i was a thousand miles away   and it so happens that i have never talked with any person who did see  it  yet i know there was a great fire  and many buildings were burned   and lives lost  it has been proved to me       oh  well   said skeptic number two  while number one retired into  silence to speculate over this answer   fires are common enough things   anybody can know that they happen  but it ain t such a common affair to  see a stick turn into a serpent and swallow up other serpents  i ve seen  them fellows make things that looked like snakes  myself  i could  most swear to it that i d seen them wriggle  but they never did no   swallowing        that is  they did not give unmistakable signs that they were alive  but  do you think it too strange a thing for god to do  surely he can make  life  how is it that you are here  breathing  talking  thinking  if  there is no power anywhere to make life       oh  i came from a tadpole   said the boastful young scientist  putting  his thumbs under his arms  and affecting an air of great wisdom   i know  all about that  i was there  and see the things wriggle      evolution staring her in the face in a corner class in a mission  school   a class that had been gathered from the slums  mrs  roberts did  not know that these are the very places in which to find it in all its  coarseness  yet she made haste to meet the boy on his own ground      very well  if you choose to take that view of it  was not the tadpole  alive  where did the  life  come from  you insist that the story i  have been telling you is untrue because you know that none of these  sleight of hand performers have ever  or  can  ever make actual life   that it is an impossible thing for human beings to do  yet when i tell  you that  god  did it you refuse the statement  how are you going to  account for life  if  in its very lowest forms  it cannot be made by men  who have given all their time to the study of the marvellous  how is  it that it is everywhere about us  unless i am correct  and there is a  power that can produce life      not a boy among them had heard the term  evolution   knew anything  about  the survival of the fittest   they were entirely ignorant of   protoplasm  or  bioplasm   yet not one of them but had caught the  meaning of some of these terms as they had been translated for them into  the vernacular of the city slums  not one in the class but perceived  that their champion arguer had been met on his own ground and  vanquished  not with an outburst of horror  he had not even been  informed that he was irreverent  nimble dick delighted in making each  teacher tell him this  he had merely been replied to in the calmest of  argumentative tones  and called upon to account for the facts in his  own statements  and had been unable to do so  the crowd broke into a  derisive laugh  and were noisy  it is true  and brought troubled frowns  to the face of their superintendent  and made the flush on alfred ried s  face deepen  yet if both these anxious watchers had known it  it was  worthy of note that the laugh had been at the expense of one of their  number  and not at their teacher      well  go on   interposed the youngest and quietest of the group   tell  us some more about your old fellow with his serpents  did they stay  swallowed  and what did it all amount to  anyhow      thus challenged  mrs  roberts gave her whole heart to the business of  giving  in as dramatic a manner as she could  the closing scenes in the  act performed in egypt so long ago  carefully avoiding any reference  to time  and mentioning no names  using only modern terms  and an  exceedingly simple conversational form of language  she was  however   presently interrupted with a question        when did all this happen  and why don t somebody do something like it  nowadays      ignoring the first question  mrs  roberts adroitly gave herself to the  second      why don t you find your pleasure in tumbling around on the floor   playing with a bright colored marble or two as you did when a child  the  world was in its childhood when god taught the people in this way  he  has given them just as wonderful lessons since  but lessons more suited  to men and women who have learned to think and reason  we don t like to  be always treated as children      whether they really dimly understood the meaning or not is possibly  doubtful  yet it appealed to their sense of dignity in so indirect a  way  that they did not themselves realize what inclined them to quiet  for a moment  while she finished her sentence earnestly  in the midst  of the quiet the closing bell rang  and the seven young scamps seemed  at once to take into their hearts seven other spirits worse than  themselves  and behaved abominably during the closing exercises  and  tumbled out of the door over each other  in the wildest fashion  the  moment the signal was given  halting only to say  in the person of their  leader        you be on hand next sunday  we like your yarns first rate      mrs  roberts  with glowing cheeks  and eyes behind which there were  unshed tears  made her way to the desk where mr  durant was standing   and spoke quickly      there is a difference between others who have tried it and myself  mr   durant  the sentence in mr  ried s account that gave me courage was    every one has failed  so far  people are unwilling to take the class a  second time   i have failed  but i want to try again            chapter iii      anything uncommon about me        though they rushed out with even more noise than usual  every boy  of them knew that the noise was to cover a certain sense of  shame facedness  because they had actually been beguiled into listening  quietly for a few minutes to earnest words     directly they had reached the privacy of the street they became quieter      i say  boys   said nimble dick   is that an awful green one  or a new  kind       new  i should say   replied one of the younger boys   she ain t like  anything that s been in that room since we got acquainted with it  i  don t know her style  myself       what do you take it she meant by that stuff about being friends  and  telling us where she lived  and all that       dunno what she meant  but she ain t  green   you may bet your head on  that  i ll tell you what i think  boys  i b lieve she knows what she is  about  every time      what this sage conclusion amounted to  one not acquainted with the  dialect of the street might have been at a loss to understand  but the  rest of the party received it in grave silence and nods of the head  as  though it were a thought that needed careful investigation  in common  parlance  jerry tompkins had expressed the opinion that mrs  roberts had  some point to gain in being so uncommonly polite and attentive to them   and they were curious to know what the motive could possibly be     they considered the important question in silence until they reached  the next corner  then nimble dick  tossing back his head as one who had  thrown off an abstruse problem  and would have none of it  said        well  what next  we ve got through with that fun for to day  what are  you going to do  boys  say we go around to poke s  and see what is going  on there      to this proposition there was eager agreement from all the party save  one  he maintained a somewhat moody silence      what say  dirk   the leader asked  addressing him   are you ready for  poke s       no  i don t think i ll go around  just now       what  then  if you ve got something better on hand  why don t you let a  fellow know  we re not dying for poke s place       i haven t got a thing on hand  only i don t care about going there       where  then       nowhere       nowhere  mean place  too cold weather to stop in the streets  there ll  be a good fire at poke s  you come along  don t go to getting the sulks   it ain t becoming  just after you ve been to sunday school      but the young fellow persisted in gloomily refusing to join them  and  presently they began to tease  in what they meant to be a good natured  way      dirk s struck   said one   that yellow haired party has got him by  the throat  i saw her looking at him most uncommon sharp  when she was  telling that biggest story of hers  about the serpent that swallowed   dirk he thinks he s been swallowed by one of  em  he feels it choking in  his throat       no   said another   that ain t it  dirk s a going to get pious  that s  his last dodge  i ve seen the spell coming on  for some time  didn t  you see him pick up that there bible and lay it on the seat the other  sunday  after jerry s elbow knocked it off by mistake  i ve been scared  about dirk ever since  and now he won t go to poke s  it s a bad sign  i  say  dirk  maybe there s going to be a prayer meeting down your way  and  you wouldn t mind letting us come      they expected him to laugh  but his face grew blacker than before  and  at last he said  in very significant tones        you better hold up there  scrawly  if you don t want to try the depth  of that gutter       leave him be   said nimble dick  quickly   he s going into one of  his tantrums  when he begins like that  there s no end to the fighting  that s in him  and i don t want a row now   it s too early in the day   besides  i know something that s better fun  you fellows come along with  me  and let him go      as this was said in a sort of undertone as dirk strode on ahead  and  when  at another corner  he dashed down it  leaving them all  there was  no call after him  he was free to go where he would  and for reasons  that he himself could not have explained he chose that it should be  home   that is  the place which he called home  it might not meet your  ideas of what a spot so named should be  the road to it led through one  of the meanest portions of the city  each foot of the way the houses  seemed to grow more squalid looking  and the streets filthier  the  particular alley down which he dived at last was narrower and blacker  than any yet passed  and the cellar door which he pushed open let him  into the meanest looking house in the row   a long  low  dark room  in  one corner there was the remnant of a stove  braced up by bricks and  stones  but no fire was burning therein  though the day was cold   furniture there was none  unless the usual rickety table and two broken  chairs could be called by that name  a door was ajar that led into an  inner cellar  and a glimpse of piles of offensive looking rags  that  were called  bed clothes  by the family  might have given you an idea of  what their home life was  as hardly any other phase of it can  the rags  were not all in the further cellar  however  a gay patch work quilt  or  at least one that had once been gay  but from which bits of black cotton  now oozed in every direction  seemed to have curled itself in a heap  against the one window  however  it moved soon after dirk opened the  door  and showed itself to be more than a quilt  inside was a young  girl  the quilt wrapped around her closely  drawn up about her face and  head  as if she would hide all but her eyes within  and try to get rid  of shivering      you home   she said  her tones expressing surprise  but at the same  time indifference   what is it for       because i wanted to come  hasn t a fellow a right to come home if he  wants to       of course  and it s such a lovely home  and you are so fond of it  no  one need wonder at your coming in the middle of the day      the sentence was sarcastic enough  but the tones were hardly so  they  expressed too much indifference even for sarcasm     dirk surveyed her thoughtfully  he seemed to have no answer ready  in  fact  his face wore almost a startled air  and really the thought which  presented itself for consideration was startling  something about the  face of the girl  done up so grotesquely in her ragged quilt  suggested  the lady who had been his teacher at the mission  could one find a  sharper contrast than existed between these two  yet dirk  as he looked   could not get away from it      what are you staring at   the girl asked  presently  growing uneasy  over the fixedness of his gaze   do you see anything uncommon about me       where s mother   he asked  dropping his eyes  and turning from her      in there  asleep  you needn t talk quite so loud  it won t hurt her to  get a bit of rest  she sat up till morning  poking at your old coat      dirk looked down at it thoughtfully  there had been an attempt to make  it decent  although the setting of the patches showed an unpractised  hand  and they were of a strikingly different color from the coat  itself      you might have done it for her  then  in the daytime   he said   briefly  and added   where s father      the girl shrugged her shoulders      how should i know  where he is most of the time  you know more about it  than i do  or ought to  you live on the street      he gave her an answer which seemed to surprise her        i say  mart  what is the use in being so horrid cross all the time       you are so good natured   she said   and everything is so nice and  pleasant around me  it is a wonder that i should ever be cross       that s all lost  mart  for i never said i was good natured  nor thought  i was  and if i don t know just how hateful things are  i should like  to know who does  but  after all  what good does it do to snarl  why  couldn t you and me say a good natured word once in a while  just for a  change       try it   she said   i wish you would  i m so tired of things as they  now are  that most any change would be fine  but i ll risk your doing  much in that line  it isn t in you      what was there in this cross girl to remind any one in his senses of  mrs  evan roberts  yet even as she spoke that last ungracious sentence   she turned a little  so that a slant beam of sunshine  one of the few  that ever found its way into this dreary room  laid a streak of light  just across her hair  yellowing it until it was almost the shade that he  had noted in the lady at the mission  and he thought of her again  and  wondered curiously whether  if mart were dressed in the shining black  dress  and fur wraps and feather decked bonnet that the lady had worn   she would really resemble her  how would mart look dressed up  he  wondered  even decently dressed  as the girls were whom he met on the  streets  he had never seen her in anything much more becoming than the  ragged quilt  he was studying her in a way that mart did not in the  least understand  she broke the spell suddenly again        have you had any dinner       dinner  why  no  of course not  where would i find that sort of thing   i looked all up and down the streets  and smelled plenty of it  but not  a bite did i get       where have you been       oh  around in several places  not much of anywhere       i know where you ve been    a severe light coming into her eyes    you ve been down to the south end  and if i was you i d be ashamed of  myself  i know how you fellows go on down there  sallie calkins goes   and she told me all about it  she said that she was ashamed to live  on the same street with any of you  and that none of the folks in the  mission knew what to do with you  and the next thing you knew you would  all be marched off to the lockup       let them try it   muttered dirk  his face growing darker   we d make  that street too hot to hold them in short order if they played at any  such game as that  and i guess they know it       well  anyhow  i wouldn t be meaner and lower down than i had to be   dirk colson  it is bad enough as it is   a drunkard for a father  and we  nothing more than beggars  but i d behave myself half way decent when i  went among folks that wanted to be good to me  or else i d stay away       look here  you keep your preaching for them that wants to hear it  i  don t  a fellow can t come home without having a row  if it isn t of one  kind  it s another  i wonder i ever come home at all      dirk was angry now  and his dark  thin face looked fierce with passion   his sister kept the curiously composed tone and manner with which she  had said all her exasperating things      i wonder you do   she said   i suppose you get starved  and can t help  it  now and then  there s some dinner i saved for you  if you want it   eat it  and then take yourself to some place that suits you better      as she spoke  she jerked open the door of a little cupboard near which  she stood  and brought therefrom a much cracked plate  on which lay  a baked potato  with one end broken or bitten off  then carefully  replaced  as if the owner might have had a second thought as to its  disposal  there was also a bit of corn bread  somewhat burned  and half  of a roasted apple     meagre as the fare was for a hungry boy  there was more variety than he  had expected  and something in the simple preparation touched him  and  quieted his anger      where did this come from   he asked  taking in the unaccustomed morsel  of apple with two eager bites   i tell you  that is good       sally calkins gave it to me last night  she got one give to her  somewhere      just as the last bite was gone  it occurred to dirk  first to wonder   and then to be almost certain  that his sister  having shared the apple   had saved her entire share for him  it was not the first time he had  known of such an effort on her part to supply him with food  had he  thought of it sooner he would certainly have left a bit of the dainty  for her  but no thought of telling her so  for an instant crossed his  mind  neither had she  on her part  the slightest idea of describing to  him with what care and patience she and sallie had roasted the choice  morsel before sallie s fire  only last night   sallie s father being  fortunately late in coming  and so giving them a chance  then she had  borne hers home in a bit of paper  and carefully guarded it all day   just for this hour  also  she might have told him that she bit the end  from the potato before she remembered that there would be none left for  him  and then fitted it on again as best she could  and went without   she would not have told him for worlds  why  she could not have  explained why  something within her shrank from letting him know  not  that she sacrificed for him  but that she  cared  enough for him to want  to do it     potato and corn bread were gone  to the last crumb  it seemed to dirk  that there had been only enough of them to show him how hungry he was      i suppose there isn t anything more   he said  wistfully  with the  rising inflection  indeed  but not as one who had any idea of receiving  an affirmative answer      i should think there wasn t    defiance in the tone   there s a piece  of bread that i kept for mother s supper  and i mean she shall have it       well  don t bite me  i m perfectly willing that she shall  isn t there  anything for a fire       only some chips that i m saving till mother has her nap out       you better go to bed yourself  then  it s awful cold here       i ain t going to stir from this corner so long as this streak of light  lasts  it isn t so very often i see it that i can afford to lose it      her brother turned and looked at her  she had gathered the folds of the  ragged quilt about her again  and was crouching at the low window  and  the very last gleam that the sunshine would vouchsafe them came and  glimmered in her hair     there it was again   that mysterious  haunting resemblance  what would  mart think if he told her of it  probably that he was trying to poke  fun at her  at least  he should not experiment  yet he could not help  wondering again  how mart would look if she were dressed like other  people      i say  mart   he began  suddenly  breaking the stillness   let s you  and i get out of this  where it is warmer  come and take a walk down on  the avenue  the sun will shine yet for half an hour  and it is real warm  and bright       in this quilt   she asked  significantly  looking down at it     the boy s face darkened      hasn t your shawl got out of pawn yet       how should it      he flung himself angrily out of the broken chair  picked up his ragged  cap  and strode angrily and noisily across the room  out at the door   stumbling up the steps  like one half blind with disgust or rage  and  went on swift feet down the street out of sight  and mart  poor mart   left thus to solitude  let the last beam of the sun go without watching   and buried her face in the ragged quilt and cried           chapter iv      i don t blame them        it was not a  pet  name  poor mart colson would not have known what to  do with a pet name  her life had not taught her how to use such phrases   how she came to be named martha  she did not know  but a hollow eyed   sad voiced woman could have told her of a country home  long ago  where  there were daffodils blowing in the early spring  almost under the snow   where  later  the earth was turned into sky  or the stars came down and  gleamed all over her father s fields  so plentiful were the dandelions   and the breath of the clover came in at all the open windows  and the  cows  her father s cows  coming home from pasture  and the tinkle of  their bells were sights and sounds familiar to her ear  she sat there  one summer evening  in the back door  watching the glory and the peace   and studying  between times  her sabbath lesson  often and often the  words came back to her in future years   now jesus loved martha and her  sister and lazarus   that was one of the verses  was it a dim memory of  the words  and a sort of blind reaching out after their fulfilment  that  led her to name her poor little two days old baby  martha  the old home  had vanished  the sweet scented meadows  the tinkling bells  the peace  and the plenty  were as utterly things of the past as though they had  not been  mother  and father  and one brother  were gone  lying in  grass grown  neglected graves  and she  why the two days old  baby s father was  drunk   and had been for three weeks  a hard   hateful sounding word   coarse  almost  why don t i say intoxicated  oh   because i can t  i ve no desire to find smooth sounding words with which  to cover the sin of that baby s father  but the mother named her martha   she never told her why  if  indeed  she herself fully knew  it was not  a family name  gradually  after the fashion of the times  she sought to  shorten the name  and because they had not sweet  short words  as  pet    and  dear  and  sweet    all such belong to happy homes   they grew to  calling her mart  and now even she herself hardly realized that she had  ever owned to any other call  poor mart  i find myself wanting to use  the adjective over and over again when i speak of her  such a desolate   loveless life  always a drunken father   she had never known any other   always a sharp toned  weary eyed  disheartened mother  who shut her  tenderness for the child within herself  as one who could not afford to  show it  then dirk  the one brother  going astray almost as soon as  he was born  what wonder  from such a home  yet mart wondered and felt  bitter over it  why could not dirk be like some others of whom she knew   like sallie calkin s brother  for instance  who worked day and night   and brought home  often and often  an apple  or a herring  or sometimes  even a picture paper for sallie  mart was sharp tongued  all her life  had taught her to be so  she spoke sharp words out of the bitterness of  her heart at dirk  and of late rarely anything but sharp words  yet  and  this was mart s secret  hidden away as if it were something of which to  be ashamed  she  loved  dirk  loved him fiercely  with all the pent up  wealth of her young heart  and often   because  she loved him  she was  harsh and bitter towards him  though she did not herself understand why  this should be     as for dirk  he walked rapidly but for a few blocks  his dinner had been  too insufficient to give him strength  after the first aimless anger had  subsided  then came the question what to do with himself  why hadn t he  gone with the fellows  more than likely some of them had contrived a way  to get a dinner  why had he persisted in sullenly leaving them all and  going home     he had not the least idea why he had been impelled to go home  now  that he was fairly away from home again  he had no idea what to do with  himself  a place where he could warm his feet and his hands  where  he could get a bite to eat  possibly   this last would be an immense  attraction  but was not a necessity  and he did not expect it   but  warmth  at least  he felt that he must have  where would he find it   what place had been provided for such as he  he ought by this time to  have been earning his own living  to have had a corner which he could  call home  earned by himself  where some of the decencies of life were  gathered  of course he ought  but the painful fact to meet just now  was  that he had not done his duty  he had gone astray  not so far but that  there were plenty of chances to go farther  greater deeps to which he  might yet reach  but far enough to all but break any watchful mother s  heart  only that  his  mother s heart was broken before he was born  the  simple question waiting to be solved was this  having done as poorly for  himself as under the circumstances he well could  what was dirk colson  to do next  he had no idea  neither  apparently  had multitudes of  christian people engaged in praying that the father s will might be done  on earth  even as it was in heaven  the young man walked six blocks down  the respectable avenue  lined with pleasant homes  where the people went  to church  and read their bibles  and had family prayers  and kept holy  the sabbath day  not a door among them all opened and held out a winning  signal to arrest his heedless feet  not so satan  is he ever caught  idling at his post     just around the corner from the respectable avenue  and around the  corner dirk presently turned  still uncertain what to do  where to find  the warmth he craved  then the winning invitations for such as he began  to present themselves  saloons  and saloons  and saloons  how many of  them were there  far outnumbering the churches  pleasant they looked   too  opening doors  ever and anon  revealing brightness and warmth  within  they would like to see him inside  of this dirk was sure  not  that he had money  but he had something that in such places often served  him well   a decided and dangerous talent for imitating any and every  peculiarity of voice or manner that had chanced to come under his  notice  he could make the fellows in these saloons roar with laughter   if he did particularly well  they were willing to order for him a glass  of beer  or a fairly good cigar  in any case he had a chance to get  warm  this was actually dirk s only present source of income  yet he  shrank from it  he could not have told you why  but on this particular  sabbath he was averse to earning his coveted warmth in this way  he  walked resolutely by two or three places where he had reason to think he  might be welcomed  wondering vaguely whether there wasn t something  else a fellow could do to keep himself from freezing  oddly enough there  seemed to be something about the glimmer of sunshine as he saw it in  mart s hair that kept him from halting before any of the places open to  him  what if she had come out with him to take a walk  he could not  have taken her into one of them  then  poor fellow  he set himself to  wondering where the place was  open and warmed  to which he could take  mart  there were places  several of them  in the large city  but dirk  knew nothing about them  and he was acquainted with the saloons  he  thought of another thing  he had been invited to call at a house on east  fifty fifth street  suppose he should walk up there this very afternoon  and ring the bell  and say that he had come to call  what would happen  then  whereupon he laughed aloud  the fancy seemed to him so utterly  preposterous  the idea of  his  making a call  the utter improbability  of his ever seeing the inside of one of the east fifty fifth street  mansions     still remained that hopeless question  what should he do with himself   the sun was quite gone now  and a cold wind was blowing up freshly  from the north  it blew directly through dirk s threadbare garments  he  turned suddenly and slipped inside one of the worst of the many saloons  which literally lined this end of the street  he had refused to go with  the boys to poke s  an hour or two before  and this was several grades  below poke s in decency  but it was growing dark  and he was cold     there was one young man who saw him dash down those cellar stairs   who stood still and looked at him  his face darkening the while with  discouragement  this  then  was all the afternoon s sabbath school had  accomplished for him  to be sure he was not disappointed at the result   it was no more than he had expected  but it was so discouraging to be an  eye witness to the degradation to which these young wretches had fallen   of course the young man was alfred ried  and he went home  and  was dreary  over all sorts of failures in christian work  mission  sabbath schools especially  and their own  more especially than any  other     among the early shoppers on monday morning came mrs  evan roberts   shopping  however  seemed to be a small part of her business  she came  directly to young ried s counter  and addressed him very much as though  she had ceased talking with him but a moment before        mr  ried  what can you and i do for those boys during the week      but alfred was at his gloomiest      i don t see that we can do anything for them at any time   he said   dismally   what is an hour on sunday  set against all the rest of the  time  they go from the school room to the rum saloons  and dawdle away  the rest of the day  yesterday i met that young colson going into one  of the worst saloons on dey street  they are not to blame  either   this  last in a fiercer tone  after a slight pause   i don t blame them   they have nowhere else to go  and nothing to do  and it is cold on the  streets  and warm in the saloons      if he expected the small lady  who was regarding him so steadily  to  take the other side of this question  he was disappointed  she spoke  quietly enough  but with the earnestness of conviction      those are startling facts  i do not see how one could be surprised that  the results are they are  and the practical question forces itself upon  us  what are we to do under the circumstances  mr  ried  you have had  your eyes open in regard to this subject for some time  what have you  thought out      now was mr  alfred ried embarrassed  it was true that his eyes had been  long open to the subject  it was true that he had given it a great deal  of what he had called thought  but with those alert eyes fixed on his  face  her whole manner indicating intense earnestness  he suddenly  realized that all his thought had been to no purpose  had accomplished  nothing  unless it had served to give him a feeling almost of irritation  against the boys  and their teachers who made failures  and the people  who folded their hands and let things go to ruin  here confronted him  one  whose hands were not folded  though they rested quietly enough  on the counter before him  he began to feel that there might be latent  power in them      i have nothing to say   and he said it at last with flushed face and  embarrassed voice   i have thought out nothing  the whole thing seemed  hopeless to me with my utter lack of resources  my sister had schemes   many of them  and they seemed to me good ones  even then  they seem  better now  only i cannot carry them out      she caught at the name      your sister  ester ried  good  let us carry them out  you and i  and as  many more as we can get to help us  she is at work yet   don t you see   what is that prophecy about her   that voice which the prophet heard   you know   and i heard a voice saying unto me  write  blessed are the  dead which die in the lord from henceforth  yea  saith the spirit  that  they may rest from their labors  and their works do follow them       how strangely the words sounded  repeated in her low  clear voice  amid  the hum of business on every side  alfred ried felt singularly moved   he had been a highly strung  imaginative child  he had been his sister  ester s almost constant companion during those last months in which  she was slowly fading out of sight  while julia held steadily to her  mother s side  and learned to do many helpful things  he had been  stationed chief nurse in ester s room  to see that she lacked for no  tender care during the hours when others must be away from her  and  those hours she had tenderly improved  he remembered to this day just  how she looked  with a pink flush all over her cheeks  and a bright  light in her eyes  as she talked to him of the things that she and dr   douglass had meant to do for boys   neglected  homeless  friendless  boys  oh  the plans they had carefully thought out  to reach after these  forsaken ones  he remembered that his own cheeks had grown hot while he  listened  and the blood had seemed to race like fire through his veins  when she said   god wants  me  for something else  alfred  but you will  do my work when you get to be a man  you will find helpers  and carry  it on as i wanted to do   he had made no audible answer  but he had told  himself sturdily again and again that he certainly would  yet here  he was  barely of age  and almost soured by disappointments  certain  well meant attempts having proved failures  and having not found  the helpers whom he had eagerly expected  the magnitude of the work  impressed itself upon him more remorselessly each hour  yet now he  seemed to feel again the thrill in his veins  and he felt almost under  the power of his sister s eye while those words were in his ears    they rest from their labors  and their works do follow them   might  it possibly be that this was one of the  helpers  of whom ester used to  talk  sent by god himself to take up her planned work and follow it out   yet she was so utterly unlike his memory of ester  she had seemed to  him a self reliant  strong toned woman  mrs  roberts was so small and  frail looking  and so fashionably dressed  and how those boys had acted  with her only yesterday  what could she possibly do     customers came just then  to change the current of his thoughts  they  wanted round collars  and deep collars  and fichus  and edges  and a  hundred little irritating things  young ried  usually so gracious  and patient  had much ado to keep from showing his annoyance over the  smallness of all their wishes     meantime mrs  roberts  who had taken a seat  entered apparently with  absorption into the relative merits of round or pointed collars with a  young lady acquaintance  she patiently measured to discover whether the  turned down corner of one was a quarter of an inch deeper than the other  or not  she gave  with due deliberation  her opinion as to whether the  points were more becoming to the young lady s style of beauty than the  rolling fronts  and even went to the trouble of unfastening her furs to  show still another style that she liked better than either  sending  the disgusted alfred to an entirely different box in search of a like  pattern  as he went  his lip curled visibly  what a fool he had been  to allow himself to get momentarily excited over this doll  how  preposterous in him to mention his dead sister s name to her  she had  already forgotten the entire matter  and was deep in the merits of  collars  his first estimate of her had been the correct one  her  mind was just about as deep  he believed  as the tiny collar she was  measuring  what a farce it was to talk to her about helping those poor  fellows  she probably thought a few soup tickets  and a chance for a  good christmas dinner at some of the public charity halls  was the way  to reach and reform them   he  shouldn t help her  she mustn t expect  it  doubtless she did not  probably she had by this time forgotten that  she had suggested it  why need she putter here about a few collars for a  young lady in her own circle to wear with her morning dresses  that was  just it  he told himself  it was because she  was  in her circle  and  because the collars were to be honored by being worn by such as she   that they became important  and the boys and their desperate needs sunk  into insignificance  well  he wished they would both go  and leave him  to himself  give him a chance to rally from his momentary excitement  of  which he was now ashamed     at last the collars were bought   but not until the counter was strewn  with different sorts  and the lady  with many bright little nothings  for last words  moved off to another part of the store  and mrs  roberts  whirled on her seat until her eyes were in full view again  and said      what were some of her plans  mr  ried            chapter v      a christian home         i don t suppose you can go into detail just now   she added  noting  young ried s hesitation and embarrassment   but i was wondering if you  could give me some general idea of what she wanted to do  or thought  could be done       there were a great many things that she wanted to do  and i believe she  thought they could be done  but i don t think she knew the world very  well   said this aged cynic   she judged everybody from the standpoint  of her own unselfishness  i remember she was not in sympathy with  soup houses  and dinner tickets  and great public charities of that  sort  or  i don t know that i should say she was not in sympathy  with them  i mean  rather  that those would not have been her ways of  working  she was thinking of young people  and to give them a dinner  now and then  she would not have considered a very great step toward  elevating them morally and spiritually  mrs  roberts  it was just  that which she wanted to do   lift them up  she thought there could be  invented ways of reaching them  so that they would want helping  want  teaching    crave  it  i mean  and she thought that christian homes of  wealth and culture could be opened to them  and they gradually toled  in   made to feel on a level with others  in the social scale  in  short  she believed that instead of people going down to them in a  condescending spirit  they could be drawn up to the level of others   so that they would realize their manhood  and be led to make earnest  efforts to take their rightful places in the world  i know i am bungling  dreadfully  i don t know how to tell you her plans  only that they were  splendid  but i am afraid the world will have to be made over  before  they can be carried out       perhaps so  christ is at work making the world over  you know   the  lady before him  whose eyes never for an instant moved from his face   spoke with exceeding sweetness and gravity  neither by word nor glance  did she give him to understand that she thought his schemes wild   but i  find that  after all  i want details  i catch a glimpse of the grandness  of your sister s meaning  what were some of the steps   the little  steps  such as you and i could take  toward accomplishing  yet  even  while i ask the question  i see something of what the answer must be    christian homes opening to receive them   that is a new thought to me   and in the plural number i do not see how just now  it could be done   but  one  christian home   i ought to be able to manage that  mr  ried   that is the way to begin it  you may depend  indeed  i suppose you have  tried it  the city is full of boys  and many of them are away down   since we cannot reach all of them this week  we must try to reach seven   and failing in that  suppose we say one  for which one have you been  working  just who  at this moment  specially interests you  i hope it  is one of my boys  because  you see  they appeal to me  just now  as  no others can  which is it  mr  ried  and what have you tried to do for  him  and to what extent have you succeeded      there were never any hotter cheeks than young ried s just at that  moment  this was the most extraordinary person with whom he had ever  talked  it was impossible to generalize with her  not that he wanted to  generalize  on the contrary  he at once saw the possibilities growing  out of individual effort  and caught at the idea of undertaking  something  but the question was  why had he not thought of it before   one person to reach after  and try for   surely  he might have attempted  it  instead of trying to carry the hundreds that he stumbled against   and so accomplish nothing for any of them  it was humiliating  the  confession that he had to make        indeed  mrs  roberts  i have not one in mind  if you asked me what one  hundred i was most anxious about  i might possibly be able to answer   but i see that there has been no individuality about it  unless   perhaps  the half dozen or more boys who compose that class are taking  a little stronger hold on me than any of the others  but even for them  i have tried to do nothing  unless two or three attempts to secure a  permanent teacher for them  which have ended in failure  may count for  effort  i don t blame myself as much as i might  because  now that you  suggest personal work to me  i realize that there is nothing for one  situated as i am to do  i have no christian home at my command       ah  but we are to come down to very small numbers  you know   to  fractions  if need be  you have a piece of christian home at command  i  trust      but he looked at her inquiringly  and she explained        why  you have the privacy of your own room  which is  of course  your  corner of home just now  and it is a christian corner  is there not room  in it sometimes for two      he smiled faintly over that      mrs  roberts  there is one thing with which you evidently are not  familiar  and that is the corner which a poor clerk in the city has  to call home  mine is the fourth story back of a fourth rate  boarding house  where the thermometer drops often below the  freezing point  and this place i share with as uncongenial a fellow as  ever breathed  what would you think of labelling such accommodations   home   and what can i do in it for others       not much  perhaps   smiling   unless for the uncongenial fellow  i  should think there might be a chance in this direction       ah  but   he said  eagerly   he is a christian  my sympathies do not  need to be drawn out in that direction      the smile was a peculiar one now  but the tone was very quiet in which  the little lady said that some time  when they had leisure to talk  she  should like to ask him whether his experience with christians had been  so exceptionally bright that he thought there was no work to do in that  direction      but just now   she added  earnestly   i want to know  since you are  shut away from home effort  for which of these boys you are praying  especially  and which of them do you carry about on your heart  with the  hope of a chance meeting  an unexpected  opportunity to speak a word   or do a kindness  or look a kindness that shall give you possible  future influence  don t you have to work in those ways  two people  never equally interest me at the same moment  i find i must be intensely  individual  not to the exclusion of others  but in praying  for  instance  yesterday i prayed  and this morning i prayed  for my entire  class  but there was one all the time who was uppermost  i find myself  questioning  what can i do for them all  but especially for him  do you  know  i fancy that most christians feel the same  individual effort  is so necessary that i have thought perhaps the holy spirit turns our  thoughts most directly toward one person at a time  so that we may  concentrate our efforts  do you think this is so      young ried did not answer promptly  he had no answer ready that suited  him  his strongest feeling just then was one of self reproach  mingled  with humiliation  how had he looked down on this fair and beautiful  little woman   her very beauty being  he had fancied  an element against  her when it came to actual effort  how had he allowed himself to sneer  over her attempts at teaching that class of boys  how actually irritable  he had been over it  how almost angrily he had questioned why it was  that a teacher was not found for them fitted to their needs  when he had  prayed about it so much  determined not to believe that the prayer had  been answered  and the teacher found  yet here she was  the one whose  efforts he had despised  talking already about individual prayer for  them  while he  who had done a great amount of fretting for them  had  not once presented them as individuals to christ  and asked a definite  blessing for each  his answer  when it came  was low and full of  feeling        i have concentrated my desires in praying for the coming of such a  teacher as might get hold of them  and i begin to think that i have an  answer to my prayers      but she was absolutely proof against compliments  she wasted not a  moment s thought on that  but said        mr  ried  who are they  i tried to get their names yesterday  but soon  saw that they were not in the mood to help me  i don t think i have one  correct name  can you give me a list      no  he could not  which admission did not lessen the glow on his cheek   possibly he could mention the names of two  and guess at a third  but of  the others he knew nothing      to whom  then  can i go  mr  durant would know  of course  where shall  i find him      so much alfred knew  mr  durant was to be found at the fourth national  bank  but  as for giving information in regard to that class  he was  sure it was beyond him  he  alfred  had asked only last sabbath who the  boy was who behaved so wretchedly  and also who was the fellow next him   but mr  durant had not known     well  then  mrs  roberts said  nothing daunted  not even a shadow  appearing on her quiet face  she must just study it out with his help      there is immediate work for you   she said   for of course i want  to know their names  who are the two  this dirk colson  whom you  mentioned   which was he      alfred described him as well as his bewilderment would allow  and was  interrupted       oh  the small dark one  i know   he interested me  where does he live      but to this question no clear answer could be given  down in one of the  alleys towards the south end  but just which alley  or how far down it   alfred did not know  he knew it was a disreputable alley  and that there  wasn t a decent home anywhere about it  and that was all      what does dirk do for a living      this question was quite as difficult to answer as the other  nothing   young ried believed  at least nothing regular  odd jobs he doubtless  picked up occasionally  but as for regular employment  alfred was sure  he had none      is that his fault  i mean  doesn t he desire work  and make an effort  to secure it      but this young ried could not even pretend to answer  work  for such as  he  was scarce  boys with better habits  brought up to be industrious   were at this present time out of work  possibly the fellow was not to  blame for being an idler     many other questions were asked  and many attempts were made at answers   but when the shoppers began to press in  to such a degree that their  conversation was broken  and the energetic seeker after information felt  herself obliged to retire  one thing had been accomplished  alfred ried  had been made to realize that he knew much less than he had supposed he  did about the seven boys who had seemed to be filling his thoughts for  several weeks  and also  in his eager  passionate desire that everything  should be done for all of them  he had overlooked the chances for doing  here and there some little thing for one of them      good morning   mrs  roberts had said  turning cordially to a  fashionably dressed lady   collars  oh  yes  this is the counter for  them to be found in endless variety  they have a new pattern that i have  been admiring  mr  ried  please show mrs  emory the curtain collars   with embroidered points      which thing mr  ried proceeded to do with alacrity and respect  no trace  of the earlier contemptuous feeling shadowing his face  here was a woman  who knew stylish collars when she saw them  and who also knew several  other things  and had taught him a lesson this very morning that he  would not be likely to forget     but mrs  roberts  as she made her way out from the fast filling store   felt that she had not made great progress toward getting acquainted with  her class     still it must be admitted that if young ried had gotten some new ideas   so also had she   a christian home   she found herself repeating the  phrase  lingering over it  wondering if her new home  in every sense of  the word  merited that title   it cannot simply mean a home where christ  is honored   she said to herself   i surely have that  it rather means  a home where everything pertaining to it serves his cause  the very  furniture and the light and the brightness are made to do duty for him   else they have no place there  and i  labelled christian  have no right  to them  can they bear the test  i wonder  what is there that i can do  with all the beauties of my parlors  there are things that i have not  done  i can see some to do  but how can my christian home serve these  boys  when i get them into it  of course it will work for me  but how to  get them in  who are they  i wonder what spring i can touch to give me  even this meagre bit of information      as if in answer to her mental query  she came just then full upon  policeman duffer  she recognized him instantly  a man who  though by  no means small  was so far from having the majestic presence of most  policemen that  in the estimation of the boys  he merited the name   little duffer   mrs  roberts carried to her new work one talent  not always to be found among even efficient workers   the ability to  remember both names and faces  especially did a name seem  without any  effort on her part  to fasten itself upon her memory  and not only that   but it brought with it a train of memories enabling her to locate  when and where  and under what circumstances  she heard the name  and   therefore  generally whom the name fitted  recognizing the features of  the policeman whom she had seen at the door of the south end mission   she connected him at once with the term  little duffer   heard in her  class  and addressed him        mr  duffer  i believe      it is safe to say that policeman duffer  entirely accustomed as he was  to hearing himself addressed officially a hundred or a thousand times a  day  was yet utterly unaccustomed to the prefix of  mr    and started in  surprise      are you not the gentleman whom i saw at the south end last sabbath      the policeman admitted that he probably was  he was detailed for duty  there  then she plunged at once into business  did he know the boys who  attended that school  some of them he did  better than he wanted to  and  a precious set they were  in policeman duffer s opinion      might as well go out to the zoo   he declared   and get a set of  animals and try to tame  em      mrs  roberts was not in the mood to argue  she was bent on information   did he know  she wondered  the boys who composed her class  she had just  taken the class  and was so unfortunate as not to be acquainted  with their names  one was dirk colson  and another she had heard was  haskell  timothy haskell  perhaps  though of that she was not certain   did that give mr  duffer any clue      plenty of clue   he said  shaking his head   so you ve taken that  class  ma am    a curious mixture of amazement and credulity in his  voice   what possessed you  if i may be so bold  they re a hard lot   ma am  i know them  as i said  altogether too well  i ve had enough to  do with some of them  and i expect more work from them  they gain in  wickedness in a most surprising way  their names  yes  there s scrawley  and sneaking billy  and black dirk   him you know      mrs  roberts interrupted him  she begged his pardon  but could those  really be the boys names  were they not rather some unfortunate street  names that had been fastened upon them     thus brought back to his senses  policeman duffer laughed  and admitted  that he supposed sneaking billy was properly named sneyder  but he was  once caught in a mean trick  from which he tried in so many ways to  squirm out  that the boys had themselves named him sneaking billy  and  the name had stuck     as for  scrawley   his real name was stephen crowley  how it became  contracted into  scrawley  the boys could tell better than anybody else   they always called him that  and so did other people  and policeman  duffer was inclined to doubt whether the fellow remembered that he had  any other name      you can see yourself  ma am   he added   how black dirk came by his  name  he is the blackest white fellow as ever i saw  and i ve seen  crowds of  em      the streets were full  and policeman duffer was being interviewed by  a great many people in regard to all the questions that policemen are  expected to answer  but by dint of patient waiting  one foot poised on  a curbstone to keep it out of the mud  making hurried little memoranda  while policeman duffer was engaged  and earnestly plying her questions  when he was at leisure  mrs  roberts learned the names of her seven  boys  and where several of them lived           chapter vi      satan  he has  em all the week         that black dirk is a case   said policeman duffer  turning hastily away  from an unusually stupid man  who could not be made to understand where  a certain street was   he is the worst of the lot   i  believe   jerry tompkins is slyer  and dick bolton is quicker than lightning at  mischief  nimble dick they call him  he s a sort of ringleader  what he  does the rest are apt to  but  to my thinking  dirk is ahead of them all  for evil  the rest are kind of jolly  fun seems to be about half that  they are after  but dirk  he s sullen  you never know how to take him   nor when he may burst out on you  he s dangerous  i am always looking  out for something awful that he will do      poor dirk  yet he was the boy to whom mrs  roberts  desires had gone  out the most anxiously  it was over his image that she had lingered  that morning in her closet  policeman duffer would have been greatly  astonished had he known there was that in his words which gave her  courage   perhaps   she said to herself  with quickening breath   oh   perhaps the poor boy is the most in danger of them all  and the saviour   knowing it  sees ways in which i may reach him  and so presses his poor   sullen face on my memory       what does he do for a living   she hastened to ask      well  to the best of my knowledge  he loafs for a living  that s all  i ve ever known him guilty of doing  he s got a drunken father   one  of the meanest kind of drunkards  if he would go and stay drunk all  the time and leave them alone they might manage  but he has spells  of getting half over it  and coming home and tearing around like all  possessed  then they have times  i ve been in there when it took all my  strength to manage him  if he would get killed in one of his rows i d  have some hope of the rest of  em  but he won t  that kind of folks  never do get killed  it s the decent ones  a fellow was carried by here  just with a broken leg   a nice  decent boy  works hard to help his  sister  he s the sort now that gets his leg broken and gets laid up for  the rest of the winter  how do you account for that  he lives pretty  near black dirk s  of course  he s got a drunken father  they all have  in that row  but if i was going in for benevolence i d twice as soon do  something for young calkins as for any of your set  they re a bad lot   they aren t worth lifting a finger for  now  that s a fact       and yet   said mrs  roberts  her voice tremulous with a feeling that  just then surged over her   how can i help remembering that if the lord  jesus had said that of us  and stayed up there in his glory  we should  have been utterly without help or hope to day      very much astonished was policeman duffer  ladies on all sorts of  errands had consulted him  he had been presented with many tracts in  his day  but rarely had a clear voiced  earnest eyed woman quietly  confronted him with that name  as if it contained an unanswerable  argument  however  he was not embarrassed  it took a great deal to  embarrass him      i don t take much stock in him   he said  with a lofty toss of his  head  and a careless tone  as though the question were one easy to  dispose of   i don t believe in him myself       do you know him      earnest eyes  raised to his face  fixed steadily on his face  while the  questioner waited quietly for an answer     policeman duffer was embarrassed now  he was not used to being  confronted with such matter of fact questions      do i know him   with a confused little laugh   why  i reckon not   ma am  according to the popular notion he is too far away for folks to  be well acquainted       then popular notion is mistaken  for i know him very well indeed  and  he is by no means far away  but what i meant was  have you studied  his life and character  and do you fully understand the arguments for  believing in him       i study the folks who profess to belong to him  ma am  and i find that  about as much as i can stand      this was said with a saucy little laugh  and with the air of a man who  believed he had produced an unanswerable argument  the steady eyes did  not move from his face  and the voice which answered him had lost none  of its quietness        but do you think it is wise to spend your time in studying the  imperfect copies  without looking at the perfect pattern  you would not  take the child s careless imitation as a proof that his teacher could  not write  i thank you for helping me to day  i wish you would help my  boys when you can  and i wish you would study my master instead of me   good morning       that s a queer party   did policeman duffer exclaim  as he watched her  far down the street   i m blessed if i wouldn t like to know who she is   she ain t like the rest  somehow   her  boys  much she knows about  em   her  bears  she might as well call  em  what does she think she can do  with that set in her little hour  sunday afternoon  satan  he has  em  all the week  and looks after  em sharp  and then these christians come  in of a sunday  and mince a little  and think they can upset his doings  by it  shows their sense  but she s a curious little party  sharp   without knowing it  i m blessed if i don t keep an eye on her  and save  her from scrapes  if i can      meantime  all unconscious of his good intentions  mrs  roberts pursued  her way down the thronged avenue  and presently turned from it entirely   and moved down one of the side streets with resolute steps  a daring  thought had come into her mind  she would try to find the alley where  one at least of her boys lived  it couldn t be worse than some of  the alleys at home which she had penetrated  she felt certain that  by following the policeman s directions she could find the place  and  possibly be able to minister to the boy with a broken limb  at all  events  it was necessary for her to know how her boys lived  and  where they lived  if she were to reach them  but there are alleys  and   alleys   as the venturesome lady found to her cost  this one into  which she was plunging excelled anything in that line which she had ever  imagined   swarming with life in its most repulsive forms  and growing  every moment more terrifying to a well dressed woman braving its horrors  alone     she stopped in dismay at last  admitting  reluctantly  that the  wisest thing she could do was to turn around and go home  possibly the   wisest   but not  it appeared  practicable  where  was  home  down  which of the cross streets had she come  did this one where she stood  lead to it  or did it lead  as it appeared to her  in an entirely  opposite direction  she looked up and down and across for some familiar  landmark  and looked in vain  growing momentarily more frightened at  the attention she was attracting by standing irresolutely there  flossy  shipley  in her girlhood days  had been almost a hopeless coward  and  flossy roberts felt  by the throbbing of her heart  that she had not yet  outgrown her girlish character  suddenly she gave a little exclamation  of delight  and with a spring forward laid her hand on the arm of one  whom she recognized  none other than  nimble dick  himself      i am so glad   she said to the amazed young scamp  a little quiver of  satisfaction in her voice   so glad to have met you  do you know you are  a friend in need  i have lost my way  i cannot decide which way to turn  to reach fifth avenue again  will you help me  please      when had nimble dick lost an opportunity for fun at the expense of  another  here was a chance for a jolly lark  a woman scared to death  because she was on green alley  what would she think of burk street   suppose he should send her there  only three blocks away  through a  lovelier part of the city than she had seen yet  he would venture   if the crowds here showed her too much attention  it would be worth  something to see how she got through burk street      oh  yes   he said  briskly   i can show you the way in a twinkling  you  just go down this alley till you come to the big house on the corner   that has the windows all knocked out of it  then you turn and go down  that street till you get to the third crossing  then turn again to the  right  and you ll be on fifth avenue before you know it      had mrs  roberts been looking at his face  she would have seen the  wicked light dancing in his eyes over the thought that he had thus  mapped out for her a walk through the very worst portion of the city   every step  of course  leading her further and further away from fifth  avenue  the sights that she might see  and the mishaps which might occur  to her   a handsomely dressed woman alone   before she made her way  through the horrors of these streets were too much even for nimble  dick s imagination  who knew the locality well  he did not try to  calculate them  but gave himself up to the enjoyment of imagining  how long it would be before she would reach home if she followed his  directions   she won t see no swallowing serpents that i knows of   he  reflected  gleefully   but i ll miss my reckoning if she don t see what  will scare her worse than they would      but mrs  roberts was already  scared   she felt her heart beating hard   and knew that her cheeks were aglow with excitement and vague terror   she was not used to walking such streets alone  she looked ahead at the  way pointed out  and could see that the swarming life grew more turbid  as far as her eye could reach  she felt that she could not brave its  terrors unprotected  suddenly she turned from looking down the alley   and her hand  a small  delicately gloved hand  was again laid on nimble  dick s arm  he could feel it trembling      i suppose i shall seem very foolish to you   she said  gently   but i  am afraid to walk down there alone  would you mind going along with  me to protect me  i am only a woman  you know  and we are apt to be  cowards      a very curious sensation came over nimble dick  he looked up the alley   and down the alley  and was glad that not one of the  fellows  was in  sight  what was to become of his lark  but there was that hand still  resting on his arm  with a persuasive touch in it  and he had never been  appealed to for protection before   never in his life  was it possible  that with  him  she would not be afraid  he turned and looked at her   searchingly  a scowl on his face   no  she was not  shamming   her eyes  were full of anxious fear  and also of petition  nimble dick was amazed  at himself and ashamed of himself  he did not know how to account for  his sudden change of intention  but he suddenly turned in an opposite  direction from the one which he had pointed out  and said   come on   then  i ll show you a shorter way   and strode forward      oh  thank you   she said  relief and gratitude in her voice   i shall  be so much obliged to you for coming with me  i am quite bewildered   cannot decide which way i came  or anything about it  i was trying to  find the house of a young man who has been hurt  a policeman told  me that he lived on this street  and that his name is calkins  i was  thinking about him  and walked on without noticing  until i did not know  where i was  do you know anything of the young man       you are too far down for him   said nimble dick   he s quality  and  lives at the upper end of the alley  that s his house  away up there   he s hurt bad  they say  but i s pose he ll get well  he s got a quality  doctor   a regular swell  who never come into these alleys before  he  was going along when they brought mark home  and he followed them in   and he come there again last night and this morning  i dunno what for   i m sure  mark calkins can t pay no doctor s bills  if he does work  regular  and pay more rent than the rest of folks      there was a curious mixture of complaint and satisfaction in dick s  tone  mrs  roberts gathered from it that the young man  mark calkins  in  whom the policeman had tried to interest her  was superior to the rest  of the miserable people in the alley  and that they resented it as an  insult to themselves  but that  at the same time  the reflected honor  of having a  swell  doctor come into their midst  attendant upon one who  really belonged to their class  was very great  could she possibly get  a little influence over them by following up the injured young man   and giving what help was needful  she had hardly meant to call  though  trying to find the house  her method of reasoning had been something  like this   the policeman said he lived about two blocks from my poor  dirk s home  since there has so recently been an accident  there may  be something to mark the house   a doctor passing in  possibly  or  something that shall give me a landmark  and i can have a glimpse of the  outside of one of the homes   in her ignorance of life at that end of  the social scale she did not know that a doctor passing in and out  even  after an accident  was a sufficiently rare occurrence to make much more  of a mark than she was looking for  so absorbed had she been over the  boys belonging to her class that she had rather ignored the policeman s  manifest hint to add this one to her list  yet  was it possibly an  answer to her prayer  an entering wedge of some sort  that might open  the way to influence      who is the doctor   she asked her guide  as the possibility of making  an entrance through him occurred to her   do you know his name      oh yes  dick knew his name and where he lived  and even the names of  some of his  swell  patients   trust him for gaining information about  anything that came into the alley      it s dr  everett   he said promptly  that curious touch of  pride appearing again in his voice   he lives away up among the  twenty thirders  and he goes to cady s house to doctor  and lots of them  places where the big ones lives  i dunno how he happens to come here      mrs  roberts had never heard the name  but she reflected that she was a  new comer  and wisely desisted from taking from the glory of dr  everett  by admitting that he was not known to all the world  he might be a good  doctor and a philanthropic one  his visits to this region looked like  it      do you know where any of the boys in our class live      this was her next carefully worded question  she did not know whether to  hint that she had heard of one who lived in that alley  or whether this  would be considered an insult      well   said nimble dick  the sly twinkle coming back to his eyes  that the strangeness of the situation had driven away for a moment   i  calculate that i know where i live  myself   sometimes i do  anyhow       to be sure   she said  laughing at his humor   i should have said   where any of the others live  of course you will give me your address   after being so kind as to see me to  some point where i am acquainted      she had nearly said a place of safety  but checked herself in time  i  am not sure  though  that dick would have noticed it  he was lost in  astonishment over the idea of giving anybody his address      this is dirk colson s house   he said  suddenly   and he is one of our  fellows      mrs  roberts uttered an exclamation  the house was one of the most  forlorn in the row  seeming  if the miserable state of the buildings  would admit of comparison  to be more out of repair than the others  it  came home to her just then  with a sudden  desolating force  that human  beings  such as she was trying to reach  and such as she hoped would  live in heaven forever  called such earthly habitations as these homes   what possible idea could they ever get of heaven by calling it  home       do they have the whole of the house      she asked the question timidly  for the building looked very large  but  she was utterly unused to city tenement life      the  whole  of that house   dick fairly shouted the sentence  and bent  himself double with laughter   well  i should say not  mum  as near as i  can calculate  about thirty five different families have that pleasure   the whole of the house  oh  my  what a greeny   and he laughed again     mrs  roberts exerted herself to laugh with him  albeit she was  horror stricken  thirty five families in one house  how could they be  other than awful in their ways of living      i know almost nothing about great cities   she said   my home was in a  much smaller one      this was the truth  but not the whole truth  instinct kept this  veritable lady  in the truest sense of the word  from explaining that  she knew nothing about the abject poor  when she was speaking to one of  their number  just at this moment occurred a diversion  they had been  making swift progress through the alley  dick s long strides requiring  effort on his companion s part to keep by his side  but just ahead the  way was obstructed           chapter vii      what a little schemer it is        a riot  not among men  which is sufficiently terrifying  nor yet among  women  which is worse  but that most awful of all sights and sounds  of sin   a riot among the children  swearing  spitting at one another   tearing one another s hair  scratching like tigers  growling like wild  beasts  throwing garbage at one another  this was the sort of crowd upon  which mrs  roberts  in her black silk walking suit  with her velvet hat  and seal furs  presently came  she grasped at dick s arm in horror  but  a feeling that was more than terror was taking her strength away      oh   she said  and the agony in her voice really suggested more than  terror to the young fellow beside her   and they are little children   they cannot be more than seven or eight  oh  what can i do       you needn t be scared  mum   there was a little hint of something like  pity in dick s voice  she clung to him so that he could not help feeling  himself her protector   it ain t an uncommon row at all  they mostly act  like this  most likely one of  em s found a bone and t  other one wants  it  and then they re gone in for a row  and all the young ones crowd  around and fight  on one side or t  other      did this fearful explanation make the situation less terrible     there was a lull  however  in the quarrel  the elegantly dressed lady  was seen approaching   an unusual sight in that alley   and both parties  paused to get a view  paused in their attentions to each other  that is   but at mrs  roberts they hooted and jeered  and one threw a handful of  mud     then did nimble dick rise to his position as protector      shut up  there  stand aside  pluck  and let us pass  look out there   you smirchy  don t you throw that over here unless you want your head  broke for you when i get back      this threat was thrown at a wretched little girl  who had dived her hand  deeply into a box or cask of garbage  and brought it forth reeking with  rotten apples  pork fat  and any liquid horror which the name suggests  to you  she had her hand uplifted ready to throw  and was evidently  intending to give the strange lady the benefit of what she had prepared  for one of the rioters     the assured tone in which nimble dick spoke had its effect  the  combatants were all small  and he was large  and was evidently  recognized as a power  there were some defiant glances thrown at him   but the motley crowd gave way  and allowed him to pass uninjured  still  he kept an alert watch of them until quite out of reach  and was not  sparing of his admonitions      hold on there  bill   i see that  look out  sally  you ll be sorry if  you throw anything   mind you that      and at last they were through the crowd  not out of danger  it seemed   for there  directly in their narrow path  was a drunken man  swaying  from side to side in the way which is so terrible to one unused to such  sights  dick felt the hold on his arm tighten  and was astonished at the  sound of his own voice as he said  soothingly        you needn t be scared at him  mum  that s only old jock  he s as ugly  as old nick himself  but he knows better than to be very ugly to me  i  can throw him in the gutter as easy as i could them young ones  and he  knows it  that s dirk s father  that is  ain t he a beauty      and again mrs  roberts uttered an exclamation of dismay  and part of her  terror went out in sorrow over the wrongs of a boy who had such a home  and such a father  what ought to be expected of him     that interminable alley was conquered at last  and they emerged into  respectability on the broad avenue  mrs  roberts released her hold of  her protector s arm  and his new character vanished on the instant      you re here  mum   he said  with a saucy twinkle in his eye and a saucy  leer on his face   can you get yourself home from this spot  or shall i  borrow a wheelbarrow and tote you there      much shaken with various emotions though she was  mrs  roberts forced  herself to laugh  she would not frown on his fun when it was not  positively sinful  he might not be aware that it was disrespectful  he  might never have heard the word      i know the way now  thank you  at least i think i do  can you tell me  whether i take a green car or a yellow one to get to east fifty fifth  street       you take a green one   he said  quietly  his character of protector  having returned to him with the question  which still showed her  dependence on him      thank you   she said again  with great heartiness   i shall never  forget your care of me   her hand was in her pocket  and a bright coin  was between her fingers  she longed to give it to nimble dick  he had  saved her from so much this morning  and he was so miserably clad   surely he needed help  a moment s reflection  and she resolutely  withdrew her hand  he should be paid by a simple hearty   thank you    this morning  for kindness rendered  he might not consider it a current  coin  but possibly it would be his first lesson in the courtesies of  life     later in the day  when mrs  roberts was somewhat rested from her  morning s campaign  young ried received a little note       dear mr  ried   i know the names of all the boys  and inclose you a  list  it is possible that you may fall in with some one during the day  who can impart knowledge concerning them  anyway  i thought you would  like to know their names  keep me posted  please  as to your success in  making their acquaintance  we are allies  remember     yours for the master     mrs  e l  roberts     alfred ried twisted the delicate note paper thoughtfully in his hand   a look of perplexity on his face  he felt committed for labor  glad was  he  very  yet perplexed  he did not in the least know where to commence   well  neither had this little lady  yet she had accomplished more in her  one day s acquaintance than he after a lapse of weeks  either she had  found opportunities  or had made them  there must be chances  he would  be sure to keep his eyes open after this     in the handsome house on east fifty fifth street  where mr  roberts had  settled his bride  after a somewhat extended business tour  involving  months of absence  matters were in train for a cosy evening in the  library  that was the name of the beautiful room where the husband  and wife sat down together  but it was quite unlike the conventional  library  books there were in lavish abundance  but there were also  pictures and flowers and a singing bird or two  and an utter absence of  that severe attention to business details which characterizes most rooms  so named  little prettinesses  which mr  roberts smilingly admitted  did not belong to a library  were yet established there  with an air of  having come to stay   we will call it the library for convenience    the master of the house said   and then we will put into it whatever  we please  it shall be a conservatory  and a sewing room and a  lounging room and anything else that you and i choose to make it    and mrs  roberts gleefully assented  and gave free rein to her pretty  tastes  flossy shipley had been wont to be much trammelled with the ways  in which  they  did everything  but mrs  evan roberts was learning  that  in unimportant matters at least  they had a right to be a law unto  themselves  perhaps it helped her  to be aware that a large class of  people were all ready to quote  mrs  evan roberts  as authority on  almost any point of taste     on the evening in question mr  roberts  in dressing gown and slippers   had drawn his lounging chair to the drop light  preparatory to a  half hour of reading aloud  but it transpired that there was something  preparatory to that  or at least that must take the precedence  certain  business telegrams followed him home  which required the writing of two  or three business letters      it will not take me long   he explained to his wife   and they are  not complicated affairs  so i give you leave to talk right on while i  dispatch them   she laughed at this hint about her fondness for talk   but presently made use of the privilege      evan  what sort of a young man do you consider mr  ried       ried  who  oh  my clerk  the very best sort  a most estimable  fellow   one of a thousand  by the way  did you tell him how you became  interested in that sister of his       not yet  i want to get better acquainted  but  evan  do you know where  he boards       hardly  on third avenue somewhere  i believe  or possibly second  the  store register would show  do you want his address       oh  i know  where  it is  but i mean what sort of a place is it      mr  roberts slightly elevated his shapely shoulders      it is a boarding house  where many clerks board  that tells a doleful  story to the initiated  i suspect  poor fare and dismal surroundings   still  it is eminently respectable       where does he spend his sabbaths      the rapidly moving pen executed nearly two lines of handsome writing  before mr  roberts was ready to respond to this question      why  at church  principally  i fancy  he is very regular in his  attendance at morning service  and the south end mission absorbs his  afternoons  i suppose he goes to church in the evening  but since we  have been giving our attention to that evening mission i have not seen  him       ah  but  evan  i mean the rest of the time  those little bits of  sabbath time that are sacred to home  the twilight  for instance  or  for an hour in the morning  do you know what sort of a place he has for  those times      nearly three more lines added to the paper  then mr  roberts raised his  head        no  my dear  i don t  now that you bring me face to face with the  question  it seems a surprising thing to say that i should not know  where a young man who has been for more than a year in our employ spends  his choice bits of time  but i don t       then i want to tell you something about it  he has a dingy   fourth story back room  small  i fancy  from the way in which he spoke  of it  and not a speck of fire over  in such weather as this  how can a  young man read his bible  or even pray  under such circumstances      mr  roberts laid down his pen and sat erect  regarding his wife with a  thoughtful  far away air      flossy   he said at last   it is an immense question  you open a  perfect mine of anxiety and doubt  i have hovered around the edges for  some time  but have generally contrived to shut my eyes and refuse to  look into it  because i was afraid of what i might see  and because i  did not know  what to do with my knowledge  i have not been the working  member of the firm very long  you know  and my special field  until  lately  has been the other side of the ocean  but i have been at home  long enough to know that there are several hundred young men in our  employ who are away from their homes  and knowing  as i do  the price of  board in respectable houses  and knowing the salaries which the younger  ones receive  it does not require a great deal of penetration to  discover that they must have rather dreary homes here  to put it mildly   the fact is  flossy  i haven t wanted to look into this thing very  closely  because i do not see the remedy  look at our house  for  instance  with its three hundred clerks  we ll say  who are away  from their friends  suppose one half  or even one third  of them are  miserably situated  what can i do       are they not sufficiently well paid to have the ordinary comforts of  life       doubtful  the truth is  what you and i call the ordinary comforts of  life takes a good deal of money  and in the city  rents are high   and the boarding house keepers have hard struggles to make their  expenditures meet their income  and they carry economy to the very verge  of meanness   some of them fairly over the verge  i presume  and the  result is cheap food  badly cooked   because well cooked food means  high priced help   and cold rooms and dreariness and discomfort  everywhere  now what can be done about it  then our house is only one of  hundreds  and in many of these hundreds they employ more help and give  less wages than we  in fact  i know that some of our clerks are looked  upon with envy by a great many young men  we never have any trouble  in supplying vacancies  people swarm around us  because we have the  reputation of being liberal  we are not liberal  however  sometimes i am  inclined to think we are hardly fair  yet there is nothing i can do   i am a junior partner  with a great deal of the responsibility  and a  third of the voting power  and i can t get salaries raised  i ve been  working at that problem at intervals for a year  and have accomplished  very little  do you wonder that i keep my eyes as closely shut as i  can      his wife s face wore a thoughtful  not to say perplexed look  she seemed  to have no answer ready  and  after waiting a moment for it  mr  roberts  bent himself again to the task of getting his business letters  answered  before he had written one more line  her face had cleared  she  interrupted him        evan  when you talk about four hundred clerks  and multiply that by  hundreds of houses and more hundreds of clerks  i cannot follow you  at all  it is not that i am not impressed with the number   i am   it  appalls me  but i don t want to be appalled  i want to be helpful   perhaps just now there is nothing that i can do for the hundreds  so i  want to narrow my thoughts down to what  possibly  i can do  what  for  instance  can be done towards getting a good young man  like alfred  ried  into a place that will be just a little bit like a home  that will  give him a spot where he can study his bible in comfort  and invite a  friend with whom he wants to pray  or whom he wants to reach and help in  any way  that isn t a huge problem  can t it be solved      her husband smiled      he is only one of thousands   he said      yes  i know  but he is  one  of thousands  since we cannot reach  thousands  shall we fail to reach one  evan  i am only one of thousands   but  but how would you argue about me      mr  roberts laughed again      you are one out of thousands and thousands   he said  emphatically     a line more  and he signed the firm name with an unusually fine  flourish      there  i ve accomplished one letter  what do you want to do  flossy       i want mr  ried to have a room where he can invite one of my boys  occasionally  and make him comfortable  and do for him what we cannot  with our rooms  do for him what only a young man can do for a young man   i don t clearly know what i want further than that  but i see that one  thing as a stepping stone  remember  i want all your thousands to have  just as pleasant rooms  and i would like to help to bring it about  but  i don t just now see the way       do you see the way to this       no  but doesn t it seem as though we ought to be able to accomplish so  much       it does  certainly  what is your desire  flossy  do you want him to  have a room in our house      she shook her head      no  that would not further my plan for those boys  i would like to have  him here  and it would be a good thing for him   at least i think it  would  but i can see things which he could accomplish for these young  men  set by himself  in a different part of the city  besides  evan   i have other plans for our rooms  entirely different ones  and some of  them i am afraid you will think are very strange      he answered the doubt with a smile that said he had no fears of her or  her plans      what a little schemer it is   he said  looking down on her with fond   proud eyes   who would have imagined that she could plot  and plot so  mysteriously  i used to think she was a very open hearted woman            chapter viii      what would you do  dear        she joined in his laugh albeit  there was a tender look in her eyes   after a moment  she said  gently        it is not scheming  evan  i am only trying to set about the work for  which i have been chosen  i ll tell you how it all came to me  i was  reading  my morning reading  you know  after you had gone  taking little  dips here and there in the fashion that you think is so unsystematic   and i came upon this verse   he is a chosen vessel unto me   you know   about paul  well  it came to me with a sudden sense of awe and beauty   the being chosen of god to do a great work  i stopped reading to think  it out  what a grand moment it must have been to paul when he realized  it  and i began to feel almost sorry that we lived in such different  times  with no such opportunities  i stopped right in the midst of my  folly to remember that i was as certainly chosen of god as ever paul  was  for assuredly i did not come to him of myself  nor begin to love  him of myself  and therefore he must indeed have chosen me  and i  wondered whether probably each christian had not a work to do as  definite as paul s  a work that would be given to no other  unless  indeed the chosen one failed  i did not want to fail  and i asked god  not to let me  then  of course  i set to wondering what my work  or my  part of some other person s work  could be  it was the morning after you  had told me that about ester ried  you cannot think how that impressed  me  i could not get away from the wonderment as to how her work was  prospering  and whether there were chosen ones enough  or if there  might possibly be a little place for me  i couldn t settle anything  and  finally i decided to look at paul s work a little while  of course  it  was not reasonable to suppose that the duties of the great apostle had  anything in common with my bits of effort  still  i said  the directions  given him may help me a little  and evan  what do you think was the  first thing i found  why  this   the god of our fathers hath chosen  thee  that thou  shouldst know his will    surely  so far  the things  for which both he and i were chosen were parallel  i looked further    and see that just one   that was the very next  was not i  too  chosen  for that   thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty   i said over the  beautiful promise to assure myself that it was true  and went on    and shouldst hear the voice of his mouth   was it not strange  evan   certainly i shall hear my king speak  often and often  when i get home   only think of it  so far paul was not ahead of me  i hurried to find  another reference to paul s work  and i found this  let me read it to  you   her bit of dainty sewing was suddenly pushed one side  and up from  the depths of the rose lined work basket came a small  plainly bound  bible  much marked  a rapid turning of the leaves  and the eager  disciple read   i have appeared unto thee for this purpose  to make thee  a minister and a witness  both of these things which thou hast seen  and  of those things in the which i will appear unto thee  now  evan  you  know the veriest child can be a witness if he knows anything about the  facts  and i do certainly know some wonderful things about jesus to  which i could witness  and besides  isn t it reasonable to suppose that  he will appear to me every day with things for me to witness to  and  then i read this  paul sent to the gentiles  you know  but for what   to  open their eyes  and to turn them from darkness to light  and from the  power of satan unto god  that they may receive forgiveness of sins and  inheritance among them which are sanctified  by faith that is in me    evan  was there ever a more wonderful work to do in the world than that   and yet i cannot tell you how it made me feel to discover  or at least  to realize  that a great deal of it was my work  of course  i naturally  began to ask myself  what gentile was there for me to reach  whose eyes  must i try to open  do you know  that very afternoon i met mr  ried  and  heard of those boys  they interested me from the first  and what he told  me about his sister increased the interest  then when i saw them   evan   if ever boys were in the power of satan they are  and to think that they  may have an inheritance among them which are sanctified  this morning  when i saw where some some of them lived  and imagined how they lived  i  fell stunned for a moment  it seemed to me impossible  what means  could possibly be found of sufficient power to fit them for such an  inheritance  and then directly came the closing words of the commission    through faith that is in me   evan  god will save them  and i think he  will let me help       amen   said mr  roberts  and his voice was husky  when his wife was in  one of her exalted moods he always admired her with a sort of reverence   he had been for years an earnest worker  he carried business plans and  business principles into the work  he studied cause and effect  and  calculated and expected certain results to follow certain causes  like  a mathematical problem  not that he by any means forgot the power  of faith  or in any sense attempted to do his work alone  he was a  christian who spent much time on his knees  but little flossy brought  so much of the childlike  unquestioning spirit into her work  that  sometimes he stood in awe  not knowing whether he could follow her  it  was not so much a mathematical problem to be worked out  as it was the  faith that can remove mountains         as a little child relies       on a strength beyond his own      knows he is neither strong nor wise        fears to stir a step alone       mr  roberts often found himself quoting these lines when his wife gave  him glimpses of her heart  and at such times he had no hesitancy in  deciding that the steps she took were not alone  but the lord was with  her     the postman s ring broke in on their quiet      i hope there are letters from home to night   mrs  roberts said   real  long ones  it is a week since we have heard       and i ought to hope that they would require a first reading in  private   her husband answered  as he seized his neglected pen   it is  the only way in which these business letters will get answered  i find  the temptation to talk to you irresistible      one letter  but that was of comfortable dimensions and weight      it is from marion   mrs  roberts said  delight in her voice  after the  first glance at the familiar writing  she was presently lost in its many  pages  and the business of letter writing went on uninterruptedly for  some time     mrs  marion dennis had not forgotten her fondness for her pretty little  flossy  nor forgotten that   softly innocent little creature though she  was  she possessed a wisdom far above those who are credited with having  keen insight  even a wisdom so subtle  and withal so tender  that its  source could only be infinite wisdom  so she  in company with many  others  was learning to turn to the friend so much younger than herself   as one in whom she could safely confide      dear little flossy   so the letter ran   i suppose  though you should  live to be a white haired old lady  sitting with placid face and fluted  cap and spectacles  in your high backed arm chair  in the most treasured  corner mayhap of some granddaughter s choicest room  i  writing to you   would still commence  dear little flossy   that i have to cover it from  prying eyes by the dignified and respectable  mrs  evan roberts   is  almost a matter of amusement to me  i fancy i can see you making  a journey through some of the chautauqua avenues  picking your way  daintily towards palestine  bending lovingly over the small white stones  that mark the village of bethany   a pink on your cheek  born  as i  thought  of the excitement of being among those tiny photographs of the  wonderful past  but born in part  i now believe  of the fact that mr   evan roberts joined us in our walk  oh  little mousie  how quiet you  were      well  many things have since transpired  we are old married women  you   and ruth  and eurie and i  i suppose the contrast in our lives   the  outward portion of them  i mean   is still as strongly marked  perhaps  more so  than it was when we were in chautauqua together  we were girls  then  we are matrons now  and with the taking on of that title  ruth and  i took special and great responsibilities  to night it rains  mr  dennis  has been called to the upper part of the city   away out to springdale   in fact   to see a sick and dying man  and i am alone and almost lonely   if i could summon any one of the three to my aid and comfort i would   i am almost as lonely as i was on some of those evenings in the old  boarding house  still there are differences  the smoky old stove is not   a summer warmth floats through the house  born of steam  no ill smelling  kerosene lamp offends your aesthetic friend to night  but the softest  of shaded drop lights sheds a halo around me  isn t that almost poetic   moreover  oh blessed thought  i have no examination papers to prepare   no reports to make up  nothing to do but visit with you  also  i will  admit just to you  that this is another and most blessed difference  between this and my lonely past  at almost any moment now i may hope  for dr  dennis  ring  and when he comes all sense of loneliness will  instantly depart  ah  flossy  dear flossy  this is such a difference as  even you cannot appreciate  you had your mother and father  and all your  dear home friends  and i had no one  and besides   here i hesitate  lest  you may be too obtuse to understand the reasoning   you have only added  mr  roberts to your circle of treasures  he is grand and good  i know   and i like him without even a mental reservation  but  my dear  i have  added dr  dennis  can human language say more      nonsense aside  sweet little woman  god has been very good to you and  me  yet  flossy  do you remember how  during those last months in which  we were together  i fell into the habit of telling you a great deal  about the thorns  and admitted to you once that they pricked less when  they had felt your smoothing touch  i want to tell you something  our  gracie  i am so sorry for her  yet i don t know what to do  she is  living a most unhappy life  and of course she shadows our lives also  i  told you  dear  about prof  ellis  he is still trying to convince  poor gracie  that i  being her step mother  must be her natural enemy   reminding her that before i came into the family her father was entirely  willing to receive his calls  and allowed her to accept his attentions   don t you see  it isn t strange at all that the poor little girl should  believe him  and turn from me  she has many judicious helpers in her  father s congregation  there are those who sigh over her almost in my  hearing   poor gracie  they say   how changed she is  she used to be so  bright and happy  there is something unnatural in these second mother  relations  all high spirited children rebel   imagine such talk helping  gracie  meantime  what do you suppose can be prof  ellis  motive  i  cannot think that he cares for her  i almost do not believe that there  is enough purity left in him even to admire a pure hearted young girl   certainly not one with such high ideals and earnest ambitions as gracie  had   why does she admire him   i fancy i hear you asking  my dear  she  doesn t  she thinks she does  and at seventeen such thoughts sometimes  work irreparable mischief  but left alone  one of these days she would  make the discovery that she was flattered by his attentions  because  he is nearly fifteen years older than she  and is brilliant in  conversation  and quoted as the finest musician in the city  i wish i  knew more things about him  what i do know shows me plainly enough the  sort of man he is  but with these guileless young things it seems as  though one had to unmask wickedness very thoroughly before they will  believe that it is anything but gossip or misrepresentation  he has gone  away for a six weeks  vacation  i don t know where  nor does dr  dennis   gracie knows  but does not enlighten me  flossy  dear  could you give me  a little wholesome advice  do you think  i wonder  sometimes  whether i  was not too complacent over my proposed duties  such schemed as i had   i was going to be the blessedest step mother that girl ever had  that  would not be saying much  possibly  don t we all incline to think that  the second mothers must be wrong  and the sons and daughters poor abused  darlings  but i loved gracie  you know  and she seemed to love me  and  to be so happy over the thought of our near relationship  there is very  little happiness from any such source during these days  gracie has  retired into dignity  she can be the most dignified young woman on  occasion that i ever beheld  she is not rude to me  on the contrary  she is ceremoniously polite  calls me mrs  dennis  and all that sort of  thing  when necessity compels her to call me anything  but she speaks  as little as possible  sits at table with us three times a day  when she  cannot secure an excuse for absence that her father will accept  says   yes  sir   and  no  sir   obediently to him  and  no  ma am  thank  you   to me  and that is the extent of our conversation  generally her  face is pale and her eyes red  and at the first possible moment she begs  to be excused  and retires to the privacy of her own room and locks her  door  her father has stopped her music lessons  at least she preferred  to have them stopped rather than take lessons of any other person  so  she practices no more  she continues her german and french  and secures  good reports from the professors  but there is an air of weariness and  dreariness about everything she does that makes one alternate between a  feeling of deep pity for her  and a desire to box her ears or shut her  up in a corner until she can behave herself  as a rule  however  i am  sorry for her  i was young once myself  i was undisciplined  i had no  mother  and i had a thousand wild fancies  any one of which might have  ruined me  what do you think you would do  dear  if mr  roberts had a  daughter  and you were her mother  you are all in a flush  now  and have  lain down this sheet and said aloud   what an idea  marion does say the  most absurd things   well  then  if you were marion dennis  and stood  before god in the place of mother to grace dennis  what do you imagine  you would do  i ll tell you my policy  i am uniformly cheerful in her  presence  gay  if i can make gayety out of anything  not toward her  father  you understand  because i can fancy that might irritate her   i really try to be gay toward gracie herself  but can you imagine an  attempt to be cheery with a tombstone  i study as much as i can  her  tastes  in the ordering of dinner and desserts  and arrange the flowers  that i know she likes best  and in short try to do all those little bits  of nice things that i feel certain you would do in my place  and just  here i may as well own that i learned these small prettinesses  studying  you  never should have thought them out for myself  flossy  dr  dennis  is one of the most patient and long suffering of men  but it is very  hard for him to be patient with poor gracie  harder than it is for me   first  because i know by personal experience just what a turbulent young  creature a miss of seventeen or eighteen can be  and secondly  because  it is upon me her displeasure falls most heavily  and that naturally he  resents      why am i writing all this to you  i don t  know  childie  really  save  that i remember what a curious way you have of telling jesus all about  your friends and their trials  and i remember with great comfort that  you are my friend  don t imagine me as miserable  i can never be that  so long as christ is the present helper that he is to me now  and you do  not need to be told that i daily thank him for giving me my husband   but i think you will understand better than many would how earnestly  i desire to fill the place of mother  to my bright young motherless  gracie  with her dangerous beauty and her dangerous talents and her  capacity for being miserable  oh  i want to do more than my duty  i want  to love her with all my heart  and to have her love me  if it were not  for that man  who always hated me  and who  i believe in my heart  has  sought her out and is pressing his attentions upon her because he sees  a possibility of stinging me through her  i might hope to fill the place  in her heart that i thought i could      the letter closed abruptly at this point  and was finished a few days  afterwards in a different strain  giving plenty of home news  and being  full of the brightness which always sparkled in marion s letters  but it  was the first two or three pages to which mrs  roberts turned back  and  which she thoughtfully re read  then she interrupted the busy pen        evan  are not the business letters nearly done  i want to read this to  you  and then i want to talk to you       delightful prospects  both of them   he said with energy  as he added  the last hurried line  signed and delivered to his wife to enclose in  its envelope  then pushed aside writing materials and sat back to enjoy      it isn t all delightful   his wife said  shaking her head   i did hope  that poor marion was going to have a few years of rest  her life has  been such a hard one            chapter ix      tremendous facts   he said       it is well that mrs  marion dennis felt entirely safe in her friend  flossy s hands  for her affairs were very thoroughly talked over that  evening  and sundry conclusions arrived at     one question mrs  roberts asked her husband  at the close of the  conference  which apparently had nothing to do with marion dennis   affairs        evan  do you know dr  everett       everett  let me think  yes  i know of him  a young physician   comparatively  who had not been here long  and has made his mark       in what direction       several  perhaps  but i have heard of him chiefly in the line of his  profession  he was accidentally called to attend a young lady belonging  to a very wealthy family out in brookline  i say accidentally  that is  a reverent way we have of speaking  you know  of course  i mean  providentially  the nursery governess in the family was sick  and this  dr  everett  who had fallen in with her somewhere  volunteered to cure  her  he was calling on her one morning when the sick daughter  who   by the way  had been given up by her physician  was taken suddenly and  alarmingly worse  in the emergency dr  everett was summoned  and while  they waited for the regular physician he succeeded in doing such good  service that he inspired the mother with confidence  she became anxious  to put the case entirely into his hands  which was done  and the young  lady recovered  and dr  everett s position  professionally  was assured   isn t that an interesting little item for you  he is said to have marked  success  and  of course  since the brookline occurrence his practice is  largely among the wealthy  how has your attention been called to him       my protector this morning said he was a  swell  doctor  who was  attending that calkins boy  i wondered if he did it because he loved  christ  he might be a helper  i want to call on that sick boy to morrow  if i can arrange it  i think i must take some one with me       you may take me with you   her husband said  emphatically     however much trips through alleys with nimble dick might be conducive to  that young man s moral development  mr  roberts felt that his wife had  experimented sufficiently     thus it transpired that  dressed in the plainest  quietest garb which  her wardrobe would furnish  mrs  roberts went to the alley the next  morning accompanied by her husband     in one sense it was a mistake that the first call in the alley should  have been made on the calkins family  it was calculated to give mrs   roberts mistaken ideas as to the manner in which poor people lived  a  bare enough room  certainly  not even a bit of carpet laid before the  bed  but it was a clean room  floor and window and cupboard door were as  clean as water could make them  and the bed  while it looked hopelessly  hard and dreadful to mrs  roberts  was really a pattern of neatness and  purity to every dweller in that attic  there was a straw tick  covered  with a dark calico spread  which did duty as a sheet  and the boy who  lay on it was covered by a patched quilt that had been mended  and was  clean  wonderful things these to say of such a locality  mr  roberts  suspected it  and dr  everett knew it  that gentleman was bending over  his patient when the two guests arrived  and vouchsafed them not even a  glance  while the dark haired  dark eyed  homely  decently dressed girl  gave mrs  roberts a seat on the one chair which the room contained  and  set a stool for her husband that had been made of four old chair legs  and a square board     sallie calkins was somewhat flurried by this unexpected call  she had no  idea who the people were  nor for what they had come  a vague fear that  they might be in some way connected with her brother s  place  at the  printing office  which he was in such fear of losing that his night had  been a restless one  made her hasten to say  in a tremulous voice        the doctor thinks he will be well in a little while  it isn t a bad  break  he says  and mark wants to keep his place  he thinks  maybe  some  of the alley boys would keep it for him  if you would be so kind      she was evidently addressing mr  roberts  but she looked at flossy  the  fair  sweet face  that gave her such sympathetic glances  seemed the one  to appeal to  mr  roberts  however  discerned that he was mistaken for  the employer  and immediately dispelled the idea by asking where the boy  worked  and how the accident had happened      it was the elevator  sir   she said  eagerly   the chain broke  and it  went down with a bang  and mark was on it  and he rolled off somehow  he  doesn t know how  and he has been that bad that he couldn t tell me  if he had  he was kind of wild  sir  all night  and talking about his  place       was there no one but you to be with him during the night   mrs  roberts  asked   where is the mother       we ve got no mother  ma am  there is only mark and me  and father   she  added  after a doubtful pause   but father was not at home last night   oh  i didn t need no one to take care of mark  i wouldn t have left  him       and he likes to have you take care of him  i am sure  what do you give  him to eat  he will need nourishing food  i think  beef teas and broths   and nice little tempting dishes  made with milk  perhaps  are you his  cook  too  i wonder if you wouldn t like to have me show you how to make  good things for him  i ve learned how to make some nice dishes that sick  people like      before the bewildered girl could answer  the doctor turned abruptly  from his long examination of his patient  and gave the guests the first  attention he had vouchsafed them  the truth was this man had had some  unfortunate experiences with district visitors  and had perhaps an  unreasonable prejudice against them as a class   i can t help it   ma am   he said to mrs  saunders  when she was taking him to task one  day   there are exceptions  of course  at least we will hope there are   but if you had seen some of my specimens  you would be the first to wish  an infusion of common sense could be introduced among them  as a rule   they offer a tract where they should give a loaf of bread or a bowl  of broth  and wedge their advice and reproofs in with every helpful  movement  it is like so many doses of medicine to the patient  to be  endured because he is at their mercy  and can t help himself  they mean  well  the most of them  but the trouble is  we have a way of making  district visitors out of people who have nothing to do  and who have  never learned that  all the nations of the earth were made of one  blood       something in mrs  roberts  tones or words seemed to interest him  and he  turned toward her      does this alley belong to you   he asked  abruptly  his mind still full  of the district visitor     she regarded him with a puzzled air for a moment  then answered  naively        i don t think it does  if it did i would have some things ever so  different      dr  everett laughed  and mr  roberts came forward and introduced  himself      my wife has hardly answered you fully   he said   i am under the  impression that she desires to adopt a certain portion of this alley  at  least i have heard of little else since last sabbath afternoon  she is  in search of some stray sheep who have been put under her care       ah   the doctor said  turning quickly to her   a sabbath school  teacher  is this young man one of your scholars       no   she explained   but she had heard of him while inquiring where one  of her boys lived  and she had called to see if she could help in any  way  dirk colson was the boy who  they told her  lived near this place      the eyes of the trim sister brightened      he lives on the next square   she said   oh  ma am  are you his  teacher  and do you care for him  i m so glad       he is a favorite of yours  is he   the doctor asked  looking from  one speaking face to another  and seeming immensely interested in the  matter      no  indeed   the girl said  quickly   he s horrid  but i m sorry for  his sister  and she wants dirk to get on  and he never does get on  but  i thought maybe such a kind of a teacher could help him      there was such intense and genuine admiration in the girl s voice for  the vision of loveliness before her that dr  everett could not help  smiling      it doesn t seem unlikely   said he  with significance  and added   who  is this dirk colson  who seems to be an object of interest       he is one of the worst boys in the alley  sir  sometimes i think he  is the very worst  because he is cross as well as hateful  but mark is  always kind of sorry for him  and says he has such a bad father he can t  help it  and mart  that s his sister  she is a friend of mine  and she  feels bad about dirk  but she can t do nothing  he ain t a bit like mark  there      the last words were spoken tenderly  and the sisterly eyes turned toward  the boy on the bed  and obeying a sign from his eyes she went over to  him  the doctor plied his questions        have you recently taken a class  madam  and is their general reputation  as encouraging as this special scamp of whom we are hearing      his words almost jarred on mrs  roberts  she had already prayed enough  for her boys to have a sort of tender feeling for them  a half desire  to cover their faults from the gaze of the indifferent world  did dr   everett represent the indifferent world  or did he love her master  she  wished she knew      there is nothing encouraging about them   she said  with grave  earnestness   save the facts that they are made in the image of god  and  that he wants them to  turn from the power of satan unto god  that they  may receive forgiveness of sins  and an inheritance among them which are  sanctified       a rare flash of intelligence and appreciation greeted her now from those  fine eyes bent so scrutinizingly on her      tremendous facts   he said   glorious possibilities   himself hath said  it   i claim kinship with you  i am an heir of the same inheritance      he held a hand to each  and they were cordially grasped  then dr   everett proceeded to business      there is enough to do   he said   everything is lacking here  there is  severe poverty  united to the most scrupulous tenderness and the most  tender love on the part of this brother and sister  i stumbled on the  case  and will do professionally all that is needed  and i have a friend  who would undoubtedly come to the rescue  but she is crowded just now   i shall be rejoiced to report to her a helper  do you know joy saunders   well  i wish you did  she is one whom you could appreciate  she is  young  though  and without a husband to guard her  and there are some  places to which she cannot come       has she learned that important fact   asked mr  roberts  with a  significant smile  then some explanation seemed necessary   this lady    he said   tried the alley alone yesterday  and lost her way  and went  lower down   quite near to burk street  i imagine       and what happened   the quick question and the doctor s tone suggested  possibilities not pleasant      oh  she met one of her new recruits   as hard a boy  so one of the  policemen on this beat tells me  as there is in the row   and pressed  him into service to escort her back to civilization  and strange to say   the fellow did it without placing any tricks      the doctor turned on the small lady a curious glance      i think you may be able to do something  even for dirk colson   he  said      do you know him      he laughed over the eagerness of the question      never heard of him before  i was only thinking of our friend s  description of his awfulness  ah  whom have we here      for the door had opened abruptly  and a pair of great blue eyes  set  in a frame of tawny hair  all in a frizzle  had peered in on them  the  vision was clothed in garments so torn the wonder was that they stayed  on at all  and there was a general look of abject poverty about her to  which sallie calkins  with all the bareness of her lot  was a stranger   she stood for just a moment  as if transfixed by astonishment at the  unwonted sight in the room  then turned and sped away as swiftly and  silently as she had come      that is dirk s sister   sallie calkins said  coming forward  her homely  face aglow with shame   she isn t a bad girl  ma am  she doesn t mean to  be  but she has a dreadful time  her mother is sickly  and has to go out  washing  times when she isn t able to sit up  and there ll be days when  she can t hold up her head  and the father is bad  ma am  and drinks   and swears  and sells things for drink till there ain t nothing left to  sell  and mart hasn t anything to mend her clothes with  and she doesn t  know how  anyway  and she hasn t even got a comb to comb her hair with   her father he took it to sell  and everything there is horrid  and dirk   he s awful      it was strange  she could not herself account for it  but with every  added word of misery that set poor dirk colson lower and lower in the  scale of humanity  there seemed to come into this woman s heart  and  shine in her face  an assurance that he was to be a  chosen vessel unto  god      the doctor was watching her again  curious  apparently  to see how this  pitiful appeal for forbearance in judging of poor mart affected her  and  something in his face made her say  speaking low   an inheritance among  them which are sanctified       amen   he said  and there came to mrs  roberts a feeling that this  earnest prayer  for the second time repeated by two men who prayed  was  a sort of seal from the master     she turned away from both gentlemen then  the tears were very near the  surface  she must do something to tone down the beating of her heart   sallie was at hand  and she went with her to another corner of the room   and a low toned conversation was carried on  scraps of which floated  back to the gentlemen in the form of  sheets    grape jelly    mutton  broth    a soft pillow   and the like      i feel my patient growing better   the doctor said  with satisfaction      is there no father here   mr  roberts asked     the doctor shook his head  but answered        there is the most pitiful apology for a father that i ever saw   a mere  wreck of a man  spends his time in a sort of weak drinking  if i may  coin a phrase to describe him  he actually uses no energy even in that  business  just staggers around and bemoans his lot  a most unfortunate  man  in his own estimation  with whom the world  through no fault of  his  has gone wrong  he is never downright intoxicated  and never free  from the effects of liquor  he is much like a wilted leaf in the hands  of this boy and girl  they could pitch him out of the window without  much difficulty  and if the fall did not kill him he would shed tears  and say it was a hard world  but now  what do we see  when the name of  father is so dishonored   made a wreck  as it were  why  the order of  nature is reversed  and these children take on the protective  they are  father and mother  and he is the weak  sinning child  the way that that  boy and girl have worked to keep their miserable father from starving or  freezing is something to astonish the very angels  they shield him   too  nobody who wants to reach their hearts must blame him  they are a  study   as different from the other inhabitants of the alley as the  sky is different from that mud hole down there  it isn t a good simile   either  there is no religion in their efforts  they are the veriest  heathen       how do you account for the development      the doctor shook his head        i don t account for it  it is abnormal  there must have been a mother  who left her impress  i can t learn anything about the mother  she died  when the girl was an infant  but i would like to know her history  i  venture to assert that she belonged to christ  and that a gleam of the  divine pity that she saw in him  and loved  left its impress on her  children  that is somewhat mystical   he added  smiling   i rarely talk  in this way  it must have been your wife who set me off       but she is the most practical and energetic of beings       ay  so are the angels  i fancy  and make us think of heaven directly we  hear the rustle of their wings  has your wife been a christian long       barely two years since she began to think of these things       i thought as much  she impresses me as one who is being led  who  does not choose to go alone  has not learned how  indeed  a very few  christians never learn how  and with them the lord does his special  work  well  sir  i must go  i m glad to have met you  and glad to leave  you here  good morning            chapter x      and she always tried        other business was transacted that morning which brought results  a  curious habit of mrs  roberts    one which  perhaps  most strongly  marked the difference between her ways of working and those of other  people   was that of appealing to the person at hand for information  on any subject which chanced to be the one prominent in her mind at the  time     where other and more systematic persons would have said   he is not the  one to ask about this matter  there is no reason for supposing that he  has any knowledge in this direction   mrs  roberts would say   i cannot  be sure that he may not be able to give just the information which i  need  in any case  what harm will it do to try   and she always tried     it was on this principle that she arrested dr  everett s speedy  departure with a question        dr  everett  are you familiar with boarding houses for young men      something like a vision swept instantly before the doctor  in which he  saw the long line of young men  and the long line of boarding houses   in the world  and he laughed with eyes and lips  the question seemed so  queerly put      with how many of them  madam   there was amusement in his voice  but  there was also curiosity   he wanted to know what this original little  lady was in search of      one would do  if it were of just the right stamp  i ll tell you what  i want   a nice  quiet  comfortable  home  sort of place  with a small  room  capable of being warmed  a single bedstead  with a passably  good bed  and a moderate rate of board  are not those modest enough  requirements       not at all  they are preposterous  a boarding house to which one could  conveniently apply the word   home     fire  in a young man s room   he is expected to enjoy freezing in a city  and if he come from the  country  he should be grateful for the privilege  but the idea of  calling for a good bed  that is the wildest suggestion of all  has she  ever boarded  mr  roberts       not at a boarding house  at least   said that gentleman  enjoying the  fun     but mrs  roberts looked grave      are you serious   she asked  gently   is there no chance in this great  city for a christian young man to have the ordinary comforts of common  life  just a little quiet room where he can pray  and where he can  invite some tempted soul  and try to help him  doesn t it seem all  wrong      the laugh was gone from the doctor s face  there was a look of keen  interest and genuine respect      how many young men are you thinking about  there are many christians  i  believe  among that class   poor young men  away from home   and i have  reason to fear that their chances for comfortable retirement are very  scarce  i have thought about the problem somewhat how to help them  in  the concrete  i don t see the way  of how many are you thinking       i am willing to think about them all   mrs  roberts said   and now it  was her turn to laugh    but i am panning for just one  i cannot work in  great ways  but i thought i might help one       exactly  mr  roberts  if every christian in our city would undertake  to help  one   the problem would be solved  well  there is one  boarding house to which the word  home  may properly be applied  and  there is one small room on the third floor vacated yesterday  i wonder  if the master wants it for your young man  it seems to me if there is  any one thing more than another that we need in that house just now it  is a christian young man  of what type is your friend  will he help or  hinder a gay young scamp much sought after by satan       he will try hard to help   said both mr  and mrs  roberts  and before  they parted the doctor had taken mr  ried s address  and promised to  call on him and negotiate the matter      that plan will work in two ways   said mrs  roberts  gleefully   mr   ried will be in the same home with  and somewhat under the influence of  that grand doctor  isn t it splendid that we asked just him      and her husband smilingly assented  and added that he should not have  thought of such a thing as asking him     on her way down town  mrs  roberts had dropped a letter in the mail   which also brought results  it read thus        dear marion   i have time for but a line  for i want to catch the  morning mail  i have such a nice plan  suppose you let your gracie come  and stay with me for a few weeks  you know she always liked me a little   and evan and i think we can make it pleasant for her  i will try to get  her so much interested in seven boys whom i know that she will forget  all about professor ellis  mr  barnwell a confidential clerk in the  store  old and gray headed   will go to morrow to transact some business  with papa  evan will give him a letter of introduction to dr  dennis  he  expects to return on saturday  and if you will trust gracie to us  and  she is willing to come  she might travel in mr  barnwell s care  and  we would meet her at the depot  dear marion  we should like it ever  so much  and i have prayed about it all the morning  and cannot help  thinking that jesus likes it too      thus it came to pass that when mrs  roberts took her seat on the next  sabbath afternoon before her seven boys at the south end mission  a  vision of loveliness  such as the mission had not often seen  came in  with her  and looked with wide open eyes on all the new and strange  sights and sounds about her  a very pretty creature was gracie dennis   her eyes had lost none of their brightness  although they had shed some  tears during her recent experiences  they were fairly sparkling to day   for the great city into which she had come for the first time was like  fairyland to her  albeit  she had passed through scenes that afternoon  which bore no resemblance to her idea of fairyland  what the boys  thought of her could only be determined from their stares  let us hope  that her presence had nothing to do with their conduct  for never   in all the annals of the south end mission  had seven boys comported  themselves as did those before whom mrs  roberts sat that winter  afternoon     nimble dick  as if to be revenged for his unintentional courtesy of the  monday before  placed his ill kept feet on the seat in front of him  in  alarming proximity to mrs  roberts  shoulders  and chewed his tobacco   and defiled the floor with its juice  and talked aloud  and was in  every sense disgusting  neither was dirk colson one whit behind him  the  spirit of entertainment was upon him  he mimicked mr  durant s somewhat  hoarse tones  exaggerating the imitation  of course  until it was  ludicrous  he imitated the somewhat shrill tenor  and the nasal tones  of deacon carter  who was doing good work with a class of meek looking  women  he even imitated mrs  roberts  soft  low voice  as she essayed to  interest them in moses and some of the wonders which he performed     vain hope  struggle as she might to be intensely dramatic in her  narrative  she did not for a moment gain the ascendency      moses   interrupted nimble dick in the very midst of one of her most  earnest sentences   let s see  that was the old fellow who swallowed the  serpents  wasn t it  i should have thought he would have been used up       you don t know nothin    interrupted stephen crowley  with a nudge at  dirk that the latter pretended tipped him entirely off the seat  and  left him a limp heap at mrs  robert  feet      he don t know nothin    repeated stephen  addressing mrs  roberts in  a confidential tone    t was the serpents swallowed moses  wasn t it   question is  how did he get around again       quit that   came at this point from dirk colson  in his fiercest tone    look here  you bill snyder  if you try pinching on me again i ll pitch  you over the head of old durant in less than a second      what was the poor  pale little woman to do  with one boy crawling about  the floor and two others in a hand to hand fight  with the rest in a  giggle  of what use to try to talk to them about moses  you should have  seen gracie dennis eyes by that time  horror and disgust were about  equally expressed  and rising above them both  a look of actual fear   mr  durant came over to attempt a rescue  his face distressed beyond  measure      mrs  roberts  this is too much  i am sure that patience has ceased to  be a virtue  they have never gone so far before  i suspected mischief  to day  i have heard from several of them during the week  and never  anything but evil  i am prepared for it  there is a full police force  on guard in the next room  what i propose is to have every one of these  fellows taken to the lock up  it will be a lesson that they richly  deserve  and may do them good      whispering was not one of mr  durant s strong points  he meant to convey  secret intelligence of carefully laid plans to mrs  roberts alone  in  reality not a boy in the class but heard every word  they were startled  into silence   a full police force   they were not fonder of the lock up  than are most boys who deserve that punishment  they were skilful in  escaping the hands of policemen  they had not believed that the south  end mission would resort to any such means  they recognized in the  mission an attempt to do them good  and  without any effort at reasoning  it out  they had by tacit consent decided that policemen and lock ups  and christian effort did not match  they had chuckled much over the  stationing of  little duffer  at the door on guard  any two of the  strong young fellows were a match for him  and in the event of a riot   which they would like no better fun than to help get up  how many choice  spirits all about the room would join them if given the word  and in the  delightful confusion which would result how easy to escape from sight  and hearing while policeman duffer was summoning aid  they had felt  comparatively safe  but  a full police force  detailed for duty was  quite another thing  they felt caught in a trap  nimble dick got up in  haste from the floor and took his seat  and the boys looked from one to  another with ominous frowns  there were reasons why none of them cared  to come before the police court just now  what was to be done     while they waited and considered  mrs  roberts did it  her hand was on  mr  durant s arm  and directly the loud whispering ceased  she spoke in  low  but distinctly emphatic tones        i beg of you  mr  durant  do no such thing  i would dismiss every  policeman at once  with thanks  if i were you  we shall not need their  help  i give you my word of honor that the boys will be quiet during  the rest of the session  not because they are afraid of policemen   but because they respect me  and do not want to see me frightened or  annoyed  please don t let a policeman come near us      i am not sure which was the more astonished  the superintendent or  the boys  he returned to his desk with the bewildered air of one whose  deep laid schemes had come to naught in an unexpected manner without  giving him time to rally  and the boys looked at one another in  perplexity  and were silent     mrs  roberts turned to them with quiet voice        boys   she said   you have spoiled the story that i was going to tell  you  i have lost my place  and there isn t time to go back and find it   i am sorry  for i think you would have liked the story  i spent a good  deal of time this week trying to make it interesting  but never mind  now  there is something else i want to say  will you spend the hours  from eight to ten with me to morrow evening at my house  i brought cards  with me for each of you  containing my address  that you might have no  trouble in finding the place      whereupon she produced the delicate bits of pasteboard  with her name  and address handsomely engraved thereon     nimble dick took his between his soiled thumb and finger  turned it over  in a pretence of great interest  and finally endeavored to  sight  it  with his eye  as a workman does his board      what ll you do with us if we come   stephen crowley asked  fixing what  was intended as a wise look upon her  the leer in his eye hinting that  he was smart enough to see another trap  and meant not to fall into it     mrs  roberts laughed pleasantly      it is an unusual question  when one invites company   she said   but i  don t mind answering it  for one thing i thought we would have an oyster  stew and some good coffee together  then  if any of you like music  i  have a friend with me who is a good singer  and i have a few pictures i  should like you to see  if you cared to  and  i don t know whether you  are fond of flowers  but some of you may have a mother  or sister at  home who is  and the greenhouse is all aglow just now  oh  how can i  tell what i should do to entertain guests  just what seemed to me to be  pleasant at the time  that is the way i generally do  may i expect you      the boys stared  this was a new departure  indeed  how much of it  did she mean  what was she trying to do  was it a trap  still she had  rescued them from the police force  and they had not expected that   for every boy of them knew that he had treated her shamefully  timothy  haskell was generally the quietest one of the group  and perhaps the  most straightforward  he went directly to the point of the question that  he saw in the eyes of the others      what do you do it for       yes  that s the talk   said nimble dick   what do you want of us       why  i want you to spend the evening with me  didn t i tell you  if  you really mean to be friends with me of course i must invite you to my  home  what  could  i want except to have a nice time  i m trying to make  you like me  of course i want you to like me  how can we have pleasant  times together unless you do            chapter xi      i have but to try again        pleasant times like we ve been having to day   said nimble dick  with a  wicked leer     if he meant to disconcert her  he missed his point      no   she said  promptly   we haven t had a bit nice times to day  and  as for liking you  i haven t done so to day at all  if i had the least  idea that you meant often to treat me as you have this afternoon i  should know it was of no use  but i cannot think that you will continue  to treat a lady in such a manner  particularly when i am really trying  to make a pleasant time for you  there is no object  you see  in  spoiling it      this plain bit of truth  for the time being so commended itself to the  judgment of the boys that they regarded the speaker gravely  without  attempting a reply  she was not moralizing  at least it was unlike any  moralizing that they had ever heard  it seemed to be simply a bit of  practical common sense  not a boy would have owned it  but each felt   just at that moment  a faint hope that she would  not  decide it was  of no use  and give them up  straightforward tim haskell had one more  question to ask        why didn t you let them bring in their police and settle us      their teacher hesitated just a moment  would the  whole truth  do to  speak in this case  could she hope to make them understand that she saw  in it a step lower down  and that thus degraded before her eyes  she  feared her possible hold on them would be gone forever  no  it wouldn t  do  a little  a  very  little piece of the truth was all that she could  treat them to  a faint sparkle in her bright eyes  which every one of  them saw  and she said        i was afraid you might not be excused in time to keep your engagement  with me to morrow evening      they all laughed  not boisterously  actually an appreciative laugh  they  were bright  there is hardly a street boy living by his wits who isn t   they recognized the humor hidden in the answer  and enjoyed it     then the superintendent s bell rang  that bell always did seem to have  an evil influence on those boys  indeed  mrs  roberts was known to  remark  a few sundays afterwards  that if there  were  no opening and  closing exercises in the sabbath school  her work would be easier  that  street boys did not seem to have one element of devotion in them  and  needed to be kept at high pressure  in order to be able to control  themselves     the thought is worthy of study  perhaps  it is just possible that our  opening and closing exercises are too long drawn out even for those who  are not street boys     be that as it may  the little spell which mrs  roberts had been able for  a few minutes to weave around her boys on this particular sabbath  was  broken by the sound of the bell  the boys returned to their memories of  insult  as they regarded the police force  they muttered sullenly among  themselves about  traps  and  sells   and  guessed they wouldn t get  caught here again   and mrs  roberts  seeming not to hear  heard with a  heavy heart     how angry they looked  even nimble dick s usually merry face was clouded  over  what a curious thing it was that even they had their ideas  of propriety  and felt themselves insulted  was it an instinct  she  wondered  a reminder that there was in them material for manhood     would they ever  any of them  be men  christian gentlemen  it seemed  almost too great a stretch for even her imagination  as she moved in  her seat her delicately embroidered  perfumed handkerchief fell to  the floor  mrs  roberts was used to young men  mere boys  even  whose  instinctive movement would be to instantly restore it to her  not a boy  before her thought of such a thing  she had not expected it  of course   yet she wondered if the instinct were not dormant  needing but the  suggestion  it was a queer little notion  worthy of flossy shipley  herself  who  from being continually busy about little things  had come  to the conclusion that nothing anywhere was little  that the so called  trifles  which make up many lives  had much to do with the happiness of  other lives  was it worth her while to try to teach these street arabs  to pick up fallen handkerchiefs  she differed from many christian  workers  in that  in her simplicity  she really thought it was     there was a lull just at that moment  a hymn had been announced  but the  organist s note book had been mislaid  and was being sought after  it  could disturb no one if mrs  roberts tried her little experiment  she  looked longingly at dirk colson  but his brows were black and his eyes  fierce  this was no time to reach him  nimble dick looked much more  approachable  she determined to venture him        mr  bolton   spoken in her sweetest voice   i have dropped my  handkerchief       anybody with half an eye could see that  mum  and a mighty dirty spot  you picked out for such a nice little rag to lie in      this was her only response  then the discomfited experimenter told  herself that she was a blunderer  how could the poor fellow be expected  to know what she meant  why had she not  asked  the service from him   she would try again     would he be kind enough to pick it up for her  it was long afterwards  before mrs  roberts could think of his answer without a sinking heart   fixing bold  saucy eyes on her  he spoke in deliberate tones  loud  enough to be heard half way across the room        why  pick it up yourself  mum  it is as near to you as it is to me  and  you don t look weakly      she picked it up  her poor cheeks burning  but she did not forget it     various after school conferences told their different stories      well   mr  durant said  stopping in the act of mopping his hot forehead  to shake hands with her   mrs  roberts  i honor your courage  those boys  were simply fearful to day  i really feared some outbreak that would be  hard to quell  i m afraid we shall have to give them up  yes  i know how  you feel  but you haven t been here to see what we have borne from  them  all sorts of teachers have been tried  we have given them the best  material we had  both men and women  and every one has failed  then you  actually want to try it for another sabbath  well  i m glad of it  oh    i  don t want to give them up  it makes my heart ache to think of it   but if we can t keep them in sufficient order to get any benefit  nor  find a teacher who is willing to hold on to them  what else is there for  us to do  but that last complaint i needn t make so long as you  hold  on   need i   this last with a genial smile   well  god bless you  i  couldn t begin to tell you how much i hope you will succeed      but his face said   however  i know you won t      he turned from her and said as much to young ried        she is in earnest  ried  and she has resources  but she won t catch  them  simply because they don t mean to be caught  they come here  to make trouble and for nothing else  just look at the way they have  performed to day  worse than ever  and they never had a better teacher   i ve watched her  and i believe she knows how  i ll tell you what it is   ried  we must hold on to her  and when she gives up those boys we must  secure her for that class of girls down by the door  i really think we  have a prize      now  if he had but known it  mrs  evan roberts meant to teach no other  class at the south end mission save those boys      flossy shipley   this was gracie dennis  exclamation  when she was very  much excited  she went back to the old name   what  are  you trying to  do with those horrid boys  and how can you endure their impudence  i  never saw anything like their actions in my life  and i thought i had  seen bad boys  you look completely worn out  and no wonder  i shouldn t  think mr  roberts would let you do this  what good can you do such  creatures  flossy       my dear gracie  don t you think that jesus christ died to save them       well   said gracie  hesitatingly  it was a favorite phrase with her  as  it is with many people when they don t know what to say next      and don t you think he wants them saved  and will he not be pleased  with even my little bits of efforts if he knows that my sincere desire  is to save these souls for his glory       but what i mean is  what good can you do them so long as they act as  they do now  they didn t listen to a word you said  so as to get any  good out of it       i don t know that  dear  nor do you  don t you think the holy spirit  sometimes presses words on people that they do not seem to be heeding   in any event  that is a part with which i have nothing to do  i tried   and if i failed utterly i have but to try again  it isn t as though  there were some good teacher ready to take them  nobody will make a  second effort  now there is one thing i can certainly do  i can keep on  making efforts  who knows but some of them may bear fruit  by the way   gracie  i want ever so much of your help       mine    said gracie  with wide open eyes   i don t know how to  help people  i m not good   and her face darkened in a frown   some  unpleasant memories that went far toward proving the truth of that  statement coming to mind just then  after a moment she spoke in a  somewhat more gentle tone   don t count on me  flossy  for help about  those boys  they frighten me  i never saw such fellows  i couldn t help  wondering what  papa would have said to them      between the  wondering  and the noun there had been an observable pause   mrs  roberts suspected that the thought in gracie s mind was rather what  mrs  dennis  who was supposed to have much knowledge of boys  would have  thought of them  but since her arrival gracie had studiously avoided any  reference to her stepmother  and mrs  roberts had humored her folly      never mind  you can help them  and when you begin to realize that  you  will forget your fears       do you expect to see one of the creatures to morrow evening  what in  the world would you do with them if they did come       i m not sure that i  expect  them  i only hope for them  as to what  to do with them  i trust to you to help answer that question  i want to  give them an idea of what a nice time is       i cannot help   said gracie again  but she was  interested   and  referred again and again to the subject  cross questioning mrs  roberts  as to her plans and hopes  until that lady gave a satisfied smile to the  thought that her seven boys had begun their work     the first part of this conversation was held while they waited in one of  the class rooms for mr  ried to give in his report before joining them   the waiting suggested to gracie another question      who is this mr  ried  who seems to have us in charge       he is one of the clerks from the store  which accounts  in part  for  his attendance on us  but i am interested in him for other reasons  he  had a wonderful sister  that is  she was a wonderful christian  she died  when quite young  but one might be ready to go to heaven early if  one had accomplished as much as she did  by one of those strange  arrangements  which i should think would go far toward making observing  people believe in a special providence  her life  or i might almost say  her death  was the means of changing the current of my husband s life   he says he was a gay young fellow  a member of the church  but giving  just as little attention to religion as many do whom you and i know   an accident to one of his family held him for several weeks in the town  where this ester ried lived  and her physician  with whom he became  acquainted  introduced him to her  it seems she was very much interested  in young men  in their christian development  he went to see her several  times  and  to use his own expression  she first made him realize that  there was such a thing as zeal  and then she set it on fire  what she  had begun in life she finished in her death  evan attended her funeral  services  and the walls were hung with bible texts of her selection   the most wonderful texts  all about christian work  and about being in  earnest  because the time was short  evan says he began to understand   then  that the service of christ was first  best  and always      wasn t it a singular providence that led him under the influence of  that young girl during the closing weeks of her life  only think  he has  been doing her work ever since   doing it  possibly  in ways that she  could not compass  that is one reason why i am so much interested in  those boys  it seems to me as though they were her boys  did i tell you  that her heart went out especially after the neglected  i learned about  the boys through mr  ried  he was but a child when his sister died  and  yet she succeeded in so enthusing him with her ideas that he is all the  time trying to carry out her plans  she had some wonderful ones  this  idea of inviting the boys  socially  i had from her  do you see how  plainly she is working yet  though she has been in heaven so long       do you think   asked gracie dennis  a timid  gentle sound to her voice    that all christians ought to put religion  first  best  and always    as your husband said  i fancied that some were set apart to do a special  work       we are all set apart  dear  don t you think  given to him to use as he  will  the trouble is that so many of us take back the gifts  and use our  time and our tongues as though they were our own       our  tongues    repeated gracie  amazement in her voice      why  yes  didn t you give him your tongue when you gave him yourself   and yet you are fortunate if you have not dishonored him with it many a  time      said gracie   what a queer way you have of putting things      then came alfred ried in haste  and apologizing for the long delay   gracie dennis  watched him curiously  listened critically to his words   was it to be supposed that this young man put religion  first  best  and  always   and considered his tongue as given to the lord  alfred bore the  scrutiny well  he took very little notice of miss gracie  being entirely  absorbed with another matter  he had settled opinions about mrs  roberts  now  from which he would not be likely to waver  he had seen much of her  during the week  and he knew she had not been idle  she had given  him much valuable information concerning the boys in whom he had been  interested all winter  and whom she had known for a week  also he was  aware that sally and mark calkins had seen much of her  to their great  benefit  she had made him her messenger on one occasion  and he had seen  sally calkins take from the basket the clean  sweet smelling sheets that  were to freshen her brother s bed  and bestow on them rapturous kisses   while she murmured   i d walk on my knees in broad daylight through the  gutter to serve her   that i would       sheets aren t much  i suppose   moralized the young man  as he walked  thoughtfully homeward   people with much less money than she has  must have furnished them  it is thinking about things that makes the  difference between her and others      but he had not quite found the secret  the main difference between her  and many other people lay in the fact that she set steadily about doing  the things she thought of that would be nice to do     on the whole  young ried was fully prepared to sympathize with mr   durant s opinion  that the south end mission had secured a prize  not  that he was very hopeful over those boys  he felt that their conduct   under the circumstances  showed a depth of depravity which was beyond  the reach of mission schools  but it was a comfort to think that good  things were arranged for them if they had but chosen to receive  he  began at once to talk about them      mrs  roberts  they are worse than i had supposed  i am afraid that your  patience is exhausted      her answer was peculiar      mr  ried  i want you to spend to morrow evening with me  i have invited  my boys  and i depend on you and gracie here to help entertain them       are you equal to such formidable work as that   asked gracie  with a  mischievous smile     he did not respond to the smile  he was looking at mrs  roberts   studying her face as one bewildered with the rapidity of her moves      i want to be   he said  with feeling   i want to know how to work   and i m learning  mrs  roberts  i moved to my new boarding house last  evening  and my room is a perfect little gem  there is an illuminated  text in it  and all around it is twined an ivy  growing   don t you  think  hidden  you know  behind the frame in a bottle  and the text is  one of my sister s treasures  isn t that a singular coincidence       it is very nice   said mrs  roberts  with satisfied eyes  she still  made much use of that little word      and  mrs  roberts  i asked one of your boys to come in this evening and  see my room            chapter xii      i want them to get used to parlors         those two people can think and talk of nothing but those dreadful  boys   said gracie to herself  half annoyed and wholly interested   she found herself that very evening turning over the music  with the  wonderment in her mind as to what she could sing that they would be  likely to care for  provided one of them appeared  which thing she did  not expect     but i have not told you of all the discussions had that day  the boys  went their various ways  their minds also busy with the events of the  afternoon  dirk colson and stephen crowley went off together  not that  they were special friends  but their homes lay near together  for the  distance of half a block they walked in silence  then stephen crowley  spoke his mind        nimble dick wasn t near as smart to day as he thinks he was  accordin   to my way of thinkin        he was meaner than dirt   burst forth dirk  fiercely   to go back on  her like that  after she had saved us from a row with the police  ain t  what i believe in  why couldn t he have picked up the rag  seeing she  wanted him to  that s what  i  say  i d a done it myself if she had give  me the chance       that there dick bolton can be too mean for anything when he sets  out   said stephen  with a grave air of superiority   i don t go in for  anything of that kind myself  we wasn t none of us much to boast of   but dick  he went too fur  i say  dirk  what do you s pose all that yarn  means about to morrow night  and what be we goin  to do about it  dick   he said it was all a game to get hold of us somehow  and he wasn t goin   to have nothin  to do with it      had stephen crowley desired exceedingly to secure dirk s vote in favor  to the proposed entertainment he could not  at that moment  have chosen  a better way  dirk tossed his thick mat of black hair in a defiant  fashion and answered        he needn t have a thing to do with it  so far as i care  i don t know  who ll miss him  but if he thinks he s got all the fellows under his  thumb  and they re goin  to do as he says  i ll show him a thing or two    i m  a goin  to morrow night  i don t care what it is  nor what it is  for  she was nice and friendly to us to day  and i m willin  to trust  her to morrow  i shall go up there and see what she does want  it can t  kill a fellow to do that much       then i m a goin   too   declared stephen  with decision   dick  he  thinks there won t none of us go if he don t  and i d just like to show  him that he must get up early in the mornin  if he wants to keep track  of us      if dirk colson needed anything to strengthen his resolution  there was  material in that last sentence which supplied it  he had long  chafed under the control of dick bolton  here was a chance to assert  superiority  he even  just at that moment  conceived the brilliant idea  of supplanting dick  running an opposition party  as it were     what if he should get every fellow in the class to promise to go  and  dick  the acknowledged leader  should find himself left out alone in the  cold  the thought actually made his grim face break into a smile  thus  it came to pass that the most efficient worker for the success of the  monday evening entertainment  so far at least as securing the presence  of the guests  was dirk colson     in mr  roberts  mansion preparations for receiving and entertaining the  hoped for guests went briskly forward  preparations which astonished the  young guest already arrived      are you really going to let them come in here   she asked  as she  followed mrs  roberts through the elegant parlors  and watched her  putting delicate touches here and there      certainly  why not  don t you open your parlors when you receive your  friends       i don t think we have such peculiar friends on our list   gracie said   with a little laugh  and then   flossy  they will spoil your furniture       if one evening in the master s service will spoil anything it surely  ought to be spoiled   mrs  roberts answered  serenely      but  flossy    with a touch of impatience in her voice    what is the  use  wouldn t the dining room answer every purpose  be to them the most  elegant room they ever beheld  and be less likely to suffer from their  contact      the busy little mistress of all the beauty around her turned to her  guest with a peculiar smile on her face  half mischievous and wholly  sweet  as she said        i want them to get used to parlors  my dear  they may have much to do  with them  as well as with dining rooms       they are more likely to have to do with penitentiaries and prisons    gracie said  but she abandoned discussion  and gave herself to the  pleasure of arranging lonely flowers in their lovely vases     there was a divided house as to the probability of the guests  appearing   mr  roberts inclining to the belief that some of them would  come  while gracie was entirely skeptical  mrs  roberts kept her own  counsel  neither expressing wish nor fear  but steadily pushing her  preparations     as a matter of fact  the entire seven appeared together  promptly  as  the clock struck eight     at the last moment dick bolton  the usual leader  finding himself in  a minority of one  not to be outwitted  protested that he had not the  least notion of staying away  of course he was going  and good naturedly  joined the group     i wonder if you have the least conception of how those boys looked  the  ideas of some people cannot get below nicely patched clothes  carefully  brushed boots  clean collars  and neatly arranged hair     clean collars  not a boy of them owned a collar  no thought of brushing  their worn out  unmended boots ever entered their minds  their clothes  were much patched  but in many places needed it still     stephen crowley had made a somewhat unsuccessful attempt to put his mass  of hair in order  most of the others had not thought even of that  why  should they  poor dirk  you will remember  if he had thought of it  had  no comb with which to experiment  it is doubtful if many of the others  were any better off in this respect     imagine the seven standing  a confused  grinning  heap  in the centre of  mrs  roberts  large and brilliantly lighted hall     she came forward to welcome them  shaking hands  though they made no  attempt to offer a hand in greeting  she had to grasp after each  she  essayed to introduce gracie  not one of them attempted a bow      come this way   mrs  roberts said   and take seats   then she led the  way into the long  bright  elegantly furnished  flower decked room     they followed her in a row  midway in the room they made a halt  they  caught a view of themselves  full length at that  revealed by the great  mirrors  they had never seen themselves set in contrast before  they  could not sit in a row  for the easy chairs and sofas  though plentiful   had the air of having been just vacated by people who had left them  carelessly just where they had chanced to sit     it required diplomacy to seat those boys  when at last stephen crowley  dropped into one of the great pillowy chairs  he instantly sprang up  again  and looked at it doubtfully     was the thing a trap  how far down would it sink with him  this was  too much for nimble dick  even under the present overpowering  circumstances  he laughed  his hostess blessed him for that laugh  the  horrible stiffness was somewhat broken  and all were seated     just at that moment came alfred ried  hurriedly  like one who had  intended promptness and missed it      all here ahead of me   he exclaimed   mrs  roberts  i beg your pardon   at the last moment i went in search of dr  everett  there was serious  illness in a house next door  and i happened to know just where he was      during this address he was shaking hands with his hostess  his manner  easy and graceful  as one used to it all  then he crossed the room  that  wonderful room  treading down those flowers on the carpet as though he  had no fears of breaking their stems      good evening  miss dennis   he said  and he was bowing in a manner that  dirk colson was confident he could imitate  then he turned to the boys   shaking hands        how are you  haskell  by the way  crowley  i called on you to day at  the office  sorry not to find you in       mrs  roberts  allow me   and he wheeled one of the easy chairs to the  spot where that lady was standing      how well he enters into the thing   said gracie dennis to herself   looking on in admiration at this young man  who  still so young  was  adapting himself to circumstances that might well have embarrassed older  heads than his  he plunged into talk with the boys  making them answer  questions  he had come but a few moments before from mark calkins    stopped there with a message from dr  everett  and these boys knew mark  and sallie and the worthless father  and all the more or less worthless  neighbors who ran in and out  and young ried had a dozen questions to  ask  his quick wittedness  and the ease with which he made talk to these  young men who lived in such an utterly different world from himself   surprised his hostess very much     even she did not know to what an exalted pitch his enthusiasm and  excitement reached  though he had flashed a pair of most appreciative  eyes on her when she gave him her invitation for the evening  here was  actually his sister ester s darling scheme being worked out before his  eyes  not only that  but he was being called upon to help  ester had  wanted him to grow up to undertake just such efforts as these  and only  last week they had seemed to him so altogether good and noble and so  impossible to try  yet here he was helping try them  no wonder alfred  ried could talk     it had been determined in family council that mr  roberts must absent  himself  he was in the house  indeed  no further away than the library   ready for call in event of an emergency  but it was judged that another  stranger  and such a formidable one as the head of the house  must be  avoided for this one evening  as for mr  ried   would  they remember  that he was not much older than some of them  and that he was not a  rich young man living on his income  but was earning his living by daily  work  and would they note the contrast between themselves and him  this  was what their hostess wondered  a few moments and then came a summons  to the dining room  seated at last  though one of the poor fellows  stumbled over a chair  and barely saved himself from falling     if you could have seen that dining table  the picture of it would have  lingered long in your memory  the whitest and finest of damask table  linen  napkins so large that they almost justified dick bolton s  whisper   what be you goin  to do with your sheet   china so delicate  that gracie dennis could not restrain an inward shiver when any of the  clumsy fingers touched a bit of it  and such a glitter of silver as even  gracie had never seen before     one thing was different from the conventional tea party  every servant  was banished  none but tender eyes  interested in her experiment  and  ready to help it on  should witness the blunders of the boys  so  the hostess had decreed  and so instructed alfred and gracie  the  consequence was that alfred himself served the steaming oysters with  liberal hand  and gracie presided over jellies and sauces  while mrs   roberts sugared and creamed and poured cups of such coffee as those  fellows had never even  smelled  before  if you think they were  embarrassed to the degree that they could not eat  you are mistaken     they were street boys  their lives had been spent in a hardening  atmosphere  directly the first sense of novelty passed away  and their  poorly fed stomachs craved the unusual fare served up for them  the  fellows grinned at one another  seized their silver spoons  and dived  into the stews in a fashion that would have horrified every servant in  the house     how they ate  oysters and coffee and pickles and cakes and jellies   there seemed no limit to their capacities  neither did they make the  slightest attempt to correct their table manners  none of them paid any  outward attention to their  sheets   although alfred and gracie spread  theirs with elaborate care  they leaned their elbows on the table  they  made loud  swooping sounds with their lips  and  in short  transgressed  every law known to civilized life  why not     what did they know about civilized life     nevertheless  not one movement of young ried escaped the notice of some  of them     he tried still to carry on a conversation  though the business of  eating was being too closely attended to on all sides to let him be very  successful     gracie studied  him   and was not only interested in his efforts  but  roused to make some attempts herself  what could she talk about with  such people  school  the literary club  the last concert  the course  of lectures  the last new book that everybody was reading  no  not  everybody  assuredly not these seven     on what ground  was  she to meet them     yet talk she must and would  mr  ried should see that she at least   wanted  to help           chapter xiii      let us be fashionable        one feature of the hour was not only entirely new to the boys  but gave  them a curious feeling  the name of which they did not understand   when the last one sat back in his chair  thereby admitting himself  vanquished  mrs  roberts  looking at the young man who sat at the foot  of the table  said        will you return thanks      what did that mean  to be sure they had heard of thanking people  but  even  they  were aware that it was an unusual thing for persons to  demand thanks for themselves  they watched  behold  the young man bowed  his head  and these were the words he spoke        dear saviour  we thank thee for the joys of this evening  we pray thee  to teach us so to live that we may all meet some day in our father s  house  amen      the boys looked at one another  then looked down at their plates  their  sole experience of prayer was connected with the south end mission  to  meet it at a supper table was a revelation  did the people who lived in  grand houses  and had such wonderful things to eat  always pray at their  supper tables  this was the problem which they were turning over in  their minds     returning to the parlor  gracie went at once to the piano  she had spent  a good deal of monday  settling the question of what to play  and had  chosen the most sparkling music she could find  i am anxious to have it  recorded  that  all uncultured as they were  these boys neither talked  nor laughed during the music  but appeared at least to listen  it was  dirk colton who sat nearest to the piano  and who listened in that  indescribable way which always flatters a musician      do you like it   gracie asked  running off the final notes in a tinkle  of melody     his dark face flushed a deep red      i dunno   he said  with an awkward laugh   it s queer sounding  i don t  see how you make so many tinkles  do you make all your fingers go at  once on those black and white things       not quite  but sometimes they have to dance about in a very lively  fashion  i have to keep my wits at work  i assure you       is it hard to do       not very  nowadays  when i first commenced  the practising was horrid   i hated it       what made you do it  then       oh  the same reason which makes people do a great many things that  they don t like   she said  lightly   i wanted the results  i knew if i  worked at it steadily the time would come when i should not only enjoy  it myself  but be able to give pleasure to other people  why  don t you  ever do things that you don t particularly like      he shrugged his shoulders  and bestowed on her a very wise look      often enough   he said fiercely  and he thought of his drunken father    but then i wouldn t if i could help it       that would depend on whether you thought the thing would pay in the  end  would it not      then  without waiting for an answer  she asked  what is your business       my business   with a curiously puzzled air      yes  how do you spend your time       hunting up something to eat   he said  with a grim smile  visions of  his aimless loafing appearing before him as the only occupation he could  be said to have  it had not occurred to him to try to mislead her  but  she evidently did not understand      oh  yes   she said  seriously   so i suppose  isn t it queer how  busy men and women have to be day after day  and year after year  just  getting themselves and others something to eat  do you have other  people to help get it for  mother  for instance  and little brothers and  sisters       i ve got a mother   he said   and a sister       and that makes work easier  does it not  i always thought it would be  stupid to work all the time just for one s self  but i meant  what do  you work at in order to get the something to eat   there are so many  different ways       how do you know i work at all      dirk s voice was growing sullen  a consciousness that he would appear at  a disadvantage in admitting himself an idler in a busy world was dawning  upon him as an entirely new idea  at his question  gracie turned on her  music stool and regarded him with surprise      why  of course you work   she said   people all do      she was not acting a part  her experience among poor people was limited  to that outwardly respectable class who  however disreputable their  conduct might be on sabbath  had  nevertheless a monday occupation with  which they pretended to earn a living     dirk shrugged his shoulders again      do they   he said     her evident ignorance of the world made him good natured  she was not  trying to preach to him  he decided  a thing which dirk hated  in common  with all persons of his class     but the lull in the music had started conversation in other parts of the  room     dirk heard young ried s question        mrs  roberts  do you know of any young man looking for work  i heard of  a good situation this afternoon  oh  there are plenty of applicants  but  the gentleman is an old friend of my brother in law  and i could speak a  helpful word for somebody       i have no one in mind   mrs  roberts said  and she glanced eagerly at  the boys lounging in various attitudes in her easy chairs  only three of  them she knew made any pretence of earning their living  did alfred  mean one of them   here is a chance for you  young gentlemen   she said   lightly   who bids for a situation       what is the place      it was dirk colson who asked the question  ever since he could remember  he was supposed to have been hunting for work  but i am not sure that he  ever felt quite such a desire to find it as at that moment      it is at gray s  on ninth street  a good chance  but the one who  secures it must have a fair knowledge of figures       oh  land   said dirk  sinking lower in his easy chair   no use in  me   asking about it       are figures your weak point   mrs  roberts asked  smiling on him   i  can sympathize with you  i had to work harder over arithmetic than at  any other study  but i learned to like it  do you know i think it  should be a favorite study with you  it is so nice to conquer an  obstinate looking row of figures  and fairly oblige the right result to  appear  what did you find hardest about the study  mr  colson      the others chuckled  but dirk glowered at them fiercely      there s nothin  to laugh about as i see   he said   i didn t find  nothin  hard  because i never had no chance to try  i never went to no  school  nor had books  nor nothin   now that s the truth  and i m blamed  if i ain t going to own it       what a good thing it is that you are young   this was her animated  answer   there is a chance to make up for lost time  mr  ried  i have  such a nice idea  i heard you and dr  everett speaking of the literary  club the other night  why cannot we have a literary club of our own  a  reading circle  or something of that sort  suppose we should meet once  a week and read aloud something interesting  and have talks about it  afterwards  do you ever read aloud      if mrs  roberts in all sincerity had not been one of the most  simple hearted  and in some respects ignorant little creatures on the  face of the globe  she could never  with serious face  have addressed  such a question to nimble dick     young ried could not have done it  for he realized the folly of  supposing that nimble dick ever read anything  by just so much was mrs   roberts ahead of him  she supposed that these boys had their literature   and read it  and perhaps met somewhere on occasion and read together   this made it possible for her to ask surprising questions with honest  face      bless me   said nimble dick  startled into an upright posture   oh  no   mum  never      and even dirk colson laughed at the expression on his face      still i think you would enjoy it  after a little practice  and i can t  help fancying you would make a good reader      the boys were all laughing now  nimble dick with the rest      you re in for an awful blunder there   he said  good naturedly   i m  like black dirk  never had no chances  and didn t do nothin  worth  speakin  of with them that i had  why  bless your body  mum  i can t  even read to myself  i make the awfulest work you ever heard of spellin   out the show bills  i have to get black dirk to help me  and him and me  is a team      by this time dirk s face had lost its smile  and his fierce eyes were  flashing  but the hostess was serene      that doesn t prove anything against my statement  i was speaking of  what  could  be  not necessarily of what was  let us have a club  the  more i think of the plan the more it pleases me  i ll tell you  the word   club  doesn t quite suit me  let us be fashionable  gracie  don t you  know how fashionable it is becoming to have  evenings  set apart for  special occasions  mr  ried  you know mrs  judson s  tuesday evenings    and mrs  symond s  friday evenings   very well  let us have our  monday  evenings   in which we will do all sorts of nice things  sometimes  literary  sometimes musical  and sometimes  well  anything that we  please  what do you say  gentlemen  shall we organize  mr  ried  will  you give monday evenings to us  gracie  you are my guest  and cannot  of  course  refuse      it was a novel idea  certainly  even alfred  while trying to heartily  second her  was in doubt as to what she could hope to accomplish by it   as for the boys  not one of them promised to attend  but neither  did they refuse  mrs  roberts presently left the subject  seeming to  consider her point carried  and proposed a visit to the conservatory     i think it very doubtful whether the boy lives who does not like  flowers  there are those who seem to consider it a mark of manliness to  affect indifference to them  but these  as they grow older  become real  men  generally lay this bit of folly aside  then there are those  plenty  of them  who really do not know that they care for flowers  the boys   ushered for the first time in their lives into the full bloom of a  conservatory  were  most of them  of this latter stamp     what a scene of beauty it was  great white callas  bending their  graceful cups  great red and yellow roses  making the air rich with  their breath  vines and mosses and ferns and small flowers in almost  endless variety  alfred and gracie moved among the glories  the latter  exhausting all her superlatives in honest delight  although she had  visited the spot a dozen times that day  and alfred  who had been less  favored  was hardly less eager and responsive than she  but mrs  roberts  watched the boys     it was all very well for those two to enjoy her flowers  of course they  would  but what language would the silent  lovely things speak to her  untutored boys  they said not a word  not one of them  they made no  exclamations  they had no superlatives at command  but stephen crowley  stooped before a lovely carnation  and smelled  and  smelled   drawing  in long breaths  as though he meant to take its fragrance all away with  him  and nimble dick picked up the straying end of an ivy  and restored  it to its support again  in a way that was not to be lost sight of by  one who was looking for hearts  and dirk colson brushed back his matted  hair and stood long before a great  pure lily  and looked down into its  heart with an expression on his face that his teacher never forgot     she came over to him presently  standing beside him  saying nothing   then at last she reached forth her hand and broke the lily from its  stalk  he started  almost as if something had struck him      what did you do that for   and his voice was fierce      i want you to take this for me to your sister  the girl with beautiful  golden hair  i saw her one day  and i shall remember her hair and eyes   she will like this flower  and she will like you to bring it to her      gracie   raising her voice   gather some flowers will you  and make  into bouquets  these young gentlemen will like to carry them to some  one  there must be mothers at home who will enjoy bouquets brought by  their sons      over this gently spoken sentence nimble dick laughed a hard  derisive  laugh  it made the dark blood flow into black dirk s indignant face   even alfred ried lost self control for a moment  and flashed a glance at  him out of angry eyes  how could there be any hope of a boy who sneered  at his mother  yet you need not judge him too harshly     he thought of his mother  indeed  when he laughed  but alas  he thought  of her as drunk  and he knew her scarcely at all  save as that word  described her  how  could   mother  mean to him what it meant to alfred  ried  what it meant even to dirk colson  whose mother  weak indeed in  body and spirit  full of complaining words  oftentimes weakly bitter  words to him  yet patched his clothes so long as she could get patches  and thread  and would have washed them if she could have got soap  and  been able to bring the water  and if her only tub hadn t been in pawn   oh  yes  there are degrees in mothers     mrs  roberts  meantime  broke off blossoms with lavish hand  and made  bouquets for nimble dick and for dirk  he took the bright hued ones with  a smile  but the lily he held by itself  and still looked at it     they went away at last noisily  growing almost  if not quite  rough  towards one another  at least  and directly they were out of the door   nimble dick gave a whoop that would have chilled the blood of nervous  women  but matron and maiden looked at each other and laughed      we have kept them pent up all the evening  and that is the escape valve  being raised to avoid a general explosion   this was mrs  roberts   explanation     they were quite alone  alfred  on being invited in low tones to tarry  and talk things over  had shaken his head  and replied  significantly        thank you  no  i am one of them  and must stand on the same level       you are right   mrs  roberts said  smilingly   you must have been an  apt pupil  my friend  that dear sister taught you a great deal      he held up the bouquet which she had made for him      i am going to put it before ester s picture   he said   her work is  going on       well   said gracie   it is over  and we lived through it  and they   did  all come  i am amazed over that  and how they  did eat   i suppose  the next thing is to open all the windows and air out  flossy roberts   i m afraid you are going insane  the idea of your inviting that horde  here every monday  what a parlor you would have  and they would breed  a pestilence  they won t come  to be sure  but just imagine it if  they should  i really think mr  roberts ought to send you home for dr   mitchell to look after  well  flossy  what next       next  dear  you must pray  pray as you never have done before  for  the souls of these boys  and for the success of my  monday evenings    gracie  we are at work for immortal  souls   think of it  they  must   live forever  shall they  through all eternity  keep dropping lower and  lower  or shall they wear crowns            chapter xiv      something s happened        sallie calkins sat in a common little rocking chair and rocked  and  while she rocked she sewed  setting neat stitches in a brown coat which  was already patched and darned and was threadbare in many places  there  was a look of deep content on sallie s face  there were many reasons for  it     dr  everett had that morning pronounced mark s broken limb to be healing  rapidly  he had also reported that mark s place was to be held open for  him by his employers  at this present moment  mark  arrayed in a clean  shirt  was resting on a very white sheet  his head reposing on a real  feather pillow dressed in white and frilled  over him was carefully  spread another of those wonderful sheets  and to make the crowning  glory  a white quilt  warm and soft  tucked him in on every side  how  could sallie but rejoice  all about the room there had been changes  a  neat little table stood at the bed s side  it was covered with a white  cloth  and a china bowl set thereon with a silver spoon beside it  a  delicate goblet and china pitcher also  both carefully covered with a  napkin  did mrs  roberts know how homely sallie gloried in the thinness  of that china and the fineness of that napkin  how does it happen that  some of the very poor seem born with such aesthetic tastes  mrs  roberts  had intuitions  and was given to certain acts  concerning which she  could not give to others satisfactory explanations  therefore  she  sometimes left china where others would have judged the plainest  stoneware more prudent and sensible     a bit of bright carpet was spread at the side of the bed  a fire glowed  in the neatly brushed stove  a white muslin curtain hung at the window   and the chair in which sallie rocked and sewed was new and gayly  painted     there were other traces of mrs  roberts  you might not have noticed  them  but it seemed to sallie that her fingers had touched everywhere   yet the lady herself thought that she had done very little  she had held  her inclinations in check with severe judgment     the door opened softly  and a mass of golden hair  from out of which  peered great eyes  peeped cautiously in      alone   it said  nodding first toward the figure on the bed  and  intimating that she was aware of mark s presence  and did not mean him      yes   said sallie   come in  mark s asleep  but you won t disturb  him  he don t disturb easy  he sleeps just like a baby since the doctor  stopped that pain in his knee  there s my new chair  just try it and see  how nice it is      saying which  she got herself out of the little rocker in haste  and  pushed it toward her guest  meantime taking a plain wooden chair  also  new  and adding        did you ever hear of anybody like her before       something s happened   said mart colson  ignoring the reference to the  mysterious pronoun   her voice so full of a new and strange meaning  that had sallie been acquainted with the word she might have said it was  filled with awe     as it was  she only exclaimed   what   in an intensely interested tone      why  look here  i brought it along to show you      whereupon she produced from under her piece of torn shawl a large  broken nosed pitcher  a piece of brown paper carefully tied over the  top  she untied the bit of calico string with fingers that shook from  excitement      look in there   she exclaimed at last  triumph in her tone  reaching  forward the pitcher     sallie looked  and drew in her breath with a long  expressive  o h      there  reposing in stately beauty  lay the great white lily with its  golden bell      yes  i should think so   mart said  satisfied with the expression    did you ever see anything like that before  it ain t made of wax nor  anything else that  folks  ever made  it s alive  i felt of it  it looks  like velvet and satin and all them lovely store things  but it doesn t  feel so  it feels  alive   and it  grew   but  sallie calkins  if you  should live a hundred years  and guess all the time  you never could  guess where i got it  sallie calkins  if you ll believe it  dirk gave it  to me       dirk       yes  he did      who would have supposed mart colson s voice capable of such a triumphant  ring      you see the way of it was  last night he didn t come for his supper  at all  and that always scares me dreadful  i m expecting something to  happen  you know  father  he didn t come either  for the matter of that   he hasn t come yet  and mother  she was awful tired  and hadn t had no  dinner to speak of  and she just broke down and took on awful  mother  don t often cry  and it s good she don t  for she just goes into it with  all her might when the time comes  it wasn t about father  she s used to  him  you know  and don t expect nothing else  but dirk drives her wild  with what may happen to him  i was worried about him  too  but i was mad  at him  it seemed too awful mean in him to stay away and scare mother   at last i got her to go to bed  and she was all tuckered out  and went  to sleep      then i wrapped myself in the quilt and sat down to wait  but i got  asleep  and i dreamed i saw  her   she had wings to each side of her   and she flew over the tops of all those houses and made them turn white  like the snow looks when it is coming down before it drops into the  gutters  wasn t that queer  well  some noise woke me up  i was sitting  flat on the floor by mother  and i sat up straight all of a tremble   and there was the old stool  and the brown pitcher on it  half full of  water  and this wonderful thing stood in it looking at me  and dirk  he  stood off the other side looking at it       it s for you  and she sent it   that s what he said to me  and i  wasn t real wide awake  you know  i suppose that s what made his voice  sound so queer  and what do you think i said  i was thinking of my  dream  and says i   did she have her wings on   then dirk made a queer  noise  it was a laugh  but it sounded most like a cry   i guess so    says he  and then he turned and went off to bed  and i can t get any  more out of him  he is as snarly when i ask any questions as though he  was mad about it all  if it hadn t been for this great white thing i  might have thought this morning that it all belonged to the dream  but  dirk brought this home from somewhere  and put it in the pitcher  and  give it to me his own self  that s sure      the story closed in triumph      it is beautiful   said sallie  the brown jacket slipping to the floor   while she bent over the lily   it is beautiful  all of it  and it looks  just like her  and sounds like her  wings and all  of course she sent  it       and dirk brought it   that part of the story mart colson did not  forget     sometimes it seems to me a pity that hearts are not laid bare to the  gaze of others  what  for instance  might not this little incident have  done for dirk colson had he known how the starved heart of his sister  fed on the thought that he brought her the flower     still  on the other hand  i don t know what the effect would have been  on mart had she known what a tremendous amount of courage it had taken  to present the flower to her  a dozen times on the way home had dirk  been on the point of consigning it to the gutter   he  carry home a  flower  if it had been a loaf of bread he thought it would be more  consistent  someway he recognized a fine sarcasm in the thought that  he  who had never in his life contributed towards the necessities of the  family  should carry to that dreary home a flower  yet the fair lily did  its work well during that long walk from east fifty fifth street to the  shadow of the alley  it made dirk colson tell it fiercely that he hated  himself  that he was a brute and a loafer   a blot on the earth  and  ought not to live  why didn t he go to work  why didn t he have things  to bring home to mart every little while  as mark calkins did to sallie   hadn t he seen mark  only a few evenings before he was hurt  with a pair  of girl s shoes strung over his shoulder  and heard him whistle as he  ran  two steps at a time  up the rickety stairs  what would mart think  if he should bring her home a pair of shoes  what would she think of  his bringing her a flower  she would sneer  of course  and  in the mood  which then possessed him  dirk said angrily that she had a right to  sneer  and would be a fool not to  and yet he hated the thought of it   there was nothing in life that dirk hated more than sneers  and he had  been fed on them ever since he could remember     he was altogether unprepared for the reception which the lily received   that suggestion about wings  which seemed so apt  had brought the   queer  sound to his voice that mart had noticed  if only she had  understood  and not spoiled  next morning  the effect of her words     in the prosaic daylight  the illusion of  wings  being banished  she was  bent on knowing how dirk came into possession of the lily      who sent it  dirk  i don t believe anybody told you to give it to me   who would care about  my  having a flower  where did you get it       where do you s pose   dirk s voice was ominously gruff  it is a painful  truth that by daylight he was ashamed of his part of the transaction    i told you she sent it  it s noways likely that i d take the trouble to  make up a lie about that weed  how do i know what she wanted you to have  it for  maybe she thought it matched your looks      there was a bitter sneer in dirk s voice  yet all the time he heard the  sweet  low voice saying   that girl with the beautiful golden hair    suppose he should tell mart that  why not  let me tell you that dirk  colson would not have repeated that sentence for the world  and yet he  did not know why     mart s face burned red under his sneer      how am i to know who  she  is   she said  in bitter scorn   some of  your bar room beauties  for whom you dance and whistle  i suppose  you  can tell her i would rather have my shawl out of pawn  or some shoes for  my feet  enough sight  what do i care for a great flower mocking at me       pitch it into the fire  then  and it will be many a long day before i  bring you anything else   said dirk  pushing himself angrily back from  the table  where he had been eating bread dipped in a choice bit of pork  fat      there isn t a bit of danger of my doing that   she called after him   mockingly   there isn t a spark of fire  nor likely to be to day  unless  some of your admirers send me a shovel of coal  mercy knows  i wish they  would      he mercifully lost part of this sentence  for the reason that before it  was concluded he was moving with long  angry strides up the alley     and then mart took the broken nosed pitcher away into the furthermost  corner  although she was alone in the room  and laid her face against  the cool  pure lily  and wept into it great burning tears  poor   ignorant soul  she wanted  oh  how she  wanted  dirk to be brave and  good like mark calkins  her one type of manhood  yet she did not know  that she was crushing out the germ which might have grown in his  heart  true  she knew herself to be very different from sallie  but the  thought  poor soul  that that was because mark was so different from  dirk     isn t it a pity that the sweet faced lily could not have told its tender  story to both these ignorant ones           chapter xv      what made her different         i have heard a good deal about your sister that has interested me  do  you like to talk of her      this was the question which gracie dennis asked of young ried as he  stood beside her at the piano  she had been playing  and had come to  the music alcove for the purpose of turning her music  but now she was  touching sweet chords here and there aimlessly  and waiting for his  answer     at the further end of the parlor mrs  roberts was entertaining a caller   but the distance between them was so great that  in effect  the young  people were alone      i like nothing better than to talk of her   mr  ried said  with  animation   but i don t know so much about her as i wish i did  she went  away when i was quite young  i used to say  she died   but since i have  awakened to see her cherished plans being carried on all around me i  cannot think of her as dead       that is what i want to talk about   her work  or her plans for work   what made her so different from other people  mr  ried   wasn t  she  different      the young man regarded the question thoughtfully before answering      not from all the people   he said at last   but certainly very  different from some  i used to think that all christians were like her   of course  then  when i saw my mistake  i went to the other extreme  and  thought there were none like her on earth  i have discovered that the  medium position is the correct one       but what i want to know is  what  made  her different  it wasn t her  age  mrs  roberts thinks she was young       she was hardly nineteen when she died  oh  no  it wasn t age  she  told me that she used to be very different  she was a christian from  childhood  but she said that she was ashamed to claim the name  there  was nothing christlike about her  still she was a member of the church   as i remember her  and as i look at other people  my judgment is that   in her early christian life  she was much like most of the christians  with whom you and i are familiar       and what made her different  was it  that is  do you think it was  because she was to die so soon that she had a special experience       not at all   he said  promptly   it was before she realized anything  about her condition that the great change took place in her  my  brother in law says that she supposed herself to be in perfect health at  the time when she was most marked in her christian life       ah  but you don t understand  i mean more than that  it is difficult to  tell what i mean  i mean  but you know  of course   god  knew that she  was soon to go to heaven  i thought  perhaps  he gave her a special  experience on that account       no  oh  no   he said  speaking with great earnestness   ester  was particularly anxious that no one should suppose her experience  exceptional  little fellow though i was  it seemed to be her desire that  i should fully understand this  don t let anybody make you think that  because you are a little boy you must be a sort of half way christian    she used to say  and her eyes would glow with feeling   i tried that way  for years   she said   and i want you to understand that it is not only  sinful  but there is not a particle of happiness to be gotten out of  it  not a particle  and i would give almost nothing for what such a  christian can accomplish  the harm one does  more than overbalances all  effort for christ   i think  perhaps  she felt more deeply on that than  on almost any subject  and it was because she thought she had wasted so  many years       then do you think that there is  or rather that there should be  no  difference in christians  have all the same work to do       not that  quite  of course   or  i don t know  either  isn t it all  different forms of the master s work  the children of the home may  have each a different task  but each is needed to make the home what  it should be  and each worker needs the same spirit of love and  unselfishness to enable him to do his part  it isn t a perfect  illustration  miss dennis  i m not skillful in that direction  but  i   know what i mean  and that is a comfort       and i know what you mean   gracie said  not joining in his laugh   but  i am not sure that i believe it  why  mr  ried  that would make a very  solemn thing of living       well  did you suppose it was other than solemn  i m sure it makes a  triumphant thing of it  too  and without it we are only a lot of wax  figures  dancing to pass the time away       but don t you really think that people have a right to have  any  nice  times       miss dennis  did you ever see any person who had nicer times than your  friend  mrs  roberts       well  flossy is peculiar  her tastes all seem to lie in this direction   though once they did not  i admit  papa used to think that she had  no talent for anything but dancing  something changed flossy s entire  character  no one who knew her two years ago could possibly deny that       she will serve as an illustration  then  to explain my meaning  i  believe  miss dennis  that religion should have sufficient power over  us to change all our tastes and plans in life  fitting them to the  saviour s use       but what would such a rule as that do with most of the christians of  your acquaintance       ah  i am old and experienced enough to warn you not to make shipwreck  of your happiness on that shoal  i hovered around it  and vexed my soul  over the whole bewildering question until i suddenly discovered that i  was held absolutely responsible only for my own soul  and that the lord  would look after his own      for a time there was no answer to this     gracie let her fingers wander with apparent aimlessness over the keys   drawing out soft  sweet strains  suddenly she said        what do you expect flossy will accomplish with that last scheme of  hers  i ought to beg her pardon for the familiar name  but i have known  her ever since i was a child  don t you think her attempts for those  boys rather hopeless      instantly the young man s eyes filled with tears  and when he spoke his  voice indicated deep emotion      i can hardly tell you how i feel about those boys  i have been anxious  for them so long and felt so hopeless  do you remember how elijah sat  under a juniper tree  discouraged  and said that he was the only one who  had not bowed the knee to baal  and the lord told him he was  mistaken  that there were five thousand others  it sounds ridiculously  egotistical  but i have felt at times something like that  as though i  was the only one who cared whether the poor fellows went to destruction  or not  but since i have met mrs  roberts  and seen how intense she is  and single hearted  and since through her i have met dr  everett  and  seen how they are trying to work at the same problem  and since i have  come to know how mr  roberts is at work all the time for young men  and   above all  since that wonderful evening here last monday  when i saw how  two gifted ladies understood the art of turning their accomplishments  to account  in order to take those poor fellows captive for christ  i  discovered that there were ways of solving this problem about which  i had known nothing  and people to carry it through  it was simply  glorious in you to give those fellows such music as you did  and to  accomplish by it what you did  my life has been narrow  miss dennis  i  never saw the piano used for christ before      gracie looked down at the keys  her face aglow  it was a new experience   this being classed among the christian workers of the world  making her  music for other purposes than to amuse the gay friends who chanced to  gather around her  she made the keys speak loudly for a few minutes   then softening them  said        you must not class me with flossy  mr  ried  i only did what she wanted  done  i am not in the least like her  unselfish and gentle and all  that      but his reply  spoken low  was pleasant to her ears         by their fruits ye shall know them       he evidently looked upon her as a worker  she could not help feeling  that it was pleasant to be so classed  what an intense young man he  was  not in the least like those with whom she had hitherto been most  familiar     there was another voice in the front parlor  a strong  vigorous voice  that carried a sense of power with it      ah   said ried  his eyes bright  his face eager   that is dr  everett   just study him if you want another type of the sort of christian about  whom we have been talking  the grandest man      gracie  shielded by the distance  turned on her stool and studied him   certainly he did not look much as though he were appointed for early  death  what a splendid physique it was     and how thoroughly wide awake and interested he was in the subject under  discussion  bits of the talk floated back to the two at the piano      oh  he is young   dr  everett was saying   i hope for returned vigor in  time  but there must be long weeks of patience before he will be ready  for his old employment       do you know of whom he is speaking   gracie asked      i fancy it is that calkins boy  the one with the broken limb  he is  deeply interested in the poor fellow  and is trying to plan employment  of some less wearing sort for him  i believe  dr  everett is always  intensely interested in somebody       is it always the very poor      alfred laughed      not always  i know several quite well to do fellows in whom he keeps  a careful oversight  but he is grandly interested in the poor  he is  taking rank as one of the most successful physicians in the city  and   of course  he is pressed for time  yet he is so continually at the call  of the poor that people begin to speak of him as the poor man s doctor   he told me he was proud of that title      at this point the musicians were appealed to to come to the front  parlor  and gracie had opportunity for a nearer study of the man whom  she could not help but admire  he was not likely to suffer from a nearer  view  at least  not while gracie was in the mood that then possessed  her  he greeted her cordially  and at once brought her into the  conversation by appealing to her for a decision  seeming to take it for  granted that she was of the same spirit with himself     this young lady was taking lessons of life that were designed to be  helpful to her if she would but let them  a thoroughly well educated and  cultured gentleman  well fitted to take high rank in society  not in the  ministry  and yet thoroughly absorbed in what she had hitherto almost  unconsciously set down as ministers  work was a mystery to her   moreover  for the second time that evening  she felt a curious sense of  satisfaction in being classed among the energetic workers of the  world  the pretty school girl  who had lived all her young life in a  neighborhood where she was  gracie dennis   looked up to  indeed  by  her set  and having a decided influence of her own  yet felt it to be a  novel experience to hear herself addressed in a clear  firm voice after  this manner        miss dennis  what means would you advise for interesting a company of  young girls in reading  regularly  books which would be of use to them   of course  i speak of a class of girls who have done no reading of any  account heretofore  and who have no knowledge in the matter       it is something about which i have not thought at all   said gracie   her pretty face all in a flush   but i should suppose the way would be  to take one girl at a time  and study her  to find what would be likely  to interest and help  her   and also to get such an influence over her  that she would read what i wanted her to       first catch your hare  eh  good   said the doctor  with an approving  glance towards mrs  roberts   the longer i live the more convinced am  i that individual effort is what accomplishes the great things in this  world      there was more talk about this and kindred matters  and gracie found  herself drawn out  and her interest excited on themes about which she  had supposed she knew nothing     then occurred an interruption   a ringing of the door bell      for miss dennis   said the messenger  but she handed the card to mrs   roberts     there was just a moment of hesitation  while that lady apparently  studied the name  then she said  composedly        this is professor ellis  gracie  do you wish to receive him this  evening      since i have known mrs  roberts well  i have studied her innocently  sincere manner  with not a little curiosity as to the probable effect on  the world  suppose it were possible for others to adopt her method  the  actual practical effect with her is that she succeeds often in wisely  deceiving  while intending to be perfectly sincere  for instance  her  question to gracie after a moment of hesitation  during which she asked  herself   what ought i to do   and immediately answered herself   there  is nothing for me to do  but to be perfectly straight forward      her question was intended to say to gracie   i trust you  what your  father has directed you to do  i feel sure you will obey   but it said  different things from that to gracie  ever since she had been told that  she might make her old acquaintance  flossy  a visit  this highly strung  young lady had been suspicious that this was a device of her stepmother  to get pleasantly rid of her for a few weeks  she surmised that a very  carefully elaborate account of her sins had been written out by this  same stepmother for the benefit of her young hostess  and that special  directions had been given for guarding her from the wolf  professor  ellis  she would have spoiled the entire scheme by haughtily refusing to  leave home had not the innocent delight of a young girl over the thought  of visiting a beautiful strange city gotten the better of her pride  the  gently put question of her hostess disarmed a whole nest of suspicions   it was hardly possible that it had been hinted to flossy that her guest  might attempt to elope with this man  else she would not with serene  face be asking whether it was her wish to receive him      if you please   she made haste to answer  her cheeks glowing the while   and mrs  roberts gave instant direction that the gentleman be shown to  the parlor     there were several new lessons set for miss gracie dennis to learn that  evening  one was that professor ellis  with his faultless dress and  excessive politeness  his finished bows and smiles  that would have done  credit to any ball room in the land  his accurate knowledge of all the  printed rules of etiquette  yet in mrs  roberts  parlor  contrasted with  dr  everett  and even with young ried  the dry goods clerk  appeared at  a disadvantage     she was slow in learning the lesson  on that first evening she simply  stared at it in bewilderment  what did it mean  there was an attempt to  draw the professor into the circle  to continue the conversation that  had been so animated and interesting before his entrance  the effect  was much like that produced in striking a discordant note in a hitherto  faultless piece of music  young men out of business needing help   needing an encouraging word  an out stretched hand  professor ellis had  words  and hands  but he might have been without either for all the help  they gave him in responding to efforts like these  books to help uplift  the young  to give them high ideas of life  to enthuse them with  desires to live for a purpose  truly he could only stare blankly at the  suggestion  what did he know of books written for such purposes  yet  gracie had supposed him to be literary in his tastes and pursuits   certainly he read french  yes  french novels  he was quite familiar with  some of such a character that  had gracie been a good french scholar and  ever likely to come in contact with a copy of them  he would not have  dared to mention their names in her presence  more than once of late had  the stepmother wished that her young daughter understood the language  well enough to be aware that the man whom she admired used frequently  smooth sounding french oaths  but alas for gracie  when he had so  poisoned her mother s influence over this dangerously pretty girl  that  she would have believed his word at any time rather than that mother s   well  he read other than french novels  charles reade  for instance  and  some of the more recent authors fashionable in certain circles  it is  true that gracie was not acquainted with them  that her father would not  allow a copy of their books to come freely into his home  and gracie  was much too honorable to read them in private  but it is also true that  while professing to admire this trait in her  as charming in a young  daughter  the professor had also  pityingly and gently  told this young  daughter that these things were her father s concessions to the narrow  age and trammelled profession to which he belonged  that the fact was   free thought was discouraged  because there was that in every church  which would not bear its light  that her wise father was one of a  hundred in recognizing this  and trying to shield her while she was  young     you are also to remember that she  was  young  and therefore forgive her  that she did not detect the contradictory sophistry in the professor s  words  he really understood how to sugar coat poison as well as any man  of his stamp could           chapter xvi      here was his opportunity        but the question which would keep forcing itself on gracie dennis was  this   if he really knows of nice books  full of  the beautiful  and   the ennobling   that would enlighten the race  as he has often told  me  why doesn t he mention some of them now  there is no minister here   trammelled by long years of narrowing education   how does he know but  that these people are as  advanced  in their ideas as he is himself      i do not mean that she was conscious of thinking these thoughts  but  that they hovered on the edge  as it were  of her mind  making her  feel ill at ease  dr  everett  on his part  seemed courteously bent on  securing an expression of the professor s opinion about matters of which  he either could not  or would not  talk  when at last the disturbed  gentleman resolved to violate what gracie was sure was a law of good  breeding  and address her in french  what with her embarrassment lest  others should understand  and her own marked ignorance of the language   she found great difficulty in making a free translation   upon my word   i wish you understood french  or some other tongue  so that we could  escape from this boredom  does the poor little prisoner have much of  this to endure  cannot we escape to the music room  and talk things  over      gracie cast a frightened glance about her to see if there were others  who understood better than herself this sentence  which  for aught she  knew  might contain something startling  but alfred was busily engaged  in looking up the name of a book which he had vainly tried to recall   and dr  everett was apparently serenely oblivious to any language but  his mother tongue  very soon after this gracie managed to escape  with her caller to the music alcove  thus much of the french she had  understood  and at least professor ellis could play  which fact she  resolved that the people in the front parlor should speedily understand   ah  but he could play  and herein lay one of his strong fascinations  for the music loving girl  for a time the most ravishing strains rolled  through the parlor hushing into rapt attention the group gathered there   who had just been reinforced by the coming of mr  roberts  by degrees  the strains grew fainter and fainter  and at last ceased altogether  as  the professor  still on the music stool  bent over gracie  seated in a  low chair  and apparently found fluent speech at last     mrs  roberts  meantime  was ill at ease  what would dr  dennis and  marion say  could they have a peep at this moment into her back parlor   was she being faithful to her trust  yet what was there she could do   she tried to sustain her part in the conversation  but her troubled  gaze  constantly wandering elsewhere  betrayed her  dr  everett s keen  eyes were upon her      are you particularly interested in that man   he asked  abruptly     mrs  roberts smiled faintly      i am particularly interested in that girl   she said      how do you like her present companionship       not at all   she answered  quickly     whereupon mr  roberts began to question      may i know  doctor  whether you have any other reason than that of  intuition for asking the question       possibly not   said the doctor  guardedly   it maybe a case of mistaken  identity  mrs  roberts  would you like to have me investigate something  that may be to his disadvantage      mrs  roberts had a prompt answer ready        there are reasons why it is specially important that such an  investigation should be made and reported to me  may i commission you      the doctor bowed  and the subject of professor ellis was immediately  dropped     during the following week certain innovations took place in mrs  roberts  well ordered household  at the end of the conservatory was a long   bright  and hitherto unfurnished room  it had been designed as a sort  of second conservatory  whenever the beauties of that department should  outgrow their present bounds  but meantime other plants had taken root  and blossomed in the mistress  heart  early in this week the unused room  had been opened and cleaned  then began to arrive packages of various  shapes and sizes  a roll of carpeting  and two young men from the  carpet store  and there followed soon after the sound of hammering   furniture wagons halted before the door  leaving their burdens  men and  women flitted to and fro  busy and important     it was saturday night before mr  roberts and his young clerk were  invited in to admire and criticise the new room  mr  roberts  at least   was prepared to appreciate its transformation     the floor was covered with a heavy carpet in lovely shades of mossy  green  and easy chairs and couches in tints that either matched or made  delightful contrasts with the carpet abounded  the walls were hung with  pictures and charts and maps  a study table occupied the centre of  the room  one of those charming tables  full of mysterious drawers  and unexpected corners  paper and pens and inks in various colors were  disposed about this table in delightful profusion     other tables  plenty of them  small and neat  each of a different shape  or design  were stationed at intervals  in convenient proximity to  comfortable chairs  nothing could be further removed from one s idea of  a school room than was that long  beautiful parlor  yet when you thought  of it  and took a second  deliberate survey  nothing that could have  contributed to the enjoyment of pupils was missing  a small cabinet  organ occupied an alcove  and music books of various grades were strewn  over it  toward this spot mrs  roberts smiled significantly as her eye  caught alfred ried s  and she said        i have visions of sacred sabbath evening half hours  connected with  this corner  one of these days  meantime  is this a pleasant room for  our monday evenings      but alfred could not answer her  his head was turned away  and there  was a suspicious lump in his throat  that made him know better than  to attempt speech  he was standing at that moment under one of the  wall texts that the gaslight illumined until it glowed  and the words  stood out with startling clearness        let us not sleep as do others  but let us watch and be sober      his sister s text  one that  perhaps more than any other  was on her  lips when she talked with him  one that hung at her coffin s head when  he  a little boy  stood beside the coffin and looked down at her face   and looked up at that text  and took a mental photograph of both to live  in his heart forever      this is your special chair   mrs  roberts said  smiling up at him  and  he understood her   here was his opportunity to live out that text for  his sister  wouldn t he try      well   said gracie  drawing a long breath   as a study it is certainly  a success  one can easily see  flossy  why you were born with the  ability to tell at a glance what colors harmonized  and just where  things fitted in  i can t imagine anything prettier than this  and i  cannot imagine what you are going to do with it      whereupon they sat down to talk that important question over  what they  were going to try to do  sometimes i have wondered whether ester  from  her beautiful home  could look down on it all  and whether she smiled  over the fact that her work was doing so much more than she had planned   she had roused in her little brother an ambition that had grown with his  years  and that had helped to hold him away from many temptations  so  much  doubtless  she had foreseen  but what a blessed thing it was that  she had touched  in those long ago years  influences which had drawn her  brother  in his young and perilous manhood  into intimate relations with  such people as mr  and mrs  roberts  so that they sat down familiarly to  talk over mutual interests  but for ester s words  spoken long ago  but  for her strong desires transmitted to him  he might have sat with a very  different circle  and talked over widely different schemes  on the edge  of this circle gracie dennis hovered  she could not but be interested in  their talk  for she was a christian  and her father was a christian  and  she had  all her life breathed in the atmosphere of a christian home     at the same time she could but imagine some of their ideas wild ones   for she had never been associated with people who widely overstepped the  conventional ways of doing things  and she had  of late  been much with  professor ellis who had a sort of gentlemanly sneer for every phase of  christian work  and  so far as could be discovered  believed in nothing   he had not been outspoken  it is true  and herein lay one of the  dangers  he was too skillful to be outspoken  but the subtle poison had  been working  and although gracie could not help being interested in  those queer boys  she could not help thinking flossy s whole scheme  exceedingly visionary  and expected it to come to grief  the puzzling  question was  why did mr  roberts  being a keen sighted man  permit it  all  or was he so much in love with flossy that he could not bear to  thwart even her wildest flights  it was strange  too  to see a young man  like alfred ried so absorbed  his sister must have had wonderful power  over him  gracie thought  she went back to his sister s influence   always  in trying to explain the matter  and never gave a thought to  christ s influence  meantime she listened to the various plans proposed  for the first monday evening  and was sufficiently interested to gather  her pretty face in a frown when the distant peal from the door bell  sounded through the house      what a pity to be interrupted by a caller   she exclaimed   this room  is so much nicer than the parlor  flossy  don t you hope it is some one  to see mr  roberts on business       no   said mrs  roberts  shaking her head  with a smile   i feel in  special need of mr  roberts just now  evan  i really think we must be  excused to callers for this one evening  there are so many things to  arrange       let us wait and see   answered mr  roberts  perhaps the lord sent the  caller here to help us  or to be helped      at that moment came the card      oh  it is dr  everett   was mrs  roberts  exclamation   let us have him  come directly here  evan  please go and escort him  you were right   the  lord has sent him to help us  i don t know how  i m sure  but he is just  the man to help everywhere      and the circle instantly widened itself to receive dr  everett     it took almost no time to speak the commonplace of the occasion  and  get back at once to the business of the hour  it was evident that dr   everett needed no lengthy explanations  and there was apparently nothing  bewildering to his mind in the plan  true  it was new to him  but he  seemed to spring at once to the centre of their thoughts  his eyes  glowed for a moment  and he said with peculiar emphasis        ried  when the son of man cometh  he will surely find  some  faith on  the earth      then he gave himself to intensest listening and questioning  and  presently followed his questions with suggestions which showed that  unconventional ways of working were not altogether new to him     as for gracie  she had as much as she could do to listen intelligently   she almost caught her breath over the rapidity with which the talkers  moved from one scheme to another  all the time there was a curious  process of comparison between this man and professor ellis going on in  her mind  not that she wished to compare the two  she told herself that  it was absurd to do so  none the less she did it  for instance   she reminded herself that she had mentally assented promptly to the  suggestion of inviting the doctor to this room to talk this strange  scheme over  she had recognized the fitness of the act  but suppose  professor ellis should call  would it not be simply absurd to think of  explaining to him the uses of this unique room  who would for a moment  think of suggesting his name as a helper                                                 i do not know how to describe to you the appearance of that room on  monday evening when the boys were in it  i do not know whether the sight  to you would have been pitiful or ludicrous  how can i tell  not knowing  you  there was a dreadful incongruity between the soiled  ragged clothes  and matted hair and unwashed hands and the exquisite purity which  prevailed around them  of course you could have seen that  but the  all important question  the answer to which would have stamped your  place in the world s workshop  would have been  do you see any further  than that  and seeing further  which way  do you see the possibilities   or the certainties of failure  oh  no  i am wrong  it would take more  than that to tell where you belong  dr  everett saw the possibilities  and gloried in them  gracie dennis thought she saw the certainty of  failure  and was sorry for it  but professor ellis would have seen the  certainty of failure  and would have met it with a sneer  if he had not  been too indifferent even for that  as for mrs  roberts  did she  or did  she not  represent a different and higher type than any of the others   she thought not much about either success or failure  but pushed  steadily forward the plan that she believed she had gotten on her knees   born of the spirit  if it really were of god  nothing could make it  fail  but if she mistook  and the plan was only hers  mere failure in  that direction would signify nothing  she would have but to try again   something of this she felt  but did not reason out  for she was no  logician     what the boys saw was a great  splendid room  the like of which they had  never seen before  for they recognized  without being able to explain   the difference between it and the parlors  and felt freer in it  they  all came  and they looked not one whit better than on the monday evening  before  over this fact gracie dennis  with all her public scoffing  was   in private  a little disappointed  it is true she had not expected to  see them again  but if they came  she thought it possible that they  might have been tempted to appear with clean hands and faces  possibly  some were so tempted  and but for the difficulties in the way  might  really have tried for this  but gracie was not sufficiently enlightened  to dream of difficulties in the way of simply washing one s face and  hands     during the saturday evening conference it had been decided that mr   roberts must make acquaintance with his guests  it would never do to  have them come familiarly to his house  and he not be able to recognize  them on the streets  several plans were suggested for introducing him  skilfully to them  but he disapproved of them all      no   he said   i ll tell you what we ll do  i will introduce myself   you may receive them  flossy  and then retire for a few minutes   and i ll let myself in by the conservatory passage  and make myself  acquainted to the best of my abilities  in ten minutes  flossy  i ll  give you leave to return  as for the rest of you  don t dare to venture  in until i have made good my claim as the head of the house  i am  jealous of you  perhaps      to this plan mrs  roberts readily assented  but the young clerk  looked doubtful  in common with the rest of his employees  he stood in  wholesome awe of the keen eyed  thorough business man  who seemed to  know  as by a sort of instinct  when anything in any department of  the great store was not moving according to rule  his knowledge of mr   roberts  outside of the store  was limited  and he expected to find the  boys  if not frightened  so awed that they would resolve never to be  caught inside that room again     however  he of course only looked his fears  he was too much afraid of  the great merchant to express them  and it had been understood  when  they separated  that this plan was to be carried out           chapter xvii      i wonder what they re all after        in the library waited gracie and mr  ried  while mrs  roberts went  merrily to see whether the boys or their host had proved the stronger      i don t believe this part of the programme will work   alfred said   confidently  the moment the door closed after mrs  roberts   those  fellows will all be afraid of mr  roberts  and we shall lose what little  hold we have on them       they don t look to me as though it ever occurred to them to be afraid  of anything   gracie said  but alfred ried  who had studied deeper into  this problem of the different classes of society  was ready with his  answer      yes they are  they can be awed  and made to feel uncomfortable to the  degree that they will resolve not to appear in that region again   one cannot judge from their behavior in sabbath school  some way they  recognize a mission school as being in a sense their property  and  behave accordingly  but in a man s own house  surrounded by things of  which they do not even know the name  he has them at a disadvantage  and  can easily rouse within them the feeling that they are  trapped   than  which there is nothing those fellows dread so much  i believe       but they were not afraid of flossy last week  even surrounded by the  elegances of her parlors and dining room       ah   he said  his eyes alight   she has a wisdom born of god  i think   for managing these and all other concerns  she is unlike everybody  else      whereupon gracie dennis laughed  not a disagreeable laugh  but there  came to her just then a sense of the strangeness of thinking that pretty  flossy shipley  whom she had known all her life  and half scorned from  the heights of her childhood because she was a silly little thing  who  could not do her problems in class  should have a wisdom unlike any  others  yet  almost immediately her laugh was stayed  because the change  in flossy was so great that she  too  recognized it as born of god   sometimes it came with force to this proud young girl that if god could  do so much for flossy  what might he not be willing to do with those  whom he had made intellectually her superior  if they were but ready to  be led     the young man  who was studying her  watched the grave look deepen on  her face  and wondered at its source  what a pretty face it was  oh   much more than pretty  there was great strength in it and sweetness   too  of a certain sort  but he could not help comparing the sort with  that in some other faces  and he wondered over the difference  this  young lady was a christian  why should her christian experience stamp  her with such a different expression from that which others wore  he  always finished this sort of sentence with a blank space first  as  though he did not choose to have himself tell himself any names  yet he  spoke a name forcibly enough  still gazing earnestly at gracie      did you ever meet miss joy saunders      gracie turned toward him a laughing face      no  but we are very anxious to  flossy and i  we have both been told  that we ought to know her  and told so earnestly that we really think we  ought  who is she  is she  too  unlike anybody else       very   he said  promptly   i know her very little  she is the daughter  of our landlady  i meet her in the hall on rare occasions  and sometimes  catch glimpses of her just vanishing from some room as i enter  but as  for being acquainted with her  i suppose i am not  i think  though of  that i am by no means sure  that she is engaged to dr  everett      oh  then  of course he would think naturally that people ought to know  her  what is she like       like nothing   said alfred  with great promptness   did you ever know a  person named joy       no   what a singular name       well  it fits  she is very far removed from mirth  and she is not  what people call gay  and she is not outspoken apparently at any time   though  as i say  i do not know her  but there is something in her face  that fits the name  i do not know what it is  sometimes i think it is  the shining of christ s face reflected in her  but the puzzle is  why do  not other faces have it  faces which belong to him       perhaps there is a difference in the degree of belonging      gracie spoke the words very gently  wondering meanwhile at the way in  which this thought chimed in with hers about flossy      oh  there is  but why should there be  if i belong to christ  i   belong   don t i  there is no half way service possible  why do i not  so look that others take knowledge of me that i have been with jesus       how do you know but they do       ah  i know  i know too well  they are more likely a great deal to take  knowledge that i have been with satan  i feel the frown all over my face  a great deal of the time  and the world goes astray a great many times   when i suppose it is just myself that is wrong  but  miss dennis  i  hunger for the shining of his face in me       that must be the meaning of the beatitude which puzzled my childhood    she answered trying to speak lightly  to hide feelings that were deeply  moved   blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness   for they shall be filled       thank you   he said  smiling   there is actually a promise  i had  not thought of it  and yet   the thoughtful frown gathering almost  immediately   do you suppose that a person who really hungered for a  certain thing could be satisfied with anything else  i often have an  hour of what at the moment seems to me like hunger for him  but the hour  passes  and i get filled  with business  or with plans  or possibly with  annoyances  and feel nothing but a general irritation for everybody  do  you think there can be anything genuine about such desires  so easily  turned aside       oh  i do not know   said gracie  hastily   why do you ask me such  things  did not i tell you i was not good  ask those people who are  unlike all others  why don t you ask this joy  she could tell you  i  presume  i can tell you nothing  save that this is a very strange world   not half so nice as i once thought it  and i don t like to think about  things      how  different  he was from other young men with whom she had spent  fifteen minutes many a time in gay banter  this was  after all  the  thought uppermost in her mind at the moment  nice christian men  of whom  her father spoke well  and who  people said  were young men to be proud  of  it seemed to her that she knew them by the dozens  yet with which  one of them had she ever carried on such a conversation as this  with  which one could she have attempted any thing of the kind  without  leading him to suppose that she was taking leave of her senses     she recalled some of the gay words that she had spoken with these  others  and tried  hurriedly  to decide why it would sound to her  perfectly absurd to talk with alfred ried in that way  however  she  did not want to talk with him  he was too full of questionings   and  questions   said poor gracie   are all that i can ask myself  i want  somebody to talk with who is assured of the ground on which he stands   and can tell me why he stands there      there was not time for further talk  they were summoned to the new room   bursts of laughter greeted their ears as they made their way eagerly  across the hall  and gracie took time to remark that the boys were  certainly not awed into silence  before the opening door let them into  the brightly lighted scene  every boy was laughing  not quietly  but  immoderately  and the centre of attraction was evidently mr  roberts      i have been giving our friends an account of an old army experience    he said  in explanation to gracie   and we have been enjoying a laugh  together over the old memory  you are all acquainted with miss dennis  i  think  young gentlemen      clearly there was no need for any one to introduce mr  roberts to the  boys  apparently they knew him now better than they did any of the  others  yet as gracie  after shaking hands with each of the guests   took a vacant seat by nimble dick  she was greeted with a confidential  whisper        that s a jolly chap as ever i saw  and i never heard anything to beat  the yarn he told us  for cuteness  who is he       why  he is mr  evan roberts  the owner of this house       my eyes   said dick  gazing about him in a startled way   look here  he  ain t that roberts from the big store on fourth street       yes  he is  he is one of the partners in that store      then did nimble dick give a low whistle   suddenly cut short  as the  other boys looked at him   and sat up straight in his chair  and for at  least a minute was awed  or else was bewildered  if his mind could have  been looked into for a moment something like this might have been seen  there   and here i am sittin  in one of his chairs  and been laughin  to  kill over his funny story  if this ain t the greatest lark out  i wonder  what they re all after  anyhow      then the real business of the evening commenced     i should like to describe that evening  but it is really worse to  describe than the boys  it was designed to be one of those most  difficult evenings  where every act and almost every word has been  previously arranged  but arranged in such a manner as to appear like an  impromptu effort  the result of merely the happenings of the hour     for instance  mrs  roberts aimed at nothing less formidable than the  teaching of these boys to read and write  and know as well as ever i  know it  that to frankly own that she was ready and willing to give her  time and patience in so teaching them would be to outwit herself  they  did not belong to the class who can be beguiled into evening schools   there are such  mark calkins would have seized such an opportunity  and rejoiced over it  but these were lower in the scale  they did  not realize their need  and they had what they in ignorance called   independence   they were not to be  trapped  by evening schools   therefore it required diplomacy  and no people can be more diplomatic   on occasion  than certain most innocent looking little women  mrs   roberts had studied her way step by step     therefore it was  that by the most natural passage possible  she led the  way to a discussion of different styles of writing  bringing forth to  aid her a certain old autograph album which had been to many places  of note  among others chautauqua  and had the names of distinguished  persons  as well as of many who were not distinguished  except for  christian endurance in consenting to write in an autograph album  good  writers were talked about and selected  and poor writers were talked  about  and it was said by some one  accidentally of course  that a good  hand was really an accomplishment      it is more than that   declared mr  roberts   a man s business life  often turns on it  i have myself had to turn away from several otherwise  suitable helpers in our business because they really could not write a  good  clear hand  that could be read without studying       are you a good writer  miss gracie      this remark  coming suddenly to gracie from her host  almost embarrassed  her  for you are not to suppose that the very words by which these  themes should be introduced had been planned  and it had not occurred to  gracie that so personal a question might be asked her  but she rallied  quickly      no  sir  i am sorry to say that i am not  i write what papa calls a  mincing hand  all jumbled up together  you know  or running into each  other  the letters are  and so difficult to read that papa said when i  came away he hoped i would call on his friend  dr  stuart  every day   and write a letter on his type writer       what is that   interrupted nimble dick  his face curious      what  a type writer  oh  it is a strange little machine used instead of  the pen  at least  a very few people use it  it is quite new  i think   and must be very curious  i never saw one  but the writing looks just  like print  dr  stuart  a pastor in the city  is my papa s friend  and  writes to him on his  and papa reads the letter with great satisfaction   saying to me   there  daughter  that is something like  people who  cannot write well enough for others to read should print        they are not so very uncommon  miss dennis   explained dr  everett   who saw the eagerness on nimble dick s face   it is a comparatively new  invention  but is being caught up very promptly  i think nearly all  the leading lawyers use them  and those who do not own them are  getting their copying done at the rooms  they are very ingenious little  instruments       did you say you never saw one      this question from mr  roberts to gracie  and he added        mrs  roberts  i believe you have never had other than the first glimpse  i showed you in the parker building  i have an idea  suppose i rent one  of the little fellows to interest us  it would be pleasant to look into  it and see how it works  did none of you ever see one  well  now  we ll  try for that on next monday evening  i ll have one sent up to morrow   and  miss gracie  we ll appoint you showman for the following monday  so  it is to be hoped that you will employ your leisure in learning how to  manage the creature  and perhaps send your father a readable letter at  the same time      now  as may readily be supposed  all this about machinery had not been  arranged for beforehand  but was a side issue  born of the fact that the  watchful servant of his master saw an eager look in the eyes of the boy  dick directly there was anything said that suggested machinery  one  of the great aims of these evenings was to study character  however  developed     having turned his company from the regular channel  mr  roberts made  haste to put them skilfully back where they were before        still  it would be a pity to resort to machinery simply because one did  not know how to write well  i would rather set to work to correct the  error  i happen to know one of our number who can write a very enviable  hand  do you know  ried  that the letter you wrote me was the first  thing which attracted me to you  i remember i showed the note to one of  our senior partners  who was particularly disturbed by poor writing  and  he said   engage him  roberts  do  a young man who can write like that  will be a relief   mrs  roberts  i move you that we resolve ourselves at  this moment into a writing class  to be taught by mr  ried  my dear sir   will you take us in hand      something of this kind had been planned  at least  it had been planned  that ried should be asked to do this thing  but he found the actual  asking embarrassing  and struggled with it with flushing cheeks  gracie  came to his aid        i don t know whether i ll take lessons or not  who wants to expose  one s ignorance  will you teach  must we each give a specimen of our  present attainments      instantly ried divined the reason for the question      no   he said  eagerly   oh  no  i should begin with those horrors of  your childhood  pothooks or something of that sort  lines and curves   you know  there are not many of them after all in our letters  and when  once a person has conquered them it is easy to put them together      there was more talk  easy and social  mr  and mrs  roberts  the doctor   and gracie seemed equally interested in the project  and questioned  young ried  until he assured them that he began to feel like a veritable  professor  apparently the boys were forgotten  this very fact put them  at their ease  and they listened  interested and amused over the thought  that these ladies and gentlemen wanted to go to school     at first i do not think it occurred to one of them that he was included  in the proposal to form an writing class     how was it done  i am not sure that any one of the eager group of  workers could have told you afterward  so excited did they become over  this first scheme  nobody could remember just what words were said  nor  who said them  nor whether the boys all looked equally startled when  paper and pen were put into each hand  they remembered that some shook  their heads emphatically  and that nimble dick spoke plainly   no you  don t  i can t write any more than a duck can  and i never expect to    mrs  roberts knew that dirk colson s dark face turned a fierce red  and  he snapped the offered pen half way across the table with his indignant  thumb and finger  but of these words and acts nobody apparently took any  notice  the writing began  and the first marks given as copies were  so simple  looked so easy to do  and the attempts of the ladies and  gentlemen fell so far short of what the teacher desired  and were so  unmercifully criticised by him  and the criticisms were so merrily  received by the writers  that at last the whole thing took the form of  a joke to nimble dick s mind  and he became possessed with a burning  desire to try  one by one the boys stealthily followed his example   alfred taking care to watch eagerly  to commend both stephen crowley  and gracie dennis in the same breath for some true stroke  and criticise  both mrs  roberts and nimble dick for not holding the pen aright     the entire party became so interested that only mrs  roberts knew just  when dirk colson stealthily filliped back his pen from the distance to  which it had been rolled  and  sitting upright that he might attract  the less notice  tried his hand on the curve which was giving even dr   everett trouble     when the young teacher discovered it he made also another discovery   which he proclaimed        upon my word  i beg the pardon of each of you  but colson here has made  the only respectable  r  curve there is in the company      then if his sister mart had seen the glow on dirk s face  i am not sure  that she would have known him  there was a momentary transformation     as for mrs  roberts  she bowed low over the letter she was carefully  forming  but it was to say in soft whisper heard by one ear alone        thank god            chapter xviii      yourn s the way        you are not to suppose  because this first monday evening  which  by the  way  was concluded with sandwiches and coffee  was a success  pronounced  so by all concerned  that therefore the ones which followed were all  rose color     fortunately  not one of the workers expected this  and so were brave and  cheerful under drawbacks     these were numerous and varied     after the first novelty wore off  it took at times only the most trivial  excuses to keep the boys away  sometimes when they called their conduct  was anything but encouraging  they lolled in the easy chairs  smelling  strongly of tobacco and other bar room odors  refused insolently to  apply themselves to any work at hand  audibly pronounced the whole  thing  slow   and in numberless ways severely tried the patience of both  alfred and gracie     for the others  they had counted the cost   at least the gentlemen  had   and expected to move slowly  even to appear to go backward some  of the time  as for mrs  roberts  i have told you that she worked in a  peculiar manner  with the motto   this one thing i do   apparently ever  before her     each evening was distinct in itself  with efforts to make and obstacles  to overcome  and at its close she had a way of laying it aside  as  something with which her part was done  not attempting even to calculate  results  then she was ready to turn to a new day  and work steadily for  that     the winter was slipping away and gracie dennis lingered  she could  hardly have told you why  yet there were many apparent reasons  mrs   roberts wanted her  rejoiced in her  and coaxed irresistibly as often  as the thought of going home was mentioned  then gracie  laugh over the  peculiar work going on as she might  was undeniably interested in those  boys  she was working for them  therefore of course she was interested      i don t see how you can go this week   would young ried say to her   with a perplexed air   you know we have that matter all planned for next  monday evening  how can we carry out the scheme if you are not there to  do your part      then would gracie laugh and demur and admit  to herself only  that it  was very pleasant to be needed  as she certainly was  for one night  more  and so the nights passed     her work was to be  professor of elocution   as mr  roberts gaily called  her when the workers were alone together  it had been discovered that  she could read both prose and poetry with effect  so a reading class was  organized  and they chose for the first evening  not one of bryant s or  whittier s gems  nor selections from milton or shakespeare  which would  have suited part of the company  nor yet the  easy readings  in some  standard spelling book  which would have fitted the capacity of the  others  but with great care and much discussion  one of will carleton s  descriptive poems  full of homely  yet tender language  full of pathos  and of humor  was unanimously selected     the first evening reading had been commenced with nuts and apples  there  are those who can see no connection between this and the intellectual   happily for the characters with whom she had to deal  mrs  roberts was  not one of them  while the others were still enjoying the refreshments  she took the book and read  this was her quiet little sacrifice  it was  not pleasant to her to become a public reader  it required courage  to get through with one verse  with dr  everett sitting opposite  and  gracie dennis on a low seat at her side  and her husband listening  intently  mrs  roberts was not a good reader  and was aware of it  she  pronounced the words correctly  it is true  but when you had said that   you had said all that there was to offer in praise of her effort  she  had some exasperating faults  but she bravely read the two verses  and  some of the boys listened  and one of them laughed  he had caught a  gleam of the fun in the poem  this  of course  was nimble dick     then alfred ried made the same effort on the same verses  his  performance was very little better  and he  too  knew it  he could  write  but he was by no means a public reader  this was his offering to  the general good  if those fellows  by reason of his mistakes  could  be induced to climb  he was willing to offer his pride on the altar  no  matter by what petty trials they were caught so that they were really  caught     then followed gracie dennis  and her own father  acceptable preacher  though he was  might with credit to himself have taken lessons of her   she was certainly  for one so young and so unprofessional  a magnificent  reader  so indeed was marion wilbur  and she had enjoyed teaching  gracie     the poem blossomed in her hand  the crunching of nuts and apples  entirely ceased  the boys sat erect and listened and laughed and flushed  and swallowed suspiciously over some of the homely pathos  they had  never heard anything like that before  and they evidently appreciated  it  she read through to the end     then were unloosed the tongues  they exclaimed in delight        what an accomplishment it is   said mr  roberts   and how few possess  it  doctor  how many really fine readers have you heard in your life       about three   said the doctor  laconically      well   said mrs  roberts   let us all be exceptions  gracie  teach us  how  i will try again      and she did  on the first verse of the poem  with better success than  before  but how sharp the contrast between her reading and gracie s  she  knew  it was not easy for her to read     i don t know  possibly i am mistaken  but it seems to me that i have  known people ready for large sacrifices  who yet would shrink painfully  from these little ones     in discussing the programme for the evening  the question had been  when  each had done his part  how were they to influence the boys to join    could  they join  was it probable that they knew enough about reading  to attempt to speak the words of the poem  with reference to this  obstacle a poem had been chosen full of simple  homely words  such as  are in common use  especially was the first verse free from what mr   roberts called  shoals   having heard the verse read several times  it  was hoped that some one of the seven might have courage to attempt it   but gracie did not believe that such would be the case      i don t see how we can ask them  and do it naturally   said dr   everett   it is such an unheard of thing  you know  and i am afraid  do  our best  it will present itself to them as a patronage  and that will  be fatal  the people who are low enough to need patronage are the very  ones who won t endure it      whereupon various ways of managing the matter were discussed and  discarded  suddenly mrs  roberts turned to her young lieutenant  who had  been silent for some time  and said        what are you thinking of  mr  ried  do you see a way out       no   he said   i have neither knowledge nor skill in such matters   but my thoughts just then were far away  i was thinking how curiously   certain apparently trivial instances of one s childhood will stand out  with almost startling prominence       what sent you off in that direction   questioned dr  everett   there  must have been an association of ideas       oh  there was  i was thinking how vividly i remembered a discussion  between my mother and my sister  younger than ester  in regard to some  matter which perplexed them  and when they could come to no satisfactory  conclusion they appealed to my sister ester  who was resting as usual on  her lounge  i can seem to hear her voice as she said   we haven t to do  anything about it until to morrow  perhaps to morrow will have a light  of its own for our direction       thank you   mrs  roberts said  her eyes lighting with an appreciative  smile   we have not to do anything about this until monday night  and  perhaps monday night will see us wise      i don t know how many thought of this little conversation when monday  evening came  but certainly alfred ried and mrs  roberts did  for  she glanced at him and smiled significantly when dr  everett  having  apparently forgotten that anything beyond their own pleasure was in  contemplation  challenged gracie to a discussion as to the emphasis on  a certain word in the second line  he had never heard it so read  and he  called for an analysis that would sustain the reading  and received it   and was not yet prepared to yield the point  but read the verse as he  had imagined it should be read  and then gracie  at mr  roberts  call   repeated it with her rendering  and i am not sure but all parties  concerned actually forgot their final object in the interest of the  discussion until they were suddenly called to it by an interrupting  voice        your n s the way   it said  with an emphatic nod of a shock of matted  hair   your n s the way      it was dirk colson  he had forgotten for the moment that anybody was  listening to him  save the two readers  he was looking directly at  gracie  and the nods were evidently intended for her      of course it is   she said  eagerly  her face flushing with a triumph  that had nothing to do with the right emphasis   you read it  won t you   and show these people that we are right      afterward mrs  roberts confessed that she involuntarily placed her hand  on her heart with a dim idea of hushing its beating lest others would  hear  so important to her did the moment seem  dr  everett looked  dismayed  the least hopeful one of the seven seemed dirk  none of them  knew of his dangerous talent for imitation  none of them believed that  he would make any attempt at reading  but thought he would shrink into  deeper sullenness  all of them were mistaken  he reached for the book   glanced for a moment over the lines  and then read the verse  with so  complete an imitation of gracie dennis  and yet with a voice and manner  that so fitted the homely words and the homely scene described that the  effect was actually better than when gracie read     instinctively the cultured portion of his audience greeted the effort  with a clapping of hands  the blood  meantime  rolled in dark waves over  dirk s face  he had been cheered before  none of his present applauders  could imagine what a set had often clapped their hands over his  successful imitations  but dirk  who liked applause as well as other  human beings do  had never  in his wildest stretches of imagination   placed himself before such people as listened now and received their  approval     great was the excitement and satisfaction  the six companions  far from  feeling any emotion of jealousy  seemed greatly elated  believing that  one of their number had made a  hit   and increased their importance     no one else could be found to attempt the verse  nimble dick shook his  head good naturedly  and declared that he would rather  undertake to run  an engine to californy  than try it  and the others were of like mind   then came gracie to the front again        i ll tell you what you must all do  i have been experimenting with that  type writer  mr  roberts  all the week  you know it will manifold  with  the use of carbon paper  and it chances that when i was seized with a  desire to try its powers in that direction i choose this very verse to  copy  so i have fifteen good copies in print  you must each take a copy  and make this verse a study until next monday  then i shall challenge  you all to sustain me in my reading      this proposition was hailed with such satisfaction by the older members  that it immediately became popular  and each boy received his copy  mechanically and gazed at it curiously  but dirk colson s thoughts were  turned in a new channel      look here   he said  detaining gracie by an imperious inclination of  his head  as she handed him the copy   how did you make these  didn t  you print them fifteen times  i didn t understand what you said       why no   said gracie   the machine will  manifold   i ll show you  come  over to the end window  it stands there waiting to be displayed  and it  is a little wonder      then they crowded around the type writer  and gracie  really proud  of the skill she had acquired in a week s time  showed off the little  wonder to great advantage     the fact that the type writer was new to most of the others  that they  were decidedly ignorant as to its working  increased the comfort of the  hour by doing away with the embarrassing feeling that any one of  them was playing a part  dr  everett was no more familiar with the  type writer than was dirk colson  and was just as eager to know about  it     also everybody  apparently  felt an equally strong desire to write his  name on the marvellous little creature  and each in turn sat down before  it and moved his awkward hands with nearly equal slowness over the keys   picking out the magic letters     it was this episode that made the workers during their next conference  branch out in new lines      we need something   said dr  everett  walking up and down the floor  in puzzled thought   we need something that shall be a genuine  common interest  of which we are all  or all but one  equally  ignorant  something that we can take hold of with zest  on as low a  platform as the most ignorant of those seen  i was convinced of that  when i saw the abandon with which we all went into the type writer  business  with a naturalness and equality that  in the matter of reading  and writing  it is impossible for us to feel  if the machine were  complicated  so that it would take us each three months or so to master  it  that would do  what can we take up that will place us on a level            chapter xix      we have begun backwards         well   said mr  ried   we should want to have one of our number not  on  a level   how would it do to appoint you  sir  to give us a few lectures  in hygiene  popular lectures about air and exercise and ventilation  and bathing  and all sorts of every day topics  about which people are  ignorant       that s a capital idea  ried  those fellows could certainly be benefited  by a little attention to such questions  and i m sure the rest of us  would like to hear of the principles which govern these important laws   such lectures put into popular form are decidedly interesting  i think   let us vote for them   this was mr  roberts  hearty seconding     but the doctor laughed      there is a ludicrous side to it which you do not see   he said    imagine me holding forth on the importance of ventilation  for  instance  to a poor follow who comes from a region where father and  mother  and a horde of children of both sexes and all ages  crowd  together in one room  and that a cellar  where the sun never penetrates  and the air that crawls in through the one small window is reeking with  even more impurities than can be found inside  or talking about bathing   to the poor wretches who have no clothing to change  and barely water  enough  by carrying it long distances  to satisfy their most pressing  needs  still  ried  i m not quarrelling with your idea  there is a  sensible side to it  there are things that i could tell even those boys  which might interest them  and would certainly be to their advantage to  know  the subject is one which can be popularized to suit even such an  audience  i ll try for it occasionally if it shall seem best  but it  doesn t meet my demand  i want us all on a platform where we shall start  in equal ignorance and get on together  of course you are all more or  less familiar with all the facts that i should have to present  and the  boys would know it  they are sharp fellows  it wouldn t take them an  hour to discover that we were fishing for them  and if there is any one  thing on which they are at present determined  it is  probably  that  they will not be benefited  what is there that one of us knows  of which  the others are ignorant  french won t do  for miss dennis is acquainted  with that language  i think  and so are you  ried  are you not       well  i can stammer through a few sentences  i don t speak it like a  native as you do      at this revelation a vivid blush glowed on gracie dennis  cheek  she  remembered professor ellis  comments in french  then the doctor had  understood  though his face was so imperturbable  what could he have  thought of the courtesy of her guest     meantime mr  ried wore a perplexed face      you are right   he said to the doctor   we are not enough on a level   i felt our advantage last night when miss dennis was explaining the  type writer  but i don t see the way clear  what subject is there on  which all but one of us could meet on common ground  and that one could  turn professor      here interposed mr  roberts  speaking in a meek tone of voice        if i were not a modest man i should venture a suggestion  as it is  i  really don t know what to do      the doctor turned to him quickly        out with it  man  if you are master of a profession or a trade or  a theory unknown to the rest of us  you are bound on your honor as a  member of this unique organization to present it      at the same moment mrs  roberts came to his aid      oh  evan  teach us short hand      whereupon mr  roberts heaved what was intended to appear as a relieved  sigh  and announced that his modesty was preserved     upon this suggestion they seized with eagerness  not one of them knew  anything about phonetic writing save mr  roberts  and he was master of  the art      it is the very thing   the doctor said  with heartiness   i should like  exceedingly to learn it  and ried and the ladies may be able to make it  useful in a hundred ways  and as for the seven  if they really master  it  it may be the foundation of a fortune for some of them      so  without more ado  it was planned that at the very next monday  evening the subject should be skilfully presented  its importance and  its fascinations discussed  and the boys be beguiled into taking a first  lesson  sandwiched in between the all important reading and writing  lessons     alas for plans  on the very next monday the conspirators  with the  exception of young ried  were together by seven o clock  the faint aroma  of coffee floated through the room  a fruit basket filled with oranges  occupied a conspicuous table  and everything waited for the guests     while they waited  instead of enjoying themselves as the four were  certainly capable of doing  they were noticeably restless  listened for  the shuffling of careless feet on the steps  and the sound of uncultured  voices in the hall  and waited expectantly whenever the bell pealed   only to be obliged to send word to some caller that  mr  and mrs   roberts were engaged      the special occupation of the four seemed to be to look at their watches  and to remark that the doctor s was a trifle fast  and to wonder if  half past seven would be a more suitable hour for the boys  and to  wonder what could be detaining ried     at last it was half past seven  and then it was fifteen minutes of  eight  and then it was ten minutes of eight  and then the door bell rang  again  it was ried  and he was alone  one glance at his distressed  face told the lookers on that something was amiss  even before he  exclaimed        you won t see a boy to night       why    what is the trouble    where are they      these were the various ways of putting the same question      one of the mccullum partners has become interested in the boys  it  seems  and has concluded that he will try what he can do towards their  elevation  so he has commenced by presenting each one of them with a  ticket to the green street theatre  and there they are at this moment      this startling intelligence was variously received  dr  everett  exclaimed        is it possible      gracie dennis remarked that it was something like what she had expected   mrs  roberts said not a word  and mr  roberts added to the astonishment  of the moment by bursting into a laugh     poor ried seemed to feel the laugh more than anything  his face gathered  into heavier clouds than before  he bit his lip to hold back the vexed  words that were just ready to burst forth  and strode almost angrily to  the further corner of the room     an embarrassed silence seemed to fall upon the others  at least gracie  felt embarrassed  the doctor looked simply expectant     at last mr  roberts drew himself up from his lounging attitude and broke  into the stillness      ah  now  good people  don t let us make serious mistakes  come back  here  my dear young brother  and let us look this thing in the face  and  talk it over calmly  are we children playing at benevolence that at  the first discouragement we should cry out   all is lost   and retire  vanquished  come  i laughed because really this does not seem such a  serious matter to me as it seems to present to the rest of you      what did we expect  here are seven boys  right from the gutters   somehow we have had them laid on our hearts  and have enlisted to help  fight the battle that is going on about them in this world  christ died  to save them  and satan means that the sacrifice shall be in vain  he  is bringing all his powers to bear on them  and he has many and varied  powers      here comes into the scene a man benevolently inclined  not a christian   but in his way a philanthropist  by accident he has come in contact with  one of the boys  by accident he learns that something  he does not know  quite what  is being attempted to benefit them  can t you give him the  credit of being honest  the only thing he thinks of that he can do to  help is to give them an evening s entertainment  at one of the decent  theatres there is being presented what seems to be known in their  parlance as a  moral play   so he presents each boy with a ticket  now   what did we expect of those boys      last week a lady and two gentleman who have been members of our church  for years  left the regular prayer meeting  and went to the philharmonic  concert      ought we to expect that it would even occur to our seven boys to give  up what to them is a rare treat for the pleasure of spending an evening  with us  as for the moral obligation  they have probably never so much  as heard the words      isn t it time we knew what we were about  what are we after  it is well  enough to teach the poor fellows to read and write  and to help lift  them up in other ways  but our efforts will amount to very little unless  we succeed in bringing them to the great lever of human society  unless  christ take hold of this thing we shall fail  now  has he taken hold  is  he  at least  as much interested in them as we are  is his holy spirit  preceding and supplementing all our efforts  and  if this is the case   is an evening at a theatre going to ruin his plans      long before these earnest sentences were concluded ried had returned  from his distant corner  and taken a seat near his employer  his eyes  were full of tears  and his voice trembled        i beg your pardon  mr  roberts  i m an ignorant blunderer  i did feel  for the moment as though everything were lost       we have begun backwards   said mr  roberts   i was reading to day that  a mistake the missionaries made for years in trying to  civilize  the  greenlanders  and what a perfect failure they made of it until one day  almost by accident  a man began to tell them about christ on the cross   and the story melted them  i don t think i have thought enough about him  in this matter       i stand convicted   dr  everett said   i ve made the same mistake  i  believe  in all my efforts for people  i have been praying for them  it  is true  but  after all  i feel now as though there had been too much  relying on human means  and not enough on god  it is a case of  these  ought ye to have done  and not to have left the other undone        well   said mr  roberts  looking at his watch   we are in the same  condemnation  it is  i believe  the most common  and one of the most  fatal  mistakes that christian workers make  but there is a way out  we  expected to spend until ten o clock with those boys  it is nearly nine  now  suppose we spend the next hour with christ  asking for the power of  the holy spirit on any and every effort that we may make for them in the  future  our ultimate aim is to bring every one of them to jesus and he  knows it  now if we have gone about in the wrong way  we have only to  ask him forgiveness and look to him steadily for guidance  what do you  say  friends  shall we spend the hour in taking them to the only one who  really can afford them lasting help      i suppose that he who  maketh the wrath of man to praise him  is equally  able to manage the folly of man  could the injudicious philanthropist  have looked into that room that evening  and heard the prayers that  went up to god for those boys  and understood something of the power  of prayer  he would have had one illustration of how god manages the  foolishness of men     it was a very earnest prayer meeting  these workers had each one bowed  in secret  and with more or less earnestness  asked for god s blessing  on their efforts  but it occurred to them that evening  as a very  strange thing  that they had never unitedly prayed for this before   therefore there was an element of confession in all the prayers that  moved gracie dennis strangely  especially was this the case when she  heard her old acquaintance  flossy  pour out her soul s longings  it  happened  so strange are the customs of christians  that though this was  the daughter of a minister of the gospel  herself a christian  she had  never before heard a lady pray in the presence of gentlemen  she had  heard of their doing so  heard them criticised with sharp sarcasm  some  of the criticisms which had sounded full of keenness and wit when she  heard them  recurred to her at this time  and some way  with flossy s  low  earnest voice filling her heart  they dwindled into shallowness and  coarseness  all the same  their baneful influence was on her  and  helped to hold her back from opening her lips  for the critic had been  professor ellis     when the hostess and her young guest were left alone together that  evening  the latter had a question to ask        flossy shipley    the name you will remember which she always went back  to when excited   i didn t know you believed in praying in  public    have you changed in  everything        in public  my dear   with a quiet smile   why  i am in my own house       oh  yes  but you know what i mean  before gentlemen  do you really  think it is necessary       as to that  gracie  i don t believe i thought anything about it  i  wanted to pray for those boys  and so i prayed       and didn t you really shrink from it at all  how very queer  flossy  i  do believe nobody was ever so much changed by religion as you have been   i don t see what makes the difference  i m sure i think i m a christian   but i could never do such a thing as that       not if you believed it to be your duty       but i don t believe it   said the fair logician  her face flushing    i think it is out of place  i beg your pardon  flossy  i don t mean i  think it sounded badly in you  but only that for me it would be horrid   and i couldn t do it       then what are you talking about  my dear  if you should never consider  it your duty  you would certainly never be called upon to do it            chapter xx      oh  what a nice thought        this very calm view of the question gave gracie time to recover from  her excitement  and to laugh at her folly  then mrs  roberts said  still  speaking very gently        i don t want to argue with you  dear  and i couldn t if i wished  you  know i am a dunce about all such things  but i just want to ask you a  little question  you need not answer me unless you choose  not now  that  is  perhaps some time we may want to talk about it  i would like to know  the reasons that people have for thinking that it is out of place for a  lady to kneel down with her christian friends and speak to jesus about a  thing that they unitedly desire  and that they believe he is able to do  for them  if it is not proper to speak before them  why is it proper to  speak  to  them on the same subject      this question gracie carried to her room for thought     meantime  as dr  everett and young ried went homeward  they had a talk  together      when i found out that those boys had gone to the theatre to night i was  completely discouraged   declared ried   it seemed to me that our work  was a failure  i could almost see satan laughing over the success of his  scheme  i never felt so about anything in my life  and now it seems to  me that perhaps the lord will let it result in being the best thing that  ever happened to us      to all of which dr  everett made the apparently irrelevant answer        mr  roberts and his wife are singularly well mated  how perfectly they  fit into each other s thoughts  ried  you and i have a great deal to  learn from them       i have   said ried  meekly     yet another bit of talk closed this evening      mccullum has given me an idea   mr  roberts said to his wife as they  sat together reviewing the day   not a bad one  i fancy  i wonder when  we can act on it and watch results  there are tickets for other places  besides theatres  why couldn t we furnish them for some entertainment   lecture  or concert  or something of the sort  that would be really  helpful  the only difficulty is that there are few helpful places as yet  within reach of their capacities  it takes an exceptional genius to hold  such listeners      but his wife  her face aglow  clasped her hands in an ecstasy of  delight      what a beautiful thought   she said   and how nice that it should come  to you just now  when there will be such a splendid opportunity to  put it in practice  why  don t you know  gough  next week  fifty cent  tickets  on temperance  too  how grand  and evan  let us give them each  two tickets  i want that dirk colson to take his sister  perhaps he will  not  but then he may  one can never tell  oh  evan  won t it be nice       ah   said mr  roberts   as usual you are ahead of me  i had not thought  of the two tickets apiece  that is a suggestion for their manliness   flossy  we ll try it      yet another bit of talk     they shambled down the stairs  from the second rate hall at a late hour  that evening  those seven boys  quiet for them  though the play had been  exciting  and not remarkably moral  viewed  from the standpoint of a  christian      after all   said nimble dick  breaking a silence with speech  as though  the subject of which he spoke had been under discussion among them    after all  it was rather sneaking to bolt and say nothing  i kind of  wish we hadn t done it       that s what i told you all along   said dirk colson  with even unusual  sullenness   but you would go and do it  and we was fools enough to  follow you       and i ll bet she had oysters or something   this from jerry tompkins   you have probably no idea how hungry he was at that moment      they was goin  to do somethin  new to night  that there dennis girl  told me so when i met her on the street yesterday  something that we  would like first rate  she said  a brand new notion   this was stephen  crowley s contribution to the general discomfort      well   said nimble dick  and the sigh with which he spoke the word  would have gone to mrs  roberts  heart   i s pose it s all up now  i  shouldn t wonder if we never got another bid  i wouldn t if i was them   i know that  and their old theatre wasn t no great shakes  after all   we ve been a pack of fools  and i don t mind owning it      whereupon  having reached the corner  they separated and went glumly to  their homes  and this is gratitude  what a pity mr  mccullum  who had  been smiling over his benevolence all the evening  could not have heard  them     the weeks that followed this night  were crowded with trifles on which  hung important and far reaching results  this is a very trite saying  i  know  all weeks are crowded with eventful trifles  at least  we in our  blindness call them trifles  although we are constantly discovering  their importance  and being constantly astonished over them     among other things  the seven boys became nine   having taken to their  companionship two choice spirits  apparently worse than themselves   and appeared at the south end mission with all the bravado that boys  of their stamp are apt to put on when they feel somewhat ashamed of  themselves  the consequence was that the trials which mrs  roberts had  to endure from them  though a trifle less apparent to others  were not a  whit less distressing than usual     but before the session was concluded they were treated to a sensation  that held them in silent astonishment for nearly five minutes  any  person well acquainted with alfred ried could have told that he had a  plan in view  and was trying to carry it in the face of some opposition   he looked convinced  and mr  durant looked astonished and troubled   there was much low toned talk between them and some shaking of head   apparently  however  mr  ried came off victor  for his brow cleared  and  he presently made his way to mrs  roberts  side and said a few words   and must have been gratified by the sudden lighting up of her face and  her eager        oh  what a nice thought  even if it fails  apparently  it will not  utterly  for the suggestion will help them      in the course of time the new idea came to the front  there was to be  a festival  or a social  or an entertainment at the south end in the  course of a few weeks   a sort of anniversary of the starting of the  mission  among other work that was in progress  the decoration of the  room  involving the hanging of pictures  banners  mottoes  wreaths   etc   required some strong arms and willing hands  committees were to be  formed  two weeks before  teachers had been appointed to prepare a  list of committees  it fell to young ried to appoint the committee on  decoration  when he was called upon for his report  he came promptly  forward  like a man ready for action  and commenced        a committee of four has been deemed amply sufficient for decoration   and i appoint for the purpose the following  richard bolton  morris  burns  miss gracie dennis  and miss annie powell      the teachers  who had been long at the mission  looked from one to  another with a bewildered air  morris burns they knew   a clear eyed  young scotchman  with willing hands and feet ever ready to run of  errands for all workers  a boy of nineteen or so  whom everybody liked   warm hearted  unselfish  and thoroughly trustworthy  annie powell was  one of the older girls in mr  durant s bible class  a sweet faced   ladylike little factory girl  who would work in with morris burns  nicely  miss gracie dennis was mrs  roberts  beautiful young friend  all  the teachers knew her  and all thought it very kind in her to throw her  strength and taste into the preparations as heartily as though she  were one of them  but who was richard bolton  nobody knew  yet their  knowledge of business etiquette told them that he was chairman of the  decoration committee  where was he  not a teacher  certainly  for they  were intimately acquainted with one another  and they knew no such name  in the one bible class made up of trustworthy helpers     over in mrs  roberts  class  with the single exception of the teacher   there was equal ignorance  the nine boys had stopped their restless  mischief to listen  because there is a sort of fascination to boys  in all the details of well managed business  they liked to hear the  appointments  but who richard bolton might be seemed not to occur to one  of them  it is true that jerry tompkins nudged nimble dick in anything  but a quiet way with his elbow  and murmured   you ve got a namesake it  seem  in this  ere job   yet no light dawned on them     mr  durant  who  it is possible  has not appeared to you in a favorable  light  for the reason that he was being much perplexed by the entirely  new methods being introduced among the boys who had heretofore driven  him to the very verge of desperation  was really a quickwitted man  and  having succumbed to what he feared was a wild experiment  knew how to  help carry it out properly  he came briskly to the front   alfred s  committee being the last on the list   and began his work      the chairmen of these different committees will be kind enough to  report to me as rapidly as possible the time and place of their first  meeting for consultation  and i will make the announcements   then he  stepped to mrs  roberts  class   bolton   he said  bending toward that  astonished scamp  and speaking as though this were an every day affair    you are chairman  i believe  of the decoration committee  where and  when will you have them meet      imagine nimble dick s eyes  nay  imagine the eyes and faces of the  entire nine  it would have been a study for an artist     for a moment nimble dick was speechless  then he managed to burst forth  with        what in thunder are you talking about       your committee   said mr  durant  politely ignoring the manner of the  questioner   you must call them together  you know  to plan your work   where shall it be  and when       i ain t got no committee  and i ain t got no place to meet nobody  and  i don t know what in thunder you re after      then came mrs  roberts to the rescue        why  mr  bolton  you can meet at our society parlor  you know  it is  the very place  and will be so convenient for miss dennis       what s to meet  and what s to do   said dick  defiantly   i ain t going  to meet nobody       why  it is just to hang mottoes and banners  and trim the room for the  anniversary  of course you ll help  i would have the meeting arranged  there by all means       very well   said mr  durant  quickly  as though he had received the  answer from the chairman himself   now as to time  you ought to come  together to morrow evening if you could  there is a good deal to do       mr  bolton  couldn t you come up at six o clock for once  then you  could get your work all done before the time for our social  i can  arrange for annie powell to be there at that time  and  mr  durant   doesn t morris burns work for you  could he be present at six o clock   then i don t see but your meeting is nicely planned  you can be there at  six  can t you  mr  bolton       i tell you i don t know nothin  what you are talking about      nimble dick  who was rarely anything but good natured  was surprised by  the bewilderments of the situation into being almost as fierce as dirk  colson was habitually  the gaping amazement of his boon companions  seeming to add to his irritation      but you will   said his teacher  cheerily   it is an easy matter to  explain  miss dennis knows all about such things  and i m going to help   though they haven t honored me with an appointment      at a sign from the lady  mr  durant stepped back to his platform and  announced        the chairman of the committee on decoration desires me to say that  his committee is called together to morrow evening  at the young men s  social parlors  no     east fifty fifth street  at six o clock   sharp    as the chairman has another engagement at seven       i had to coin a name for the place of meeting   he said to mrs  roberts  afterwards   i beg your pardon if it was wrong  but ried has been giving  me glowing accounts of that room  and you said something about its being  a social parlor  didn t you       it is a good name   said mrs  roberts   we have awkwardly called it the   new room   i am glad it is christened  i will have some curtains hung  through the centre to morrow  to make parlors instead of parlor of it  i  can see how a second room can be made useful in several ways      thus was the bewildering committee willed into existence  the chairman  thereof being still so dumbfounded with his position that he did not  rouse until the laughing boys  by whom he was surrounded  began to take  in some of the fun of the situation  and to assault him right and left  with mock congratulations  ill suppressed groans  hisses  and the like   then he turned towards them with new born dignity that would have fitted  dirk colson  and said        if you fellows don t shut up  and behave yourselves something like  decent for the rest of the time  i ll chaw half a dozen of you into  mincemeat as soon as we are out of this            chapter xxi      had his experiment been too severe        dr  everett was driving rapidly through the city  at least  as rapidly  as the crowded character of the street would permit  he was out on  professional duty  and had just been congratulating himself that his  regular calls were now made for the day  and unless something special  intervened he should have a couple of hours free for the alleys     that meant professional duty  too  and of the very hardest character   one would suppose  as it brought him in contact not only with sickness  in some of its most repulsive forms  but with abject poverty as well   and too often with loathsome forms of sin  yet he went about this  work with a zest that his regular practice did not furnish  this  was something done solely for jesus  sake  and with an eye that was  manifestly single to his glory     he had already selected his alley  and was planning how  when his horses  were safely stabled  he could make a cross cut to it  when his eyes were  held by two persons who were ascending together the stairway that led  to one of the public halls  his face darkened as he watched them   apparently they were engrossed with each other  and took no notice of  him  but there were reasons why he specially desired to keep them in  view  a network of carriages and wagons such as is common to crowded  thoroughfares blocked his path just then  and prolonged his opportunity  to watch the two     they made their way in a very leisurely manner up the long staircase   letting others  more in haste  pass them continually  yet presently they  joined the group who were passing up tickets of entrance     the doctor signalled a policeman  and entered into conversation        what is going on in seltzer hall       well  sir  there s a kind of a concert  i guess  they play on goblets   they say  just common glass goblets  and make fine music       an afternoon entertainment       yes  sir  as a kind of introduction  you know  they expect to get a  crowd for evening by the means       do you know where tickets are to be had      the policeman indicated a bookstore at his left by a gesture from his  thumb  and said   right here   and offered to secure some at once  he  knew dr  everett  many of the policemen did     his offer was accepted with thanks  and the doctor presently wound his  way out from the network with two green tickets in his pocket  his plans  for the afternoon had been suddenly changed  instead of spending the  time in sewell alley  he had decided to attend a musical exhibition  the  instruments being goblets     he must make all speed now  so he left the crowded street and dodged  through several byways to the stables     no use to keep his horses   she would be afraid to drive through such  crowds   he explained to himself   and i should be afraid to leave the  carriage standing      rushing out from the stables he caught just the right street car  and in  a short space of time was ringing at mr  roberts  door     gracie dennis was in the hall  dressed for the street      ah   said the doctor   i am either fortunate or unfortunate  i wonder  which  i had set my heart on having you for a companion to what i fancy  may be a unique entertainment  is there another engagement in the way  i  know this is a most unconventional method  but a doctor is never sure of  his time      but gracie dennis felt too well acquainted with dr  everett  and was too  young and ready for enjoyment to be disturbed about conventionality  she  merrily declared her willingness to be taken to whatever entertainment  the doctor had to propose  mrs  roberts was out with her husband on  business connected with church matters  and she had only intended to  walk a square or two for her health     on the way the doctor was distrait  gracie having most of the talking  to do herself  the truth was  he was trying to recall the faces of the  people he had seen crowding into the hall  to make sure that he was  not taking gracie among people whom he would not care to have her meet   apparently the couple whose movements had changed all his afternoon  plans were not a sufficient guarantee of respectability  however  his  face cleared as he recalled one and another  as being in the crowd  seeking admission  they might not be of the class with whom gracie was  accustomed to mingle  but they were respectable people     gracie was in a merry mood  she understood enough of the doctor s busy  life to feel sure that this sudden resolve to be entertained was quite  out of his ordinary line  and that of itself served to mark the hour as  exceptional      he feels the need of a little every day fun   she told herself   and  i ll help him to have it if i can  poor man  it must be doleful to go  among sick and dying people all the time      they were late at the hall  the concert was well under way  but there  were plenty of vacant seats  dr  everett swept his eye over the room   then indicated to the usher just which seat he would have  it was one  which commanded a view of the young man and woman who seemed to have  such a mysterious influence over his plans     he was relieved to find quite early in the entertainment that it really  was unique  and  in its way  well worth hearing  had the surroundings  been agreeable he could easily have given himself up to enjoyment   however  they had been seated but a few moments  when he saw by gracie s  startled eyes that she had seen and recognized at least one of the  couple at their left  professor ellis  in his usual faultless attire   lounged gracefully on the seat in such a manner that his side face was  distinct  he rested a well shaped arm on the back of the seat next  him  and his delicately gloved hand almost  if not quite  touched the  shoulder of his companion     both he and the lady at his side gave extremely little attention to the  entertainment in progress  apparently they had come thither for purposes  of conversation  they kept up a continuous murmur of talk  interspersed  at intervals with rippling laughter  and really seemed so entirely  absorbed in each other as to have at times forgotten that the hall was  public  and that the attention of many was being turned toward them   the girl was pretty  extremely so  with an entirely different style of  beauty from gracie dennis  and a certain indescribable something in her  face and manner would have told even the most casual observer that she  moved in a different circle  it was not her dress  unless that was a  little too pronounced for the place and hour  but quite young ladies in  good society sometimes make a similar mistake     neither was her manner objectionable to the degree that you could have  pointed to any one thing as offensive  yet you would have been sure  had  you watched her  that she was without the pale of what we call society     gracie dennis watched her with a kind of fascination   becoming at last  so absorbed with the watching  and the apparently troubled thoughts  which grew out of it  that she gave but slight attention to dr   everett s occasional remarks  nor seemed to observe that at last he  lapsed into total silence     once  during the hour  the young woman glanced casually in their  direction  and the careless nod  and free and easy smile with she  acknowledged dr  everett s presence  drew a startled glance from gracie  to rest on him for a moment      now i wish i had my horses   the doctor said  as at last they made  their way down the aisle   i have a mile s drive up town to take  and i  think the exercise might be good for you      gracie caught at the suggestion  and begged to be allowed to remain in  the bookstore below while he went for the horses      i want a ride  and i want to talk with you   she said  simply     as this was precisely what he wanted  he went for the horses without  more delay     meantime  gracie  in one of the windows of the bookstore  was supposed  to be employed in examining a late book  but in reality gave much  attention to the couple who were crossing the street  or rather waiting  for an opportunity to do so     they seemed in no haste  but were conspicuous  even in the crowded  street  for their interest in each other  more than one policeman  regarded them narrowly  as professor ellis stood with head bent toward  the lady  engaged in eager and animated conversation  it was just the  attitude of absorbed interest with which he had so often listened to  gracie  not on the street  it is true  but in some crowded parlor  and  it had flattered her  it made her frown to day  they were starting now  to make the disagreeable crossing  he had taken his companion s hand   preparatory to a leap over a muddy curbing  but gracie could see that  there was a pressure of it that was unnecessary  and  for the street   peculiar  his face  too  was distinctly visible  and the expression on  it was what gracie had seen before  but certainly she supposed no other  person had     altogether it was probably well for professor ellis  peace of mind that  he did not turn at that moment  and get a glimpse of the young lady in  the bookstore  instead he took his lady away  and they were lost in the  crowd     dr  everett  making all haste with his horses  had still time for  anxious thought  had his experiment been too severe on gracie  was it  possible that her interest in the man was such that the afternoon s  experience had been mixed with pain as well as with disgust  he could  not believe it possible that the pure hearted young girl cared for such  a man as professor ellis  yet there had been a look on her face when she  saw those two which startled and hurt him     when fairly seated in his carriage he did not speak until they had  threaded the maze of wagons and reached clear ground  even then he only  said   now for speed   and gave the horses their desire  until crowds  and business were left behind  and they were driving down a broad  avenue  lined on either side with stately yet quiet looking homes   then he drew rein  and obliged the horses to walk  he had by this time  resolved on probing the wound  if there was one      i wish i knew just how much of a villain that man is   these were the  somewhat startling words which broke his silence      what man   yet the very tones of gracie s voice indicated that she knew  of whom he was speaking      that man  ellis  professor  i think he is called  i have reason to  be very suspicious of him  by the way  miss gracie  i think he is an  acquaintance of yours  have you confidence in him      how promptly and indignantly such a question would have received an  affirmative answer two months before  what should she say now      in what respect   she faltered  more for the purpose of gaining time  than because she did not understand the question      well  in any respect i am almost prepared to say  i have not the honor  of the man s acquaintance  but whatever i hear about him  or see in  him  i dislike and distrust  just at present his ways are specially  disturbing  you noticed him this afternoon  i think  the young girl in  his company belongs to my sabbath school  i have a deep interest in her   partly because she is the sort of girl who is always more or less  in danger in this wicked world  and partly because she is capable of  strongly influencing another  who is a special  protege  of mine       who is the girl   gracie s manner was abrupt  and her voice  constrained  it was evident that she was making great effort to control  herself  and appear indifferent to all parties     the doctor took no notice of her constraint      her name is mason  hester mason  she attends the packard place  sabbath school  which you know i superintend  she is motherless  and  worse than fatherless  is a clerk in one of the fourth avenue stores   and is  or was  inclined to be what is called gay  i do not know that  that term conveys any special meaning to you  in young men i think they  call the same line of conduct  fast   i hope and believe that you would  not well understand either term  yet  i think  possibly  that watching  her this afternoon in a public hall will give you some conception of the  stretch that there is between yourself and her            chapter xxii      some people are hard to warn        had dr  everett desired in a few words to show gracie the gulf between  herself and the man who had been the girl s companion for the afternoon   perhaps he could not have formed his sentence better     she shivered visibly  and the doctor drew the carriage wraps more  carefully about her  while he continued        i would not want to give you a wrong estimate of hester mason  nor lead  you to imagine for a moment that i believe a girl who serves behind a  counter cannot be a true lady  i wanted  rather  to explain to you  that her opportunities had been limited  she means to be a good girl   i think  in fact  i may say i have the utmost confidence in her  intentions  she is not a christian  but a few weeks ago i had her name  on my note book as one who was almost persuaded  she has been  fighting the question of personal religion for some time   her special  stumbling block being that she is quick witted  and has quite a clear  idea of how christians ought to live  and can find very few who seem to  her to be living what they profess  however  as i say  i have been very  hopeful of her until within a few weeks  when she came in contact  with this man  and i tremble for the result  he is constant in his  attentions  and she is evidently flattered and dazed       how long has he known her  how did he become acquainted   abrupt  questions still  asked in that curiously repressed voice     the doctor s face was growing very grave and stern  he feared that there  was a real wound here      inadvertently  miss dennis  it seems that both you and i are to blame   or  at least  are involved in the acquaintance  do you remember a little  incident which occurred in a streetcar some six weeks ago  a young  woman  in leaving the car  dropped a package  which you noticing  called  our attention to  and pointed out the person crossing the street  and  professor ellis announced his willingness to overtake her and return the  package  as he was about to leave the car  miss mason was the person in  question  and professor ellis presumed on that very slight introduction  to cultivate an acquaintance  i have learned that he quoted my name in  connection with the incident  and since that day has been on terms of  exceeding intimacy with hester      gracie was surprised out of her reserve      i remember the incident perfectly  but the girl i saw this afternoon  cannot be the one who was on the car       yes  she was in holiday attire to day  and in her working garb when  you saw her momentarily on the car  i remember a feeling of regret that  professor ellis should have so promptly volunteered to do your errand   yet i did not know what i dreaded  i simply shrank from the man  and  wanted others to do so       dr  everett  what is his motive in showing her attention       i wish i knew  i can tell you what i greatly fear  that it is to play  with the human heart  to see to what extent he can gain power over it   and in this case certainly it is a most cruel thing  the girl has no  friends  no father or mother to advise with or help her  she is bright  and pretty  and is being shown glimpses of a world that seems to her  like fairyland  she is dazzled  and one cannot blame her  for she has  neither carefully formed judgment nor trustworthy friends to lean upon   miss dennis  you can judge from her manner this afternoon what is her  knowledge of the customs of polite society  i do not think she has  an idea that she was conspicuous  save for her beauty and the fine  appearance of her attendant  she is not one to shrink from what she  would consider legitimate public admiration  and this you can see but  adds to her danger       but  dr  everett  you do not think   you cannot mean that he intends to  pay her special attention  that he means anything beyond the desire to  give her a little pleasure       well   said the doctor  speaking slowly  but with firmness   you may  judge  miss dennis  what i think   what any honorable person thinks   of  a man who bestows in public the sort of attentions which we saw this  afternoon  you would have been insulted by them  the only reason that  this poor girl was not  is because she does not know any better      did you observe the flashing of a peculiarly set ring on her finger  i  have reason to fear that it belongs to him and that she believes herself  specially honored in being asked to wear it      poor gracie s cheeks were flaming now  she had not observed the ring   but she knew it well  and for one brief evening had worn it herself  and  then had returned it to the owner with the assurance that she could not  bring herself to wear it without her father s consent  she remembered  what a wound she had felt herself bestowing when he had looked at her  with those expressive  reproachful eyes  and replied that if she felt  toward him as he did to her  she would not allow even a  father  to come  between them  and he had actually given that ring into the keeping of  this girl     they rode on in silence  the doctor giving a hint to the horses that  they might go as fast as they chose  he was in great doubt and pain of  heart  could it be possible that this carefully shielded young girl  was caught in the toils of a man whom he believed to be an unprincipled  villain     if so  had he been unnecessarily cruel in his revelations  ought he to  take her home  or drive further  and give her time to recover herself     could he have understood what was passing in her mind he would have  known better what next to say  the simple truth was this  before she  came to mrs  roberts  the child had believed herself to be a martyr to  the unreasonable prejudices of her stepmother  she had been led to feel  that her father had turned against her  solely because of his wife s  influence over him  and that the wife was piqued because professor ellis  had not paid her sufficient attention in the days of her maidenhood   this  the professor had succeeded in teaching gracie to feel  was  the sole charge against him  he was  therefore  an ill used man  and  therefore her heart went out towards him in sympathy     it had not been at first a stronger feeling than this  but flattered  by his attentions  so much more marked and polished than had ever been  offered to the young girl before  she had taught herself to believe  that  but for her father s bitterness  she could be to professor ellis  what he delicately and vaguely assured her no one else could  and fill  a place that hitherto in his lonely life had been left void  she had not  engaged herself to him  indeed  he had never  in actual words  asked  her to do so  but to the young and innocent and well trained there is a  language which speaks as clearly as words  and is held as sacred     gracie had allowed herself to be looked upon as one who was held by   others  from being more to professor ellis than she was  who might  always  perhaps  be held back   for she had resolved in her own sad  heart that she would never marry against her father s consent  no  not  if she were twice of age     of late  strange reflections had come to her  she had measured  professor ellis with other men  christian men  and he had appeared at  a disadvantage  also she had measured herself by the side of other  christian workers  and herself had appeared at a disadvantage  a vague  unrest and dissatisfaction with her christian experience were growing on  her  moreover  she was growing interested in those boys  as she had not  believed that it would be possible for her to be interested when she  first saw them  she began to believe that some of them  at least   would be saved  she wanted to help save them  and to help others  her  martyrdom dwindled rapidly into insignificance  until there would pass  entire days in which she did not once remember that she as an unhappy  girl     at last  but a week or two before this afternoon  she had taken her  affairs in hand  and tried to look steadily at them  the result of her  hours of thought and prayer was that she was bound to professor ellis   that is  provided there should come a time in the dim and distant future  when her father should give his consent  it would be her duty and her  pleasure  because of what had passed between them  to marry him  still   she began to feel less amazed at her father s opinion of him  less angry  about it  she began to say to herself  softly and pitifully   poor   lonely man  he has no one to be his friend  he is not a christian  and  that is what makes so great a difference between him and others  it is  that which papa misses  but i must not desert him  i must pray for him  all the time  and work for his conversion  then he will grow to be the  sort of man whom papa can like  and everything will be right   and while  she said it  she was dimly conscious of a feeling of satisfaction over  the thought that she was very young  and that it would be a long    long  time yet before anything could be settled  and that  meantime   it certainly was not right for her to have anything to do with professor  ellis  only to pray for him  and that perhaps her father would allow  her to carry out a project that was under delightful discussion in the  roberts family  namely  to remain in the city as a pupil in the famous  green lawn school  and she did not know  foolish little thing  that so  far even as her heart was concerned everything was wrong     perhaps it would be difficult for me to explain to you  that is  if you  do not understand without explanation  what a turmoil she was thrown  into by this afternoon s experience  she was far from realizing as yet  that the uppermost feeling even now was not wounded love  but wounded  pride  of what poor stuff she had been making a hero  nothing had ever  opened her eyes like this before  was it possible that she had spent  entire evenings with a man who stooped to set in unpleasant  even  suspicious light  not his own character only  but that of an ignorant  young girl     it would not do to plead a lack of knowledge in excuse for him  he might  be ignorant of the ways of the christian world  but no one understood  better the rules which governed society  during part of the afternoon  she had been very angry with the girl  but after listening to dr   everett it began to dawn upon her that her friend had been playing  with the ignorance of a girl who probably trusted him fully  you are  to understand that gracie dennis was the sort of girl who would be  made very angry by such a suspicion  the glow on her cheeks was not all  caused by the fresh air of the spring day      dr  everett   she said at last  breaking the silence   what do you  think he means by asking the girl to wear that ring  or by letting her  wear it  does he  do you suppose that he has engaged himself to her       i wish i knew what he meant   dr  everett said again  a surge of  indignation rushing over him   if he really meant anything so honorable  as that  it would be bad enough business for poor hester  but  as i  said  i distrust the man utterly  and from my experience with the  world i have reason  from your knowledge of him  miss dennis  could you  suppose him to be honest and earnest in his attentions to that girl      it was a very plain question  it meant more to dr  everett than even  gracie saw  but she saw enough to know that she was admitting an  intimacy that made her blush  however  she answered steadily        no  i cannot think that he is honest or honorable       so i fear  witness this afternoon  gentlemen do not parade their  friendships before the public gaze  and that man knows it      the doctor s voice was  very  stern  he was sure now that there was  a wound  and that it was being probed  he believed in making thorough  work  even with wounds  there would be more hope of genuine healing  afterward     gracie s next question  if her companion had but known it  was a  singular one   why have not people who are her friends warned her  against him  and held her back from making such a false step  if she  does it in ignorance      oh  gracie dennis  how are warnings sometimes received  even by  carefully trained girls  who have every reason to trust the love that  would shield them      some people are very hard to warn   said the doctor   i have tried it   and i have a friend who has tried to help her  but the poor girl  you  must remember  has not been brought up in a christian atmosphere  has  never had a christian friend who came with the authority of  relationship  if she had a good father the way would be made so plain   as it is  can t you see how naturally she distrusts the rest of us  in  favor of the man who makes special professions of friendship  i am not  surprised at hester  i am only sorry for her      had the doctor been carefully informed as to all the circumstances  connected with gracie s intimacy with the professor  he could not have  chosen words which would have touched her conscience more  had not her  good father tenderly and patiently warned her  and had she not chosen to  blind her eyes to all his words  and believe rather in professor ellis  than in him           chapter xxiii      part of the great well to do world         i must call at this house   the doctor said  suddenly drawing rein  before a quiet little house at the foot of a wide lawn   the gatekeeper  of this american castle has a sick child whom i have promised to see   can you hold the horses  miss dennis  or shall i tie them  this is a  quiet spot  and they are gentle       i am not afraid of anything   gracie said  eyes aglow as well as  cheeks  and the doctor went into the house wondering whether professor  ellis  if he could see her now  would not be afraid of her     once inside he gave a start of surprise  almost of dismay  for the  face which appeared at the open door of the sick room belonged to joy  saunders      you here   he said  trying to control the disturbed element in his  voice     she answered quietly        i came out by street car  did you drive       yes    he said  abruptly   but i am not alone  how is the child    and he went forward at once to his professional duties  leaving her to  wonder over his manner     it was peculiar  certainly  joy saunders was used to abruptness  from this man  but there was a quality in it to day that she did not  recognize  she went and looked out of the window  and saw gracie dennis  holding the horses  saw her red  red cheeks  and flashing eyes  and the  peculiar  haughty poise of her head  with which the stepmother at home  was well acquainted     she did not know this gracie dennis save by reputation  once dr  everett  had asked her to call at mrs  roberts   and had made her feel as though  she were foolishly conventional in declining to do so   how is she ever  to know you  according to the rules which trammel society  there ought  to be some way arranged for christians to be free from trammels   this  had been his comment  but he had not asked her again  and she had never  met mrs  roberts  nor yet gracie dennis  yet she knew her very well  and  had watched her often as she passed  she knew instantly who she was now   as she sat there in her haughty beauty  checking with determined hand  the impatience of those horses  oh  she knew more than this  it was  very apparent now why dr  everett was peculiarly abrupt  and  well   yes  embarrassed  she had almost thought that was the name of the  feeling  only it had seemed so absurd  and then joy saunders held  her meek little head high  and told herself that he need not fear her  presence  she could go as she had come  in the street car     the doctor came towards her now  speaking rapidly  as usual        joy  the child is very sick  there ought to be an experienced person  here to night  not you  i am sorry you came up  do you think your  mother would come  will you ride down with me  i have miss dennis in the  carriage  but it is quite large enough for three  you know      then joy had turned away her head  holding it high  and said        no  thank you  i am going down in the street car      and that blundering doctor drew on his gloves  saying to himself   i  don t know but that is best   and went out  only waiting to say to  joy        will you ask your mother about it  i will see her as soon as i can get  around  i wish you would go directly home from here  will you      then he lifted his hat to her  and sprang into his carriage and rode  away with gracie dennis  and joy saunders waited for the next yellow  car  and climbed into it  and told herself all the way down town that  she wished she had stayed at the little house and watched all night by  the sick child     the thoughts that dr  everett had given to the entire matter were few   they ran somewhat after this fashion        joy here  and i m afraid of the fever  from all i have heard  i shall  take her home as soon as possible  how will that poor little girl in the  carriage manage with a new acquaintance just now  i wonder      i am afraid it will be quite a strain  still  i can do the talking   and let her be quiet  the main point is that i hoped she might have a  suggestion to make about hester  if she could rouse herself to try to  save that girl it would be the best thing she could do  if she only knew  it  joy is the one who could help her in that direction or any other      as they dashed down the avenue  he was still occupied in wishing that he  had urged joy to ride  and thus forced an acquaintance between her and  the pretty girl at his side  he was not very patient with what he called  the  trammels  of society  when there were two people so fitted to enjoy  and help one another  as were joy saunders and gracie dennis  he held it  to be a waste in christian economy that they should not know each other     too much occupied with his thoughts and his driving to give heed to  passers by  he lost the careful bow that young ried had for them as they  drew near the city s whirl again  gracie did not  she returned it  with  a slightly heightened color in her cheeks  and wondered if that young  man knew professor ellis  and what he thought of him  and what he  thought of her for being acquainted with him     sometimes it seems to me a real pity that on occasion there could not  be some way of looking into one another s thoughts  so many  misunderstandings might thus be saved  for instance  there was ried  who  went on his way with a clouded brow  where had dr  everett been  and why  was gracie dennis with him  was it probable that he had been riding for  pleasure  the bare suggestion astonished the young man  he found that  he had never before given room to the thought that dr  everett took time  for pleasure  allowing this to be the case  why had he not taken joy  saunders with him  such a proceeding would have seemed altogether  natural  though the honest hearted young fellow admitted to himself  that  had he been taking a ride for pleasure  the companion of his  choice would not have been joy saunders  it was certainly a bewildering  world  so trying did young ried find his thoughts on that evening that  he actually set himself deliberately to learn whether the ride was the  result of chance or design  the consequence was that he learned not only  of the ride  but of the afternoon entertainment at seltzer hall  with  glass goblets for instruments  this increased his astonishment  and did  not lessen the gloom on his face     but the two in the carriage  unconscious of the gloomy young man  or of  the sad hearted young girl riding in a street car  were almost silent  during the homeward ride  until just as they turned into the avenue that  led to mr  roberts  door  then grace said        dr  everett  i should like to know that girl  there are some things  that i ought to say to her  and if i had a chance i would try to say  them in a way to help her       i will manage it   said dr  everett  speaking in a quick  relieved  tone  he felt encouraged for hester now  and greatly relieved about  gracie  she might be wounded  but she was made of the material of which  he had hoped  she was not going to die herself  nor fold her hands and  see others ruined  merely because she had been deceived     he bade her a cheery  good afternoon   and drove away  feeling that   although he had been obliged to give up sewell alley  good work had been  accomplished  he believed now that he understood the situation     he was right about one thing  gracie dennis had not the slightest idea  of dying  her mood was better expressed  half an hour later  when she  stood at the parlor window  and returned a low  lingering bow from  professor ellis  with a haughty stare from flashing eyes  looking out  from an erect and motionless head                                                dirk colson s brain was in a whirl  he had an important question to  settle  in his pocket were two blue tickets  promising to admit him to  the largest and finest hall in the city to hear the great temperance  orator  dirk knew very little about orators  but he had heard of john  b  gough  and everything he had heard made him wish to have a glimpse of  him  you will remember that dirk was an imitator  he had heard that mr   gough was also  and down deep in his heart the boy had an ambition to  hear the man  now was his unexpected opportunity  of course  he was  going  but the perplexing thing was  what to do with that other ticket     there was mart  oh  yes  to be sure  he had not forgotten her  but what  a strange thing it would be to take her to a lecture  he had never taken  her anywhere in his life  she had nothing to wear  though he remembered  at that moment that the mother had  by earnest effort  succeeded in  getting her shawl out of pawn     there was one incentive for taking her  it would please mrs  roberts   dirk studied the thing for some time  to try to discover why she should  care  and had finally given up the problem as too great for him  yet he  was sure she cared  there had been a wistful light in her eyes when she  said   i thought possibly you might like to take that sister with the  golden hair   that he saw and interpreted  it took him three days to  decide what he should say  supposing he made up his mind to ask her     several people were at work helping him  though he knew nothing about  that  mrs  roberts remarked one evening to young ried that she wished  she knew a way to induce dirk colson to take his sister  without  actually asking him to do so  she fancied that  besides the advantage  which might possibly directly follow an evening spent in that way  it  would suggest new thoughts to the brother     the young man caught at the suggestion  and wanted to help carry it  out  it was not an easy thing to do  he had not grown intimate with dirk  colson  in fact  that misguided young fellow rather resented any attempt  at intimacy  he was  however  acquainted with sallie calkins  the  numerous trips he had made to their room during mark s illness had  brought him into such constant and pleasant contact with sallie and her  brother that they looked upon him as a tried friend  sallie  he knew   was a friend of the shy  golden haired sister  so one evening he went  to call at the calkins room  with a vague hope of helping indirectly in  bringing to pass mrs  roberts  desires     to sallie he made known the wish that dirk would take his sister to  the lecture  and secured from her a promise to help the scheme along   provided it developed     after he went away  sallie sat long at her sewing  making all alone   by a dim light  one of the most heroic little sacrifices that was ever  offered  in his name   to fully understand it  you must know that mark  calkins had recovered sufficiently to take his place in the office where  dr  everett had secured him an opening  and an employment that would  enable him to sit  most of the time  thereby giving his injured limb  a chance to rest  also  mark had been admitted to the monday evening  gatherings  and was distinguishing himself there by his skill in reading  and writing  of course  he had received two tickets  and equally of  course  being the boy he was  he had planned to take sallie with him to  the lecture  great was sallie s prospective pleasure  the event of her  lifetime it was to be  to walk with mark through the crowded streets   both neatly dressed  to walk boldly forward with the throng  and present  their tickets of admittance to the great hall  hitherto seen only from  the outside  to move down the long aisles as those who had a right  and  select their seats unquestioned by police  in short  to be like other  people  part of the great well to do world   this was sallie s joy     she had washed and mended her best calico dress  she had sewed buttons  on the pretty cape  according to mrs  roberts  directions  she had tried  on the neat bonnet which had been manufactured for her by mrs  roberts   own fingers  and  altogether  sallie had probably gotten  during these  two days  more enjoyment out of gough s lecture than many others  who  had heard him a dozen times  ever secured  i do not think it any wonder  that  as she rocked and sewed  and thought out her great thought  there  fell tears on the work she was doing           chapter xxiv      for you don t know what may come        this was the thought  suppose dirk colson should want to take his  sister  sallie did not believe it in the least probable  she had not  that amount of faith in dirk colson  but suppose he should  mart could  not go  for the reason that she would have nothing to wear     and here was sallie s pretty cape  which would cover the worst of her  dress  and her pretty bonnet  which she knew would make a picture of  mart  but if she lent them it meant staying at home to sallie   could   she do it  could she bear to think of such a thing  what would mark say   what would he do with his other ticket     would she be likely ever to have another chance to go to that wonderful  hall  and be like other folks     but  mart  had never been anywhere in her life      and i   said poor sallie  catching her breath with a sob   have been  often for a walk on the brightest streets  and looked in at the shop  windows  and everything  i  most know i will help her to go if i can      young ried had no conception of the sacrifice for which he had asked     it is little wonder  surely  that sallie s voice faltered that same  evening  as she explained to mart  who had slipped in for a bit of talk   that if ever she wanted to go anywhere very bad  she was to let sallie  know  and she should have her cape and bonnet to wear  then she had  anxiously planned for her a way to mend her dress  so that it would look  quite well under the cape  and she had even urged        now do  mart  if anybody should want you to go don t say you won t  but  take your chance  for you don t know what may come      also she bore with patience mart s scornful laugh  and emphatic  statement that no chances ever came to her  and nobody ever wanted her  to go anywhere  as she talked she grew interested and eloquent   urged earnestly that mart should embrace the first opportunity to go  somewhere  and wear her new cape and bonnet  at the same time she was  silent about the lecture  suppose no chance should come  then it would  be doubly hard to mart to have had the possibility suggested  the same  delicate reasoning had held her from dwelling on her own prospects  some  people would have been very much astonished over the amount of delicate  consideration for the feelings of others which could be found in that  little room     dirk loitered strangely over his meagre dinner the next afternoon  it  was late  for he had secured a position at last in one of the printing  offices  and was apt to take his meals at any hour when it happened to  be convenient to do without him at the office  he had only been three  days at work  and mart had taken little notice of the new departure   except to remark grimly that it would not last  but to sallie she had  boasted that dirk had gone to work as hard as anybody  if somebody could  only have told dirk that his sister ever boasted of him it might have  helped him much during these days      what are you hanging around for  you ve got all there will be to eat in  this house to day  and it is time you were off   this was the ungracious  manner in which the sister took note of his lingering  she was painfully  afraid that he had already grown weary of regular employment  and the  fear made her voice gruffer than usual     his reply amazed her  in fact  it amazed himself        mart  i ve got tickets to a show   a nice place   and i want you to go  along       humph   said mart   that is a likely story      then he grew earnest  displayed his treasures  and urged her  acceptance  quite astonished with himself the while   did  he really  want her to go  he wondered  or did he want to please mrs  roberts     you would have been interested  an hour later  to have seen mart skip up  the rickety stairs leading to the calkins abode  you would probably have  thought that she endangered life or limb by her rapid movements  but  mart was used to such staircases  and the news she had to communicate  required haste      there s a chance   she said  breathless with speed and eagerness    sallie calkins  there s a chance  and you d never guess how  dirk he  wants me to go to a show with him this very night  he s got tickets  it  is a big show   where all the grand folks go  it is in the very biggest  hall in this city  and dirk he says i am to go  sallie calkins  do you  mean it  truly  that i am to wear your lovely new bonnet and cape  do  you suppose i can really go anywhere  i don t known why dirk wants me to  so bad  but he coaxed and coaxed      poor sallie  she stooped quickly to pick up a pin from the floor  so  that mart might not get a glimpse of her eyes with the sudden tears in  them  yet  as she stooped  she made her final  grand sacrifice  mart  should go     then she entered with entire abandon into the preparations  not only her  bonnet and cape  but her shoes  new ones that mark had bought her with  his first earnings after his illness  were to attend the lecture     she rejoiced over the excellent fit of the shoes  she did more than  this  as mart watched the process of buttoning them  and remarked  complacently that she shouldn t wonder if dirk would buy her a pair some  day  when he earned money enough  she kept her lip from curling with  an incredulous sneer  you will remember that she had not the slightest  faith in dirk     neither must i forget that there was another thing to lend  her comb   in order that mart s wonderful yellow hair might be for once reduced  to something like order  and at the risk of leading you to think that  sallie was altogether too  aesthetic  for her position in life  i shall  have to confess that this was her hardest bit of sacrifice  her comb was  so new and so pretty     however  it did its duty on mart s tawny locks  and the transforming  effect was marvellous  in fact  when all was ready  the cape adjusted   the hat which mrs  roberts had shown her how to wear set on the yellow  head  sallie said not a word  but went to the packing box in the corner  which served as a treasure cupboard  and drew forth the one possession  about which she had been utterly silent  a little hand glass which mark  had brought her one winter evening just before he was hurt  a cheap   little  ugly glass  which you would have turned from in disgust  saying  that it made your nose awry  and your chin protrude and your eyes  squint  and was altogether horrid  but  held before mart s glowing face   what a secret did it reveal  mart looked  and was silent  too  and went  home in a hushed frame of mind to wait for dirk  home was deserted  the  mother had dragged her wearied body out for a day of  light  work  the  time had gone by when she was able to do any that people called heavy   where the father was  none of the family knew  and their chief hope  concerning him was that he would stay away as long as possible     i find myself longing to give you an idea of what that elegant   brilliantly lighted hall  with its brilliant audience  was to this girl   and being unable to do it     when people live so far below us that our every day experiences are to  them like a day at the world s fair  it is very hard indeed to describe  how our special treats affect them     it is a treat to everybody to hear gough  how then can i tell you  what it was to this girl and her brother  dirk listened  he must  have listened well  for long afterward he was able to repeat entire  paragraphs  and to imitate the manner of the great orator with  remarkable skill   yet at the time he would have seemed to a close  watcher to have been absorbed in another way  he looked at mart somewhat  as he had on that sabbath when his acquaintance with mrs  roberts began   but the thought which had dimly haunted him that day blossomed on this  evening  certainly mart looked like mrs  roberts  it might be folly to  think so  doubtless the fellows would make no end of fun of him if he  should ever tell them so  which he meant to take excellent care not to  do  but the fact remained  that in sallie s bonnet and cape  and  above  all  with the waves of hair floating about her  there was a look which  instantly and strongly reminded him of that lady     there was another listener at the lecture who was unexpectedly present   part of poor sallie s trial had been to tell her brother  who had been  radiant for a week over the prospect of taking her  that she had with  her own hand put away the blessing  how would mark take it  dirk s  forlorn looking sister was no favorite of his  i think it would have  been very difficult to have convinced him that there was a trace of mrs   roberts in her face     but such curious creatures are we that it actually hurt sallie to see  how quietly he took the great sad news of her sacrifice  after the first  start of surprise  he seemed preoccupied  and she could almost have  thought that he did not hear her explanation  she had much ado to keep  back the tears  but she had made a special little feast for him that  evening  with a white cloth on the table  and a cup of actual tea   and the cup set in a saucer  she was not going to spoil the scene with  tears  so after a little she said  cheerily        now you have a chance to do something nice for somebody  who will you  take on your ticket       i was thinking   he answered  slowly   you know it is a temperance  lecture  and it is by a wonderful man  the fellows in the shop have been  talking about him all day  and they say you just can t help  thinking   when he gets agoing  and i was just thinking  what if we could get  him   to go  and he would listen  and get to thinking      there are no italics that will give you an idea of the peculiar emphasis  which the boy put on the pronouns  sallie understood  that  he  could  mean but one person in the world  but her brother must have answered the  look on her face  for she spoke no word      sometimes they  do   sallie  there was old pete  you know      oh  yes  sallie knew old pete  every body in that alley knew him  a  notorious drunkard once  of the sort which people  even good christian  people  are apt to pronounce hopeless  yet now he wore a neat suit of  clothes every day  and brought home twenty pounds of flour at one  time in a sack  and bought his coal by the barrel  wonderful things  occasionally happened in that alley      yes   said sally   that is true  and old pete wasn t much like him      the tone spoke volumes  it would have almost angered her  even now  to  have had it hinted that old pete was superior to that father  though  hardly a person acquainted with the two but would have said that there  was more hope for old pete  even in his miserable past  than for this  one     how they managed it  those two  the difficult task of getting him  persuaded to go  find then the more difficult task of keeping him  sufficiently sober to get there  would make a story in itself  i fancy  there are many such stories in real life which will never get told  the  probabilities are  if they were  some wise critic would pronounce them  unnatural and sensational     suffice it to say that the task was accomplished  and among the most  attentive listeners to the great speaker that evening was sallie s  father  while she sat at home and mended a badly torn jacket  and  cried now and then  and was glad and sorry and proud and frightened and  hopeful by turns all that long evening     i am not sure but it was better for her that she sat at home  i don t  know just what she might have done had she been in the hall to see her  father  at the close of the meeting  shamble forward with the crowd  and  sign his name to the total abstinence pledge     she might have screamed out in her excitement  or she might have  fainted  for although there were those who said  some with a sneer  and  some with a sigh  that  signing the pledge would not amount to anything   the miserable fellow could not keep a pledge to save his life   sally  would have thought nothing of the kind  she had faith in her father s  word     it is a wonderful stimulus to have some one who believes in us           chapter xxv      what do you hope to accomplish         do you know   said mrs  roberts  addressing gracie dennis  who  with  young ried  had waited in the hall for her to join them  they were ready  for the lecture  and were to take up mr  roberts on the way    do you  know that i have a desire which i see no way of realizing  if mr  colson  should bring his sister with him to night i should like so much to get  possession of her and bring her home with me  but i have been planning  all day  and see no possible excuse for such an apparently wild  proceeding      i want you to notice how naturally mrs  roberts said  mr  colson   she  never talked about dirk under any other name  she even taught herself to   think  of him as  mr  colson   consequently  when she spoke the name in  his presence  there was not a trace of unnaturalness in tone or manner   the others tried in vain to follow her example  dr  everett could  not speak of him in this way without slight hesitation and a touch of  embarrassment   the truth is   said he   i think  dirk  all the week   and on the sabbath i find it impossible to reach up to  mr  colson   without an effort   there was no touch of  reaching up  or reaching  down  about mrs  roberts  talk with her pupils  it is possible that this  is one link in the chain of influence which she was weaving around them     gracie dennis  face expressed curiosity  and when they were seated in  the carriage  she referred to the cause        but flossy  i cannot imagine why you should want to do such a thing  it  will certainly be too late to night to try to get acquainted with her  i  should think some time when you could have an unbroken evening would be  the better for experimenting       for some sorts of experimenting it would   mrs  roberts answered   smiling quietly   my experiment  in part at least  was to see how the  pink room might impress her       flossy shipley      when gracie took refuge in that name her hostess knew she was not only  much excited  but a trifle disapproving  at such times she made haste to  change the subject     it happened that the thing for which she had been planning  shaped  itself so naturally as to give not the slightest color or premeditation  to the act     when dirk and his sister worked their way through the dense crowds to  the open air they discovered that it was raining heavily  for almost  the first time in her life the fact struck terror to mart colson s soul   ordinarily no duck could have been more indifferent to a rain storm  than herself  on this evening she gave vent to her dismay in short   expressive words      sallie s bonnet    and cape   this last  after a moment s thought   and  shoes   she added  as the magnitude of her troubles grew upon her     drawn up close to the sidewalk stood a carriage and a pair of horses  that dirk could not help giving admiring attention to  despite the rain   a fine horse always held his attention  no thought of the occupants of  the carriage came to him  not even after a head leaned forward and a  hand beckoned  of course it was beckoning to somebody else  then a clear  voice spoke        mr  colson      he started quickly forward  there was but one person who ever said  mr   colson   and besides  that voice belonged only to one      i want your sister to go home with me  it is raining so hard that she  ought not to walk  and i should like very much to have her stay with me  to night  won t you ask her to  please      if mrs  roberts had been asking a favor  instead of conferring one  her  voice could not have been sweeter and more winning     dirk went back to his sister  too much bewildered by the state of  affairs even to express surprise   mart   he said   she wants you      a quick spring to the sidewalk  and young ried was standing beside mart    it is raining so hard   he explained   mrs  roberts would be very glad  if you would come      and mart  thinking of nothing at all  save sallie s bonnet and cape and  shoes  turned toward the waiting carriage     mr  ried had his umbrella raised  and carefully shielded the bonnet   assisting its wearer to enter the carriage with as much courtesy as he  had bestowed on gracie dennis but a few moments before  not a movement  was lost on the watching dirk     when the door was closed and the goodnights had been said   mrs  roberts  leaning from the carriage again for that purpose   and when the horses  had dashed around the corner  he still occupied his position on the  curbstone  gazing down the street  gazing at nothing unless he saw a  reflection of his own bewildered thoughts      come   said a policeman who knew him  and was therefore suspicious    what are you hanging about here for  move on       humph   said dirk  as he slowly took his hands out of his pockets   eyes still fixed on the corner where the carriage had turned   what if i  should      something in his eye would have told mrs  roberts  had she been there   that he meant more than moving down the street  though that he presently  did  regardless of wind and rain     meantime the bonnet and cape in the carriage stepped somewhat into the  background  and the girl who wore them allowed herself once more to  think of her individuality  and to wonder at her position  she sat bolt  upright on the edge of the soft  gray seat  and gazed about her as well  as she could by the glimmer of the street lamps  she in a carriage  mart  colson sitting on a back seat  beside a grand lady  and rolling down the  avenue  who would have supposed that such a thing could have happened to  sallie calkins  bonnet  mrs  roberts recognized the bonnet and cape with  a smile of satisfaction  she had studied much over the possibilities of  this girl s costume  was it probable that she had anything suitable to  wear to a lecture  she had passed the cellar where the girl lived but  once  and had had but one glimpse of her  yet these glimpses had been  enough to render it highly improbable that she had any street costume   then  had mrs  roberts canvassed the possibilities of getting a  street suit for her  there were apparently insurmountable difficulties  in the way  she was too utterly unacquainted with the ground to venture   besides  there were reasons for believing that anything of value would  find its way from that cellar to a pawnbroker s in a very short space of  time     having spent hours over many different schemes  and rejected each one as  liable to bring disaster  mrs  roberts was obliged to betake herself to  prayer  if the watching saviour wanted her to work through the medium  of this lecture on this particular child of his  he could certainly see  that she was present  could furnish her with clothes to wear  either  through herself or some other of his servants  she would wait and watch     not once had she thought of sallie calkins and the new bonnet that her  own fingers had helped to fashion  yet here it was beside her on the  head of this girl  toward whom she was drawn  the fact made mrs  roberts  radiant     she said almost nothing to the startled prisoner at her side  beyond a  murmured   so glad you let me carry you home with me   then she drew a  bright colored wrap about her  and left her to her amazement  while the  eager tongues of the rest of the party talked continuously     by the way  you are not acquainted with the pink room  i think  you  should see it before it is invaded for the night  large  it is  i think  little people sometimes have a peculiar fondness for large rooms   mrs  roberts had  the walls were tinted with what might be called  a suggestion of pink  with just a touch of sunset gold about the  mouldings     the carpet was soft and rich  it gave back no sound of footfall  it was  strewn with pink buds  some just opening into beauty  some half blown   accustomed to the sight of elegant carpets as you are  you would  almost have stooped to pick one of these buds  they looked so real  the  curtains to the windows were white  but lined with rose pink  they were  looped back with knots of pink ribbons  the bed was a marvel of pink  and white drapery  so was the dressing bureau  the easy chairs were  upholstered in soft grays with a pinkish tinge  and the tidies  lavishly  displayed  were all of pink and white  there was nothing conventional  about the room  a professional would have been shocked by some of its  appointments  many a lady of wealth  accustomed to having things as   they  decree  would have been more than doubtful over the pink ribbons  and the profusion of white drapery  aside from the carpet  and a  choice picture or two  there was nothing especially expensive about the  furnishings  it was simply a room in which mrs  roberts had allowed her  own sweet little fancies to take her captive     the gas was lighted  the door was ajar into a toilet room  a lavish  display of great  beautiful towels could be seen as you peeped in  and  various touches told of an expected guest  flowers were blossoming  on the mantel  and a tiny vase which stood on a bracket near the  toilet stand held a single rose of a peculiar hue and perfume  which had  blossomed for this hour  at least  mrs  roberts thought so     into this room  in all its purity and beauty  went sallie calkins   bonnet and cape and her strong  new  thick shoes  and the wearer thereof  pushed the bonnet away from her flushed face  and stood and looked about  her     down stairs they discussed in curious tones  not her  but the mistress  of the mansion      flossy  i do think you are too queer for anything  why don t you have  her go to katy s room  katy is away for the night  you know  and i m  sure her room is as neat and pretty as can be  imagine what a contrast  it would be to anything that she has ever seen  mr  ried  you ought to  see the room into which she has been put  there isn t a more elegant one  in the house  some of its furnishings are so delicate that i hardly like  to touch them  what sort of a disease is it that has taken mrs   roberts  do you suppose  to send her there  flossy  she will get no rest  to night  she will be afraid of that immaculate bed       this  of course  was gracie dennis     mr  roberts looked from her to his wife   his face smiling  curious  yet  with a sort of at rest expression      what do you hope to accomplish  flossy   he asked the question as  one who was pleased to watch a new experiment  yet felt sure that the  experimenter had an end to attain which would justify any measures that  she might take  mr  roberts had believed in his wife when he chose her  from all others  but he was learning to believe in her in a peculiar  sense  as one led by a hand that made no mistakes     she turned to answer his question  her face bright  yet half puzzled        i am not sure that i can explain to you what i hoped for   she said   i  caught the idea from mr  ried       from me   and the young man thus mentioned looked so astonished and  incredulous that gracie laughed      he is sure he never thought of anything so wild   she said  gayly    flossy  you must find a better excuse than that       yet it was something that he said  do you remember telling me  not  long ago  about your sister s idea that all the world had lost its place  because of sin  that god intended everything here to be beautiful  and  all life to be bright with joy  and that satan had gotten hold of men s  lives  and was trying to ruin them  and that every beautiful creation  was god s picture to the world of what his intention had been  i m  telling it poorly  but it made a very deep impression  this girl s face   you know  is beautiful  it is what god meant some faces to be  at least   i mean he has given her the frame for a face of beauty  i have a vague   half understood sort of wish to give her a glimpse of harmony  something  that will fit her golden hair and lovely complexion  and see what she  will think of god s idea  and whether she will understand that it is sin  which has spoiled it  and whether she is willing to serve the author of  her ruin  i don t believe i am making myself plain  but i know what i  mean  at least       if we do not  i think it must be because you have caught a thought from  god  that we are not able to reach up to      it was mr  roberts who made this reply  something in his wife s  experiment had deeply moved him     as for mr  ried  his face lighted  as it always did  at the mention of  his sister s name      sometimes i almost think that it is ester still at work  and that he  lets her work through this woman      it was what he said to gracie dennis in an aside  mrs  roberts had  already gone to see in person to the comfort of her guest           chapter xxvi      o lord  take dirk  too        she found her standing before the mirror  by reason of the fact that she  understood no pretty trick of braid or curl  her long yellow hair hung  just as nature had made it  with no waves or ripples save those which  had grown with its growth  it fell about her now like a sunset cloud   she had taken from the vase near at hand a rose  which she had pushed  in among the masses of hair  with no knowledge as to how it should be  arranged  or  indeed  thought  yet the effect was something which made  mrs  roberts give an involuntary start of admiration     still it was evident that  though apparently gazing at herself  she was  thinking away beyond herself  it is doubtful if at that moment she saw  the flower  or her own reflection  or knew that she was looking  her  eyes had the faraway expression which one sometimes sees in great power  on faces like hers  she turned as mrs  roberts  having softly knocked  and received no answer  softly entered  and her first words indicated  the intensity of her thought  whatever it was        dirk has  got  to go there       go where   asked mrs  roberts  startled out of the words she meant to  speak  startled by the hint of power in the voice and manner      of whom are you thinking  my dear girl  and where do you want him to  go       i m thinking about dirk  ma am  i thought about him all the evening   the man made me  and i ve made up my mind  he s  got  to go to heaven      i suppose i cannot give you an idea of the force in her voice  it was  as though a resolution  from which there could be no appeal  had been  taken  and the person resolving felt her own power to accomplish  it  was altogether an unexpected answer to mrs  roberts  she did not know  whether to be half frightened or to laugh     she sat down in one of the easy chairs to study the girl  and consider  what answer to make  mart  meantime  turned back to the survey of  herself in the mirror  or to the survey of whatever she saw there  and  continued talking        i never knew much about heaven  you may guess that  if you have ever  been in our alley  only lately  sallie calkins she s been telling me  what you told her  and i had a kind of notion that you must know what  you was talking about  and that it was for rich folks and grand folks  like you  but the man told about that madge  you know  to night  an  awful drunkard and swearer  and all that  how she reformed and went to  heaven  dirk ain t no drunkard  but he will be  everybody says he will   because father is such an awful one  mother  she s never had no hope of  him  she says father didn t drink till he was most twenty  and then he  begun  and she s looking for dirk to begin  and i haven t thought he  could help it either  what if he doesn t care for it much yet  he will   it s likely  i ve never told nobody that  not even sallie  and i ve been  mad at mother every time she said any such thing  but all the time i ve  been expecting him to begin  and i know well enough  when once they   begin   how it goes on  but that man to night told things that made a  difference  he says that god can keep them from wanting to drink  and  help them right straight along  and that they can go to heaven as well  as the next one  i ve wanted nice things for dirk all my life  but i  never saw no way to get them  and it made me mad  to night i saw a way   but i never had no kind of a notion how heaven looked till i come into  this room  and see the light and the flowers and the shine  and another  room spread out there in the glass  and now i know  and dirk shall go      mrs  roberts was in no mood for laughing  the tears were dropping slowly  on the flower she held in her hand  mart saw in the glass just then a  sight which seemed to add to her surprise  she turned wondering eyes on  her hostess      what are you crying for   she asked   don t spoil the flower  it is  like the one dirk bought me once  he said you sent it to me  i kept it  most a week  i took it over to sallie s  and she got fresh water for it  every day  somehow  and it was then she begun to tell me what you said  about heaven  and i thought if god had made such flowers as that for  you  it was likely he had made a heaven for you  but i didn t believe it  was for dirk till to night  and i didn t have no kind of a notion how  it looked till just now  do you  believe  what that man said  that  folks like dirk can go  of course  if madge went  why dirk would have a   right   he is bad just because he  has  to be  he never had no chance  to be anything else  and he ain t very bad  anyhow  nothing to compare  with some   her voice was almost fierce in its earnestness  she was  beginning to resent the creeping doubt that mrs  roberts  silence  suggested     careful words must be spoken now  what if this awakening soul should be  turned aside  no wonder that the unspoken words were prayers      dirk has a  right  to go to heaven   she said  steadily  sweetly    there is not the shadow of a doubt as to his right  no one in the  world  not satan himself  can deprive him of it  and it is not only his   right   but his duty to go       then he shall      i wish i could give you an idea of the strength in the girl s voice  it  almost carried conviction with it to mrs  roberts  heart      come and sit down   she said  and she drew her towards one of the low  cushions  if mart sat on that  her head would be just where a gentle  hand could stroke the masses of hair      let me talk with you about this  you are mistaken in one thing  dirk is  very bad  he is bad enough to shut him out of heaven forever      the girl started  and tried to fling off the caressing hand      so are you   said the gentle voice      oh   me   don t talk about me  whoever said i wasn t bad  let me go  i  want to go home  i don t care how hard it rains       and so am i   continued the gentle voice     the girl on the cushion ceased struggling to free herself from the  caressing touch  and remained motionless      let me tell you of something that we have each done a great many times   we have been asked and urged and coaxed day after day  and year after  year  to accept an invitation to go to this very heaven  and we have  paid no attention at all  and this  after jesus christ had given his  life to make a way for us to go  is not that being bad       dirk he never had no invitation  never heard anything about it       yes  he has   speaking with quiet firmness   the lord jesus christ told  me to invite him  and i have done so a great many times  and he has made  no answer  and sallie calkins has invited you  and you have treated it  in just the same way       i didn t believe it       isn t that being bad  what has he ever done that you should refuse to  believe his word  when he died an awful death to prove to you that he  was in earnest       you said dirk had a  right  to go       so he has  jesus christ has given him a right  if he will  i have  invited you to my house  and asked you to spend the night in this room   and sleep in this bed  has any person a right to keep you from doing  so       no   an emphatic nod of the head  and a lingering  almost loving look  at the white bed behind her      then cannot you truthfully say that you have a  right  to be here  my  dear girl  it is so faint an illustration of what jesus christ has  done to give you a right to heaven  that i almost wonder at your  understanding it  but can you imagine something of how i should have  felt had i urged you to come to me night after night  for weeks and  years  and you had turned from me with no answer  or else with scorn       you wouldn t have kept on asking me   mart spoke with the assurance of  one who had firm faith in her statement      no  i presume i should not  i would have said after the third or fourth  invitation   if she really will not have anything to do with me i cannot  help it   and i should have tried to forget you  this is one of the many  differences between christ and me  he waits  and asks  and  asks   how  long will you keep him waiting      i have given you only the beginning of the conversation  it was long ere  it was concluded     down stairs mr  ried waited as long as he could  curious to know the  result of mart s first impressions  then he went away  and gracie went  to her room  and the house settled into quiet  and mr  roberts  in the  library  waited for his wife  while she told over again  with tender  words and simple illustrations  the  old  old story   so fitted to the  wants of the world     how many times has there been a like result     it was midnight when they knelt together  the fair child of luxury and  the child of poverty  but the saviour  who intercedes for both  bent  his ear  and heard again the cry of a groping soul  seeking him out of  darkness  and held out his loving  never failing arms  able to reach  down to her depth  and received her to himself  who can tell that story   who can describe how heaven seemed to the girl just then     it was not what mrs  roberts had expected  i cannot even say that it was  what she had hoped for  her faith had not reached to such a height  at all  she could hardly have put into words what she hoped  when she  ventured to try to tell it to the friends in the parlor  and to you  i  doubt whether you understood  she thought to get a hold on the girl   to show her something of god s beauty and love  as it shone through  herself  to make her long after something her life did not give  and  to gradually lead her to seek after satisfaction in christ  a long  process  something that should unfold gradually  with many discouraging  drawbacks  and some days that would look like utter failures  she had  schooled herself to be prepared for this  but she had not looked for him  to exert his mighty power to save in a moment  how it had touched her  to find a soul  hungry  not for itself  but for a brother  i shall not  attempt to tell  the first words she said  after she went back to her  waiting husband  a little after midnight  were these        he could not do many mighty works there because of their unbelief  i  think that is what is the matter with the world to day  i wonder if he  would not be pleased with one who could throw herself at his feet with  a childlike abandon of faith  and expect wonders  yes  and  impossibilities  just as a child feels that  anything  can be done by  father  god has shamed my faith to night  it is as though i had  asked for a crumb of bread  and he gave me the entire loaf  that girl  up stairs has not heard of him before as a saviour for  her   has never  thought of such a thing  or  at least  dreamed of its possibility  and  yet she has given herself to him  and evan  what do you think were the  first words she said   o lord  take dirk  too   she is on her knees at  this moment praying for him  if you could have seen her face when it  first dawned upon her that she could tell god about him  and ask for his  mighty power to be exerted in his behalf  it would have been a picture  for your lifetime  oh  evan  evan  why can we not expect great things of  god            chapter xxvii      an awful problem       isn t it strange  the ways the lord takes to answer prayers     much prayer had been made for dirk colson  but few had thought of his  sister  sallie calkins  it is true  had come with trembling steps into  the light of christ s love  and had immediately desired to have mart  enjoy it with her  but was very trembling and doubting as to her ability  to reach mart  or to influence her in the right direction  she sent the  bonnet and cape to the lecture with a prayer  but she did not look for  the prayer to be answered  verily  he has to be content with faith  less  than a grain of mustard seed      was the rest of the story an answer to prayer  we are to remember that  he has strange ways  events startling enough in their import followed  each other in rapid succession  in the first place  dirk s father  poor   wrecked man  returned no more  whether he had wandered among the network  of railroads which lined the southern portion of the city  and lost his  life there  or whether he had fallen into the river  or just how he had  disappeared  could not be discovered  there were three men killed by an  accident on the road one night  but their disfigured bodies were buried  before dirk heard of it  there was a man seen struggling in the water  off the lower wharf one evening  but he sank before help could reach  him  and his body was not recovered  there were half a dozen men killed  by a boiler explosion  but that was not heard of in time to look into  it  there were so many ways in which the wreck might have gone out  of life and left no sign  they were safe in supposing that he was  intoxicated  and that was about all they could be perfectly sure of   concerning him  that  and the fact that he came no more  of  course  there was no such search for him as is made for the man of  respectability and position  to one who had some idea of the worth of a  soul  it was pitiful to see what a tiny ripple this disappearance made  on the surface of life     a moment of startled questioning by those who lived in the immediate  neighborhood  a few women with aprons thrown over their heads  congregating in groups around the pump  or before the door of the  bakery  a crowd of dirty children  stopping their play for a moment  and  speaking lower   then the tide of noisy  fighting  swearing life went  on     one was gone out from it  whither  none knew  few cared  and there were  such crowds and  crowds  left  how could he be missed     one missed him   an abused  insulted  downtrodden woman  one whom  years  before  he had promised to love and cherish until death parted them   and had broken the vows almost as soon as taken  and never renewed them  again  yet that woman wept bitter tears over his absence  watched for  him  listened nightly for his staggering footsteps  rose up from her  heap of straw in the corner in the middle of the night  and set wide  open the cellar door  and listened to the angry voices floating down to  her from some drunken brawl further up the street  if  perchance  she  might hear  his   listened  and held her breath  and quivered all over  with hope and fear  then crept back to her miserable bed  covered  her head with the ragged quilt  and cried herself into a few hours of  forgetfulness      she is crying herself to death about him   mart said  there was  surprise mingled with awe in her voice     she told it to dirk  and the two stood thoughtfully for a moment looking  out at the one window  they carefully avoided looking at each other   they did not understand  to them there was simply relief in the father s  absence  they had no trace of love for him in their hearts  the word   father  meant nothing to them but misery  still there was that in them  which respected the mother s grief  they tried to shield her  dirk  of  his own thoughtfulness  brought home a bit of tea in a paper  and bought  half a pint of milk at the corner bakery  and mart took lessons of  sallie  and made a delicate slice of toast  and borrowed sallie s one  cup and saucer to serve the tea in  she was disappointed that the mother  cried  and could hardly drink the tea  she was even almost vexed that  the mother said with tears that  poor jock always did like tea so   much   and she had always thought that maybe if he could have had it  hot and strong he would not have taken to the drink      mart had no faith in this  no belief that anything in her father s past  life could have kept him from the drink  but she held herself silent   and let the tears have their way  all the time she had in her heart one  great solemn regret  there was one who would have helped her father   would and could have saved him  even from rum  what if she  his  daughter  had known the lord jesus  and could have taken the miserable  father to him and had him transformed  mart had no doubt about  his   power to do it  an unanswerable argument had been given her  no infidel  need try to assail her now     but the father  why had everybody kept silence  and let him sink away     awful     why had not she known christ  why had she not listened to sallie but a  week before  why had not dirk learned the way and saved his father  an  awful problem  mart s life must henceforth be shadowed by it     meantime what was mrs  roberts to do for this new born soul  how was she  to help her  and  through her  to help her brother     she  in her elegant home  sat down to study this problem     life at east fifty fifth street was so far removed from life in the  alley that she knew nothing about the missing father  days passed   and  busy with many claims of society  she had made no movement toward  helping the girl  and knew as yet no way to do it  yet she carried  her on her heart  monday evening came and went  and still she had been  detained from any effort     one afternoon her thoughts shaped themselves into action  she would go  and see mart  she would get dirk to protect her in her journey down the  alley  also  in accomplishing this  she would accomplish another thing   she would call on dirk at his place of business  the chief of the office  was a christian man  yet she had reason to believe that he knew less  about dirk  and cared much less for him  than he did for his little dog   who sat in the window and barked at passers by     she had no difficulty in securing attention  ladies were not often  admitted  but a card bearing the name  mrs  evan roberts  was sufficient  passport among any of the business men of the city     mr  stone was more than ready  he was eager to serve her  what could  he do for the elegantly dressed lady whose carriage waited at the door   while she came in person among the bales and boxes  her business must be  urgent     it was  could she speak with mr  colson just for a moment  she would not  detain him long  but she wished to make an appointment with him for the  next day      mr  colson   the chief and his perplexed assistant looked at each other  thoughtfully  and shook their heads  there was no such person connected  with their establishment  she must have the wrong number     no  she was positive      he told me only three days ago that he was in your employ  he is on the  third floor  i believe      the gentlemen looked at each other again      colson   repeated mr  stone   there is certainly a mistake  briggs is  in charge on the third floor front  and dickson has the back rooms  no   mrs  roberts  we have no such name among our men  i am positive      but mrs  roberts gently held her ground  she was sure she was not  mistaken  for she had talked with him about his work and the different  men  he was in mr  briggs  department  she felt quite sure  he was not a  foreman  she explained  but quite a young man  had been there but a  few weeks  and dr  everett was the one who had interested himself in  securing the place     light of some sort began to dawn on the perplexed faces of the  gentlemen      can she mean black dirk  do you suppose   questioned the elder  looking  hard at his associate     then came the sweet voice of the visitor      oh  no  he is not a colored gentleman  his name is colson   mr  derrick  colson       that is the one   said the gentleman  quickly  should he laugh or be  annoyed     it took but a moment after that to summon  mr  derrick colson   black  he was  certainly  not only by reason of his naturally dark skin  but  because of the grimy work  whatever it was  which fell to his lot  his  big apron was soiled with ink and oil  and daubed with bits of dark  color which seemed not to be either     he came forward with his usual shambling gait  and an additional shade  of sullenness apparent on his face  but it glowed a swarthy red when he  recognized the lady      good afternoon  mr  colson   she said  and she held forth her  delicately gloved hand     his own went forward to meet it  then drew suddenly back      it is not clean enough   he said   there s ink or something on it       but the lavender kids were not withdrawn      never mind the ink  a little honest soil never hurt anybody   and the  rough  dark hand was taken in her own     then occurred a few moments  chat  at least the lady chatted with  easy familiarity  she referred to the  social parlors   to the  monday  evenings   to miss dennis   musicale   to half a dozen themes about  which the bewildered gentlemen within hearing knew nothing     could it be that the low voiced  gentle lady was trying to give  them  a  lesson as well as to talk with dirk  finally she made an appointment for  the next afternoon  would his employer be so kind as to excuse him for  an hour  if convenient  certainly  it would be convenient to please mrs   evan roberts     dirk was very much embarrassed  he blushed and stammered  and did not  know how to answer any of the kindnesses  but there were two things  during the interview which gave mrs  roberts more pleasure than you   perhaps  are able to understand     one was  that at sight of her he had suddenly snatched off the paper cap  which he wore  and the other  that having set it again on his head as  he turned from her  he glanced back from the door  and  in answer to her  bow and smile  lifted the ugly little cap with an air that was an exact  imitation of young ried  and yet so well done that you would not have  thought of it as an imitation     mrs  roberts could have clapped her hands  but she did not  instead she  said  sweetly        i am very glad that mr  colson is in the employ of a christian  gentleman  he is greatly in need of help from all christian sources  and  i am sure there is that in him which will respond to judicious effort      then she let the bewildered man attend her to her carriage  and went her  way rejoicing                                                but there were plans being laid for her at that moment of which she knew  nothing     to morrow she would go and see the golden haired girl  in a  neatly packed basket she had certain things  among them a bonnet and a  sack that she knew would fit the hair and face  and she believed would  give mart pleasure  if only she could contrive a natural way to give  them to her  and there could be planned ways of keeping them safe from  the pawnbroker s grasp  all this time she knew nothing of the fact  that the hand which had grasped for years to furnish the pawnbroker was  stilled forever  it had not once occurred to dirk to tell her  it is a  solemn fact that in this greater excitement he had actually forgotten  it  as for the  christian employer   he did not know of it to tell  he  had not so much as known whether black dirk had a father or not  he was  simply a street rough  whom dr  everett was trying experiments with  and  because there was an unusual pressure on the office  and poor help was  better than none  he was helping the experiment     however  when dirk went home from the office that night he remembered  that the father was gone     mart met him at the door  a look of solemn determination on her face      dirk   she said    she s  going  as sure as you live  she s going   she s been bad all the afternoon  sallie says that mark s doctor will  come to see her   she knows he will  and mark shall go for him as soon  as he comes home  but i don t mean to wait for no doctor  i want  her   to come   she  knows the way  and i want mother to be told it right   so there won t be no mistake  you go for her  dirk  right off straight   there ain t any time to lose  for i tell you now she s  going   she s  been failing all along  you know  and she has just cried herself down   dirk  will you go for  her  as fast as you can      the confusion of pronouns might have bewildered you  they did not dirk     her   meant to him exactly what it did to mart  he could not think how  it could possibly mean any other person  but this was astounding news  about his mother  it was one thing to have a father disappear  whom he  had simply feared  until he had learned to hate  it was quite another  thing to talk about the going away of the only one who had ever tried to  mend his clothes  and who had sat up nights to wash them when she could     he strode past mart into the wretched room  and looked at the bed in the  corner     the mother was asleep  but on her face was a strange change  a something  that he had never seen there before  worn and sunken as it always was   it made him understand mart s fears      i ll go   he said huskily  and rushed from the house       her   carriage was just rolling down the avenue as his swift feet  cleared the alley  he knew the horses  he was a little ahead of them   but it was not probable that the driver would stop for him      won t you stop that carriage   he said in breathless haste to a  policeman at the corner   i ve got to speak to the lady that s in it       i ll be quite likely to  no doubt   said the policeman  in quiet irony    what rascality are you up to now  dirk   can t  you be decent for a few  days      but dirk was trying to free himself from the detaining hand  and threw  up one arm in a sort of despairing gesture to the coachman  mr  roberts  caught the signal  recognized the face  and in another moment the horses  stood restlessly by the curb stone  and dirk  his embarrassment gone   told his brief story rapidly      father went off a spell ago  and never came back  and mother  she is  sickly  and it set her crying  and she s  going   mart thinks  and i  guess it s so  and mart wants you to come and show her the way  she said  you knew how  and you would come            chapter xxviii      may she go with me        of course she went  and  of course  now that the truth was known   much was done  dr  everett was summoned  the wretched bed  with its  distressing rags  were turned out together  and a comfortable one took  its place  broths and teas and jellies and physical comfort of every  kind were furnished  and the doctor did his best to battle with the  disease that long years of want and misery had fastened upon their  victim  it was all too late  of course  it was true  what mr  roberts  sadly said  that half of the effort  expended years or even months  before  might have saved the poor  tortured life  but now     how awful those  too lates  are  isn t it a wonder that we ever take the  risk of having one ring in our ears forever  there was one thing over  which some of these christian workers shed tears of joy       i  am too late   said dr  everett   but my master has as much power  to day as ever  he can save her      and he did  the poor  tired woman  who years before had remembered an  old story well enough to name her one daughter  martha   in memory of  the one who  loved martha and her sister and lazarus   roused her dull  heart at the mention of his name  and listened while the wonderful story  was told her that he loved not only martha and her sister  but her own  poor  sinful  wrecked self  loved her enough to reach after her  and  call and wait  and prepare for her a home in his glory     dear  why has not some one come with the news before  surely she would  have listened during these long  sad years  well  they made the way  plain  neither was it a difficult thing to do  the woman was weary and  travel stained and afraid  and longed for nothing so much as a place of  refuge  she knew that she was a sinner  she knew that she was  and had  been for many a year  powerless to help herself  why should she not hail  with joy the story of a great and willing helper      come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden   she opened her  eyes with a gleam of eagerness to hear the words   weary    yes  indeed    heavy laden   who more so  if the call was not for her  whom  could  it  mean  what else  why  what  but the glorious old story   i will give you  rest   what wonder that she closed her eyes and smiled  what wonder that  the first words after that were   i ll come  show me how   and he showed  her how      dirk   the sister said  when the mother had gone the last and only  restful journey of her life   dirk   she  went to heaven  and i m going   i ve been wanting to tell you for more than a week  but i didn t know  how   he  asked me to  and i m going  now  you  must   cause we never  had a good time here  and she ll kind of expect it in heaven  and be  looking out for you  she always looked out for you  dirk      then did dirk lose his half sullen self control  and great tears rolled  down his dark cheeks     but the sister shed no tears  she had serious business to attend to   dirk must go to heaven now without fail                                                one day there was an unusual scene in the alley  it was no uncommon  thing to see a coffin carried out from there  but on this day there was  a hearse  and a minister in dr  everett s carriage  and dirk and his  sister  in neat apparel  came out together and were seated in mr   roberts  carriage  and all the boys of the monday evening class walked  arm in arm after the slow moving carriages  and the children of the  alley stopped their placing and their fighting  and the women stood  silent in doorways  and took  most of them  their very first lesson in  the proprieties of life      she s got a ride in a carriage at last  poor soul   said one  thinking  of the worn out body in the coffin  and another said   i wonder what  poor old jock would think of all this      but the scene made its impression  and left its lesson  i think the  voices of some of them were lower during the rest of the day because of  it     what next  it was the question that filled mrs  roberts  thoughts   something must be done for dirk and mart  that fearful alley was no  place for human beings  certainly not for these two  but what to do with  them was a question not easily answered     various plans were proposed  sallie calkins  two rooms were much better  than the cellar in which the colson family had lived  and there was a  chance to rent a room next to sallie s  with a closet opening from it  for dirk  how would it do to have them board with sallie  the suggestion  came first from gracie dennis  and sounded reasonable  mrs  roberts was  almost ashamed to dislike it as much as she did  sallie s neat rooms  were  home  now  the father  for this length of time at least  held to  his pledge  and son and daughter were radiant over him  he had gone to  work  and already the two rooms were taking on an air of greater comfort  because of the little things that he proudly brought home     sallie was doing her part wisely  the table was regularly laid now  with  a white cloth and knives and forks  and two new cups and plates had been  added to the dishes  would it be wise to invade this home just at this  juncture and introduce boarders  mrs  roberts did not believe that it  would  it was not as though the father had an established character   and stood ready to shield his children  they were still acting the  protective  and he had but too recently risen from the depths where dirk  and mart had laughed and jeered at him  besides  the rooms were located  in that dreadful alley  and  do what she would  mrs  roberts could  not feel that that dangerously beautiful face could find a safe  abiding place in that alley  some other way must be thought of     their immediate future was arranged through the intervention of a house  agent  for even that dreary and desolate cellar had its agent  who was  eager to secure his rent  he was unwise enough to undertake to interview  mrs  roberts as she descended from her carriage  not long after it had  followed mart s mother to the grave     he considered this effort of his a special stroke of business energy   he wanted to be patient with the poor  he said  there wasn t an agent  in the city who waited for them oftener than he did  but business was  business  and it stood to reason that he could not depend on a fellow  like dirk  it had been bad enough when the mother was there  but  he couldn t think of such a thing as risking it now  what was he to  understand  did she mean to rent the room for them  and for how long   because it was his duty to look out for the future     what would be more natural than for mrs  roberts  with those two young  things looking on  to say that of course she would be responsible for  the rent as long as they lived in the room  thus reasoned the house  agent     instead of which  mrs  roberts turned toward dirk  her face flushed over  the hardness of a man who could stop a boy and girl on such business on  their way from their mother s grave  and said        if i were in your place  mr  colson  i should not rent these rooms at  all  they are not suited to your sister s needs  i am sure you can do  better      the agent was disgusted    mr   colson   indeed  the disreputable young  scamp whom nobody trusted  he would show this silly woman a fact or two      business is business  he repeated  doggedly   either they must take  the room  and pay the rent in advance  or else they must hustle out this  very night   he had waited now three days after time for decency s sake   and more than that he couldn t and wouldn t do     dirk stood looking from one to the other  the red coming and going on  his swarthy face  here was responsibility  he had not thought of it  before  the mother was not there to count out the hoarded rent with  trembling fingers  and save the wretched home to them for another month   she would never be there again  he had nothing with which to pay rent   he had nowhere to move  yet  she  had called him mr  colson  and seemed  to expect him to act for himself and mart     it was she who answered the agent  but she spoke to dirk      very well  i suppose you are quite as willing to leave here to night as  at any time  if i were you  i would leave immediately  let your sister  come home with me for the night  and until you have time to make other  arrangements      mr  roberts had been summoned to a bank meeting  and had sent ried to  attend his wife  he came forward now  from the carriage where he had  stood waiting  and laid a hand on dirk s arm      and you come home with me to night  colson   he said in a cordial tone   such as he might have used with any young friend   then we shall have a  chance to talk things over and make plans       that is nice   mrs  roberts said  quickly  rejoicing in her heart over  ried s promptness to act   then you can get away from this wretched  place at once  mr  roberts will see to the removal of your goods   whatever you need  and the agent can call on him in the morning  that  will be the simplest way to settle it all  may she go with me      a slight  caressing movement of a gloved hand on the girl s arm  accompanied this question     mart was silent with bewilderment  when had dirk ever before been asked  what  she  might do  or might not do  at first she was half inclined  to scorn the suggestion  then  suddenly  it came to her with a sense  of relief and protection  she was not alone  it was dirk s business to  think of and care for her  would he do it     as for dirk  no wonder that his face was deeply flushed  new thoughts  were struggling in his heart   he  was to decide for mart  he was  the head of the home now  mrs  roberts waited anxiously  she longed  exceedingly to rouse in the boy  who was already grown to the stature of  a man  a sense of responsibility     a moment more  and he had shaken himself free from the spell which  seemed to bind him      we ll do as you say   he spoke with the air of a man who had assumed  his proper place and taken up his duties   mart  you go along with her   and i ll see about things to morrow      and mart  for the first time in her life  received and obeyed in silence  a direction from her brother     possibly mrs  roberts may have been mistaken  but she thought that much  had been accomplished that day     yet none of them realized whereunto this thing would grow     mrs  roberts  when she ushered mart that evening into the pink room  again  and showed her how to manage the hot and cold water  and which  bell to ring if she needed anything  and in every imaginable way treated  her as a guest  whom it was pleasant to serve  had really no plans just  then  no hobby to ride  but simply acted out the dictates of her  heart  you will remember that her christian life had been always  unconventional  the very fact that during her early girlhood she had  been painfully trammelled by what  they  would say or think  seemed to  have had its influence over her later experiences  since she had been  made free  she would be free  indeed  that is  with the liberty with  which christ makes us free  what would please  him  she resolved should  be the one thought to which she would give careful attention  now  it is  perhaps worthy of mention  that this closely following disciple did not  once stop to determine whether it would please him to give such tender  care to this stray child of his  or whether she would be considered  doing not just the thing  in  his  eyes  if she entertained her in the  pink room     about what he could have her do next  she gave much thought  and it was  not for days  or rather weeks  that she caught the possibility of his  meaning that the pink room should really be the girl s own     it was just this way  the weeks went by  and no plan for settling mart  comfortably elsewhere met mrs  roberts  approval  there was constantly  some excellent reason why the one mentioned would not do     meantime they became  she and gracie dennis  more and more deeply  interested in mart  in her wardrobe first   wherever she lives she  should have respectable clothing  thus much is easily settled   so the  matron decreed  and gracie did not gainsay it  she became absorbed in  preparing it  such fascinating work  so many things were needed  and  her skin was so delicate  and her eyes so blue  and gracie s choice of  shades and textures fitted her so precisely  then  when dressed  simple  though her toilet was  her remarkable beauty shone out so conspicuously  as to alarm mrs  roberts whenever she thought of her in shop or store     several times during the weeks  she visited sallie calkins  and looked  about her with a thoughtful air  and came away feeling that it would  not do  there was mark  growing into manhood  a good boy  hard working   respectable  proud of his good  homely sister  and of his reformed  father  the two rooms were taking on every sort of homely comfort that  sallie s skill  helped by mrs  roberts  suggestions  could devise  it  was growing into a model little home in its way  but there was not a  corner in it where mart would fit     then  as the days passed  a subtle  fascinating change began to come  over mart  she slipped quietly into certain household duties  she showed  marvellous skill with her needle  such skill  indeed  that gracie dennis  said more than once   i ll tell you  flossy  what to do with her  put  her in a good establishment  and let her learn the dressmaking trade   she could make her fortune in time   and mrs  roberts smiled  and  assented to the statement  but not to the proposition  there was no  dressmaking establishment known to her where she was willing to place  so young and pretty and ignorant a girl  but she was quite willing that  mart should learn the looping of dresses  and the fitting of sacks and  collars and ruffles  and take many a stitch for her  as well as for  gracie  she was willing to have her do a dozen little nameless things   the ways of doing which she had caught up  until at last the touch of  her fingers began to be felt about the rooms  and mrs  roberts began  to notice that she should miss mart when she went away  still  from the  first time she said this  the thought came afterward with a smile of  satisfaction  and it was but a week afterward that she caught herself  phrasing it  that she should miss her  if  she went away     what about dirk  young ried could have told you more of him during these  days than anybody else  he still stayed at the boarding house  mrs   saunders  the mistress of it  was one whom  if you had known her  you  would feel sure could interest herself heartily in such as he  there  was a bit of a room next to ried s  to be sure  it had been used for a  clothes press  and it took the busy housekeeper half a day to plan how  she could get along without it  but she planned  and offered it to ried  for his  protege       just for the present  you know  until he sees what he can do  poor  fellow   she said  and ried accepted the little room joyfully  and  helped fit it up           chapter xxix     what if i belonged        you think things are taking very rapid strides  well  don t you know  that there come periods when they do just that thing  or appear to  why   even the buds on the trees teach us the lesson  how many springtimes  have you gone to your bed feeling that the season was late  and the  trees were bare  and the fruits would all be backward  and nature was  dawdling along in a very wearisome fashion  and awakened in the morning  to find that there had in the night been a gentle rain  and a movement  of mysterious power among the buds and the grasses  and that now  in the  morning sunshine  the world had burst into bloom  yet  did you really  suppose  after all  that the  work  was done in one night     there was progress of several sorts in the class at the south end  even  a casual observer could have seen a change in the boys that first sunday  after they had attended dirk s mother to the grave  the dignity of  that hour of sorrow was still upon them  even the very reckless and  world hardened will offer a certain degree of respect to death  on  ordinary occasions  the boys might have been merry at dirk s expense   for they saw changes in him  but the memory of his mother s coffin kept  them silent  and let his changed manner have its effect     that sunday was full of small events to dirk  at least they are small  enough when one puts them on paper  though i admit that they looked  large to him  several people interested themselves in his welfare      poor fellow   said mrs  saunders   i suppose his mother tried to do  for him  just as likely as not she had a clean shirt for him of a sunday  morning       you will perceive that mrs  saunders  though all her life a resident  of a large city  was not very well acquainted with the abject poor  in  point of fact  dirk colson had had no extra clothing for his mother to  make clean  but mrs  saunders  full of the motherly thought  yet finding  no trace of a shirt in the bundle of rags that dirk had brought with  him  went down one day into the depths of an old trunk  and brought to  light and mended and washed and ironed a shirt that had long been laid  aside     it lay in its purity on a chair at the foot of dirk s bed on sabbath  morning  he lay still and looked at it for a while  then arose and gave  such careful attention to the soap and water as was new to him  and  arrayed himself in the clean linen     his clothes were whole and clean  mr  roberts had seen to it that he  went respectably dressed to his mother s funeral     a tap at his door a little later  and young ried appeared  shoe brush  and blacking box in hand      want to borrow   he said  in the careless tone of one who might have  supposed that the blacking of his boots was an every day matter to this  boy   i always keep my own  it is cheaper than to depend on the street  boys      dirk said nothing at all  but reached forth his hand  and took the  offered tools  and the hint which came with them  when he went down  to breakfast his boots shone  and his fresh paper collar was neatly  arranged  altogether he was not the boy to whom i first introduced you   i am not sure that policeman duffer would have recognized him  a  collar and a necktie make a great difference in some people s personal  appearance  dirk wondered a little as to where the box of paper collars  came from  the necktie he had just found lying in the bottom of the box   it was the mate of the one young ried wore  but that told nothing  for  both were simple and plain  and could be bought by the dozens in any  furnishing store     it is small wonder that the boys in the class looked at him  nimble dick  wore at first a roguish air  but a sudden memory of dirk s face when he  turned away from his mother s grave came in time  open graves are not  easy things to forget     dirk went to the church that day  went with young ried by invitation   and sat in the pew behind mr  roberts     by the way  the seat which he occupied was another of mr  roberts   peculiarities  three seats were rented by him in a central part of the  large church  one of these seats he and his wife regularly occupied  the  others were almost as regularly occupied by the clerks from the store  who chose to make that their church home  six sittings to a pew  when  a young man chose  mr  roberts was ready to enter into a business  engagement with him  whereby the sitting should be considered his own   mr  roberts considering it to be no part of any one s concern that the  sum for which he thus sub let the sittings was not a tenth of what the  first rental cost  it was in this way that mr  ried owned sittings in  the pew just back of that occupied by mr  roberts  and brought with  him constantly one and another young man  today the young man was dirk  colson     it was all a strange world to him  he had wandered into the gallery  of the mission chapel  and looked down from his perch on the crowd of  worshippers  but this morning he was in the very centre of things  as if  he were one of them  perhaps it is not strange that the startled inquiry  came to his heart  what if i belonged  where did he belong now  he  had lost his place  he must make another  what if it should be in this  neighborhood  among these surroundings  such thoughts did not take  actual shape to him  so that he could have put them into words  they  merely hovered in his atmosphere  mrs  roberts sat so that he could look  at her  which thing he liked to do  it had long since been settled  in his mind that he had one friend  and that one was mrs  roberts  he  admired gracie dennis  too  with a different sort of admiration from  that which he gave to the matron  she might be all very well  and she  was a splendid reader  and he knew that he could imitate her on certain  sentences  at least  and she had taught him to use the type writer  an  accomplishment which he meant to perfect himself in as soon as he had  a chance  in fact  his ambition reached higher than that  one of these  days he meant to make one of his own with certain improvements  who  shall say that dirk was not growing     on this particular day there sat beside mrs  roberts a lady   a  stranger  he could not see her face  but for some reason  which he did  not understand  dirk liked to look at her  she suggested something to  him that seemed like a familiar dream  he thought much about her  and  resolved to see if in her face she looked like any one he ever saw  as  she turned at the close of the service he was looking at her steadily   lo  it was mart     now the possibility had not once suggested itself to his mind  if you  think this doubtful  you merely show that you know nothing about the  transforming effect of a becoming dress  no matter how simple it may  be  remember  dirk had never but twice seen his sister in a bonnet   the first time it was sallie s  and though the effect was sufficiently  startling  yet sallie s bonnet did not fit her face  as this creation  of gracie dennis  fingers did  the second time the bonnet had been a  hideous black one  proffered by an old woman who lived in the story  above them  and whose thoughtfulness mrs  roberts would not mar by  making any mention of the neat one which she had brought in a box that  day  the black bonnet had been like a mask  hiding mart s beauty     the bonnet that she wore now was not of that character  it told a  wonderful story to dirk s astonished gaze  now  indeed  the likeness was  plain  without doubt  the girl whose face lighted with a curious smile  at sight of him  bore a striking likeness to the woman who had smiled at  him whenever she met him     a curious effect this had on dirk  there was that in his sister which  made it possible for her to be something like the woman who had won his  heart  and that sister was in his care  she had said so  he must work  for her  and watch over her     i suppose that sabbath was really the beginning of the surface changes  in mrs  roberts  class  not the beginning to the teacher  but to those  people who only have eyes for strongly marked things     i know that it was but a few weeks afterward that mrs  roberts came home  with such an unusual light in her eyes  and with her face so full of  brightness  that her husband said  inquiringly        what is it  flossy      she turned to him  eagerly  ready to laugh      it is what you will understand  but a great many people wouldn t  it is  so nice that you understand things  i feel just like saying   thank the  lord        do you mean to convey the idea that only a very few favored people feel  like that  i don t know of a person who has not great occasion  what is  your special one       evan  the last boy had his boots blacked  and a fresh paper collar on      mr  roberts threw back his head and laughed   a genial  hearty laugh   his wife looked on  smiling  there is a great deal of character in a  laugh  remember  you would have known that this was a sympathetic one     mr  roberts was entirely capable of realizing what this said to his  wife about the future of her boys  it was becoming certain that their  self respect was awakened     a few days thereafter occurred another of those little things which mark  some characters     dirk  at mrs  saunders  breakfast table on sabbath morning  heard talk  that on monday he recalled  by the way  i should have told you of one  other way in which the sabbath became a marked day to him  he slept in  the little room which opened from ried s  but his meals were picked up  at a restaurant  as occasion offered   a much nicer and surer method of  living than he had ever known before  even the commonest restaurant had  great respectability to him  yet you will remember that he had by this  time taken several suppers in mrs  roberts  dining room  he knew that  there was a difference in things  in fact  his experience now stretched  over infinite differences  but the first time he sat down to mrs   saunders  breakfast table  on a sabbath morning  he discovered another  grade  this by no means belonged to the restaurant class  the sunday  breakfasts and dinners were some of mrs  saunders  quiet ways of helping  along the work of the christian world  many a young man appeared at her  table as the guest of ried or of dr  everett  or of some other of the  boarders  who was unaware that he owed the pleasant experience to the  landlady     well  dirk at the sabbath table heard talk of one general burton  famous  as a soldier  a scholar  and an orator  general burton was in the city   the guest of a prominent man  he was to speak on the following evening  in one of the great halls  and much eager talk was had concerning him   great desire was expressed to hear him  to get a glimpse of him  dirk  listened in silence  but had his own thoughts about what it must be  to have people talking about one  wanting to get a glimpse of one  and  next  what it must be to be intimate with such people  did mrs  roberts  know the great man  he wondered  and then dirk smiled as he thought how  queer it was that he should know mrs  roberts  that he might  in fact   be called intimately acquainted with her     remembering this reverie of his  you will better understand how he felt  on monday morning  as he made his way in haste down a quiet part of one  of the up town streets  intent on an errand that required promptness  to  hear his name called by mrs  roberts      good morning   she said   are you in too great haste to recognize your  friends  i want to introduce you to a friend of mine  general burton   mr  colson  general  this is one of my young men  of whom i told you      whereupon the famous general  hero of many battles  held out his honored  hand  and took dirk s in a cordial grasp  i don t suppose i could  explain to you what an effect this action had on a boy like dirk     there is this comfort  you may be a student of human nature  and  therefore may understand it all without explanation     this is only one of many so called trifles which occurred during the  weeks  to make their indelible impress on the characters of the boys     of course  the monday evenings prospered  reading lessons and  writing lessons  and  as time passed  lessons of all sorts made good  progress     neatly blackened boots  carefully arranged hair  and fresh collars  became the rule instead of the exception     other avenues for improvement opened  it became noised abroad in  christian circles that great transformations were being worked among a  certain set of hard young fellows who had hitherto been best known to  the police  mr  roberts was interviewed by one and another  and one  outgrowth of the talks was that tickets for a course of expensive and  valuable and attractive lectures on popular subjects were placed in  large numbers in mr  roberts  hands for him to use at discretion   moreover  seats were rented in the church towards which most of the boys  gravitated  the one connected with their mission  seats re rented after  mr  roberts  plan  so that as often as there appeared a young man who  cared to have a spot in the church which belonged to him  it could be  had for a very small sum  in fact  as pews rented in that church  a  ridiculously small sum     these are only hints of the channels which time and patience and thought  opened for these young men  on whom  but a short time before  satan  believed himself to have so firm a grip     one feature of the  monday evenings  had  in the course of time  to be  changed  the young teacher of elocution went home      i want to go   she said at last  in answer to her hostess  pleading    i think it quite likely that papa would let me stay and attend school  here  but i am in haste to get home  you need not look sober  flossy   i have had a happier time than i have ever had in my life before  and i  have found here a sort of happiness that will last  it almost breaks my  heart to think of leaving those boys   especially my dear dick bolton   but really  i need to go home and undo certain things that i left badly  done  you don t half know me  flossy shipley  when i came here i was a  regular goose  if you had known what a simpleton i was  and how hateful  i had been about some things at home  you would never have invited me      among other things that were hateful about me  i was a real horror to  my mother  i thought i had reason to distrust and dislike her  when  the truth is that i have cause to go down on my knees and thank her for  keeping me from some things  i m in a real hurry to get home  and show  that young mother of mine what a perfectly angelic daughter i can be      and mrs  roberts smiled and kept her own counsel  and this was all that  she was supposed to know about her young guest  she never knew the whole  story about professor ellis  though there was a girl  hester mason by  name  in dr  everett s sabbath school  who could have told her a good  deal about him  and about gracie dennis  helping to break the net that  satan had woven for her unwary feet  the fact is  there is a great  deal concerning all these people  hester mason and dr  everett and joy  saunders and joy saunders  mother  which i should have liked to tell you  if i could have found room  you may read of them any time  however  if  you choose  in a book called  an endless chain   of course  the story of  their lives does not end even  there   because the chain is  as i said    endless   but there are many of the links presented to view     so grace dennis went home  and neither then  nor afterward  did mrs   roberts hear in detail the story of professor ellis  what matter  she  had  however  a short added chapter  it came in a letter from mrs   marion dennis not long after gracie s return  it read thus       oh  flossy shipley roberts  blessed little scheming saint that you are   what did you do  how did you do it  ah  i know more about it than those  sentences would indicate  the dear lord did it  working through you   his servant  he has called our gracie to higher ground  filled her heart  with that which has made insignificant things take their true place  and  wrong things show for what they are     you know  of course  that it is all right about professor ellis   or no   i fear it is all wrong about him  but right with our gracie  i hear that  he has permanently located in your city  perhaps your christian charity  can reach him  he sent gracie a letter  trying to explain certain  affairs about that mason girl  with which i presume you are familiar   she showed me the letter and her answer  he will not write her another       i  don t know any mason girl   said mrs  roberts to her husband   but  it doesn t matter  i don t want to know the story if there is nothing to  be done through it  there are stories enough that one  must  know            chapter xxx      it is no made up affair       it was monday evening  and there was company at mr  roberts  home   not the usual monday evening gathering  but quite a large party  of well dressed men and women  many of them young  yet some were  middle aged  the pretty room opposite the conservatory was thrown open   and aglow with lights and flowers  and groups were continually passing  in and out  admiring the paintings and the flowers  and the type writers  of different patterns  and the books and magazines  of which there  were many  but interest was not confined to this room  the parlors were  thrown open and the music room beyond  even the cosy little library was  public property for this one evening  the company was large  and their  tastes were varied  so no pains had been spared to give them variety     you are acquainted with quite a number of the guests  yet i am by no  means sure that you would recognize them all  even in so short a period  of time as three years  great changes may be elicited     for instance  do you know the young man in unnoticeable  and therefore  appropriate  evening dress  who is doing duty at the piano  watching  with practiced eye the course of the player  and turning the leaf with  skilful hand at just the right moment  it is a somewhat embarrassing  position  but his manner leads you to suppose that he has been  accustomed to it all his life  and that he reads music well  in the  latter belief you are correct  but as to being accustomed to it  three  years ago nimble dick could have told you a different story     you can t believe that it is he  i do not wonder  the change is  certainly a great one  but he does not feel it  to tell you the truth   he almost forgets  when he becomes absorbed in his work  that this sort  of society was not always open to him  three years means a long time to  the young  and richard bolton has so long been accustomed to the freedom  of mrs  roberts  parlors  and to the sort of people whom one finds  there  that none of the refinements of polite life are strange to him   and as to turning music  has he not done it for his hostess numberless  times     if your eyes are now opened  it is possible that you may be trying to  spy out other young men  the rooms are full of them  elegantly dressed   fashionable young men  but a few are noticeable by the air which they  have of being in a sense responsible for the comfort of the others  they  are on the alert  they are taking care that no young guest shall appear  for a moment to be forgotten or neglected  they appear to be entirely  familiar with the house and all its appointments  they can be appealed  to for a glass of water or an ice  or to know what special scene this  landscape hanging over the mantel represents  or whose bust this is in  the niche at the left  or in what portion of the library a certain  book will be found  or from what part of the foreign world that  strangely shaped shell came  and they are all equally at home  in short   it is like having a dozen or twenty young hosts to look after your  comfort and pleasure  in point of fact  there are seventeen of them  the  original seven has thus increased  two months ago there were twenty  but  one has secured an appointment as telegraph operator in a distant city   and as stephen crowley occupies a similar position in one of the offices  in this city  some very interesting conversations are held  and many  important items connected with the  monday evenings  and the south end  school and the  library association   etc   are transmitted when the  lines are not otherwise employed  young haskell  too  has gone with one  of the partners from the store where he was first employed  to set up a  branch store in a not distant town  and his old sabbath school teacher  has already received letters from him  saying that they have started  a branch sunday school in the south part of the town  and that he has  picked seven little wretches out of the streets  from eight to twelve  years of age  and gone to work   and  dear mrs  roberts  i wish you  would pray for me  that i may be able to bring every one of them to  christ      so the letter ran  and that tells volumes to the initiated about young  haskell     but although the changes among these young men have been great almost  to bewilderment  only one of the number has been promoted to a dazzling  height  the others are without exception earning good  honest livings  for themselves  securing good  substantial educations through the  evening classes which have grown out of that first effort  bidding fair  to become leading and honored citizens when they actually take their  places as men  but mark calkins  faithful  plodding  good hearted   patient mark  has surpassed them all  the truth is  that eye hath not  seen  nor ear heard  neither hath entered into the heart   what sort of  magnificence surrounds him now  he has gone to court  the chief ruler  of the realm has sent for mark to be always in his immediate presence in  the palace  and with what joy he went i cannot tell you  nor how often  they speak of him  and try to let their hearts conceive of the glory  which surrounds him  and dwell on the day when they will be called  one  after another  to share the same glory  for this is the ambition of more  than half of them     now  in that sentence is unveiled the most curious part of my curious  story  and that it is curious  i frankly admit  it is no made up affair   i am not responsible for the strangeness of it  you are to remember  that  truth is stranger than fiction   and then to understand that i am  telling you the truth  it is  then  a fact  that these young men have  each received conditional appointments to serve in the palace  high in  power and splendor and dignity  the conditions are that they are to be  willing to be guided in all things by the will of their king  whom they  each admit to be wise above all wisdom  and to be kind above all  their conceptions of kindness  it is true that nine of the number  have accepted their appointments  donned their uniform  assumed their  positions as he has directed  and are waiting for the summons to appear  in person at court  it is also true that the others are still in a state  of indecision  they do not know whether to accept the appointment or  not  it is true that they feel themselves honored  that they believe  this to be the only path of honorable and safe promotion  it is true  that they have full faith in those who will tell with joy  that  having  enlisted  they find the service even in this ante room sweet  and the  rewards great  it is true that they severally visited mark  just as the  door was opening to admit him to the palace  and heard him speak of the  glimpses of its glory  and heard that his last words before he went away  were   oh  mine eyes see the king in his beauty   and that his voice  was jubilant as that of a conqueror  and his face radiant as with a  reflection of unseen glory  and yet they hesitate  and dally with the  call  and mean  some time  to have such an inheritance deeded to them   but not now  remember  i am not responsible for this  were i writing  fiction i should hesitate to set down such idiotic folly  expecting you  to call it unnatural or absurdly overdrawn  but i do solemnly declare to  you that this is fact  account for the folly of their behavior as best  you can     well  sallie and her father are left behind  but  mind you  they are not  among the doubtful ones  they both as much expect to serve at court as  they expect to live through all eternity  but while they wait they are  busy  they have moved from the alley  the surroundings were not such  as they liked  did you notice that bit of a house landing modestly  back from the road  at the further corner of those ample grounds that  surround the south end church  it is the sexton s house  and that  church  and those sunday school rooms  and those grounds  and everything  pertaining to them  are under his care  the father is the sexton  it  is true  and attends the furnace and rings the bell  but it is sallie s  care that keeps seat and desk and window so beautifully free from dust  or stain  oh  they live busy lives  and happy ones  sallie trusted not  in vain in her father s promise that night  when he put his weak will  into the pledge  but you are to understand that it was but a few days  thereafter when he planted his weak and wavering feet on the rock of  ages  then did satan angle for him in vain     so  on this monday evening  there were but seventeen at the gathering   i hesitate over what to name the gathering  i would call it a party   but that in many respects it was so totally different from anything with  which you are probably acquainted by that name     the young man who stands by the door of the conservatory  eagerly  describing to miss henderson a rare and curious flower  which has been  sent to mrs  roberts from california  is  black dirk   really  i hope  you are sufficiently astonished  for he looks so utterly unlike the  scamp who used to be the special torment of the south end mission that  i should be disappointed if you were not impressed by it   mr  colson   almost everybody calls him now  the name has long since lost its  strangeness  he is in the employ of the great firm of bostwick  smythe   roberts   co   and although mr  roberts has never found it convenient to  do so before  there were reasons why he thought it would be well to  have a clerk within call  so mr  colson boards with what was the junior  partner of the firm  he is so no more  by the way  for mr  ried has been  received as a member  and is decidedly a junior partner  probably mr   roberts could tell you  if he chose  why one so young  and without  capital  had been elected to partnership  but  as a rule  he keeps his  own counsel  only remarking that the young man developed remarkable  business faculties which were patent to the whole firm  to his wife he  said        i tell you  flossy  i believe a consecrated life will be honored by the  lord  in whatever channel he gives it talents to develop   whatsoever  he doth shall prosper   that young man is going to have a career in  business  i shouldn t be surprised if the master meant him to show the  world how a christian can use money to his glory      it is early yet to prophesy what mr  colson will do  doubtless he will  be a merchant  certainly he will be a christian  possibly he will be  an orator  of whom the world will yet hear   a temperance orator  for  instance  i know you would like to hear him read a poem  he is not  confined to will carleton s style now  though he still reads with power  some of those inimitable delineations of life  but gracie dennis offers  no more criticisms when he reads  in fact  i have heard her defer to  him  when a question arose  as one who had probably studied the passage   and caught its best  i am willing to confess that my poor black dirk was  a bit of a genius  the thought i desire you to catch is that so many  of those poor fellows  who of necessity live by their wits in the city  slums  are diamonds which could be fitted to shine  you take a diamond  and throw it down in the dirt and filth  and put your foot on it and  grind it in  and leave it there  sinking and soiling  day after day   year after year  and when somebody comes along and picks it out  how  much will it gleam for him at first  yet the diamond is there      thou shalt be a royal diadem in the hand of thy god   mrs  roberts had  been at work hunting diamonds for his diadem     as mr  colson stood there chatting freely with miss henderson  there was  nothing about the association that looked incongruous  neither did it  occur to any  there was not a trace of embarrassment about this boy from  the slums  he had forgotten the slums  and stood talking with one of the  aristocrats of the city     how came she to talk with him  to allow herself to be entertained  by him  let me tell you  thereby hangs a tale  some time before this  evening  in fact  nearly two years before  mrs  roberts had come to a  puzzle  and stood and looked at it doubtfully  then she presented it to  the others        they are growing easy in their manners with me  learning to be  gentlemanly without embarrassment  and thoughtful over little things  without being ashamed of it  but i am afraid that with other ladies they  would be sadly frightened and awkward  when mrs  delaney came in this  evening i could but notice how utterly silent mr  colton became  he  had been talking well before  it seems as though there was a great gulf  between them and social advancement  how can we bridge it      then young ried ventured his thought    my sister ester had a class in  the center street sabbath school  nice little girls  who wore pretty  dresses  and had their hair curled  and came from the best families   after she was taken sick  she told me one of her regrets was that she  had not stayed well long enough to try a plan which she had  she meant  to take a class of rough little boys in the mission school  and she  meant to ask the mothers of the little girls to let them come  once a  month  and play with the little boys from the streets  she to play with  them  and watch over them every moment  but to try to interest the girls  in teaching the boys gentleness and good manners  i don t know how it  would have worked  ester was never well enough to undertake it  nor  could she seem to enlist any one else in such service  it has grave  objections  i suppose  but i have always thought that i should like to  see something of the kind carefully tried      mrs  roberts  before this little story was half concluded  had turned  those eager eyes of hers on the speaker  eyes that always had a peculiar  light in them whenever her soul took in a new suggestion      thank you   she said   i see  oh  a great many things  i ought to have  called in that dear sister ester to help on this phase of the question  before  it has always seemed to me as though we were doing her work            chapter xxxi      their works do follow them       that was the beginning of a new effort  there were certain young ladies  becoming well known to mrs  roberts  by reason of a similarity of tastes  which drew them to her     she sat down one day and wrote out their names with great care on her  tablets     miss henderson s name headed the list  she was one of the aristocrats  i  use the word in its highest sense  the accidents of wealth and position  were hers  at least  that is the way we talk  though i suppose we all  believe that the lord is the giver of both  and will require an account  of the same at our hands     if this be so  miss henderson will be more ready than some with her  rendering  for she is of royal blood  and guards well the honor of the  christian name she bears     without hesitation  miss henderson headed the list  the others were  chosen more slowly  ten of them  picked soldiers  to do special duty  in  his name      it required much explanation  much care to plan wisely     but the girls caught at the idea     in the course of weeks they formed a band  with miss henderson for  president  ostensibly they were a literary society  really they were  diamond polishers     they met one evening by invitation  with mrs  roberts  and made the  acquaintance of the  monday club   they sang for them  read for them   heard them read  chatted with them on the various topics of the hour   the last lecture of the course  which all had attended  a certain book  carefully read and criticised by mr  and mrs  roberts and dr  everett in  the monday club   not so carefully read by the young ladies  therefore   it came to pass that they were somewhat worsted in an argument  concerning it  which was bad neither for the young ladies nor the monday  club     finally  they were taken out to supper by these young men  who had so  far come under mrs  robert s  influence that they were willing to endure  torture for the sake of pleasing her     it is a long story  i could write another book about it just as well as  not     the main difficulty would be that the critics would pronounce the story  overdrawn  they always do when one revels in facts  it is only when  an author keeps within the range of sober fiction that he may feel  comparatively safe from this charge     these young ladies represented other parlors and other dining rooms   they arranged for little graceful entertainments  to which the monday  club was invited  gradually others were invited too  good  solid men   and wise hearted  motherly women  the invitations were select  the   polishers  were chosen with care  but it was surprising to these  workers to find how large the christian world is  and how many stood  ready to help if they were shown love      it is one of the best suggestions that that dear ester has given us    this mrs  roberts said one evening when the young ladies  band and the  monday club combined their forces and gave an entertainment to some of  the best people on the avenue     i have given you hints of how they did it  they were every one  christians  these young ladies  none others were chosen  they worked  with a single aim in view  his glory  they took no step that was not  paved with prayer  do you need to be told that they succeeded     this was one of the reasons why mr  colson chatted with miss henderson  with perfect freedom  and why his bow was graceful and easy when she  introduced him to her friend miss fanshawe  of philadelphia  he was  accustomed to being introduced to her friends     i m sure i hope you wish i would tell you somewhat of mart colson  if  you are not deeply interested in her i am disappointed in you  she has  been such an object of interest to me since that time when i caught a  glimpse of her once through the cellar window  with a gleam of sunset  making her hair into gold     it is a summer evening of which i tell you  and she is all  in white  except her eyes  nothing can be bluer than they are  to night   and except the flowers about her  she is always among the  flowers     i hesitate  after all  to tell you about mart  hers is one of those  stories hard to tell  besides  her friend and patron has suffered much  criticism because of her  and though mrs  roberts does not care in the  least  i find that i am sensitive      has she really kept that colson girl with her all these years   yes   she has  i speak it meekly  but she has   and never had her learn a  trade  or work in a factory  or learn to support herself in any way    she has never sent her anywhere to learn a trade or to work in a factory  or to stand behind a counter  it is too true     no  i was almost sure you did not approve of it  but  for all that  i  don t mean to argue mrs  roberts  cause   to her own master she standeth  or falleth      not but what mrs  roberts has argued  on occasion   with gracie dennis   for instance  who paid her a few weeks  visit  less than three months  after she first went home      flossy   she would say   what are you going to do  with the girl  do  you really mean to keep her here       she has no mother  my child  nor father  and her brother is not able to  care for her yet  where would you have me send her       why  flossy  there are places       yes  my dear  i know it  and this is one of them       well  but she ought to be learning things  how is she going to support  herself       she is studying arithmetic with me  you know  and writing and reading  with the dining room girls  and i am teaching her music  and mr   roberts proposes to have her join the history class as soon as she is  sufficiently advanced in the more common studies       but  flossy shipley  that is great nonsense  you know what i mean  you  cannot turn the world upside down in that fashion  or make an orphan  asylum of your house or a charity school       my dear  do you really think the house is in danger  does it look like  an orphan asylum or feel like a charity school      then would gracie dennis laugh  but look a trifle vexed  nevertheless   and mutter that people couldn t do things that way in this world     then would flossy be ready with her gentle drops of oil to soothe the  ruffles      gracie  dear  i am not trying to reform the world  there are a great  many girls left destitute i know  and i will do at wholesale all i  can for them  but this one is peculiar  you have admitted that it was  unusual to see such dangerous beauty  and she is unusual in her mental  development  she could be fierce and wicked  she is ignorant and bitter  about many things  i am afraid for her  i have not been able to think  of a place where the lord jesus would have me take her  i must see to it  that  he  is pleased  you know  at all hazards  if he does not mean us  to keep her in the shelter of our home for the present  we do not know  what he means      we cannot  mother  the whole race  he has not even suggested it to our  hearts  he has simply said   here  take this one  there is room for her   keep her until i plainly tell you that her place is elsewhere   gracie   would you have me tell him we cannot      by this time gracie would be humble and sweet      it is very good of you   she would say  meekly   and i was not  thinking of such a thing as finding fault  i was only wondering  whether  whether  well  you know  whether such a life as she is leading  in your house would not unfit her for her proper sphere      but a sentence like that was always liable to put little mrs  roberts  on all the dignity she possessed  her husband had ideas on that subject   and had imbued her with them  her voice could even sound almost haughty  as she said        as to that  gracie  we must remember that the  sphere  of an american  woman is the one that she can fill acceptably in god s sight  he may  call her to the highest  i don t know  since she is the daughter of a  king  there may be no spot on his footstool too high for his intentions  concerning her      there was outside criticism  of course  indeed  mrs  roberts was  sufficiently peculiar in many respects to call for much criticism  from the world  they talked much about  that girl  she had picked up   gradually they said  that colson girl   then one day some daughter  asked   is she really a sister of that handsome mr  colson in the  store   and by and by there were some who spoke of her as  mattie  colson   that was the name which mrs  roberts always called her  it  began gradually to be known also that  mattie colson  knew a great deal  which was worth knowing  three years of companionship with a lady like  mrs  roberts  and such as she gathers about her  can do much for a girl  who wishes much done for her     as to  earning her living   i am not sure but she was learning to do it  in several ways  mrs  roberts struggled against all false ideas of life   therefore taught her none     she was not the cook  but she could  and had on occasion  served up a  most enjoyable breakfast     she was not the second girl  yet her fingers were undeniably skilful in  the arrangement of rooms and tables  she was not the sewing girl   yet constant were the calls on fingers that had become wise in these  directions  she was by no means the nurse  yet there was a little  golden haired  flossy  in the sunny room upstairs whose devoted slave  she was  and whose mother felt that mattie s loving  watchful care over  her darling was only second to her own  and was so to be relied upon  by  day and night  as to repay tenfold whatever she might have done for the  girl     in fact  it would perhaps be difficult to define  mart  colon s position  in the house  yet she was  as i said  becoming known among the young  ladies outside as  mattie colson  that handsome young colson s sister   as pretty as a doll  and a  protege  of that lovely mrs  roberts  you  know   as for the young ladies  band   i do not include them when i talk  of the girls  outside    what they had done for mattie colson she could  not have told you though she tried  her eyes shining with tears     the days had come wherein the very matrons who had said that it was a  strange thing for mrs  roberts to take a girl from the slums into  her family  that it was  tempting providence to attempt such violent  wrenches   now said one to another  that  it must be a great relief to  mrs  roberts to have that mattie colson always at her elbow to see that  everything about the home was just as it should be   and they added   with a sigh  that  some people were very fortunate      now  dear critic  you stand all ready to say that this is a very nice   paper  story  but that in actual life attempts at doing good do not  result so smoothly  that to be  natural   mrs  roberts ought  at least   to have tried in vain to reclaim half of her boys     it is true  i have said nothing to you about two or three whom she has  not as yet reached  though she is still trying  my story was not of  them  but of the twenty whom she  did  reach  concerning your verdict   there are two things that i want to say  first  go into the work  and  give the time and patience and faith and prayer that mrs  roberts and  her fellow workers gave  before you decide that it is vain     and secondly  will you kindly remember that  whether this be natural or  not  it is true     i do not think i have told you the immediate occasion of this particular  gathering  it was  in fact  a reception given to mrs  ried  it is not  likely that i need tell you at this late day that her name was  gracie  dennis  ried  i could have told you much about it  had i been writing a  story of that sort     in fact  there is a chance for considerable romancing  there are matters  of interest that i might tell you  about  mr  colson  himself  young as  he is  and about mattie  who wears to night a rose that she did not pick  from the conservatory  but i don t mean to tell it     i have just one other bit of history to give you  they stood together  for a moment  the young bridegroom and the lady with whom he had  faithfully worked ever since that rainy afternoon in which he had  confided his gloom to her     both were looking at the two young men who stood near the piano  waiting  to join in the chorus  both had known these young men as  nimble dick   and  black dirk      still another of the original seven stood in the immediate vicinity  the  glances of the two workers took them all in  then they looked at each  other  and smiled meaningly      i have been thinking of that first sunday afternoon   said mrs   roberts   i asked them to pick up my handkerchief  which had dropped   and  nimble dick  said   pick it up yourself  mum  you re as able to as  we be   i wonder if they would remember it  what if i should tell them      as she spoke the bit of cambric in her hand designedly dropped almost at  the feet of dirk colson  he stooped for it instantly  but  nimble dick   was too quick for him  and presented it to the owner with a graceful  bow  and a slightly triumphant smile     but the chorus was commencing  and the bass and tenor were at once  absorbed in their work  so mr  ried and mrs  roberts had the memorial  laugh all to themselves  none but they understood what the white  handkerchief said     despite the laughter there was a suspicious mist in mr  ried s eyes      how far is mirth removed from tears   he asked his hostess  and then    do you know  when i look at these young men  moving about your rooms at  their ease  really ornaments to society  and think of the places in the  world that they will be likely to fill  and think of what they were when  you first saw them  the overwhelming contrast brings the tears      said mrs  roberts        i will tell you something that will do your heart good      did you

notwithstanding there are no less than eight english  translations of la rochefoucauld  hardly any are readable  none are free  from faults  and all fail more or less to convey the author s meaning   though so often translated  there is not a complete english edition  of the maxims and reflections  all the translations are confined  exclusively to the maxims  none include the reflections  this may be  accounted for  from the fact that most of the translations are taken  from the old editions of the maxims  in which the reflections do  not appear  until m  suard devoted his attention to the text of  rochefoucauld  the various editions were but reprints of the preceding  ones  without any regard to the alterations made by the author in the  later editions published during his life time  so much was this the  case  that maxims which had been rejected by rochefoucauld in his last  edition  were still retained in the body of the work  to give but one  example  the celebrated maxim as to the misfortunes of our friends  was  omitted in the last edition of the book  published in rochefoucauld s  life time  yet in every english edition this maxim appears in the body  of the work     m  aime martin in      published an edition of the maxims and  reflections which has ever since been the standard text of rochefoucauld  in france  the maxims are printed from the edition of       the last  published during the author s life  and the last which received his  corrections  to this edition were added two supplements  the first  containing the maxims which had appeared in the editions of              and       and which were afterwards omitted  the second  some additional  maxims found among various of the author s manuscripts in the royal  library at paris  and a series of reflections which had been previously  published in a work called  receuil de pieces d histoire et de  litterature   paris        they were first published with the maxims in  an edition by gabriel brotier     in an edition of rochefoucauld entitled  reflexions  ou sentences et  maximes morales  augmentees de plus deux cent nouvelles maximes et  maximes et pensees diverses suivant les copies imprimees a paris  chez  claude barbin  et matre cramoisy         some fifty maxims were added   ascribed by the editor to rochefoucauld  and as his family allowed them  to be published under his name  it seems probable they were genuine   these fifty form the third supplement to this book           in all the french editions this book is spoken of as       published in       the only copy i have seen is in the       cambridge university library              and is called        reflexions morales        the apology for the present edition of rochefoucauld must therefore be  twofold  firstly  that it is an attempt to give the public a complete  english edition of rochefoucauld s works as a moralist  the body of the  work comprises the maxims as the author finally left them  the first  supplement  those published in former editions  and rejected by the  author in the later  the second  the unpublished maxims taken from the  author s correspondence and manuscripts  and the third  the maxims first  published in       while the reflections  in which the thoughts in the  maxims are extended and elaborated  now appear in english for the first  time  and secondly  that it is an attempt  to quote the preface of the  edition of        to do the duc de la rochefoucauld the justice to make  him speak english            introduction      translators    the description of the  ancien regime  in france   a despotism tempered  by epigrams   like most epigrammatic sentences  contains some truth   with much fiction  the society of the last half of the seventeenth  and  the whole of the eighteenth centuries  was doubtless greatly influenced  by the precise and terse mode in which the popular writers of that date  expressed their thoughts  to a people naturally inclined to think that  every possible view  every conceivable argument  upon a question is  included in a short aphorism  a shrug  and the word  voila   truths  expressed in condensed sentences must always have a peculiar charm  it  is  perhaps  from this love of epigram  that we find so many eminent  french writers of maxims  pascal  de retz  la rochefoucauld  la bruyere   montesquieu  and vauvenargues  each contributed to the rich stock of  french epigrams  no other country can show such a list of brilliant  writers  in england certainly we cannot  our most celebrated  lord  bacon  has  by his other works  so surpassed his maxims  that their fame  is  to a great measure  obscured  the only englishman who could have  rivalled la rochefoucauld or la bruyere was the earl of chesterfield   and he only could have done so from his very intimate connexion  with france  but unfortunately his brilliant genius was spent in the  impossible task of trying to refine a boorish young briton  in  cutting  blocks with a razor      of all the french epigrammatic writers la rochefoucauld is at once the  most widely known  and the most distinguished  voltaire  whose opinion  on the century of louis xiv  is entitled to the greatest weight  says    one of the works that most largely contributed to form the taste of  the nation  and to diffuse a spirit of justice and precision  is the  collection of maxims  by francois duc de la rochefoucauld      this francois  the second duc de la rochefoucauld  prince de marsillac   the author of the maxims  was one of the most illustrious members of the  most illustrious families among the french noblesse  descended from the  ancient dukes of guienne  the founder of the family fulk or foucauld  a  younger branch of the house of lusignan  was at the commencement of  the eleventh century the seigneur of a small town  la roche  in the  angounois  our chief knowledge of this feudal lord is drawn from  the monkish chronicles  as the benefactor of the various abbeys and  monasteries in his province  he is naturally spoken of by them in terms  of eulogy  and in the charter of one of the abbeys of angouleme he is  called   vir nobilissimus fulcaldus   his territorial power enabled him  to adopt what was then  as is still in scotland  a common custom  to  prefix the name of his estate to his surname  and thus to create and  transmit to his descendants the illustrious surname of la rochefoucauld     from that time until that great crisis in the history of the french  aristocracy  the revolution of       the family of la rochefoucauld have  been   if not first  in the very first line  of that most illustrious  body  one seigneur served under philip augustus against richard coeur de  lion  and was made prisoner at the battle of gisors  the eighth  seigneur guy performed a great tilt at bordeaux  attended  according  to froissart  to the lists by some two hundred of his kindred and  relations  the sixteenth seigneur francais was chamberlain to charles  viii  and louis xii   and stood at the font as sponsor  giving his name  to that last light of french chivalry  francis i  in      he was created  a baron  and was afterwards advanced to a count  on account of his great  service to francis and his predecessors     the second count pushed the family fortune still further by obtaining  a patent as the prince de marsillac  his widow  anne de polignac   entertained charles v  at the family chateau at verteuil  in so princely  a manner that on leaving charles observed   he had never entered a  house so redolent of high virtue  uprightness  and lordliness as that  mansion      the third count  after serving with distinction under the duke of  guise against the spaniards  was made prisoner at st  quintin  and only  regained his liberty to fall a victim to the  bloody infamy  of st   bartholomew  his son  the fourth count  saved with difficulty from that  massacre  after serving with distinction in the religious wars  was  taken prisoner in a skirmish at st  yriex la perche  and murdered by the  leaguers in cold blood     the fifth count  one of the ministers of louis xiii   after fighting  against the english and buckingham at the ile de re  was created a duke   his son francis  the second duke  by his writings has made the family  name a household word     the third duke fought in many of the earlier campaigns of louis xiv  at  torcy  lille  cambray  and was dangerously wounded at the passage of  the rhine  from his bravery he rose to high favour at court  and was  appointed master of the horse  grand veneur  and lord chamberlain  his  son  the fourth duke  commanded the regiment of navarre  and took part  in storming the village of neerwinden on the day when william iii  was  defeated at landen  he was afterwards created duc de la rochequyon and  marquis de liancourt     the fifth duke  banished from court by louis xv   became the friend of  the philosopher voltaire     the sixth duke  the friend of condorcet  was the last of the long line  of noble lords who bore that distinguished name  in those terrible days  of september        when the french people were proclaiming universal  humanity  the duke was seized as an aristocrat by the mob at gisors and  put to death behind his own carriage  in which sat his mother and  his wife  at the very place where  some six centuries previously  his  ancestor had been taken prisoner in a fair fight  a modern writer has  spoken of this murder  as an admirable reprisal upon the grandson  for the writings and conduct of the grandfather   but m  sainte beuve  observes as to this  he can see nothing admirable in the death of the  duke  and if it proves anything  it is only that the grandfather was not  so wrong in his judgment of men as is usually supposed     francis  the author  was born on the   th december       m  sainte beuve  divides his life into four periods  first  from his birth till he was  thirty five  when he became mixed up in the war of the fronde  the  second period  during the progress of that war  the third  the twelve  years that followed  while he recovered from his wounds  and wrote his  maxims during his retirement from society  and the last from that time  till his death     in the same way that herodotus calls each book of his history by  the name of one of the muses  so each of these four periods of la  rochefoucauld s life may be associated with the name of a woman who was  for the time his ruling passion  these four ladies are the duchesse de  chevreuse  the duchesse de longueville  madame de sable  and madame de  la fayette     la rochefoucauld s early education was neglected  his father  occupied  in the affairs of state  either had not  or did not devote any time to  his education  his natural talents and his habits of observation soon   however  supplied all deficiencies  by birth and station placed in  the best society of the french court  he soon became a most finished  courtier  knowing how precarious court favour then was  his father  when  young rochefoucauld was only nine years old  sent him into the army   he was subsequently attached to the regiment of auvergne  though but  sixteen he was present  and took part in the military operations at the  siege of cassel  the court of louis xiii  was then ruled imperiously  by richelieu  the duke de la rochefoucauld was strongly opposed to the  cardinal s party  by joining in the plots of gaston of orleans  he gave  richelieu an opportunity of ridding paris of his opposition  when those  plots were discovered  the duke was sent into a sort of banishment to  blois  his son  who was then at court with him  was  upon the pretext of  a liaison with mdlle  d hautefort  one of the ladies in waiting on the  queen  anne of austria   but in reality to prevent the duke learning  what was passing at paris  sent with his father  the result of the exile  was rochefoucauld s marriage  with the exception that his wife s name  was mdlle  vivonne  and that she was the mother of five sons and three  daughters  nothing is known of her  while rochefoucauld and his father  were at blois  the duchesse de chevreuse  one of the beauties of  the court  and the mistress of louis  was banished to tours  she and  rochefoucauld met  and soon became intimate  and for a time she was  destined to be the one motive of his actions  the duchesse was engaged  in a correspondence with the court of spain and the queen  into this  plot rochefoucauld threw himself with all his energy  his connexion with  the queen brought him back to his old love mdlle  d hautefort  and led  him to her party  which he afterwards followed  the course he took shut  him off from all chance of court favour  the king regarded him with  coldness  the cardinal with irritation  although the bastile and the  scaffold  the fate of chalais and montmorency  were before his eyes   they failed to deter him from plotting  he was about twenty three   returning to paris  he warmly sided with the queen  he says in his  memoirs that the only persons she could then trust were himself and  mdlle  d hautefort  and it was proposed he should take both of them  from paris to brussels  into this plan he entered with all his youthful  indiscretion  it being for several reasons the very one he would wish to  adopt  as it would strengthen his influence with anne of austria  place  richelieu and his master in an uncomfortable position  and save mdlle   d hautefort from the attentions the king was showing her     but richelieu of course discovered this plot  and rochefoucauld was   of course  sent to the bastile  he was liberated after a week s  imprisonment  but banished to his chateau at verteuil     the reason for this clemency was that the cardinal desired to win  rochefoucauld from the queen s party  a command in the army was offered  to him  but by the queen s orders refused     for some three years rochefoucauld remained at verteuil  waiting the  time for his reckoning with richelieu  speculating on the king s death   and the favours he would then receive from the queen  during this period  he was more or less engaged in plotting against his enemy the cardinal   and hatching treason with cinq mars and de thou     m  sainte beuve says  that unless we study this first part of  rochefoucauld s life  we shall never understand his maxims  the bitter  disappointment of the passionate love  the high hopes then formed  the  deceit and treachery then witnessed  furnished the real key to their  meaning  the cutting cynicism of the morality was built on the ruins of  that chivalrous ambition and romantic affection  he saw his friend cinq  mars sent to the scaffold  himself betrayed by men whom he had trusted   and the only reason he could assign for these actions was intense  selfishness     meanwhile  richelieu died  rochefoucauld returned to court  and found  anne of austria regent  and mazarin minister  the queen s former friends  flocked there in numbers  expecting that now their time of prosperity  had come  they were bitterly disappointed  mazarin relied on hope  instead of gratitude  to keep the queen s adherents on his side  the  most that any received were promises that were never performed  in after  years  doubtless  rochefoucauld s recollection of his disappointment led  him to write the maxim   we promise according to our hopes  we perform  according to our fears   but he was not even to receive promises  he  asked for the governorship of havre  which was then vacant  he was  flatly refused  disappointment gave rise to anger  and uniting with  his old flame  the duchesse de chevreuse  who had received the same  treatment  and with the duke of beaufort  they formed a conspiracy  against the government  the plot was  of course  discovered and crushed   beaufort was arrested  the duchesse banished  irritated and disgusted   rochefoucauld went with the duc d enghein  who was then joining the  army  on a campaign  and here he found the one love of his life  the  duke s sister  mdme  de longueville  this lady  young  beautiful  and  accomplished  obtained a great ascendancy over rochefoucauld  and was  the cause of his taking the side of conde in the subsequent civil war   rochefoucauld did not stay long with the army  he was badly wounded at  the siege of mardik  and returned from thence to paris  on recovering  from his wounds  the war of the fronde broke out  this war is said  to have been most ridiculous  as being carried on without a definite  object  a plan  or a leader  but this description is hardly correct  it  was the struggle of the french nobility against the rule of the court   an attempt  the final attempt  to recover their lost influence over the  state  and to save themselves from sinking under the rule of cardinals  and priests     with the general history of that war we have nothing to do  it is far  too complicated and too confused to be stated here  the memoirs of  rochefoucauld and de retz will give the details to those who desire to  trace the contests of the factions  the course of the intrigues  we may  confine ourselves to its progress so far as it relates to the duc de la  rochefoucauld     on the cardinal causing the princes de conde and conti  and the duc de  longueville  to be arrested  rochefoucauld and the duchess fled into  normandy  leaving her at dieppe  he went into poitou  of which province  he had some years previously bought the post of governor  he was there  joined by the duc de bouillon  and he and the duke marched to  and  occupied bordeaux  cardinal mazarin and marechal de la meilleraie  advanced in force on bordeaux  and attacked the town  a bloody battle  followed  rochefoucauld defended the town with the greatest bravery   and repulsed the cardinal  notwithstanding the repulse  the burghers of  bordeaux were anxious to make peace  and save the city from destruction   the parliament of bordeaux compelled rochefoucauld to surrender  he did  so  and returned nominally to poitou  but in reality in secret to paris     there he found the queen engaged in trying to maintain her position by  playing off the rival parties of the prince conde and the cardinal  de retz against each other  rochefoucauld eagerly espoused his old  party  that of conde  in august        the contending parties met in the  hall of the parliament of paris  and it was with great difficulty they  were prevented from coming to blows even there  it is even said that  rochefoucauld had ordered his followers to murder de retz     rochefoucauld was soon to undergo a bitter disappointment  while  occupied with party strife and faction in paris  madame de chevreuse  left him  and formed an alliance with the duc de nemours  rochefoucauld  still loved her  it was  probably  thinking of this that he afterwards  wrote   jealousy is born with love  but does not die with it   he  endeavoured to get madame de chatillon  the old mistress of the duc de  nemours  reinstated in favour  but in this he did not succeed  the duc  de nemours was soon after killed in a duel  the war went on  and after  several indecisive skirmishes  the decisive battle was fought at paris   in the faubourg st  antoine  where the parisians first learnt the use  or the abuse of their favourite defence  the barricade  in this battle   rochefoucauld behaved with great bravery  he was wounded in the head  a  wound which for a time deprived him of his sight  before he recovered   the war was over  louis xiv  had attained his majority  the gold of  mazarin  the arms of turenne  had been successful  the french nobility  were vanquished  the court supremacy established     this completed rochefoucauld s active life     when he recovered his health  he devoted himself to society  madame  de sable assumed a hold over him  he lived a quiet life  and occupied  himself in composing an account of his early life  called his  memoirs    and his immortal  maxims      from the time he ceased to take part in public life  rochefoucauld s  real glory began  having acted the various parts of soldier  politician   and lover with but small success  he now commenced the part of moralist   by which he is known to the world     living in the most brilliant society that france possessed  famous  from his writings  distinguished from the part he had taken in public  affairs  he formed the centre of one of those remarkable french literary  societies  a society which numbered among its members la fontaine   racine  boileau  among his most attached friends was madame de  la fayette  the authoress of the  princess of cleeves    and this  friendship continued until his death  he was not  however  destined to  pass away in that gay society without some troubles  at the passage of  the rhine in      two of his sons were engaged  the one was killed  the  other severely wounded  rochefoucauld was much affected by this  but  perhaps still more by the death of the young duc de longueville  who  perished on the same occasion     sainte beuve says that the cynical book and that young life were the  only fruits of the war of the fronde  madame de sevigne  who was with  him when he heard the news of the death of so much that was dear to  him  says   i saw his heart laid bare on that cruel occasion  and his  courage  his merit  his tenderness  and good sense surpassed all i ever  met with  i hold his wit and accomplishments as nothing in comparison    the combined effect of his wounds and the gout caused the last years of  rochefoucauld s life to be spent in great pain  madame de sevigne   who was  with  him continually during his last illness  speaks of the  fortitude with which he bore his sufferings as something to be admired   writing to her daughter  she says   believe me  it is not for nothing he  has moralised all his life  he has thought so often on his last moments  that they are nothing new or unfamiliar to him      in his last illness  the great moralist was attended by the great  divine  bossuet  whether that matchless eloquence or his own philosophic  calm had  in spite of his writings  brought him into the state madame  de sevigne describes  we know not  but one  or both  contributed to  his passing away in a manner that did not disgrace a french noble or a  french philosopher  on the   th march        he ended his stormy life in  peace after so much strife  a loyal subject after so much treason     one of his friends  madame deshoulieres  shortly before he died sent  him an ode on death  which aptly describes his state    oui  soyez alors  plus ferme  que ces vulgaires humains qui  pres de leur dernier terme   de vaines terreurs sont pleins  en sage que rien n offense  livrez vous  sans resistance a d inevitables traits  et  d une demarche egale  passez  cette onde fatal qu on ne repasse jamais      rochefoucauld left behind him only two works  the one  memoirs of his  own time  the other the maxims  the first described the scenes in which  his youth had been spent  and though written in a lively style  and  giving faithful pictures of the intrigues and the scandals of the court  during louis xiv  s minority  yet  except to the historian  has ceased  at the present day to be of much interest  it forms  perhaps  the true  key to understand the special as opposed to general application of the  maxims     notwithstanding the assertion of bayle  that  there are few people so  bigoted to antiquity as not to prefer the memoirs of la rochefoucauld  to the commentaries of caesar   or the statement of voltaire   that the  memoirs are universally read and the maxims are learnt by heart   few  persons at the present day ever heard of the memoirs  and the knowledge  of most as to the maxims is confined to that most celebrated of all   though omitted from his last edition   there is something in the  misfortunes of our best friends which does not wholly displease us   yet  it is difficult to assign a cause for this  no book is perhaps oftener  unwittingly quoted  none certainly oftener unblushingly pillaged  upon  none have so many contradictory opinions been given      few books   says mr  hallam   have been more highly extolled  or more  severely blamed  than the maxims of the duke of rochefoucauld  and that  not only here  but also in france   rousseau speaks of it as   a sad and  melancholy book   though he goes on to say  it is usually so in youth  when we do not like seeing man as he is   voltaire says of it  in the  words above quoted   one of the works which most contributed to form the  taste of the  french  nation  and to give it a spirit of justness  and precision  was the collection of the maxims of francois duc de la  rochefoucauld  though there is scarcely more than one truth running  through the book  that  self love is the motive of everything   yet  this thought is presented under so many varied aspects that it is  nearly always striking  it is not so much a book as it is materials for  ornamenting a book  this little collection was read with avidity  it  taught people to think  and to comprise their thoughts in a lively   precise  and delicate turn of expression  this was a merit which  before  him  no one in europe had attained since the revival of letters      dr  johnson speaks of it as  the only book written by a man of fashion   of which professed authors need be jealous      lord chesterfield  in his letters to his son  says   till you come to  know mankind by your experience  i know no thing nor no man that can  in the meantime bring you so well acquainted with them as le duc de la  rochefoucauld  his little book of maxims  which i would advise you to  look into for some moments at least every day of your life  is  i fear   too like and too exact a picture of human nature  i own it seems to  degrade it  but yet my experience does not convince me that it degrades  it unjustly      bishop butler  on the other hand  blames the book in no measured terms    there is a strange affectation   says the bishop   in some people of  explaining away all particular affection  and representing the whole  life as nothing but one continued exercise of self love  hence arise  that surprising confusion and perplexity in the epicureans of old   hobbes  the author of  reflexions morales   and the whole set of  writers  of calling actions interested which are done of the most  manifest known interest  merely for the gratification of a present  passion      the judgment the reader will be most inclined to adopt will perhaps be  either that of mr  hallam   concise and energetic in expression  reduced  to those short aphorisms which leave much to the reader s acuteness and  yet save his labour  not often obscure  and never wearisome  an evident  generalisation of long experience  without pedantry  without method   without deductive reasonings  yet wearing an appearance at least of  profundity  they delight the intelligent though indolent man of the  world  and must be read with some admiration by the philosopher          yet they bear witness to the contracted observation and the precipitate  inferences which an intercourse with a single class of society scarcely  fails to generate   or that of addison  who speaks of rochefoucauld  as  the great philosopher for administering consolation to the idle  the  curious  and the worthless part of mankind      we are fortunately in possession of materials such as rarely exist to  enable us to form a judgment of rochefoucauld s character  we have  with  a vanity that could only exist in a frenchman  a description or portrait  of himself  of his own painting  and one of those inimitable living  sketches in which his great enemy  cardinal de retz  makes all the chief  actors in the court of the regency of anne of austria pass across the  stage before us     we will first look on the portrait rochefoucauld has left us of himself    i am   says he   of a medium height  active  and well proportioned  my  complexion dark  but uniform  a high forehead  and of moderate height   black eyes  small  deep set  eyebrows black and thick but well placed  i  am rather embarrassed in talking of my nose  for it is neither flat nor  aquiline  nor large  nor pointed  but i believe  as far as i can say   it is too large than too small  and comes down just a trifle too low  i  have a large mouth  lips generally red enough  neither shaped well nor  badly  i have white teeth  and fairly even  i have been told i have  a little too much chin  i have just looked at myself in the glass to  ascertain the fact  and i do not know how to decide  as to the shape of  my face  it is either square or oval  but which i should find it very  difficult to say  i have black hair  which curls by nature  and thick  and long enough to entitle me to lay claim to a fine head  i have in my  countenance somewhat of grief and pride  which gives many people an idea  i despise them  although i am not at all given to do so  my gestures are  very free  rather inclined to be too much so  for in speaking they  make me use too much action  such  candidly  i believe i am in outward  appearance  and i believe it will be found that what i have said  above of myself is not far from the real case  i shall use the same  truthfulness in the remainder of my picture  for i have studied myself  sufficiently to know myself well  and i will lack neither boldness to  speak as freely as i can of my good qualities  nor sincerity to freely  avow that i have faults      in the first place  to speak of my temper  i am melancholy  and i have  hardly been seen for the last three or four years to laugh above three  or four times  it seems to me that my melancholy would be even endurable  and pleasant if i had none but what belonged to me constitutionally  but  it arises from so many other causes  fills my imagination in such a way   and possesses my mind so strongly that for the greater part of my time  i remain without speaking a word  or give no meaning to what i say  i am  extremely reserved to those i do not know  and i am not very open with  the greater part of those i do  it is a fault i know well  and i should  neglect no means to correct myself of it  but as a certain gloomy air i  have tends to make me seem more reserved than i am in fact  and as it is  not in our power to rid ourselves of a bad expression that arises from  a natural conformation of features  i think that even when i have cured  myself internally  externally some bad expression will always remain      i have ability  i have no hesitation in saying it  as for what purpose  should i pretend otherwise  so great circumvention  and so great  depreciation  in speaking of the gifts one has  seems to me to hide a  little vanity under an apparent modesty  and craftily to try to make  others believe in greater virtues than are imputed to us  on my part  i am content not to be considered better looking than i am  nor of a  better temper than i describe  nor more witty and clever than i am  once  more  i have ability  but a mind spoilt by melancholy  for though i  know my own language tolerably well  and have a good memory  a mode  of thought not particularly confused  i yet have so great a mixture of  discontent that i often say what i have to say very badly      the conversation of gentlemen is one of the pleasures that most amuses  me  i like it to be serious and morality to form the substance of it   yet i also know how to enjoy it when trifling  and if i do not make  many witty speeches  it is not because i do not appreciate the value of  trifles well said  and that i do not find great amusement in that manner  of raillery in which certain prompt and ready witted persons excel so  well  i write well in prose  i do well in verse  and if i was envious of  the glory that springs from that quarter  i think with a little labour  i could acquire some reputation  i like reading  in general  but that in  which one finds something to polish the wit and strengthen the soul  is what i like best  but  above all  i have the greatest pleasure in  reading with an intelligent person  for then we reflect constantly upon  what we read  and the observations we make form the most pleasant and  useful form of conversation there is      i am a fair critic of the works in verse and prose that are shown me   but perhaps i speak my opinion with almost too great freedom  another  fault in me is that i have sometimes a spirit of delicacy far too  scrupulous  and a spirit of criticism far too severe  i do not dislike  an argument  and i often of my own free will engage in one  but i  generally back my opinion with too much warmth  and sometimes  when the  wrong side is advocated against me  from the strength of my zeal for  reason  i become a little unreasonable myself      i have virtuous sentiments  good inclinations  and so strong a desire  to be a wholly good man that my friend cannot afford me a greater  pleasure than candidly to show me my faults  those who know me most  intimately  and those who have the goodness sometimes to give me the  above advice  know that i always receive it with all the joy that could  be expected  and with all reverence of mind that could be desired      i have all the passions pretty mildly  and pretty well under control   i am hardly ever seen in a rage  and i never hated any one  i am not   however  incapable of avenging myself if i have been offended  or if my  honour demanded i should resent an insult put upon me  on the contrary   i feel clear that duty would so well discharge the office of hatred in  me that i should follow my revenge with even greater keenness than other  people      ambition does not weary me  i fear but few things  and i do not fear  death in the least  i am but little given to pity  and i could wish i  was not so at all  though there is nothing i would not do to comfort an  afflicted person  and i really believe that one should do all one can to  show great sympathy to him for his misfortune  for miserable people are  so foolish that this does them the greatest good in the world  yet  i also hold that we should be content with expressing sympathy  and  carefully avoid having any  it is a passion that is wholly worthless in  a well regulated mind  which only serves to weaken the heart  and which  should be left to ordinary persons  who  as they never do anything from  reason  have need of passions to stimulate their actions      i love my friends  and i love them to such an extent that i would not  for a moment weigh my interest against theirs  i condescend to them   i patiently endure their bad temper  but  also  i do not make much of  their caresses  and i do not feel great uneasiness in their absence      naturally  i have but little curiosity about the majority of things  that stir up curiosity in other men  i am very secret  and i have less  difficulty than most men in holding my tongue as to what is told me in  confidence  i am most particular as to my word  and i would never fail   whatever might be the consequence  to do what i had promised  and i have  made this an inflexible law during the whole of my life      i keep the most punctilious civility to women  i do not believe i have  ever said anything before them which could cause them annoyance  when  their intellect is cultivated  i prefer their society to that of men   one there finds a mildness one does not meet with among ourselves   and it seems to me beyond this that they express themselves with more  neatness  and give a more agreeable turn to the things they talk about   as for flirtation  i formerly indulged in a little  now i shall do so no  more  though i am still young  i have renounced all flirtation  and i am  simply astonished that there are still so many sensible people who can  occupy their time with it      i wholly approve of real loves  they indicate greatness of soul  and  although  in the uneasiness they give rise to  there is a something  contrary to strict wisdom  they fit in so well with the most severe  virtue  that i believe they cannot be censured with justice  to me who  have known all that is fine and grand in the lofty aspirations of love   if i ever fall in love  it will assuredly be in love of that nature  but  in accordance with the present turn of my mind  i do not believe that  the knowledge i have of it will ever change from my mind to my heart      such is his own description of himself  let us now turn to the other  picture  delineated by the man who was his bitterest enemy  and whom  we  say it with regret  rochefoucauld tried to murder     cardinal de retz thus paints him     in m  de la rochefoucauld there was  ever an indescribable something  from his infancy he always wanted to  be mixed up with plots  at a time when he could not understand even  the smallest interests  which has indeed never been his weak point    or comprehend greater ones  which in another sense has never been his  strong point  he was never fitted for any matter  and i really cannot  tell the reason  his glance was not sufficiently wide  and he could not  take in at once all that lay in his sight  but his good sense  perfect  in theories  combined with his gentleness  his winning ways  his  pleasing manners  which are perfect  should more than compensate for  his lack of penetration  he always had a natural irresoluteness  but i  cannot say to what this irresolution is to be attributed  it could not  arise in him from the wealth of his imagination  for that was anything  but lively  i cannot put it down to the barrenness of his judgment  for   although he was not prompt in action  he had a good store of reason  we  see the effects of this irresolution  although we cannot assign a  cause for it  he was never a general  though a great soldier  never   naturally  a good courtier  although he had always a good idea of being  so  he was never a good partizan  although all his life engaged in  intrigues  that air of pride and timidity which your see in his private  life  is turned in business into an apologetic manner  he always  believed he had need of it  and this  combined with his  maxims   which  show little faith in virtue  and his habitual custom  to give up matters  with the same haste he undertook them  leads me to the conclusion that  he would have done far better to have known his own mind  and have  passed himself off  as he could have done  for the most polished  courtier  the most agreeable man in private life that had appeared in  his century      it is but justice to the cardinal to say  that the duc is not painted in  such dark colours as we should have expected  judging from what we know  of the character of de retz  with his marvellous power of depicting  character  a power unrivalled  except by st  simon and perhaps by lord  clarendon  we should have expected the malignity of the priest would  have stamped the features of his great enemy with the impress of infamy   and not have simply made him appear a courtier  weak  insincere   and nothing more  though rather beyond our subject  the character of  cardinal de retz  as delineated by mdme  sevigne  in one of her letters   will help us to form a true conclusion on the different characters of  the duc and the cardinal  she says     paul de gondi cardinal de retz  possesses great elevation of character  a certain extent of intellect   and more of the ostentation than of the true greatness of courage  he  has an extraordinary memory  more energy than polish in his words  an  easy humour  docility of character  and weakness in submitting to  the complaints and reproaches of his friends  a little piety  some  appearances of religion  he appears ambitious without being really so   vanity and those who have guided him  have made him undertake great  things  almost all opposed to his profession  he excited the greatest  troubles in the state without any design of turning them to account  and  far from declaring himself the enemy of cardinal mazarin with any view  of occupying his place  he thought of nothing but making himself an  object of dread to him  and flattering himself with the false vanity of  being his rival  he was clever enough  however  to take advantage of  the public calamities to get himself made cardinal  he endured his  imprisonment with firmness  and owed his liberty solely to his own  daring  in the obscurity of a life of wandering and concealment  his  indolence for many years supported him with reputation  he preserved the  archbishopric of paris against the power of cardinal mazarin  but after  the death of that minister  he resigned it without knowing what he  was doing  and without making use of the opportunity to promote the  interests of himself and his friends  he has taken part in several  conclaves  and his conduct has always increased his reputation      his natural bent is to indolence  nevertheless he labours with  activity in pressing business  and reposes with indifference when it is  concluded  he has great presence of mind  and knows so well how to turn  it to his own advantage on all occasions presented him by fortune   that it would seem as if he had foreseen and desired them  he loves  to narrate  and seeks to dazzle all his listeners indifferently by his  extraordinary adventures  and his imagination often supplies him with  more than his memory  the generality of his qualities are false  and  what has most contributed to his reputation is his power of throwing  a good light on his faults  he is insensible alike to hatred and to  friendship  whatever pains he may be at to appear taken up with the one  or the other  he is incapable of envy or avarice  whether from virtue or  from carelessness  he has borrowed more from his friends than a private  person could ever hope to be able to repay  he has felt the vanity of  acquiring so much on credit  and of undertaking to discharge it  he has  neither taste nor refinement  he is amused by everything and pleased  by nothing  he avoids difficult matters with considerable address   not allowing people to penetrate the slight acquaintance he has with  everything  the retreat he has just made from the world is the most  brilliant and the most unreal action of his life  it is a sacrifice he  has made to his pride under the pretence of devotion  he quits the court  to which he cannot attach himself  and retires from a world which is  retiring from him      the maxims were first published in       with a preface by segrais   this preface was omitted in the subsequent editions  the first edition  contained     maxims  counting the last upon death  which was not  numbered  the second in      contained only      the third in       and  the fourth in            in this last edition we first meet with the  introductory maxim   our virtues are generally but disguised vices   the  edition of       the fifth  increased the number to      this was the  last edition revised by the author  and published in his lifetime  the  text of that edition has been used for the present translation  the next  edition  the sixth  was published in       about thirteen years after  the author s death  this edition included fifty new maxims  attributed  by the editor to rochefoucauld  most likely they were his writing  as  the fact was never denied by his family  through whose permission they  were published  they form the third supplement to the translation  this  sixth edition was published by claude barbin  and the french editions  since that time have been too numerous to be enumerated  the great  popularity of the maxims is perhaps best shown from the numerous  translations that have been made of them  no less than eight english  translations  or so called translations  have appeared  one american  a  swedish  and a spanish translation  an italian imitation  with parallel  passages  and an english imitation by hazlitt  the titles of the english  editions are as follows    i  seneca unmasked  by mrs  aphara behn   london        she calls the author the duke of rushfucave

the perusal of the maxims will suggest to every reader to a greater  or less degree  in accordance with the extent of his reading  parallel  passages  and similar ideas  of ancient writers rochefoucauld most  strongly reminds us of tacitus  of modern writers  junius most strongly  reminds us of rochefoucauld  some examples from both are given in the  notes to this translation  it is curious to see how the expressions  of the bitterest writer of english political satire to a great extent  express the same ideas as the great french satirist of private life   had space permitted the parallel could have been drawn very closely  and  much of the invective of junius traced to its source in rochefoucauld     one of the persons whom rochefoucauld patronised and protected  was  the great french fabulist  la fontaine  this patronage was repaid by  la fontaine giving  in one of his fables   l homme et son image   an  elaborate defence of his patron  after there depicting a man who fancied  himself one of the most lovely in the world  and who complained he  always found all mirrors untrustworthy  at last discovered his real  image reflected in the water  he thus applies his

has made it so unpopular  it is too true  we dislike to be told  of our faults  while we only like to be told of our neighbour s   notwithstanding rousseau s assertion  it is young men  who  before they  know their own faults and only know their neighbours   that read and  thoroughly appreciate rochefoucauld     after so many varied opinions he then pleases us more and seems far  truer than he is in reality  it is impossible to give any general  conclusion of such distinguished writers on the subject  each reader  will form his own opinion of the merits of the author and his book  to  some  both will seem deserving of the highest praise  to others both  will seem deserving of the highest censure  the truest judgment as to  the author will be found in the remarks of a countryman of his own  as  to the book in the remarks of a countryman of ours     as to the author  m  sainte beuve says    c etait un misanthrope poli   insinuant  souriant  qui precedait de bien peu et preparait avec charme  l autre misanthrope      as to the book  mr  hallam says    among the books in ancient and  modern times which record the conclusions of observing men on the moral  qualities of their fellows  a high place should be reserved for the  maxims of rochefoucauld            reflections  or  sentences and moral maxims    our virtues are most frequently but vices disguised      this epigraph which is the key to the system of la rochefoucauld  is  found in another form as no      of the maxims of the first edition         it is omitted from the  nd and  rd  and reappears for the first  time in the  th edition  in       as at present  at the head of the  reflections   aime martin  its best answer is arrived at by reversing  the predicate and the subject  and you at once form a contradictory  maxim equally true  our vices are most frequently but virtues  disguised            what we term virtue is often but a mass of various actions and  divers interests  which fortune  or our own industry  manage to arrange   and it is not always from valour or from chastity that men are brave   and women chaste      who combats bravely is not therefore brave  he dreads a death bed like  the meanest slave  who reasons wisely is not therefore wise  his pride  in reasoning  not in acting  lies   pope  moral essays  ep  i  line               self love is the greatest of flatterers           whatever discoveries have been made in the region of self love   there remain many unexplored territories there      this is the first hint of the system the author tries to develope  he  wishes to find in vice a motive for all our actions  but this does not  suffice him  he is obliged to call other passions to the help of his  system and to confound pride  vanity  interest and egotism with self  love  this confusion destroys the unity of his principle   aime martin            self love is more cunning than the most cunning man in the world           the duration of our passions is no more dependant upon us than the  duration of our life   then what becomes of free will   aime  martin           passion often renders the most clever man a fool  and even sometimes  renders the most foolish man clever           great and striking actions which dazzle the eyes are represented by  politicians as the effect of great designs  instead of which they are  commonly caused by the temper and the passions  thus the war between  augustus and anthony  which is set down to the ambition they entertained  of making themselves masters of the world  was probably but an effect of  jealousy           the passions are the only advocates which always persuade  they are  a natural art  the rules of which are infallible  and the simplest man  with passion will be more persuasive than the most eloquent without      see maxim     which is an illustration of this            the passions possess a certain injustice and self interest which  makes it dangerous to follow them  and in reality we should distrust  them even when they appear most trustworthy            in the human heart there is a perpetual generation of passions  so  that the ruin of one is almost always the foundation of another            passions often produce their contraries  avarice sometimes leads to  prodigality  and prodigality to avarice  we are often obstinate through  weakness and daring though timidity            whatever care we take to conceal our passions under the appearances  of piety and honour  they are always to be seen through these veils      the  st edition        preserves the image perhaps better   however  we may conceal our passions under the veil  etc   there is always some  place where they peep out              our self love endures more impatiently the condemnation of our  tastes than of our opinions            men are not only prone to forget benefits and injuries  they even  hate those who have obliged them  and cease to hate those who have  injured them  the necessity of revenging an injury or of recompensing a  benefit seems a slavery to which they are unwilling to submit            the clemency of princes is often but policy to win the affections  of the people         so many are the advantages which monarchs gain by clemency  so greatly  does it raise their fame and endear them to their subjects  that it  is generally happy for them to have an opportunity of displaying  it    montesquieu  esprit des lois  lib  vi   c                 this clemency of which they make a merit  arises oftentimes from  vanity  sometimes from idleness  oftentimes from fear  and almost always  from all three combined      la rochefoucauld is content to paint the age in which he lived  here  the clemency spoken of is nothing more than an expression of the policy  of anne of austria  rochefoucauld had sacrificed all to her  even the  favour of cardinal richelieu  but when she became regent she bestowed  her favours upon those she hated  her friends were forgotten   aime  martin  the reader will hereby see that the age in which the writer  lived best interprets his maxims             the moderation of those who are happy arises from the calm which  good fortune bestows upon their temper            moderation is caused by the fear of exciting the envy and contempt  which those merit who are intoxicated with their good fortune  it is a  vain display of our strength of mind  and in short the moderation of men  at their greatest height is only a desire to appear greater than their  fortune            we have all sufficient strength to support the misfortunes of  others      the strongest example of this is the passage in lucretius  lib  ii    line i     suave mari magno turbantibus aequora ventis e terra magnum  alterius spectare laborem              the constancy of the wise is only the talent of concealing the  agitation of their hearts      thus wisdom is only hypocrisy  says a commentator  this definition of  constancy is a result of maxim                those who are condemned to death affect sometimes a constancy and  contempt for death which is only the fear of facing it  so that one may  say that this constancy and contempt are to their mind what the bandage  is to their eyes      see this thought elaborated in maxim                 philosophy triumphs easily over past evils and future evils  but  present evils triumph over it            few people know death  we only endure it  usually from  determination  and even from stupidity and custom  and most men only die  because they know not how to prevent dying            when great men permit themselves to be cast down by the continuance  of misfortune  they show us that they were only sustained by ambition   and not by their mind  so that plus a great vanity  heroes are made like  other men      both these maxims have been rewritten and made conciser by the author   the variations are not worth quoting             we need greater virtues to sustain good than evil fortune       prosperity do th  best discover vice  but adversity do th  best  discover virtue    lord bacon  essays            of adversity         the quotation wrongly had  does  for  doth              neither the sun nor death can be looked at without winking            people are often vain of their passions  even of the worst  but  envy is a passion so timid and shame faced that no one ever dare avow  her            jealousy is in a manner just and reasonable  as it tends to  preserve a good which belongs  or which we believe belongs to us  on the  other hand envy is a fury which cannot endure the happiness of others            the evil that we do does not attract to us so much persecution and  hatred as our good qualities            we have more strength than will  and it is often merely for an  excuse we say things are impossible            if we had no faults we should not take so much pleasure in noting  those of others            jealousy lives upon doubt  and comes to an end or becomes a fury as  soon as it passes from doubt to certainty            pride indemnifies itself and loses nothing even when it casts away  vanity      see maxim      where the author states  what we take from our other  faults we add to our pride             if we had no pride we should not complain of that of others       the proud are ever most provoked by pride    cowper  conversation                  pride is much the same in all men  the only difference is the  method and manner of showing it       pride bestowed on all a common friend    pope  essay on man  ep  ii    line                 it would seem that nature  which has so wisely ordered the organs  of our body for our happiness  has also given us pride to spare us the  mortification of knowing our imperfections            pride has a larger part than goodness in our remonstrances with  those who commit faults  and we reprove them not so much to correct as  to persuade them that we ourselves are free from faults            we promise according to our hopes  we perform according to our  fears       the reason why the cardinal  mazarin  deferred so long to grant the  favours he had promised  was because he was persuaded that hope was much  more capable of keeping men to their duty than gratitude    fragments  historiques  racine             interest speaks all sorts of tongues and plays all sorts of

whimsical than that of  fortune            the attachment or indifference which philosophers have shown to  life is only the style of their self love  about which we can no more  dispute than of that of the palate or of the choice of colours            our temper sets a price upon every gift that we receive from  fortune            happiness is in the taste  and not in the things themselves  we

compensation of good and evil which renders them  equal            whatever great advantages nature may give  it is not she alone  but  fortune also that makes the hero            the contempt of riches in philosophers was only a hidden desire to  avenge their merit upon the injustice of fortune  by despising the  very goods of which fortune had deprived them  it was a secret to guard  themselves against the degradation of poverty  it was a back way by  which to arrive at that distinction which they could not gain by riches       it is always easy as well as agreeable for the inferior ranks of  mankind to claim merit from the contempt of that pomp and pleasure  which fortune has placed beyond their reach  the virtue of the primitive  christians  like that of the first

on the first approach of age do not show wherein their  body  or their mind  is beginning to fail             gratitude is as the good faith of merchants  it holds commerce  together  and we do not pay because it is just to pay debts  but because  we shall thereby more easily find people who will lend             all those who pay the debts of gratitude cannot thereby flatter  themselves that they are grateful             what makes false reckoning  as regards gratitude  is that the  pride of the giver and the receiver cannot agree as to the value of the  benefit       the first foundation of friendship is not the power of conferring  benefits  but the equality with which they are received  and may be  returned    junius s letter to the king              too great a hurry to discharge

producing the like  we imitate good actions by emulation   and bad ones by the evil of our nature  which shame imprisons until  example liberates             it is great folly to wish only to be wise             whatever pretext we give to our afflictions it is always interest  or vanity that causes them             in afflictions there are various kinds of hypocrisy  in one  under  the pretext of weeping for one dear to us we bemoan ourselves  we  regret her good opinion of us  we deplore the loss of our comfort  our  pleasure  our consideration  thus the dead have the credit of tears  shed for the living  i affirm  tis a kind of hypocrisy which in these  afflictions deceives itself  there is another kind not so innocent  because it imposes on all the world  that is the grief of those who  aspire to the glory of a noble and immortal sorrow  after time   which absorbs all  has obliterated what sorrow they had  they still  obstinately obtrude their tears  their sighs their groans  they wear a  solemn face  and try to persuade others by all their acts  that their  grief will end only with their life  this sad and distressing vanity is  commonly found in ambitious women  as their sex closes to them all paths  to glory  they strive to render themselves celebrated by showing an  inconsolable affliction  there is yet another kind of tears arising from  but small sources  which flow easily and cease as easily  one weeps to  achieve a reputation for tenderness  weeps to be pitied  weeps to be  bewept  in fact one weeps to avoid the disgrace of not weeping       in grief the  pleasure  is still uppermost    and the affliction we  suffer has no resemblance to absolute pain which is always odious  and  which we endeavour to shake off as soon as possible    burke  sublime

powerlessness of will             it is not so dangerous to do wrong to most men  as to do them too  much good             nothing flatters our pride so much as the confidence of the great   because we regard it as the result of our worth  without remembering  that generally  tis but vanity  or the inability to keep a secret             we may say of conformity as distinguished from beauty  that

desire  and avarice  passions which probably have a common origin  but produce  different results  the greedy man is nearly always desirous to possess   and often foregoes great future advantages for small present interests   the avaricious man  on the other hand  mistakes present advantages for  the great expectations of the future  both desire to possess and  enjoy  but the miser possesses and

not find they have enough faults  as they  increase the number by certain peculiar qualities that they affect to  assume  and which they cultivate with so great assiduity that at length  they become natural faults  which they can no longer correct             what makes us see that men know their faults better than we  imagine  is that they are never wrong when they speak of their conduct   the same self love that usually blinds them enlightens them  and gives  them such true views as to make them suppress or disguise the smallest  thing that might be censured             young men entering

valueless to a woman to be young unless pretty  or to be  pretty unless young             some persons are so frivolous and fickle that they are as far  removed from real defects as from substantial qualities             we do not usually reckon a woman s first flirtation until she has  had a second             some people are so self occupied that when in love they find a  mode by which to be engrossed with the passion without being so with the  person they love             love  though so very agreeable  pleases more by its ways than by  itself             a little wit with good sense bores less in the long run than much  wit with ill nature             jealousy is the worst of all evils  yet the one that is least  pitied by those who cause it             thus having treated of the hollowness of so many apparent virtues   it is but just to say something on the hollowness of the contempt for  death  i allude to that contempt of death which the heathen boasted they  derived from their unaided understanding  without the hope of a future  state  there is a difference between meeting death with courage and  despising it  the first is common enough  the last i think always  feigned  yet everything that could be has been written to persuade us  that death is no evil  and the weakest of men  equally with the bravest   have given many noble examples on which to found such an opinion  still  i do not think that any man of good sense has ever yet believed in it   and the pains we take to persuade others as well as ourselves amply show  that the task is far from easy  for many reasons we may be disgusted  with life  but for none may we despise it  not even those who commit  suicide regard it as a light matter  and are as much alarmed and  startled as the rest of the world if death meets them in a different  way than the one they have selected  the difference we observe in the  courage of so great a number of brave men  is from meeting death in a  way different from what they imagined  when it shows itself nearer  at one time than at another  thus it ultimately happens that having  despised death when they were ignorant of it  they dread it when they  become acquainted with it  if we could avoid seeing it with all its  surroundings  we might perhaps believe that it was not the greatest of  evils  the wisest and bravest are those who take the best means to avoid  reflecting on it  as every man who sees it in its real light regards  it as dreadful  the necessity of dying created all the constancy of  philosophers  they thought it but right to go with a good grace when  they could not avoid going  and being unable to prolong their lives  indefinitely  nothing remained but to build an immortal reputation  and  to save from the general wreck all that could be saved  to put a good  face upon it  let it suffice  not to say all that we think to ourselves   but rely more on our nature than on our fallible reason  which might  make us think we could approach death with indifference  the glory of  dying with courage  the hope of being regretted  the desire to leave  behind us a good reputation  the assurance of being enfranchised from  the miseries of life and being no longer dependent on the wiles of  fortune  are resources which should not be passed over  but we must not  regard them as infallible  they should affect us in the same proportion  as a single shelter affects those who in war storm a fortress  at a  distance they think it may afford cover  but when near they find it  only a feeble protection  it is only deceiving ourselves to imagine  that death  when near  will seem the same as at a distance  or that our  feelings  which are merely weaknesses  are naturally so strong that they  will not suffer in an attack of the rudest of trials  it is equally as  absurd to try the effect of self esteem and to think it will enable us  to count as naught what will of necessity destroy it  and the mind in  which we trust to find so many resources will be far too weak in the  struggle to persuade us in the way we wish  for it is this which betrays  us so frequently  and which  instead of filling us with contempt of  death  serves but to show us all that is frightful and fearful  the most  it can do for us is to persuade us to avert our gaze and fix it on other  objects  cato and brutus each selected noble ones  a lackey sometime  ago contented himself by dancing on the scaffold when he was about to be  broken on the wheel  so however diverse the motives they but realize the  same result  for the rest it is a fact that whatever difference there  may be between the peer and the peasant  we have constantly seen both  the one and the other meet death with the same composure  still there  is always this difference  that the contempt the peer shows for death is  but the love of fame which hides death from his sight  in the peasant it  is but the result of his limited vision that hides from him the extent  of the evil  end leaves him free to reflect on other things           the first supplement     the following reflections are extracted from the first two editions  of la rochefoucauld  having been suppressed by the author in succeeding  issues      i   self love is the love of self  and of all things for self  it  makes men self worshippers  and if fortune permits them  causes them to  tyrannize over others  it is never quiet when out of itself  and only  rests upon other subjects as a bee upon flowers  to extract from them  its proper food  nothing is so headstrong as its desires  nothing so  well concealed as its designs  nothing so skilful as its management   its suppleness is beyond description  its changes surpass those of the  metamorphoses  its refinements those of chemistry  we can neither plumb  the depths nor pierce the shades of its recesses  therein it is hidden  from the most far seeing eyes  therein it takes a thousand imperceptible  folds  there it is often to itself invisible  it there conceives  there  nourishes and rears  without being aware of it  numberless loves and  hatreds  some so monstrous that when they are brought to light it  disowns them  and cannot resolve to avow them  in the night which covers  it are born the ridiculous persuasions it has of itself  thence come its  errors  its ignorance  its silly mistakes  thence it is led to believe  that its passions which sleep are dead  and to think that it has lost  all appetite for that of which it is sated  but this thick darkness  which conceals it from itself does not hinder it from seeing that  perfectly which is out of itself  and in this it resembles our eyes  which behold all  and yet cannot set their own forms  in fact  in great  concerns and important matters when the violence of its desires  summons all its attention  it sees  feels  hears  imagines  suspects   penetrates  divines all  so that we might think that each of its  passions had a magic power proper to it  nothing is so close and strong  as its attachments  which  in sight of the extreme misfortunes which  threaten it  it vainly attempts to break  yet sometimes it effects that  without trouble and quickly  which it failed to do with its whole power  and in the course of years  whence we may fairly conclude that it is  by itself that its desires are inflamed  rather than by the beauty and  merit of its objects  that its own taste embellishes and heightens them   that it is itself the game it pursues  and that it follows eagerly  when it runs after that upon which itself is eager  it is made up of  contraries  it is imperious and obedient  sincere and false  piteous  and cruel  timid and bold  it has different desires according to the  diversity of temperaments  which turn and fix it sometimes upon riches   sometimes on pleasures  it changes according to our age  our fortunes   and our hopes  it is quite indifferent whether it has many or one   because it can split itself into many portions  and unite in one as  it pleases  it is inconstant  and besides the changes which arise  from strange causes it has an infinity born of itself  and of its own  substance  it is inconstant through inconstancy  of lightness  love   novelty  lassitude and distaste  it is capricious  and one sees it  sometimes work with intense eagerness and with incredible labour to  obtain things of little use to it which are even hurtful  but which it  pursues because it wishes for them  it is silly  and often throws its  whole application on the utmost frivolities  it finds all its pleasure  in the dullest matters  and places its pride in the most contemptible   it is seen in all states of life  and in all conditions  it lives  everywhere and upon everything  it subsists on nothing  it accommodates  itself either to things or to the want of them  it goes over to  those who are at war with it  enters into their designs  and  this is  wonderful  it  with them  hates even itself  it conspires for its own  loss  it works towards its own ruin  in fact  caring only to exist  and  providing that it may be  it will be its own enemy  we must therefore  not be surprised if it is sometimes united to the rudest austerity  and  if it enters so boldly into partnership to destroy her  because when it  is rooted out in one place it re establishes itself in another  when it  fancies that it abandons its pleasure it merely changes or suspends its  enjoyment  when even it is conquered in its full flight  we find that  it triumphs in its own defeat  here then is the picture

disguise them that it is itself deceived  but it even changes the state  and nature of things  thus  when a female is adverse to us  and she  turns her hate and persecution against us  self love pronounces on her  actions with all the severity of justice  it exaggerates the faults till  they are enormous  and looks at her good qualities in so disadvantageous  a light that they become more displeasing than her faults  if however  the same female becomes favourable to us  or certain of our interests  reconcile her to us  our sole self interest gives her back the lustre  which our hatred deprived her of  the bad qualities become effaced   the good ones appear with a redoubled advantage  we even summon all our  indulgence to justify the war she has made upon us  now although all  passions prove this truth  that of love exhibits it most clearly  for we  may see a lover moved with rage by the neglect or the infidelity of her  whom he loves  and meditating the utmost vengeance that his passion can  inspire  nevertheless as soon as the sight of his beloved has calmed the  fury of his movements  his passion holds that beauty innocent  he only  accuses himself  he condemns his condemnations  and by the miraculous  power of selflove  he whitens the blackest actions of his mistress  and  takes from her all crime to lay it on himself      no date or number is given for this

have yet many points of difference     sincerity is an openness of heart  which shows us what we are  a love  of truth  a dislike to deception  a wish to compensate our faults and to  lessen them by the merit of confessing them     confidence leaves us less liberty  its rules are stricter  it requires  more prudence and reticence  and we are not always free to give it  it  relates not only to ourselves  since our interests are often mixed  up with those of others  it requires great delicacy not to expose  our friends in exposing ourselves  not to draw upon their goodness to  enhance the value of what we give     confidence always pleases those who receive it  it is a tribute we pay  to their merit  a deposit we commit to their trust  a pledge which  gives them a claim upon us  a kind of dependence to which we voluntarily  submit  i do not wish from what i have said to depreciate confidence   so necessary to man  it is in society the link between acquaintance and  friendship  i only wish to state its limits to make it true and real   i would that it was always sincere  always discreet  and that it had  neither weakness nor interest  i know it is hard to place proper limits  on being taken into all our friends  confidence  and taking them into  all ours     most frequently we make confidants from vanity  a love of talking  a  wish to win the confidence of others  and make an exchange of secrets     some may have a motive for confiding in us  towards whom we have no  motive for confiding  with them we discharge the obligation in keeping  their secrets and trusting them with small confidences     others whose fidelity we know trust nothing to us  but we confide in  them by choice and inclination     we should hide from them nothing that concerns us  we should always show  them with equal truth  our virtues and our vices  without exaggerating  the one or diminishing the other  we should make it a rule never to  have half confidences  they always embarrass those who give them  and  dissatisfy those who receive them  they shed an uncertain light on what  we want hidden  increase curiosity  entitling the recipients to know  more  giving them leave to consider themselves free to talk of what they  have guessed  it is far safer and more honest to tell nothing than to be  silent when we have begun to tell  there are other rules to be observed  in matters confided to us  all are important  to all prudence and trust  are essential     everyone agrees that a secret should be kept intact  but everyone does  not agree as to the nature and importance of secresy  too often we  consult ourselves as to what we should say  what we should leave unsaid   there are few permanent secrets  and the scruple against revealing them  will not last for ever     with those friends whose truth we know we have the closest intimacy   they have always spoken unreservedly to us  we should always do the same  to them  they know our habits and connexions  and see too clearly not  to perceive the slightest change  they may have elsewhere learnt what we  have promised not to tell  it is not in our power to tell them what has  been entrusted to us  though it might tend to their interest to know it   we feel as confident of them as of ourselves  and we are reduced to the  hard fate of losing their friendship  which is dear to us  or of being  faithless as regards a secret  this is doubtless the hardest test of  fidelity  but it should not move an honest man  it is then that he can  sacrifice himself to others  his first duty is to rigidly keep his trust  in its entirety  he should not only control and guard his and his voice   but even his lighter talk  so that nothing be seen in his conversation  or manner that could direct the curiosity of others towards that which  he wishes to conceal     we have often need of strength and prudence wherewith to oppose the  exigencies of most of our friends who make a claim on our confidence   and seek to know all about us  we should never allow them to acquire  this unexceptionable right  there are accidents and circumstances which  do not fall in their cognizance  if they complain  we should endure  their complaints and excuse ourselves with gentleness  but if they are  still unreasonable  we should sacrifice their friendship to our duty   and choose between two inevitable evils  the one reparable  the other  irreparable     ii  on difference of character     although all the qualities of mind may be united in a great genius   yet there are some which are special and peculiar to him  his views are  unlimited  he always acts uniformly and with the same activity  he sees  distant objects as if present  he comprehends and grasps the greatest   sees and notices the smallest matters  his thoughts are elevated  broad   just and intelligible  nothing escapes his observation  and he often  finds truth in spite of the obscurity that hides her from others     a lofty mind always thinks nobly  it easily creates vivid  agreeable   and natural fancies  places them in their best light  clothes them with  all appropriate adornments  studies others  tastes  and clears away from  its own thoughts all that is useless and disagreeable     a clever  pliant  winning mind knows how to avoid and overcome  difficulties  bending easily to what it wants  it understands the  inclination and temper it is dealing with  and by managing their  interests it advances and establishes its own     a well regulated mind sees all things as they should be seen  appraises  them at their proper value  turns them to its own advantage  and adheres  firmly to its own opinions as it knows all their force and weight     a difference exists between a working mind and a business like mind  we  can undertake business without turning it to our own interest  some are  clever only in what does not concern them  and the reverse in all that  does  there are others again whose cleverness is limited to their own  business  and who know how to turn everything to their own advantage     it is possible to have a serious turn of mind  and yet to talk  pleasantly and cheerfully  this class of mind is suited to all persons  in all times of life  young persons have usually a cheerful and  satirical turn  untempered by seriousness  thus often making themselves  disagreeable     no part is easier to play than that of being always pleasant  and the  applause we sometimes receive in censuring others is not worth being  exposed to the chance of offending them when they are out of temper     satire is at once the most agreeable and most dangerous of mental  qualities  it always pleases when it is refined  but we always fear  those who use it too much  yet satire should be allowed when unmixed  with spite  and when the person satirised can join in the satire     it is unfortunate to have a satirical turn without affecting to be  pleased or without loving to jest  it requires much adroitness to  continue satirical without falling into one of these extremes     raillery is a kind of mirth which takes possession of the imagination   and shows every object in an absurd light  wit combines more or less  softness or harshness     there is a kind of refined and flattering raillery that only hits the  faults that persons admit  which understands how to hide the praise it  gives under the appearance of blame  and shows the good while feigning a  wish to hide it     an acute mind and a cunning mind are very dissimilar  the first always  pleases  it is unfettered  it perceives the most delicate and sees the  most imperceptible matters  a cunning spirit never goes straight  it  endeavours to secure its object by byeways and short cuts  this conduct  is soon found out  it always gives rise to distrust and never reaches  greatness     there is a difference between an ardent and a brilliant mind  a fiery  spirit travels further and faster  while a brilliant mind is sparkling   attractive  accurate     gentleness of mind is an easy and accommodating manner which always  pleases when not insipid     a mind full of details devotes itself to the management and regulation  of the smallest particulars it meets with  this distinction is usually  limited to little matters  yet it is not absolutely incompatible with  greatness  and when these two qualities are united in the same mind they  raise it infinitely above others     the expression  bel esprit  is much perverted  for all that one can say  of the different kinds of mind meet together in the  bel esprit   yet as  the epithet is bestowed on an infinite number of bad poets and tedious  authors  it is more often used to ridicule than to praise     there are yet many other epithets for the mind which mean the same  thing  the difference lies in the tone and manner of saying them  but  as tones and manner cannot appear in writing i shall not go into  distinctions i cannot explain  custom explains this in saying that a  man has wit  has much wit  that he is a great wit  there are tones and  manners which make all the difference between phrases which seem all  alike on paper  and yet express a different order of mind     so we say that a man has only one kind of wit  that he has several  that  he has every variety of wit     one can be a fool with much wit  and one need not be a fool even with  very little wit     to have much mind is a doubtful expression  it may mean every class of  mind that can be mentioned  it may mean none in particular  it may mean  that he talks sensibly while he acts foolishly  we may have a mind  but  a narrow one  a mind may be fitted for some things  not for others  we  may have a large measure of mind fitted for nothing  and one is often  inconvenienced with much mind  still of this kind of mind we may say  that it is sometimes pleasing in society     though the gifts of the mind are infinite  they can  it seems to me  be  thus classified     there are some so beautiful that everyone can see and feel their beauty     there are some lovely  it is true  but which are wearisome     there are some which are lovely  which all the world admire  but without  knowing why     there are some so refined and delicate that few are capable even of  remarking all their beauties     there are others which  though imperfect  yet are produced with such  skill  and sustained and managed with such sense and grace  that they  even deserve to be admired     iii  on taste     some persons have more wit than taste  others have more taste than wit   there is greater vanity and caprice in taste than in wit     the word taste has different meanings  which it is easy to mistake   there is a difference between the taste which in certain objects has  an attraction for us  and the taste that makes us understand and  distinguish the qualities we judge by     we may like a comedy without having a sufficiently fine and delicate  taste to criticise it accurately  some tastes lead us imperceptibly to  objects  from which others carry us away by their force or intensity     some persons have bad taste in everything  others have bad taste only  in some things  but a correct and good taste in matters within their  capacity  some have peculiar taste  which they know to be bad  but which  they still follow  some have a doubtful taste  and let chance decide   their indecision makes them change  and they are affected with pleasure  or weariness on their friends  judgment  others are always prejudiced   they are the slaves of their tastes  which they adhere to in everything   some know what is good  and are horrified at what is not  their opinions  are clear and true  and they find the reason for their taste in their  mind and understanding     some have a species of instinct  the source of which they are ignorant  of   and decide all questions that come before them by its aid  and  always decide rightly     these follow their taste more than their intelligence  because they  do not permit their temper and self love to prevail over their natural  discernment  all they do is in harmony  all is in the same spirit   this harmony makes them decide correctly on matters  and form a correct  estimate of their value  but speaking generally there are few who have  a taste fixed and independent of that of their friends  they follow  example and fashion which generally form the standard of taste     in all the diversities of taste that we discern  it is very rare and  almost impossible to meet with that sort of good taste that knows how to  set a price on the particular  and yet understands the right value that  should be placed on all  our knowledge is too limited  and that correct  discernment of good qualities which goes to form a correct judgment  is too seldom to be met with except in regard to matters that do not  concern us     as regards ourselves our taste has not this all important discernment   preoccupation  trouble  all that concern us  present it to us in another  aspect  we do not see with the same eyes what does and what does not  relate to us  our taste is guided by the bent of our self love and  temper  which supplies us with new views which we adapt to an infinite  number of changes and uncertainties  our taste is no longer our own   we cease to control it  without our consent it changes  and the same  objects appear to us in such divers aspects that ultimately we fail to  perceive what we have seen and heard     iv  on society     in speaking of society my plan is not to speak of friendship  for   though they have some connection  they are yet very different  the  former has more in it of greatness and humility  and the greatest merit  of the latter is to resemble the former     for the present i shall speak of that particular kind of intercourse  that gentlemen should have with each other  it would be idle to show how  far society is essential to men  all seek for it  and all find it  but  few adopt the method of making it pleasant and lasting     everyone seeks to find his pleasure and his advantage at the expense of  others  we prefer ourselves always to those with whom we intend to  live  and they almost always perceive the preference  it is this which  disturbs and destroys society  we should discover a means to hide this  love of selection since it is too ingrained in us to be in our power to  destroy  we should make our pleasure that of other persons  to humour   never to wound their self love     the mind has a great part to do in so great a work  but it is not merely  sufficient for us to guide it in the different courses it should hold     the agreement we meet between minds would not keep society together for  long if she was not governed and sustained by good sense  temper  and by  the consideration which ought to exist between persons who have to live  together     it sometimes happens that persons opposite in temper and mind become  united  they doubtless hold together for different reasons  which cannot  last for long  society may subsist between those who are our inferiors  by birth or by personal qualities  but those who have these advantages  should not abuse them  they should seldom let it be perceived that they  serve to instruct others  they should let their conduct show that  they  too  have need to be guided and led by reason  and accommodate  themselves as far as possible to the feeling and the interests of the  others     to make society pleasant  it is essential that each should retain  his freedom of action  a man should not see himself  or he should see  himself without dependence  and at the same time amuse himself  he  should have the power of separating himself without that separation  bringing any change on the society  he should have the power to pass by  one and the other  if he does not wish to expose himself to occasional  embarrassments  and he should remember that he is often bored when he  believes he has not the power even to bore  he should share in what he  believes to be the amusement of persons with whom he wishes to live  but  he should not always be liable to the trouble of providing them     complaisance is essential in society  but it should have its limits   it becomes a slavery when it is extreme  we should so render a free  consent  that in following the opinion of our friends they should  believe that they follow ours     we should readily excuse our friends when their faults are born with  them  and they are less than their good qualities  we should often avoid  to show what they have said  and what they have left unsaid  we should  try to make them perceive their faults  so as to give them the merit of  correcting them     there is a kind of politeness which is necessary in the intercourse  among gentlemen  it makes them comprehend badinage  and it keeps  them from using and employing certain figures of speech  too rude  and unrefined  which are often used thoughtlessly when we hold to our  opinion with too much warmth     the intercourse of gentlemen cannot subsist without a certain kind of  confidence  this should be equal on both sides  each should have an  appearance of sincerity and of discretion which never causes the fear of  anything imprudent being said     there should be some variety in wit  those who have only one kind of  wit cannot please for long unless they can take different roads  and not  both use the same talents  thus adding to the pleasure of society  and  keeping the same harmony that different voices and different instruments  should observe in music  and as it is detrimental to the quiet of  society  that many persons should have the same interests  it is yet as  necessary for it that their interests should not be different     we should anticipate what can please our friends  find out how to be  useful to them so as to exempt them from annoyance  and when we cannot  avert evils  seem to participate in them  insensibly obliterate without  attempting to destroy them at a blow  and place agreeable objects in  their place  or at least such as will interest them  we should talk of  subjects that concern them  but only so far as they like  and we  should take great care where we draw the line  there is a species of  politeness  and we may say a similar species of humanity  which does not  enter too quickly into the recesses of the heart  it often takes pains  to allow us to see all that our friends know  while they have still the  advantage of not knowing to the full when we have penetrated the depth  of the heart     thus the intercourse between gentlemen at once gives them familiarity  and furnishes them with an infinite number of subjects on which to talk  freely     few persons have sufficient tact and good sense fairly to appreciate  many matters that are essential to maintain society  we desire to  turn away at a certain point  but we do not want to be mixed up in  everything  and we fear to know all kinds of truth     as we should stand at a certain distance to view objects  so we should  also stand at a distance to observe society  each has its proper point  of view from which it should be regarded  it is quite right that it  should not be looked at too closely  for there is hardly a man who in  all matters allows himself to be seen as he really is     v  on conversation     the reason why so few persons are agreeable in conversation is that each  thinks more of what he desires to say  than of what the others say  and  that we make bad listeners when we want to speak     yet it is necessary to listen to those who talk  we should give them the  time they want  and let them say even senseless things  never contradict  or interrupt them  on the contrary  we should enter into their mind and  taste  illustrate their meaning  praise anything they say that deserves  praise  and let them see we praise more from our choice than from  agreement with them     to please others we should talk on subjects they like and that interest  them  avoid disputes upon indifferent matters  seldom ask questions  and  never let them see that we pretend to be better informed than they are     we should talk in a more or less serious manner  and upon more or less  abstruse subjects  according to the temper and understanding of the  persons we talk with  and readily give them the advantage of deciding  without obliging them to answer when they are not anxious to talk     after having in this way fulfilled the duties of politeness  we can  speak our opinions to our listeners when we find an opportunity without  a sign of presumption or opinionatedness  above all things we should  avoid often talking of ourselves and giving ourselves as an example   nothing is more tiresome than a man who quotes himself for everything     we cannot give too great study to find out the manner and the capacity  of those with whom we talk  so as to join in the conversation of those  who have more than ourselves without hurting by this preference the  wishes or interests of others     then we should modestly use all the modes abovementioned to show our  thoughts to them  and make them  if possible  believe that we take our  ideas from them     we should never say anything with an air of authority  nor show  any superiority of mind  we should avoid far fetched expressions   expressions hard or forced  and never let the words be grander than the  matter     it is not wrong to retain our opinions if they are reasonable  but we  should yield to reason  wherever she appears and from whatever side  she comes  she alone should govern our opinions  we should follow her  without opposing the opinions of others  and without seeming to ignore  what they say     it is dangerous to seek to be always the leader of the conversation  and  to push a good argument too hard  when we have found one  civility often  hides half its understanding  and when it meets with an opinionated man  who defends the bad side  spares him the disgrace of giving way     we are sure to displease when we speak too long and too often of one  subject  and when we try to turn the conversation upon subjects that we  think more instructive than others  we should enter indifferently upon  every subject that is agreeable to others  stopping where they wish  and  avoiding all they do not agree with     every kind of conversation  however witty it may be  is not equally  fitted for all clever persons  we should select what is to their taste  and suitable to their condition  their sex  their talents  and also  choose the time to say it     we should observe the place  the occasion  the temper in which we find  the person who listens to us  for if there is much art in speaking to  the purpose  there is no less in knowing when to be silent  there is  an eloquent silence which serves to approve or to condemn  there is a  silence of discretion and of respect  in a word  there is a tone  an  air  a manner  which renders everything in conversation agreeable or  disagreeable  refined or vulgar     but it is given to few persons to keep this secret well  those who lay  down rules too often break them  and the safest we are able to give is  to listen much  to speak little  and to say nothing that will ever give  ground for regret     vi  falsehood     we are false in different ways  there are some men who are false from  wishing always to appear what they are not  there are some who have  better faith  who are born false  who deceive themselves  and who never  see themselves as they really are  to some is given a true understanding  and a false taste  others have a false understanding and some  correctness in taste  there are some who have not any falsity either in  taste or mind  these last are very rare  for to speak generally  there  is no one who has not some falseness in some corner of his mind or his  taste     what makes this falseness so universal  is that as our qualities are  uncertain and confused  so too  are our tastes  we do not see things  exactly as they are  we value them more or less than they are worth   and do not bring them into unison with ourselves in a manner which suits  them or suits our condition or qualities     this mistake gives rise to an infinite number of falsities in the taste  and in the mind  our self love is flattered by all that presents itself  to us under the guise of good     but as there are many kinds of good which affect our vanity and our  temper  so they are often followed from custom or advantage  we follow  because the others follow  without considering that the same feeling  ought not to be equally embarrassing to all kinds of persons  and that  it should attach itself more or less firmly  according as persons agree  more or less with those who follow them     we dread still more to show falseness in taste than in mind  gentleness  should approve without prejudice what deserves to be approved  follow  what deserves to be followed  and take offence at nothing  but there  should be great distinction and great accuracy  we should distinguish  between what is good in the abstract and what is good for ourselves  and  always follow in reason the natural inclination which carries us towards  matters that please us     if men only wished to excel by the help of their own talents  and in  following their duty  there would be nothing false in their taste or in  their conduct  they would show what they were  they would judge matters  by their lights  and they would attract by their reason  there would be  a discernment in their views  in their sentiments  their taste would  be true  it would come to them direct  and not from others  they would  follow from choice and not from habit or chance  if we are false in  admiring what should not be admired  it is oftener from envy that we  affix a value to qualities which are good in themselves  but which do  not become us  a magistrate is false when he flatters himself he is  brave  and that he will be able to be bold in certain cases  he should  be as firm and stedfast in a plot which ought to be stifled without fear  of being false  as he would be false and absurd in fighting a duel about  it     a woman may like science  but all sciences are not suitable for her  and  the doctrines of certain sciences never become her  and when applied by  her are always false     we should allow reason and good sense to fix the value of things  they  should determine our taste and give things the merit they deserve  and  the importance it is fitting we should give them  but nearly all men are  deceived in the price and in the value  and in these mistakes there is  always a kind of falseness     vii  on air and manner     there is an air which belongs to the figure and talents of each  individual  we always lose it when we abandon it to assume another     we should try to find out what air is natural to us and never abandon  it  but make it as perfect as we can  this is the reason that the  majority of children please  it is because they are wrapt up in the air  and manner nature has given them  and are ignorant of any other  they  are changed and corrupted when they quit infancy  they think they should  imitate what they see  and they are not altogether able to imitate it   in this imitation there is always something of falsity and uncertainty   they have nothing settled in their manner and opinions  instead of being  in reality what they want to appear  they seek to appear what they are  not     all men want to be different  and to be greater than they are  they seek  for an air other than their own  and a mind different from what  they possess  they take their style and manner at chance  they make  experiments upon themselves without considering that what suits one  person will not suit everyone  that there is no universal rule for taste  or manners  and that there are no good copies     few men  nevertheless  can have unison in many matters without being  a copy of each other  if each follow his natural turn of mind  but in  general a person will not wholly follow it  he loves to imitate  we  often imitate the same person without perceiving it  and we neglect our  own good qualities for the good qualities of others  which generally do  not suit us     i do not pretend  from what i say  that each should so wrap himself up  in himself as not to be able to follow example  or to add to his own   useful and serviceable habits  which nature has not given him  arts and  sciences may be proper for the greater part of those who are capable for  them  good manners and politeness are proper for all the world  but  yet  acquired qualities should always have a certain agreement and a certain  union with our own natural qualities  which they imperceptibly extend  and increase  we are elevated to a rank and dignity above ourselves  we  are often engaged in a new profession for which nature has not adapted  us  all these conditions have each an air which belong to them  but  which does not always agree with our natural manner  this change of our  fortune often changes our air and our manners  and augments the air of  dignity  which is always false when it is too marked  and when it is not  united and amalgamated with that which nature has given us  we should  unite and blend them together  and thus render them such that they can  never be separated     we should not speak of all subjects in one tone and in the same manner   we do not march at the head of a regiment as we walk on a promenade   and we should use the same style in which we should naturally speak of  different things in the same way  with the same difference as we should  walk  but always naturally  and as is suitable  either at the head of  a regiment or on a promenade  there are some who are not content to  abandon the air and manner natural to them to assume those of the rank  and dignities to which they have arrived  there are some who assume  prematurely the air of the dignities and rank to which they aspire   how many lieutenant generals assume to be marshals of france  how many  barristers vainly repeat the style of the chancellor and how many female  citizens give themselves the airs of duchesses     but what we are most often vexed at is that no one knows how to conform  his air and manners with his appearance  nor his style and words with  his thoughts and sentiments  that every one forgets himself and how far  he is insensibly removed from the truth  nearly every one falls into  this fault in some way  no one has an ear sufficiently fine to mark  perfectly this kind of cadence     thousands of people with good qualities are displeasing  thousands  pleasing with far less abilities  and why  because the first wish to  appear to be what they are not  the second are what they appear     some of the advantages or disadvantages that we have received from  nature please in proportion as we know the air  the style  the manner   the sentiments that coincide with our condition and our appearance  and  displease in the proportion they are removed from that point           index    the letter r preceding a reference refers to the reflections  the roman  numerals refer to the supplements           ability                                see cleverness

and waiting  waiting for the decision  to be made  the determination that would mean so much to them     the people talked and gesticulated  and there was considerable  arguing  some contending that the declaration of independence would be  adopted and signed  others that it would not      look  here it is almost evening   contended one of these latter   and  nothing has been done yet  if they were going to adopt the declaration  it would have been done before this  the delay means that it will not  be done       they are taking their time to it  that is all   replied the others    it is a most serious matter and not to be taken up hastily and  without due thought  they will adopt and sign the declaration of  independence before the day is gone  see if they don t      dick and tom dare  two patriot youths  brothers  from about three  miles over in new jersey  who had come to the city to hear the news   listening eagerly  were thrilled by the excitement and interest shown  on every side      oh  i hope they will adopt the declaration of independence  dick    said tom   i m sure they will  aren t you       i think they will  tom  i hope so       bah  they won t do nothin  uv the kind  dick dare   cried a sneering  voice at their side  and turning  the dare youths saw zeke boggs and  lem hicks  the sons of two tory neighbors  standing there      uv course they won t   added lem hicks   they don t darst  they know  that ef they do  they ll git into trouble with king george  they won t  ring no old liberty bell to day       well  they just will   cried tom dare  who was an excitable   impulsive youth   they ll ring it pretty soon  lem hicks  and they  aren t afraid of your old king  not a bit of it       what s thet  don t ye dare speak disrespectfully uv the king    snarled zeke boggs  making a threatening motion with his fist   ef ye  do  why et ll be the worse fur ye  that s all      instantly dick dare  who was the elder of the brothers  a handsome   manly youth of eighteen years  seized zeke by the wrist  and pushed  him back  at the same time saying quietly  yet firmly      that will do  zeke  don t go making any threats  you and lem go about  your business  and don t interfere with tom and i       we ll go where we please   snarled zeke  who was a vicious youth of  about dick s age  as was lem hicks also   an  we ll stay heer ef we  want to  too  dick dare  an  ye can t he p yerself       that s all right   calmly   you can stay here  i suppose  if you want  to  but you will have to behave yourselves and attend to your own  business  if you try to interfere with tom and i  or to bully us  you  will wish you hadn t stayed       is thet so   sneeringly   whut ll ye do  dick dare  hey       yes  whut ll ye do   cried lem hicks  pushing forward and facing  dick     tom confronted him quickly  and met his angry glare unflinchingly  tom  was only sixteen years of age  but he was well built and athletic for  his age  and was moreover as brave as a lion  though somewhat  quick tempered and impulsive  he put out his left hand and  placing it  against lem s chest  pushed him back      hold on  lem hicks   he said   just you stand back  one at a time  talking with dick is enough  you talk to me  if you want to talk to  anybody      lem hicks was a hot tempered youth also  and suddenly his rage flared  to the surface  he didn t relish being pushed back by tom  and quick  as a flash  he gave the patriot youth a smart slap on the cheek      that thet  an  l arn to keep yer han s offen people   he snarled     the blow was with the flat of the hand  and while it smarted  it did  not hurt much to speak of  but it was sufficient to start impulsive  tom dare into action  and quick as a flash out shot his fist  it  caught lem hicks between the eyes and knocked him down flat on his  back      there  see how you like that   exclaimed tom  his eyes flashing   i  guess that next time you ll think once or twice before you slap me in  the face      with an angry exclamation  zeke boggs struck at dick dare  but that  youth was on his guard  and he warded the blow off  and striking out  himself  landed a blow on zeke s jaw  downing him as neatly as had  been the case with hicks     instantly a crowd gathered  many eagerly asking what the trouble was  about  dick and tom explained that the two youths who had been floored  were tories  and the sympathies of the crowd were at once with dick  and tom  more especially when they learned that the tory boys had  picked the quarrel with the patriots      you did just right in knocking them down   was the cry  and so  hostile were the looks  actions and words of the crowd  that zeke and  lem on scrambling to their feet  did not renew the fight  they shook  their fists at dick and tom  however  and muttered threats  as they  moved away through the crowd declaring that they would get even with  dick and tom     the patriot youths received the congratulations and commendations of  the people in their vicinity with becoming modesty  and a little later  moved on up the street     they walked about for an hour or more  after that  and then took up  their station as near the old state house as they could  there was  such an immense crowd there that it was impossible to get within half  a block of the building  in the steeple of the state house was a bell   and the old bell ringer sat beside it  waiting for the moment when his  son  stationed below  should give him word that the declaration had  been adopted  when he would ring the bell  he had been stationed there  since morning  waiting  waiting  and as the day wore away and still  the word to ring came not  he shook his head and muttered that they  would never reach a favorable conclusion     but he was mistaken  for when evening was almost at hand  his son came  rushing out of the state house and called up eagerly and excitedly      they ve done it  father  they ve adopted and signed the declaration  of independence  ring the bell  ring it  father  ring the bell  ring  it  quick      with a glad cry  the old man leaped up  forgetting his rheumatism in  his excitement and delight  and seizing the great iron clapper  swung  it back and forth against the sides of the great brass bell  thus  causing it to do what by a strange coincidence the inscription on its  side said it was to do  viz    proclaim liberty throughout all the  land unto all the inhabitants thereof          chapter ii    waylaid on the road      as the deep tones of the old bell died away on the evening air a great  shout of delight went up from the people on the streets  they leaped  and danced for joy  they tossed their hats in the air  they shouted  and sang  many wept for joy  it was an exciting  a thrilling  manifestation     dick and tom dare were not a whit behind any in their expressions of  delight  they shouted for joy  and then in the excess of their  happiness they threw their arms around each other in a bearlike hug      oh  dick  i m so glad   cried tom   i never was so happy in my life       nor i  tom  this is the most joyous hour of my life  how delighted  father will be when we go home and tell him that it is settled  that  the declaration of independence is a real and determined fact       it will please him more than anything else in the world  dick       yes  yes indeed      then lifting up his voice the patriot youth cried out loudly  his  voice ringing clear as the notes of a bugle      down with the king  long live liberty  long live washington      the excitement was even greater after that  and instantly the cry was  taken up on every hand  thousands shouted aloud  in a thrilling   triumphant roar   down with the king  long live liberty  long live  washington      people leaped and danced  and shouted till they were hoarse  they were  like crazy people  but with them it was pure joy because of the  thought that they were to be free  to be their own masters   independent of a tyrannical king  they had reason to be joyous and  happy     it was certainly a great day for the american people without doubt the  greatest in the history of the greatest country on the face of the  globe     after awhile  when the people had calmed down to a considerable extent  and were beginning to disperse to their homes  dick and tom dare set  their faces homeward  they were soon at the river  and crossing on the  ferry  walked swiftly along the road  they were eager to get back and  tell their father the glad  the glorious news     part of the way the road led through a heavy growth of timber  and as  dick and tom were making their way past this point  talking  enthusiastically of what they had seen in the city  and never thinking  that danger might lurk near  they were suddenly set upon by four  youths of about their own age no others  in fact  than zeke boggs  lem  hicks and two other tory sympathisers of the neighborhood      we told ye we d git even with ye   hissed zeke boggs  as they hurled  themselves upon dick and tom   ye thought ye was mighty smart  there  in phillydelphy  with ever buddy on yer side an  ag in us  but heer  its different an  we ll beat ye till ye ll wish ye had never been  born  go fur  em  fellers   this last to his companions     the two patriot youths  although taken by surprise  and outnumbered  two to one  were yet not dismayed  for they were brave lads  and they  fought the tory youths with all their might  so fiercely  in fact   that they held their own remarkably well  they knocked down each of  the four young tories  and gave them a thumping that they would likely  remember for some time  of course  they got hit a number of times by  the youths  but they did not mind it  the smart of the blows only  serving to make them settle down to their work with increased vim and  determination  and the result was that the tory ruffians presently got  enough of it  and suddenly ceasing the attack and dashing in among the  trees at the roadside  disappeared from view  leaving dick and tom  dare masters of the situation      phew  that was warm work  dick   said tom  wiping his perspiring face  with his handkerchief      yes  so it was  tom   replied his brother   but i believe that we  made it warmer for zeke and his gang than they did for us       yes  i think we did   with a chuckle   say  dick  they are better  runners than fighters  aren t they       i think they are  tom  they did some lively sprinting  just now  at  any rate       i guess they won t be likely to attack us again  soon       hardly      dick and tom now resumed their journey homeward  and reached there  about half an hour later  it was still light enough to see their  father at work in the backyard  as they entered the front gate  they  ran around the house at the top of their speed  to halt a few moments  later in front of their father      they did it  father   exclaimed tom  pantingly   they adopted and  signed the declaration of independence       say you so  my son   exclaimed mr  dare joyously   well  heaven be  praised  i am glad  my sons  yes  very  very glad  it means much to  everybody  and to young people like yourselves more than to older  ones  for you have practically the whole of your lives before you   while we older people have already lived the greater portion of the  time allotted to us       it was wonderful  the interest and excitement shown by the people in  philadelphia  father   said dick   they were wild with delight       i have no doubt of it  my son  and they had reason to be delighted   it is a great thing to feel free and independent  i feel wonderfully  relieved already  i feel as if shackles had suddenly been stricken  from my limbs  and i have no doubt that is the way the majority of the  people look at the matter  so why should they not feel joyous      the three then entered the house  mr  dare having finished his work  for the evening  and mrs  dare greeted her sons affectionately      the declaration of independence has been adopted  wife   said mr   dare  joyously   the die is cast  there will be war now  undoubtedly   and it will result in the independence of the people of america  it  cannot result otherwise  for the people will fight to the death  in  the words of patrick henry  it will be with them   give me liberty  or  give me death        i am glad  henry   said mrs  dare   i am glad  and almost sorry  as  well  for i am afraid it will take you from me  you will want to enter  the army  i am afraid       oh  i must do so  wife   earnestly   every man should step to the  front and shoulder a musket and fight for liberty  yes  i must go to  the war  mother  i must join the continental army at once       i feared it   sighed the woman   but  i shall try to be brave and  bear up well  for i know that it is the right thing for you to do  i  would not want you to stay at home  when you were needed at the front  to help fight the minions of king george       spoken like my own true hearted wife   said mr  dare   i knew you  would look at the matter that way  dear      at this moment there came a knock on the back door  and when mrs  dare  opened it  she saw a neighbor  abe boggs  the father of zeke  standing  there  this man was an avowed tory  who was vehement in his  declarations of allegiance to the king  and who had been heard often  to viciously proclaim that all who were not in favor of the king  were  traitors and that they ought to be hung  knowing this  and  instinctively disliking the man because she knew he was vicious and  bad  mrs  dare s heart sank when she saw who was standing there     the fact was  that the dares lived right in the midst of a tory  neighborhood  that is the six or seven nearest neighbors were  adherents of the king  and they neighbored among themselves  and would  not have anything to do with the dares  this did not bother the  patriot family  however  for they did not like the tory families  anyway  mr  dare often met one or more of the men  when going about  his work  however  and frequently he had arguments with them  as he  was a brave man  and frank spoken as he was brave  he always told the  tories just what he thought of their king  and thus he had angered  them many times  and they had learned to hate him  only his  fearlessness  and the fact that he was known to be a dangerous man to  interfere with  had saved him from rough treatment at the hands of the  tories      good evenin   mrs  dare   said boggs  ducking his head   tell yer  husban  to come out here  we d like to see  im      mrs  dare glanced out into the yard  and her heart gave a leap  and  then sank as she saw several of their tory neighbors sanding in a  group a few yards from the house  she noted  with a feeling of fear  gripping her heart  that two or three of them had rifles in their  hands      w what do you want  mr  boggs   she asked  her voice trembling   my  husband is here  but but we were just going to eat supper  and        supper can wait a few minutes  wife   said mr  dare   i ll see what  neighbor boggs wants  won t you come in  abe       no  we wanter see ye out here  dare  replied the tory   come out uv  doors  we won t keep ye but a minnet       oh  husband  be careful   whispered mrs  dare in her husband s ear as  he passed her   don t anger them  they have weapons in their hands   and    with a smile and a reassuring glance mr  dare passed on out   closing the door behind him  he had no fear whatever of his tory  neighbors  and would have scoffed at the idea of their trying to do  him injury     dick and tom were washing their faces and hands and combing their  hair  and did not know anything about the coming of the tories until  they entered the room where their mother was  and then mr  dare had  been out in the yard perhaps five minutes  during this time mrs  dare  had been on the anxious seat  so to speak  she had been listening  eagerly and anxiously  fearing she might hear rifle shots  or the  sound of a struggle  but no such sounds had come to her hearing   still  she was not feeling very much reassured when the boys entered  the room  and she told them about the coming of abe boggs and some  more of the neighbors  and how they had called mr  dare out  on the  plea of wishing to speak to him      he s been out there quite a while   mrs  dare finished   and i m  beginning to feel uneasy  i wish you would go out and tell father to  come in  that supper is getting cold  dick       certainly  mother   said dick  and he hastened to the door  the truth  was  that a feeling of uneasiness had taken hold upon him when he  heard what his mother had to say about the tories  and  remembering  the trouble he and tom had had with zeke boggs and his cronies that  afternoon in philadelphia and on the road home  dick was led to fear  that the tories had called his father out of doors with evil intent     he opened the door and stepped quickly out  and tom  who had also been  assailed with fears for his father s safety  was close at his heels   they looked all around  but to their surprise  and to their alarm as  well  there was no one in sight  neither their father nor the tories  could be seen anywhere  it was so dark that the youths could not see  any very great distance with distinctness  but they were confident  that there was nobody in the back yard      they re around in the front yard  likely  dick   said tom  but his  tone lacked positiveness  it was evident that he had fears that such  was not really the case     the two hastened around the house  accompanied by their mother  who  had followed them to the door and had  like her sons  noted that there  was nobody to be seen  and when they reached the front yard  they saw  it was the same there  not a soul was in the front yard  the tories   and mr  dare as well  had disappeared      oh  where can they be   cried mrs  dare  almost at the weeping point    what have they done with your father  oh  i am afraid they have  wrought him injury of some kind  sons      the youths were alarmed  but they pretended that such was not the  case  in order to reassure their mother  they said that their father  was all right      he has gone with them  to see about something   said dick   you go  back in the house  mother  and tom and i will go over to mr  boggs and  see what has become of father  likely he is there  you go in and stay  with mary  we won t be gone long       very well  dick   said mrs  dare   but hurry  for i shall be anxious  till you get back with your father      she entered the house  and dick and tom hastened over to the boggs  home  which was less than a quarter mile distant  mr  dare was not  there  and mrs  boggs said she did not know where her husband was   that he had left the house an hour or more before  saying he did not  know when he would be back  thanking her for the information  dick and  tom hastened to the homes of several of the neighboring tories in  succession  and made inquiries regarding mr  dare  but with the same  result as at the boggs home  in none of the homes visited were any of  the men of the house  and the women did not know where the men were     greatly worried now  but hoping they would find their father at home  when they got there  dick and tom hastened back  and as they  approached the house  they caught sight of something white on the  door  when they reached the door  they found it was a piece of paper   and on taking this into the house discovered it was a rudely scrawled  note  signed by abe boggs and six of his tory neighbors  the note read  as follows           to mrs  dare and rebel sons  dick and tom           we hev took henry dare prisner  he       is a rebel  an we are goin ter turn him over       to captain wilson an his compny uv       british sojers  who hev ben heer fur a       week past  an are goin to jine the main       army on long island to night  ye kaint       do nothin to git him back  so ye needn try        an ye two boys  dick an tom  had better be       keerful er we ll serve ye worsen whut we       hev yer father  we don t aim ter hev       any rebels in our neighborhood  so  dick       and tom dare  hev a care       oh  husband is a prisoner in the hands of the british   wailed mrs   dare   oh  this is terrible  boys  what shall we do  oh  what shall we  do       don t be frightened  mother   said dick  soothingly   i don t think  father is in any danger  he is a prisoner  true  but the british don t  kill prisoners  and sooner or later father will escape or be rescued   that will be work for tom and i  mother   his eyes lighting up   we  will make it our object in life to rescue father and get him back home  here  with you  mother      the poor woman was not greatly comforted  however  and she shook her  head  at the same time saying  in a hopeless tone of voice      what could you do  you are only a couple of boys  you could not  possibly rescue father  it is useless to think of such a thing  oh  i  greatly fear i shall never see my husband again in this world  oh   those terrible  cowardly tories   the good woman gave way to an  outburst of uncontrollable grief      yes  you shall see father again  mother   declared dick  decidedly    don t worry  he is safe from personal harm  and sooner or later we  will succeed in getting him located and will rescue him  tom and i  will make that our object in life       yes  yes  mother   said tom eagerly   we ll join the patriot army  if  need be  to further our ends  and while fighting for liberty and  independence  and aiding our country in that manner  we will at the  same time be on the lookout to find father and rescue him       yes  that is what we will do   said dick   father would have joined  the patriot army if he had not been captured and taken away by the  tories  and now that he is not able to do that  we will do it in his  stead  i know it is what father would wish us to do  and as tom says   it will give us a better chance to find and rescue father       oh  my sons  my sons  how can i spare you  too   murmured mrs  dare    how can i let you leave me  now that i have lost your dear father       it will be only temporary  mother  you can see  when you give the  matter more thought  that it is the best thing to do       perhaps so  dick  darling   acquiesced mrs  dare   but it is hard      throwing their arms about their mother s neck  the youths kissed her   and presently she grew more calm         chapter iii    ben foster brings important news       oh  dick  is it true that you and tom are going to enter the army and  fight for liberty       yes  it is true  elsie  aren t you glad       y yes  dick   replied elsie foster  hesitatingly   i m glad you are  to be a soldier  but i well  you might get killed you know  and and       would you care  elsie      elsie foster was the daughter of robert foster  the nearest neighbor  of the dares  mr  foster was a king s man  but he was different from  the other tories of the neighborhood  in that he was an honest   honorable man  and was a friend of the dares  he had had nothing to do  with the capture of mr  dare  and was outspoken in his denunciation of  his tory neighbors for the deed they had committed     dick had gone over to the foster home to borrow something for his  mother  and had met elsie out in the yard  and the girl had greeted  dick as above  the truth was that dick and elsie were great friends   they were school mates  and whenever there was anything going on in  the neighborhood  such as spelling schools  skating parties  etc    dick was elsie s companion  elsie was seventeen  and she had a  brother  ben  he being her twin  and a sister  lucy  aged fifteen  the  three young folks of the dare family and the three of the foster  family often got together of evenings and had a pleasant time  but now  that dick and tom were going away to the war  it would break into this  arrangement     when dick asked elsie if she would care if he should get killed in  battle  she blushed and looked confused at first  and then she looked  him frankly in the eyes and said  softly   you know i would  dick       i m glad to know that  elsie   said dick  earnestly     at this moment ben foster came running up  he was a manly looking  youth  and was lively and jolly as a rule  but now he was very  sober looking  for he realized that dick  whose father had been  captured by the tories only the day before  was in no mood for  jollity  there was an eager expression on ben s face  however  and  after greeting dick  he asked      are you really going to join the continental army  dick  you and  tom       yes  ben   was the reply      well  say  i m going to go with you   declared ben      oh  ben   exclaimed elsie   what will father say       father s all right  sis  he is a king s man  everybody knows that  but  he is reasonable  and lets other people think as they like  he knows  that i m a patriot  and he won t object      dick s face lighted up  for he liked ben very much  and the idea of  having him along was a pleasing one      that would be fine  ben   he said   but i wouldn t want you to do  anything contrary to the wishes of your father       oh  that will be all right   ben assured him   he won t care  i am  sure       goodness  what will mary do if you go away   said elsie  ben seemed  to think as much of mary dare as dick did of elsie  and he flushed  slightly at his sister s words  and then retorted      i guess she ll do about the same thing that you will when dick  goes go up into the attic and have a good cry       you re a mean brother   said elsie in pretended anger  lifting her  hand as if to slap him   and if it wasn t that i will likely soon lose  you  i would box your ears soundly      they talked awhile  and then dick attended to the errand that had  brought him there and went home      i guess we will have company when we go to war  tom  he said to his  brother      is that so   with an interested ear   who       ben foster       you don t mean it  dick       yes  he just told me he intends to accompany us       but his father s a tory       yes  but he is a reasonable man  and ben says that he will not  object       well  that will be fine  i d like to have ben along       so would i  and i guess he ll go       i hope he will  he s such a lively  jolly fellow that he is good  company  and will help keep us from getting homesick       i guess  tom  that we will be kept too busy to get homesick       you think there will be lots of fighting  then  you feel certain that  there will be war       war has really existed for more than a year  tom  you know the battle  of lexington was fought april the nineteenth of last year  and that  was the first battle of the revolution  and since that there has been  more or less skirmishing between the  minute men  of new england and  the british  the most important of all these being the battle of  bunker hill  which took place on the seventeenth day of june of last  year       our soldiers defeated the british there  didn t they  dick       yes  they got all the better of the battle  but their ammunition gave  out and they had to retreat  still  it was equivalent to a victory       that s what i thought       yes  and then general washington who was appointed commander in chief  of the army by the second continental congress  at philadelphia in  may of last year  and who went to boston and took charge of the army  on july third kept the british penned up in boston till about the  middle of last march  when he fortified dorchester heights   overlooking boston  the work being performed in one night  and next  morning the british  seeing what had been done and realizing that they  would be at the mercy of the patriot army if they remained in boston   hurriedly boarded the ships of the british fleet  then in the harbor   and sailed to halifax  nova scotia       and general washington and his patriot troops went down and took  possession of boston   said tom  his eyes shining      yes  tom  but general howe  the british commander in chief  did not  keep his troops long in halifax  but sailed to new york  where he was  soon joined by the british fleet under his brother  admiral howe  and  by general clinton       and general washington and his patriot army came to new york and took  possession of that city   said tom      yes  and he s there now  and that is where we are going  tom       hurrah  dick  say  i m glad of it  i want to join the army  and fight  the redcoats  i want to fight for liberty and independence       so do i  and we will  too       when will we go  dick       in a few days  likely  we have to get things in shape so that mother  and sister mary can get along without us  you know       yes  but that won t take long  most of the work for the summer is  done  and all there will be to do on the farm is to wait for the crops  to ripen       true  well  we ll go in a few days  now  likely       don t be in too big a hurry to go  sons   said mrs  dare sadly  when  they were discussing the matter  that evening at supper   think how  lonesome mary and i will be when you are gone       mrs  foster and the girls will come over often   said dick   they  will keep you cheered up       it will help   was the reply   but we will be lonely  just the same       you might try to be cheerful  mother   said tom   dick and i won t  want to think of you as being lonely       oh  i will get along all right  sons   said the brave woman  forcing  a smile  she wanted to have the boys go away feeling that she was in  good spirits     they had just finished eating supper  when ben foster came in  there  was an eager  excited look on his face  and he said earnestly      there s a plot on foot against dick and tom  and i came right over to  let you know about it       a plot   exclaimed mrs  dare  her face paling and her voice  trembling   by whom       the tories       ah   breathed the woman  a look of anxiety on her face   this is  terrible       don t worry  mother   said dick   we know of it  now  and can prepare  for them  it will not be as if we were to be taken by surprise       no  don t be afraid  mrs  dare   said ben   we ll make the tories  wish they had attended to their own business       how did you learn about it  ben   asked tom      father found it out this afternoon  you know  he s a king s man  and  they weren t as careful as they might have been  and he heard them  talking about it       what are their plans   asked dick      they are going to come here to night at about midnight and break in   take you and tom out and tie you to trees and whip you at least  that  is their intention  they won t succeed  though  you may be sure       indeed they will not   smiled dick   there will be some sadder and  wiser tories before the night is ended       oh  i am sore afraid  son   said mrs  dare   there will be a dozen or  more of the tories  and what can you and tom do against so many       i ll come over and help dick and tom  mrs  dare   said ben   as soon  as father told me about the plan  i made up my mind that i would come  here to night and help fight the tories       say  you are all right  ben   said tom  slapping his friend on the  shoulder      that is good of you  old fellow   said dick  seizing ben s hand and  shaking it heartily   we thank you       yes  indeed   said mary  who saw that ben s eyes were on her  as if  he wished to hear what she thought about it   it is indeed good of  you  ben  to volunteer to do that       oh  that s all right   said ben  a pleased look in his eyes   i tell  you we will make it lively for those tories when they come sneaking  around here       we ll do our best to give them a warm reception  at any rate   said  dick      i ll be over in an hour or so   said ben   and i ll bring a musket  and a pistol along  but how about mrs  dare and mary  hadn t they  better come over to our house until after the attack has been made   the folks told me to ask you to come  mrs  dare and mary       perhaps it would be best   agreed mrs  dare   but still  i hate to go  away and leave you boys here  you might be reckless  when if i were to  stay you would be more careful       don t think that  mother   said dick   we are going to go to war  soon  and you can t be with us then  and if you and mary stayed here   you might get hit with a stray bullet  there is no use of your taking  the risk  we ll be as careful with you away as if you were here  and  we will be in a position to fight with more freedom and effect if you  are not here       very well  then  dick  if that is the case  we will go over to mr   foster s  but we will return after the attack has been made  for we  wouldn t want any of the neighbors to see us coming away from there in  the morning  as that would cause them to suspect that mr  foster had  warned us  and might cause him trouble       true  mother  that will be all right  you and mary can come home  after we have driven the tories away       we ll go over to mr  foster s as soon as it is dark   said mrs  dare     shortly after dark  dick  accompanied by his mother and mary  went  over to the foster home  and ben returned with him      so you re here  eh   greeted tom   that s fine  i guess when those  cowardly tories put in an appearance  they will get something that  they are not looking for       that s what they will   nodded ben   at any rate  i hope so       so do i   said dick      i wish zeke and lem would be in the party   said tom  grinning   i d  like to give them another thrashing       when did you thrash them  before   queried ben      in philadelphia  yesterday  didn t dick tell you about it       no  you tell me now   eagerly     then tom did so  detailing the encounter on the streets of  philadelphia  and when he had heard all  ben said      good  i m glad you thrashed them          chapter iv    a night attack       they re coming  dick   whispered ben foster      yes  i hear footsteps   replied dick   but   after listening a few  moments   there is only one person coming  perhaps it isn t the tories  after all       yes  that s their game to make you think there is only one  he walks  boldly  so you can hear him  while the others creep up  it is the tory  gang  all right       likely you are right      it was now nearly midnight  and so it was time for the tories to put  in their appearance  if they were to make the attack that night  as  mr  foster had heard them say they would do     closer sounded the footsteps  and then they ceased and there came a  knock on the door     dick did not answer  as he did not want the fellow to suspect that the  inmates of the house were awake and on the alert  the youths  gripping  tightly their rifles and muskets  waited  their hearts were beating  more rapidly than was their wont  but it is safe to say that no  feeling of fear had place in their hearts  only expectation  and  eagerness to get at the tories dominated them     after a brief period  the knock on the door was repeated  then dick  spoke up      who is there   he called out      a friend   was the reply  in a hoarse  evidently disguised voice      what is your name  friend       that doesn t matter  i have news  important news for you  dick dare      you have no news for me that i don t know already   retorted the  youth      what do you mean   there was a quick suspicion in the voice      i mean that i know you are a tory  and that you have a number of  companions  and intend to try to get hold of my brother and myself and  tie us up and whip us  i don t feel like permitting that  so you had  better go away  if you value your skins  for if you try to bother us   we will surely defend ourselves and do harm to you if we can      evidently the man realized it was useless to carry the deception  further  for he cried out  sneeringly      oh  will you indeed  dick dare  well  let me tell you something  my  bold young rebel  when we get through with you  you will not be in a  position to harm anybody  we are going to take you out and whip you  soundly  as should be done with all such traitors to the king as you  two are       i give you fair warning   replied dick  sternly   if you attempt to  injure myself and brother  you will get badly hurt  go about you  business and leave us alone       oh  we ll go about our business and leave you alone  of course we  will but it will be after we have tied you up to one of the trees here  in your own yard  open the door  or we ll break it down       you are wasting breath   in a voice of contempt   we would be very  foolish if we opened the door  would we not       it doesn t matter  we ll break the door down in a jiffy  anyway       if you do  you ll be very sorry  remember  i gave you fair warning       bah  boys  threats don t scare us worth a cent  we ll have the door  down and you two rebel brats out of there very quickly       and we ll have some of you tory hounds lying dead on the grass of our  own yard very soon  too  mind what i tell you      a sneering laugh was the only reply  they had no idea the boys would  really shoot at them     there was the sound of receding footsteps  followed by the murmur of  voices  and then a few minutes later there sounded the trampling of  many feet  and crash  something struck the door  causing it to creak  and groan under the impact      they ve found a log  and will better the door down   said dick   be  ready  boys and as soon as the door falls  fire through the opening   they have brought this upon themselves  and if we injure a few of  them  it will be their own fault       we re ready  dick   said tom      yes  we ll fire when you give the word   from ben      all right  boys  level your weapons  and be ready  and when i say   fire   pull trigger       yes  yes  we will   came the reply     the next moment there sounded the trampling of feet once more  and  crash  the end of the log struck the door  this time the impact was so  great the door could not withstand it  and down it came with a thud   at least a dozen forms could be seen through the opening  outlined  against the horizon      fire   cried dick  his voice ringing out loudly and clearly     the youths obeyed the command  pulling trigger instantly  and the  crash that followed was deafening  and seemed almost sufficient in  volume to raise the roof     it was an effective volley  too  for two or three of the tories were  hit by bullets  as was evidenced by the yells and screams of pain and  rage that they gave utterance to  they fell back  in dismay  the log  dropping to the ground with a thud     dick  instinctively realizing that the tories were stricken with a  feeling of dismay  not to say terror  because of their reception   cried   charge them  boys  at them  give it to the scoundrels      with a yell that must have added to the dismay of the enemy  the  youths dashed out through the doorway and attacked the tories  laying  about them with the butts of their rifles and muskets  and discharging  their pistols     thud  thud  thud  thus sounded the impact of the butts of the weapons  with the heads  arms and bodies of the ruffians  and with each thud  sounded a yell of pain and rage from the recipient of the blow  then   suddenly the tories took refuge in flight  running from the scene as  swiftly as possible  and fairly falling over the fence in their haste  to get away  they were quickly out of sight  and the affair was at an  end  the three youths had put their enemies to rout  and without  having sustained any injury whatever     they were well pleased  and although they had not killed any of the  tories outright  yet the youths were sure they had wounded several   for they had heard the ruffians give utterance to cries of pain  and  too  they saw blood on the ground in several places     dick now hastened to the foster home and reported the victory over the  tories  and was congratulated by all there  even mr  foster  the  avowed king s man  seeming very well pleased for he was an honest   honorable man  and not at all in sympathy with the night marauding  tactics of his tory neighbors     mrs  dare and mary accompanied dick home  and the good woman thanked  ben for coming and helping her sons      oh  that s all right   smiled ben   i was glad to come  i wanted a  chance at those cowardly tories       and we thrashed them soundly  too  mother   said tom      do you think there is any danger that they will return   queried mrs   dare  somewhat anxiously      i don t think so  mother   said dick   they ve had all the fighting  they want  for one night  i am sure       i think so   said ben foster   but i ll stay here  mrs  dare  and if  they come  we will be able to drive them away again      but the tories did not return  they had  as dick said  evidently seen  all the fighting they wanted  for one night     dick  tom  and ben foster began getting ready to go to new york  that  day  to join the patriot army under general washington  they would be  ready in a day or two  as there was not a great deal to do     next day  however  ben foster had news for his friends  he came over   an eager look in his eyes  and told the brothers that zeke boggs had  just told him that he and lem hicks were going over to long island and  join the british army      he says that they don t intend to let us get ahead of them  dick    finished ben   they hope to fight against us in some of the battles       well  i guess they will get the chance   said dick  grimly      yes  they ll get the worst of the fighting  too   declared tom      that they will   coincided ben      there are two things that i hope to do  when in the patriot army    said dick   one is  to find where my father is imprisoned and free  him  and the other to meet zeke boggs and lem hicks in battle and  defeat them       yes  dick   said tom  his eyes shining   we must find father as soon  as possible  and rescue him from the hands of the british  i think we  can do so  don t you       i surely think so  tom       oh  you ll be certain to find out where he is  and before very long   then you can rescue him   proposed ben  confidently      and after that we can thrash zeke and lem with a good heart    suggested tom      i don t think zeke and lem will make very good soldiers   remarked  ben      i think they ll run  the very first time they get into a battle    concluded tom         chapter v    the dare boys in new york      an orderly knocked at the door of the room occupied by general  washington  in the old fraunces  tavern  the building used as patriot  headquarters  and on being commanded to enter  opened the door and  said      a young man wishes audience with you  your excellency      general washington  the great man on whose shoulders rested such a  serious responsibility  now that the people of the colonies had  declared for independence  sat at his desk  looking over some papers   he now glanced up at the orderly      who is the young man  orderly   he queried      he says his name is richard dare       i have never heard of him   with a shake of the head   did he state  his business       no  your excellency  i asked him  but he said he preferred seeing you  and stating his business direct      washington was thoughtful for a few moments  and then said      he is a young man  you say       yes  your excellency  or rather  i should perhaps have said youth  i  doubt if he is more than eighteen or nineteen years of age       h m   murmured the commander in chief   i am pretty busy  but will  see him briefly  show him in       yes  your excellency   and the orderly withdrew     he was back again in a few moments  however  and ushered in a  handsome  manly looking youth  at the same time announcing      richard dare  your excellency   then he withdrew  leaving the two  alone     general washington glanced up as his visitor was announced  and when  his eyes took in the handsome face  the fine physique and perfect  poise of the youth  he gave a slight start and eyed him keenly and  somewhat searchingly  with considerable interest      you are richard dare   the commander in chief remarked      yes  your excellency   saluting      very good  mr  dare  now if you will be so kind as to state your  business as briefly as possible  i will hear you  i am quite busy  as  you may well suppose       pardon me for taking up your time  sir   said dick   but i wished to  see you in person  as i have come to make you an offer       ah  indeed  what kind of an offer  my young friend       i will tell you  sir  i and two friends of about my own age have come  to new york from our homes in the western part of new jersey  we  arrived here only this morning  and i  as their spokesman  have come to  offer our services to you  sir  we are ardent patriots and desirous of  fighting in our country  for the freedom and independence of our  people       well  well   said washington  looking at the youth with renewed  interest   bravely spoken  your desire is a commendable one  and  certainly i shall be glad to accept of your offer  if your parents are  willing that you shall enter the army  you are mere youths  as it  were  and i would not want to take advantage of your offer unless it  were satisfactory to your parents  they have knowledge of you  project       oh  yes  your excellency  we have done this with the knowledge and  approval of our parents  my father  however  was captured in his own  dooryard  less than two weeks ago  by a gang of tories  and i and my  brother tom decided to join your army  to take father s place  as he  had intended to join  and also with the hope of finding and rescuing  him  one of our friends  when he heard that we were going to do this   came and told us that he wanted to come  too  and here we are  i hope  you will accept us  sir  and give us a place in your army       i shall be pleased to do so  dick dare   was the hearty reply   from  this moment you are a member of the continental army  as are your  companions also  i thank you  dare  for your interest in the welfare  of our country  and pray extend to your companions my thanks  and tell  them that i shall expect to hear a good report from them when it comes  to actual conflict with the enemy       i think they will give a good account of themselves  your  excellency   said dick  quietly but modestly   i am sure they will  fight hard for freedom       i have no doubt about it  my boy  well  the matter is settled  then   here  take this order and present it to colonel morgan  who will find  room for you in his regiment  now in process of formation      the commander in chief hastily wrote the order and handed it to dick   who took it and saluted      thanks  your excellency   he said   i will do as you have commanded   my companions will be delighted when i make my report to them      then  saluting again  dick left the presence of the great man  and was  quickly back with tom and ben  who were quartered in a building only  about a block distant     they greeted him eagerly      did you see general washington  dick   cried tom dare      yes  tom  i saw him   was the reply      and what did he say   queried ben foster   did he accept our offer of  our services       yes  ben   replied dick   he seemed to be pleased  and said that he  hopes to hear a good report concerning us when we come in actual  conflict with the british       i think he will be satisfied on that score   said ben  a grim look on  his face   i think we will be as good fighters as any of them  when we  get started  eh  tom       yes  i think so  ben   nodded tom  his eager eyes sparkling      get ready and come with me  boys   said dick  beginning to gather up  his belongings  which were not many  as the youths had not brought  very much luggage with them      where to  dick   queried tom      we are to report to colonel morgan  and will be assigned to his  regiment       good   said ben   then we will be genuine soldiers  eh  dick       yes  indeed       say  that will be fine   said tom   i m ready  lead the way to  colonel morgan s quarters  dick      a few minutes later the youths set out  they found colonel morgan and  dick gave him the note from the commander in chief  whereupon they  were assigned to their new quarters  their names having been enrolled  on the membership list of the regiment      now we are soldiers  sure enough   murmured tom dare  his eyes  shining   hurrah       yes  patriot soldiers  tom   said dick  quietly  there was an air of  satisfaction on his face also      we will be ready to take part in the first battle that takes place    said ben   say  that ll be fine  i am eager to be in a battle       and i   said dick   i want to fight for independence and the freedom  of the american people  and  too  i want to fight and rescue our  father  tom       yes  yes  dick  we won t forget that part of our work   said tom         chapter vi    chosen for dangerous work      dick  tom and ben made friends rapidly  and were soon well acquainted  with the majority of the members of the company to which they had been  assigned  and with many of the members of other companies that were  quartered in the same building and near at hand     they had been in new york about a week  and were feeling quite at  home  one afternoon  as they were sitting in the big front room   talking to some of the soldiers  the door opened and an orderly from  headquarters was seen standing on the threshold      is there anyone here by the name of dare   he asked   dick dare  i  believe it is       i am he   said dick  advancing   what is wanted       you are wanted at headquarters       now       yes  at once  the commander in chief orders you to report       i will go right along with you       very well  such were his instructions      dick put on his hat and took his departure in the orderly s company   after telling ben and tom that he would probably be back soon     they arrived quickly at headquarters  and dick was ushered into the  private room occupied by the commander in chief     dick saluted and said      you sent for me  your excellency       yes  dare  be seated   and he pointed to a chair near his desk     dick took the seat and then looked at the commander in chief  inquiringly     general washington did not say anything for a few moments  but eyed  dick keenly and searchingly  it was evident that he was appraising the  boy s value carefully  and it seemed that the result was satisfactory   for he gave a sigh as of relief  and said      how old are you  dare       eighteen  sir       eighteen  that is young  you are a mere youth  but somehow i believe  you are the one to do what i wish done  i have a mind to try you   anyway  dick   pausing and looking impressively at the youth   if i  were to ask you to undertake something that was exceedingly dangerous   something that might easily result in your death if you made a false  step  what would you say       i would say  your excellency  that if you had confidence enough in me  to think i might succeed  i would be only too glad to try  you have  only to command and i will obey  sir       spoken like a true son of liberty   exclaimed the commander in chief    that is what i expected to hear you say  however  i believe you are a  brave  sensible youth  and that it is possible you may succeed in the  undertaking which i have in mind  even though several grown men have  already failed  you had better think well before you consent to  attempt this task  however  dick  it is one fraught with such danger  that i would not think of ordering you to attempt it  considering your  age  but if  on the other hand  after knowing what the work is  you  still wish to go ahead  i shall be delighted to avail myself of your  services       i will be glad to attempt the work  sir  pray state the case  what is  the nature of the work you wish me to do       it is spy work      dick s heart leapt with joy  spy work  this  of all things was what he  felt that he would most like to do  as a spy he would have to venture  into the enemy s territory  would have to even penetrate to their  midst and secure information as to their plans and  too  he might thus  find and rescue his father  it was fine to think of  and the sparkle  in his eyes must have told the commander in chief that the youth was  pleased  for he said      you seem to be favorably impressed  rather than otherwise  my boy   you think you will like spy work       yes  your excellency   was the reply   i think i shall like it   better than anything else  i shall be glad to attempt any work in that  line that you wish  just tell me where you wish me to go and what you  want me to do  and i will do my best to make a success of the work   sir       very well  dick  i will do so  you know  perhaps  that the british  army is located on the southwest shore of long island  near york bay   and the british fleet lies just outside the narrows and off york bay   the british outnumber us considerably  i think  but just how much i do  not know  and this is one thing that i wish to learn  i want to learn  the numerical strength of the british  and also i wish to find out  if  such a thing is possible  the intentions of the british  commander in chief  this is a big undertaking  my boy  and as i have  told you  several of my best men have already tried to accomplish this  and failed  so you can see the magnitude of the task that confronts  you  it will be no disgrace if you should fail       i may fail  sir   said dick  modestly   i may not succeed in securing  the information you desire  but i will make the attempt  and i will  say this  that if such a thing as securing the information is  possible  i will do it  i will do my very best  sir  you may rest  assured of that       i do  dick  i feel confident that if you fail it will be only after  you have made every effort to succeed  well  it is settled  then  you  will attempt his spy work       yes  your excellency  when shall i start       this evening  i will give you a letter of introduction to general  putnam  who is in command of the patriot force on brooklyn heights   and he will give you all the information and assistance in his power       very well  sir  at what hour shall i report here       be here at six  dick  i will have the letter for you  and then you  will go down to the east river in company with one of my orderlies   and a boatman will take you across to the long island side  it is not  far from there to the heights  where you will locate general putnam       i will report here at six  your excellency   said dick  and then  saluting  he took his departure     when he returned to his quarters and told tom and ben that general  washington had selected him to go over onto long island and do some  spying  the youths were surprised  but were delighted as well  for  they felt that it was an honor to dick      that will be fine   said ben foster   i believe you will make a good  spy  dick       i hope so  ben       i wish i could go with you   said tom  looking wistfully at his  brother      it will be best that i go alone  tom   said dick   one can do  spy work better than two       i vould lige dot sby vork   said fritz schmockenburg  a fat  dutch  soldier  gravely      it s a foine spoy yez would be afther makin   fritz   chuckled tim  murphy  a merry irish patriot   yez would be caught the first thing   and the only thing thot would kape thim from hangin  yez would be  because they wouldn t have inny rope sthout enough to hould your  weight       when are you going  dick   queried ben      this evening at six      the youths discussed the matter at considerable length  and were glad  that dick had been selected for such important work  though they were  somewhat fearful for his safety  tom and ben cautioned him to be  careful  and he was the recipient of advice from others  all  well meant  but of course not likely to be of much use to him  as he  would have to govern his actions mainly by existing circumstances   after he was on the ground and at work     shortly before six he bade tom and ben  and his comrades good bye and  made his way to headquarters  where he was given the letter of  introduction by the commander in chief  and also a few kindly words of  encouragement      general putnam will give you all the information and help in his  power   general washington said   go  now  dick  my boy  and may you  be successful is my prayer  good bye  and heaven bless you      he shook dick s hand  and then with a good bye and a salute  the youth  took his departure     an orderly accompanied him to the dock and summoned a boatman  and  then dick got in and was ferried across the east river  alighting on  the long island shore  he set out in the direction of brooklyn  heights  reaching there shortly after dark         chapter vii    dick s first adventure      dick was challenged  and on answering that he was a friend  was told  to advance and give the countersign     he approached the sentinel  and when near him  said      i am a patriot  but do not know the countersign  i wish to see  general putnam       who are you and why do you wish to see the general   the sentinel  asked      my name is dare  and i am a messenger from general washington  i have  a letter of introduction to general putnam       all right  i ll summon the officer of the guard and he ll conduct you  to the general      he did so  and the officer asked dick a few questions  seemed  satisfied  and conducted him to the quarters occupied by general  putnam     dick saluted on entering the presence of the general  and drawing the  letter from his pocket  handed it to putnam  who took it an read the  contents  after which he gave dick a keen  searching and somewhat  wondering glance      you are richard dare   he queried      yes  general putnam   replied dick      h m  the commander in chief says here that you are going down to the  enemy s territory to try to do some spying  you are rather young  it  seems to me  to be going such work       time will cure that   smiled dick      yes if you live   grimly   this is very dangerous business you are  entering upon  my boy       so general washington said  sir       yes  well  it is a fact  and i have my doubts regarding your ability  to do anything  but since the commander in chief has seen fit to try  you and has sent you to me for the purpose of having me give you what  information i possess regarding the location of the british  i will do  what i can to assist you       thank you  general putnam      the general then gave dick all the information that he thought would  be of value to him  and the youth listened attentively      now   said putnam when he had finished   do you think you can find  the british without any trouble       i am sure i can find the british  sir   was the reply   but i don t  know about the trouble part      the grim general chuckled  he seemed to like the dry humor of the lad      i guess you ll do  dare   he said   i m beginning to think the  commander in chief showed good judgment in sending you  after all   but  i might have known that such was the case  for he is a man who  seldom makes mistakes       i hope he hasn t made a mistake in this instance  sir   modestly      i guess he hasn t  it is possible that a boy like you may be better  able to penetrate to the enemy s lines and secure information than a  man  for the british will not be so likely to suspect you of being a  spy       that is what general washington said  sir       the position is well taken  i feel confident  well  dare  be careful   take care of yourself and secure all the information possible  regarding the enemy       i will do my best  general  well  i must be going      the general shook hands with dick  and wished him good luck      don t let the redcoats get you   he said     dick laughed      they won t get me  if i can help it   he said   good bye  general  putnam      dick did not start just then  however  for the very good reason that  while he had been engaged in conversation with general putnam  a storm  that had been threatening that afternoon and evening  broke upon them   the wind blew a gale and the rain poured down in torrents  the  lightning was incessant and the roar of the thunder terrific  it was  indeed a severe storm      you must not think of starting out to night   said general putnam    you could not find your way anywhere  and would simply get soaked to  the skin  or perhaps struck by lightning  i will give you a bed  and  you will remain here till morning       doubtless that will be best   agreed dick  though he disliked the  delay  still  he felt that it would do no good to go in such a storm   for as the general had said  he could not find his way to the british  encampment  or accomplish anything if he did find it     so he remained on the heights that night  only to find it still  raining the next morning      you would not want to start out in the daytime  anyhow   said general  putnam   so it does not matter  you will stay till evening  and then  if it has ceased raining  you can start on your expedition      it was still raining hard  when evening came  however  and general  putnam said it would be foolish to make the start in the storm  so  dick remained all that night  and all next day  the rain had ceased  soon after sunrise and the sun shone brightly that day  drying the  ground pretty thoroughly  by evening      you can make the start  this evening  dare   said the general   i  don t suppose the delay in getting away from here will make any  difference       i hope not  sir   said dick     after dark that evening  dick took his departure  and as soon as he  was past the sentinels  he struck out southward  the british army was  at that time encamped near the flatlands  about two miles from the bay  and about two miles south of flatbush     dick walked onward at a moderate pace  there was no hurry  and  besides  by hurrying he might run right into a party of redcoats  and  this would be bad  as it would likely result in his capture     it were better to make haste slowly  dick realized this  and he  decided to take his time and exercise his every care  caution was a  necessary adjunct of a spy     dick was eager to succeed  several men had failed  and had doubtless  been captured  and if he could accomplish his object it would be a big  feather in his cap  he was intensely patriotic  anyway  and this made  him extremely desirous of succeeding in securing the information  regarding the plans of the british     he reached the wooded heights about halfway between the village of  bedford and flatbush after a walk of an hour or so  and having climbed  the hill  he paused on the summit and listened intently for some time   it was his thought that perhaps a party of british might be located  here  and he did not want to run into their midst  if such were the  case     he heard sounds  but only such as are usually to be heard in the woods  at night the chirping of crickets  the buzzing of the wings of  insects  and the call of nightbirds  he heard nothing that would  indicate the presence of human beings      i guess there are no redcoats in these woods   he murmured after  listening a while   the british haven t advanced this far yet  likely   i ll go ahead  but will be exceedingly careful      he moved forward slowly  and cautiously made his way down the south  slope of the wooded hill  he paused every few moments and listened  he  was not going to take any chances of discovery and capture  if he  could avoid it by exercising care     somehow dick s heart thrilled with pleasure  even though he were on a  perilous undertaking  he was working for general washington  trying to  do something that would be of benefit to the great cause of liberty   and this made him experience a feeling of happiness  the danger did  not have any effect on him  save to  if anything  add to the zest  he  was a brave youth  though not a foolhardy one  and the danger made the  work all the more interesting and exhilarating     on he went down the slope  slowly and cautiously  he had to  practically feel his way  for in under the trees it was very dark and  he could not see to pick a path  this made it slow work  but he had  all night for his task  if he wished so much time  and so he did not  worry because he could not proceed at a swift pace       slow but sure   is a good motto   he told himself   there will be  times  doubtless  when it will pay me to move swiftly  but this is not  one of the times      suddenly dick paused and stood stock still  his every nerve tense  his  every sense on the alert  he thought that he had heard the sound of  voices     he listened intently  and presently his heart gave a leap  yes  he had  not been mistaken  over to the right  and not very far distant  he had  heard someone talking  at least two men were there  engaged in  conversation  their voices being pitched low     dick strained his eyes  but could not catch sight of the speakers  he  could only judge of their location and distance from him by the sound  of their voices  and he judged that they were perhaps a dozen yards  from him  this was rather close  if they were british soldiers  as he  had no doubt they were  and he decided that the best thing for him to  do was to get away from their vicinity as quickly as possible  it  would be well to be silent about it  too  for if they should discover  his presence  they would doubtless make a great outcry and try to  capture him     he began edging away  toward the left  every once in awhile he paused  to listen  the voices could still be heard  but not so plainly as at  first  he was gradually getting farther and farther away from the  speakers  and would have been successful in escaping from the vicinity  without his presence having been discovered  but for an accident  he  struck his foot against a good sized stone  which was lying right on  the edge of a rather steep slope  and the rock  becoming dislodged   went tumbling and plunging downward through the underbrush  making  what seemed to be a great noise  coming as it did in the midst of the  night stillness  it sounded as loud as thunder in dick s ears      now i ve done it   he murmured  in some dismay   that will rouse them  sure      he was right  for instantly there came the challenge  loud and clear      halt  who comes there      there could be no doubt regarding the matter  now  the men dick had  heard talking were british soldiers doing picket duty     dick s first impulse was to take to his heels and run at the top of  his speed  but his second thought was that perhaps if he were to stand  perfectly still  the redcoats would come to the conclusion that there  was no one in the vicinity save themselves  and would go ahead with  their conversation after a few minutes of listening  but it did not  work out that way  after a few moments of silence there came the  command  in a stern voice      who is there  answer  or i will fire      dick did not like the idea of being fired at  even in the darkness  he  knew the soldier could not see to take aim  but a chance shot might be  as successful as one that was aimed  dick did not care to take the  chance  anyway  and he quickly  but very cautiously shifted his  position and got a tree between himself and the redcoats      now  he won t be able to hit me  even if he does fire   thought the  youth with a feeling of relief   now if he will just make up his mind  that there is no one here and resume the conversation with his  comrade  i shall be able to slip away and escape  doubtless      but the redcoats were evidently not satisfied to let the matter go  thus   let s investigate  comrade   dick heard a voice say  and then  he heard another in reply   all right  if there is anybody round here   we will either run him down or frighten him out of his boots       that s what we will  comrade       and i feel confident there is somebody near here  what else would  make the noise that we heard       i don t know  comrade  i think it likely that somebody is about       i am positive  sure of it as can be       well  come on  then  let s search all around  we ought to be able to  lay him by the heels  for we can hear him if he tries to run away       true  come  comrade  we ll quickly have the fellow  if he s here      then dick heard the trampling of feet  which sounded closer and  closer  and he realized that he must get away from there at once  or  the redcoats would be upon him     having so decided  he lost not time  but moved away as cautiously as  possible  he went a bit faster than he should have done  to maintain a  noiseless movement  however  for he stepped on a fallen branch  which  broke with a cracking sound  and the very next step he stumbled over a  log  and fell into a brushpile  making considerable noise      a spy   he heard one of the redcoats cry   there s somebody there   sure       halt   cried the other soldier  loudly   stop  or i ll fire      but dick  fearing to remain  as he would almost certainly be found and  captured  leaped to his feet and took to his heels  running as fast as  he dared  to run too fast  would have been to break his head against a  tree  more than likely     the british soldiers heard him  evidently  for one cried  excitedly      there he goes  i hear him running       yes   cried the other   but i ll put a stop to his running  or know  the reason why  here goes to wing the rebel      the next instant the loud crack of a musket rang upon the still night  air  at the same instant dick dare fell sprawling upon his face on the  ground  and lay still         chapter viii    tom dare acts      on the afternoon of the second day after the departure of dick dare  from patriot headquarters in new york  tom dare appeared there  and to  the orderly at the door said      i wish to see general washington  sir       oh  you do  eh   was the query  the orderly could not imagine what  business this sixteen year old boy could have with the commander in chief      yes  sir  show me to his presence  please      the orderly looked at the eager  bright face of the boy with more of  interest      who are you   he queried      my name is tom dare       tom dare   in surprise   why  there was a young fellow here a couple  of days ago whose name was dare dick dare  i believe it was       yes   quietly   he is my brother       ah  your brother  are you a member of the patriot army  also       yes  sir  i m in colonel morgan s regiment      the orderly stared      well   he murmured   the dares seem to be pretty well represented in  the continental army       yes  sir  our father was captured by tories  and dick and i made up  our minds that we would join the patriot army and do all we could to  bring about the defeat of the british and tories  and if possible  rescue our father       well  that is the right spirit  certainly       will you show me to the presence of the commander in chief  sir    questioned tom  eagerly   i am very desirous of seeing him   he added   earnestly      come with me   was the reply   i will speak to the  commander in chief  and if he is willing  i will conduct you to his  presence      tom accompanied the orderly along the hall  pausing presently when  told to do so  the orderly said he would be back in a few moments  and  disappeared in a room at one side  he quickly returned and said that  general washington would see the youth     the next moment he ushered tom into the presence of the  commander in chief  announcing      master tom dare      the general looked up from some papers he was examining  and gave tom  a keen  searching glance      you are master tom dare   he said      yes  your excellency   saluting      brother to dick dare       yes  sir       very good  what can i do for you  my boy   the great man s air and  tone were kindly  and tom  encouraged  said      i have come to ask a favor  sir       what is the favor  be brief  as my time is of value  my boy       very well  sir  i have come to ask that you let me go over onto long  island  the same as you have done with dick      general washington looked at the boy in surprise      why do you want to do that   he queried      i want to be with dick  sir  or near him  all the time  if possible   i promised my mother that i would stay at dick s side and fight side  by side with him  and if i stay here  when he is over on long island   i won t be keeping my word  sir  something might happen to dick  he  might get into trouble with the british  and if i was near at hand  i  could render him assistance  and if he were captured  i might be able  to rescue him  i hope you will let me go  sir      the commander in chief looked thoughtfully at the boy  there was a  look of admiration in his eyes  and to himself he said   a brave pair  of lads are those two dares  i feel certain   aloud he said  after a  few moments      i don t know whether to grant your request or not  my boy  i have  sent dick over to long island on a spying expedition  and if you were  to go also and join him  it might hamper him in his work  at the same  time  i dislike to refuse your request  since you made your mother the  promise that you would stay by your brother s side  still  you can  hardly hope to be always together  war is cruel  and one can not  always do as one would like  or be where one would wish to be  we must  all go where we think we can be of the most benefit to the cause  and  do that which will be most beneficial  do you think you could do dick  any good  if i were to let you go  my boy       i think it possible  sir  he is going into great danger  as i  understand it  and i might render him very valuable assistance  at any  rate  if you will let me go  i will promise that at least i will not  in any way interfere with his work or do anything to cause him to fail  in the task he has before him       very good  then i will grant your request  go  my boy  but be  careful  i will give you a note to general putnam  on brooklyn  heights  and he will tell you which way to go to find your brother       thank you  sir  you are very kind  and i will try to do nothing to  cause you to regret that you let me go       that is right   the commander in chief wrote a brief note  addressed  it to general putnam and handed it to tom      there  now go  my boy  and may you succeed in joining your brother  and benefit to him in his work  good bye   and he gave the boy s hand  a friendly grasp      good bye  your excellency   and saluting  tom took his departure     he hastened down to the east river dock and got a boatman to take him  across to the east shore  after which he made his way as quickly as  possible to the patriot quarters on brooklyn heights     when he presented himself before general putnam  and handed over the  note  the officer  after a perusal of the few words written there   looked at the boy in some surprise and with no little interest      another one   he said  with something like a grim smile   the dares  certainly seem to be in evidence to night       dick was here  then  sir   eagerly      yes  he was here       how long has he been gone       oh  about an hour  i should judge  he had to remain here until this  evening on account of the storm       please direct me how to go in order to overtake him  general putnam       i will do so as nearly as possible  my boy   then the general gave  tom all the directions possible  and the boy said      thank you  sir  i will try to join my brother to night       you had better keep your eyes open  master dare   cautioned general  putnam   you are going where redcoats are thicker than mosquitoes  and  that is saying a good deal       i ll look out for them  sir   with a smile   good bye  and thank you   general putnam       that s all right  you are welcome  good bye and good luck      tom took his departure  and as soon as he was out of the patriot  encampment  he hastened away in the direction that he had been told  dick had undoubtedly gone      perhaps by hurrying i may be able to overtake dick   was his thought     he walked swiftly  at times running  and came to the wooded hills much  quicker than dick had done  he climbed the hill quickly  and was soon  making his way down the other side  he had gone only a few steps when  he heard the report of the musket shot  sounding close at hand and  almost in front of him     instantly tom was greatly excited  the thought came to him at once  that a redcoat had fired that shot and that it had been fired at dick   and with wildly beating heart he ran forward  at the same time drawing  a pistol from his belt  tom was excited  but not at all frightened   his only fear was that perhaps dick had been wounded or killed by the  bullet from the musket  and he was eager to get a shot at the person  who had just done the shooting     suddenly he heard voices  and paused  listening intently      i wonder if i got the rebel   he heard one say      likely you did   replied another voice   i don t hear the sound of  running feet any more       served the rascal right if i put a bullet through him   said the  first voice      yes  that is what ought to happen to all rebels      tom heard these words  and his heart sank  and then a feeling of anger  blazed up in his heart  what if dick was killed  as these soldiers  surmised  it was terrible to contemplate  and acting on the spur of  the moment  tom leveled his pistol  pointing in the direction from  which the voices sounded  and pulled the trigger     crack  went the pistol  and a howl of pain  rage and surprise  commingled went up on the night air      oh  ow   ouch  i m shot   cried one of the voices   there are other  rebels at hand  comrade  perhaps we re surrounded      this gave tom an idea  and he at once acted upon it  if he could make  the redcoats think there were a number of patriot soldiers around   they might be put to flight  and then he could look for dick  and  learn whether he were injured      come on  boys   he yelled loudly   charge the scoundrelly redcoats   kill them  at them  i say   and then  drawing his other pistol  he  fired another shot     he had no way of knowing whether this bullet hit either of the  redcoats  but he had evidence that it was effective in one way  for he  heard the british soldiers going tearing down the slope  through the  underbrush at a great rate  they had undoubtedly been seized with a  panic and taken to their heels     tom waited till he could no longer hear any sounds of the fleeing  redcoats  and then he called out      dick  oh  dick          chapter ix    the brothers together      almost at once came the reply      tom  oh  tom  is that you       yes  dick  i ll be right with you      he hastened in the direction from which dick s voice sounded  and a  few minutes later was at his side      what in the world brought you here  tom   queried dick   i was never  so surprised in my life as when i heard your voice       i ll tell you why i come  dick  after you left your quarters in new  york  i got to thinking  and i remembered what i had told mother that  i would go to war with you and fight side by side with you  you know   and i thought of how i had let you go away on a dangerous spying  expedition alone  and i decided to follow you  i went and asked  permission of general washington to come over here  and he gave it       he was willing for you to come  then  was he       yes  he held back a little at first  but when i told him about having  promised mother i would stick by you  he then said i might come       well  it has been all right  so far  you got here just in time to  frighten those redcoats away  but i don t believe that two can do  spy work successfully       we don t need to both actually do the spy work  dick  you can do  that  and i ll stay back and wait and watch  and then if anything  should happen to you  i would perhaps be able to render you some  assistance       true  well  now that you are here  you may as well stay with me   we ll go on down in the neighborhood of the british encampment  together  and then you can hunt at hiding place and i will go ahead  and see what i can do in the way of spying       very well  dick  that will suit me       come  then       you were not hit by the bullet from the redcoat s musket  dick    somewhat anxiously      no  tom  at the very moment he fired i tripped over a vine and fell  headlong to the ground  i was still lying there when i heard you fire  your pistol  and then i heard you yell   come on  boys   and  recognized your voice  but i was sorely puzzled  i didn t know what to  think  i almost thought i must have dreamed it      tom laughed      i hit one of the rascals  dick   he chuckled   i ll warrant you he  did not think it was a dream       likely no   with an answering chuckle   well  let s move      they set out down the slope  moving at a fair pace  pausing  occasionally to listen  all was quiet  however  the redcoat pickets  had evidently retreated to the british encampment     when dick and tom emerged from the timber  at the foot of the slope   they were able to go at a faster pace  and they set out in the  direction in which they believed the enemy s camp to be  they walked  onward about half an hour  and then came upon a little clump of trees   feeling certain that they must be in the vicinity of the british  encampment  they went in among the trees and stopped      wait here a few minutes  tom  said dick   i m going to climb a tree  and see if i can see the campfires of the enemy       all right      dick climbed a tree on the south side of the clump  and looked toward  the south  he was rewarded by seeing the twinkling lights of the  campfires  seemingly at no very great distance      there is the encampment  sure enough   he murmured   well  now  the  question is  how am i to get into the camp and secure information  regarding the plans of the british      this was a poser  it certainly seemed like a hopeless task  but dick  dare was not a youth to be easily discouraged  he had come here to spy  on the british and learn their plans  and he would do so  if such a  thing were possible     he climbed down and told his brother that he had seen the campfires of  the british      good   said tom   but  what are you going to do next  dick  how are  you going to get into their encampment       i decided on my course  tom   he said   before i started out       what are you going to do   eagerly      i m going to enter the british encampment boldly and tell them that i  want to join the army       goodness  that will be dangerous  brother       yes  but one can t do spy work without encountering danger       i know that  do you think that you can succeed  dick       i m going to try       will they take you into the army a boy like you       general washington did       but the british army may be different  they may think that they don t  need help badly enough for them to accept boys as recruits       well  even if that is the case  i will succeed in entering the  british encampment  tom       that s so  that part will be all right       yes       when are you going to approach the encampment  now       yes  i don t see any use of waiting       what shall i do       you had better stay right here or in this vicinity       all right  when do you think you will be back       i don t know  possibly to morrow night       i m to wait till you come       yes       but  i ll get hungry before to morrow night       go to a farmhouse in the morning and get some food  there must be  farmhouses near       that s so  i can do that       well  i may as well be going  good bye  tom       good bye  dick  and be careful  brother  if anything should happen to  you  it would break mother s heart       i ll be careful  tom  you had better keep your eyes open  too  for  the redcoats may come prowling around here to morrow  and you must not  let them capture you       i ll not let them get me  brother      then dick took his departure  he had some time since decided upon his  course  and as soon as he was a short distance away from the clump of  trees  he set out at a brisk walk  and made no effort at concealment   he did not care  now  if he were halted by a british picket or  sentinel     he walked swiftly onward  and about twenty minutes later was hailed      halt  who comes there      dick s heart leaped  and he felt that he was soon to be submitted to  an ordeal  but he did not hesitate  and answered firmly and promptly      a friend       advance  friend  and give the countersign   was the command     dick advanced till within a few yards of the sentinel  whose form he  could make out  it being outlined against the light background made by  the campfires      halt   ordered the sentinel   give the countersign before you come  any further       i don t know the countersign   replied dick  quietly   but i am a  friend  and i wish to see the commander in charge of this army       humph  what do you want to see him for       i want to offer my services to fight for the king       oh  you do  eh       yes  sir       you are a loyal king s man  then  are you       would i be anxious to join the king s army if i were not   questioned  dick  he had decided that there could be no harm in deceiving the  enemy  in spy work it would be absolutely necessary to use this means   his conscience did not reproach him in the least  for he felt that he  was making the pretense of being a king s adherent in a good  cause that of liberty      what is your name   the soldier asked     dick had decided that it would be best to give a fictitious name  so  he gave the first one that came into his mind      harry fuller   he said      harry fuller  eh  well  harry fuller  since you are a loyal king s  man and wish to join his army  i will see that you have the  opportunity  i ll summon the officer of the guard and he will conduct  you to the commander of the force       this isn t the full army  then   queried dick      one division of it   was the curt reply   there s enough of it here  for you to join  i guess  if you really mean business      the sentinel summoned the officer of the guard  explained matters to  him  and then the officer conducted dick into the encampment  and to a  tent near its center  this was occupied by general percy  and the  officer of the guard entered and exchanged a few words with the  general  who was writing at a little  portable desk  by the light of a  candle  and then he emerged and said to dick      the general will see you      then he ushered the youth into the tent  at the same time announcing      harry fuller  general percy      the british general looked up  eyed dick sharply for a few moments   and then said      well  harry fuller  so you wish to join the british army and fight  for the king  eh      dick had met the searching gaze of the officer unflinchingly  and now  he answered promptly and firmly      yes  sir  such is my wish       humph  how old are you       eighteen  sir       rather young  but no matter  you can hold a musket and shoot as good  as a man  without doubt  so should make a good soldier  i accept your  offer  and will assign you to colonel harker s regiment      then he scribbled a brief note  handed it to dick and said   give that  to the colonel  he will take care of you   lifting his voice  he  called out   orderly      an orderly entered at once  and saluted      conduct this young man to colonel harker  that is all  good night   young man       good night  sir   replied dick  and followed the orderly from the  tent and to the point where harker s regiment was stationed  and to  that officer he handed the note from the general      ah  a new recruit   said the colonel  when he had read the note    very well  harry fuller  you are a member of company h  that is it   yonder  take your place there   he pointed to the company in question   and dick saluted and joined the company  taking a seat with the  soldiers of company h  some of whom greeted him with nods  and many  looking at him with a slight show of curiosity  but saying nothing   one or two said   how are you  comrade       i m all right  i guess   dick replied to these  smiling     the soldiers smoked and talked  and dick sat quietly there and  listened  he had an eager interest in all that was said  for he wished  to learn all he possibly could  that indeed was what he had come there  for     dick felt that he had been fortunate in getting within the british  lines so easily  and  too  he was lucky to have been accepted as a  soldier  he naturally had feared that his youth would be against him   and that he would be refused on that account  but such had not been  the case  his youth had not counted against him  and he was now in the  british camp  playing the part of a british soldier         chapter x    in the enemy s camp      dick dare had accomplished what had seemed to be the most difficult  part of the task that he had come here to accomplish  viz   gotten  within the british lines  had become  in fact  a member of the british  army     so far so good  now to secure information that would be of value to  general washington and a benefit to the great cause of liberty      what s your name   asked one of the british soldiers      harry fuller   dick replied     where do you live       oh  about ten miles from here   replied the youth     parents living       yes   replied dick      and so you have joined the king s army and are going to help make it  hot for the rebels  hey  with a chuckle   good for you       yes   said dick   i am eager to get a chance to strike blows against  the rebels  how soon do you think that will happen  when are we likely  to get into a battle with them       hard telling  young man  that s for the generals to say  what their  plans may be is more than i can say       i have heard it rumored in our part of the country that he british  will make an attack on the rebels soon  that s the reason i came here  to night  i thought maybe the attack might be made to morrow  and if i  didn t get here to night  i would not arrive in time for the fight       we might be ordered to move against the rebels to morrow  for all i  know   was the reply   and then again we might be left sitting here a  week or a month  i haven t any idea when the move will be made       i hope it will be soon   declared dick  with a view to keeping up the  pretense of being imbued with an intense desire to get at the rebels      you ll get a chance to do all the fighting you care for  one of these  days  young fellow   said another soldier   don t worry on that  score       i m not worrying about it  sir   said dick      do you think you will fight when the time comes   half sneered  another  rather evil featured fellow  leering at dick   i d be willing  to wager that you ll do more running than fighting       you might lose your money if you wagered it that way   said dick   quietly  gazing steadily at the speaker      i might  but i don t think i would   with a harsh laugh   i don t  think much of the bravery of the americans  whether rebels or king s  men  they are not the kind that make good soldiers       i suppose you think that you are   said dick  calmly      i know it  sonny   fiercely   i ve been tried in the fire  do you  hear  i m a veteran  and have seen service in the fields of europe   india and africa       you seem to be great at blowing your own horn  at any rate   said  dick  quietly  and several of the other soldiers sitting near  snickered  which seemed to anger the other very much      do you mean to insult me   he cried  glancing fiercely at dick      oh  no   coolly   i was simply stating a fact  that is all       well  you had better be careful  that s all i have got to say    snarled the redcoat  viciously   if you weren t a boy  i would give  you a thumping for what you have already said       don t let my youth hinder you   retorted dick   i will say this  that  i think you will find the people of america as brave as those of your  country or any other  and i think  too  that they will make as brave  and effective soldiers       that s right  youngster  hold up for your own people   said one of  the soldiers approvingly   the boy s all right  coggins   to the  ill natured soldier   you had no business talking as you did       bah   sneered coggins   i meant what i said  but as the young fellow  is not yet out of his teens  i ll pay no attention to his words  it  wouldn t look well for me to thrash a boy       you might find that you had your hands full if you tried it   said  dick  coldly  he had taken a dislike to the boastful redcoat  and as  he was a brave youth  and also had always found himself a match for  any man he had ever engaged in a physical struggle with  he had no fear  of this fellow      there s good nerve  for you   remarked a soldier  admiringly   how do  you like it  coggins   it was evident that this particular soldier   coggins  was not very well liked by his comrades      do you think i m a fool  to get myself laughed at for engaging in a  fight with a green country boy   growled coggins   i ll do no such  thing   rising  he walked away with a swagger  but he gave dick a look  of hatred as he did so     a number of the soldiers grinned  and two or three chuckled aloud  and  unless coggins was deaf  he must have heard them      would you really have fought him   queried a soldier  looking at dick  keenly  when coggins was gone      if he attacked me  i should have protected myself   was the reply      but you couldn t have done much against him  you re only a boy       i don t know about that  i am pretty strong and am also rather  active  and i have wrestled with a number of grown men  and never  found one yet that i couldn t down       well  you might have held your own with coggins  but i doubt it a  little       better be a bit careful how you ruffle him  young man   said another  soldier   he s a vicious chap when his anger is aroused  and he would  not hesitate to do you serious injury  he gave you a look i noticed  that was not exactly friendly  as he left       i noticed that  too   smiled dick   but i do not fear him  i shall  not try to anger him  but if he annoys me  i will take my own part   that is certain  i won t let him run over me       that s right  of course   approvingly   but don t get into trouble  with him if you can avoid it without discredit to yourself       i won t  sir  and thank you for your friendly words       you re welcome  i don t like coggins myself  and i don t care who  knows it  he knows it  all right  i guess   with a short laugh  the  fact was  though of course dick knew nothing of it  that this soldier   whose name was ferguson  and the other  coggins  were enemies  having  had an encounter once  in which ferguson had gotten rather the best of  it  though the fight did not go to a finish  it having been stopped by  order of the colonel     soon the soldiers stretching themselves on blankets and going to  sleep  dick was given a blanket  and he also lay down  being quite  tired by this time  and was soon asleep     the fact that he was in the encampment of the enemy did not have any  effect on dick s nerves at all  he was a brave and matter of fact  youth  and felt the boldest plan was the safest  and so he was enabled  to act with as much  sang froid  as if he were really an adherent of  the king and sincere in his desire to fight for him     dick ate breakfast with the rest of the soldiers of his company  then  he looked about them  and over the encampment  with interest  it was  very interesting indeed to the boy patriot spy and he was eager to see  all that there was to be seen     he noted that this was in itself quite an encampment  but realized  that it was only one portion of the whole  he wished to get the other  divisions located  and desired also to learn how many soldiers there  were in the entire british army  he asked questions  carefully  in  such a manner as not to create suspicion  and gradually became  possessed of considerable information that he felt must be reliable   since there could be no occasion for those who gave him the  information to deceive him  they believing him to be loyal to the king  and a soldier the same as they were     about nine o clock company h  was ordered to proceed to the beach for  the purpose of allowing the soldiers to bathe  and they set out at  once  dick accompanying them  of course  on the way they passed  another division of the british army  and dick was informed by a  companion that it was the main body     when they neared the beach  dick caught sight of several old hulks of  vessels at anchor near the shore  and he inquired what they were      old hulks of dismantled ships   was the reply   we use them for  prisons for those of the rebel army that we capture       are there any rebels in there now   queried dick  making his tone as  careless as possible  though having his father in mind  his heart was  throbbing with eagerness      yes  there are a number in there fifteen or twenty  i should judge   they are in the hulk farthest to the north  among them are three or  four rebel spies who will likely be shot or hanged sooner or later      dick s heart thrilled as he heard this news  perhaps he might be able  to rescue all those poor  suffering patriot prisoners  he made up his  mind that he would try  at any rate  and again the thought struck him  that his father might be imprisoned there  he at once decided that he  would visit the prison ship and rescue the prisoners  if possible         chapter xi    tom in trouble      dick dare eyed the british fleet with interest  it lay in the  roadstead  just off york bay  and the sight of the warships was indeed  alluring  he asked questions about the fleet  being careful to inquire  as if actuated merely by curiosity  and he also managed to secure  information as to the number of soldiers in the army on shore  he was  told that the army  as a whole  had about twenty four thousand men in  its ranks      phew  that outnumbers our army considerably   thought dick   well  no  matter  when it comes to battle  i ll wager that we will give the  redcoats all they can do      when company h  had finished bathing  the soldiers marched back to the  encampment  and other companies were met on their way to the beach to  take their turn in the water     dick was on the alert for information all the rest of that day  he did  not learn much more  for he found that there was no intention of  attacking the patriot force on brooklyn heights very soon  exactly the  point on which general washington wished to be informed  he became  convinced that it would be useless to remain longer in the hope of  securing further information  as no date for an attack had been  decided upon     he turned his attention therefore to the problem of how if possible to  rescue the patriot spies and soldiers that were in the old hulk used  for a prison      i must rescue them   was his thought   i will rescue them   he  decided  and he began figuring on the matter in earnest and laying his  plans     about half past one o clock in the afternoon  however  he was given a  shock  he saw half a dozen british soldiers approaching the encampment  from the north  and in their midst was his brother tom      they ve captured tom   he exclaimed mentally  in dismay   goodness   that is bad  i wonder how it happened      this was a simple matter  the half dozen redcoats had been up in the  hills nearby the heights  where dick and tom had had the adventure the  night before  when in passing the clump of trees  some one of them  happened to catch a glimpse of tom  who was seated under a tree   eating some food that he had procured t a farmhouse early that  morning  the soldiers had advanced  and their sudden appearance had  startled tom to such an extent that when they asked who he was and  what he was doing there  he stammered and was unable to make a  satisfactory reply offhand  with the result that the redcoats seized  him and made him a prisoner  their idea being that even though he were  a boy he might be a  rebel  spy     as may well be supposed  when dick saw the redcoats approaching with  his brother a prisoner in their midst  his heart sank  he had been  figuring on getting his brother to help him in rescuing the patriot  spies and soldiers  and here was tom in the enemy s hands  a prisoner      i ll have to begin by rescuing tom  i guess   was dick s thought     the soldiers entered the encampment  with the youth in their midst   and conducted him to where in front of his tent the general was  sitting on a camp stool  the officer looked up as the party  approached  and he eyed the prisoner in some surprise     dick had drawn near as the soldiers entered the camp  and had managed  to catch tom s eye and give him a warning look  he hoped that his  brother would be very careful  and not let it be seen that they were  known to each other      whom have you there   queried general percy  as the party came to a  halt in front of him      we found this youngster over yonder in that bit of woods  general  percy   said one of the soldiers   he was sitting there  eating a  lunch  and when we appeared and asked him who he was and where he came  from  he seemed frightened and could make no satisfactory answer       i wasn t frightened  any such thing   said tom  his eyes flashing   i  am not frightened even now  sir  i was surprised  for they came upon  me so suddenly  and the leaped at me as if i were a desperado  and  naturally i may have seemed a bit confused in my answers to their  questions  but i wasn t frightened  sir      something like a grim smile appeared for an instant on the general s  face  as he looked at the bright face of the boy      so you were not afraid  eh   he remarked   well  if you are not a  rebel spy or an enemy to the king  there is no reason that you should  be afraid  what is your name       tom dare  sir   tom had given his real name to the soldiers  but had  wished afterward that he had given a fictitious one  now he could do  nothing other than give his own name      tom dare  eh  well  master tom dare  where do you live      the boy hesitated an instant  and then said   i live over in new  jersey       ah  in new jersey  well  what are you doing over here on long  island       i wanted to see the british army  sir  and so i came over here       ah  indeed  why did you wish to see the british army       just out of curiosity  sir  i have never before seen an army  and i  wanted to see one      general percy eyed the boy searchingly for a few moments  and then  said      it seems to me you have come good ways to satisfy a feeling of  curiosity  your action is a little bit unusual  you appear to have an  inquiring mind   there was something in his tone that tom did not just  like  it had a threatening sound  however  he kept a bold face  and  said as calmly as possible      yes  sir       i suppose   said the general after a few moments   that you have so  much curiosity  you would like to see all that you possibly can      tom still did not fancy the general s tone and air  but he answered      true  sir  so i would       very well  such being the case  i have no doubt that you would like  to see the interior of one of the old hulks down at the bay  that we  use as prisons for rebel spies and other prisoners  i am going to send  you down there  my boy  and i hope you will like the looks of things  there  for you will probably be there some time      tom started and turned slightly pale      surely you are not going to make me a prisoner there  sir   he  exclaimed in dismay      that is just what i am going to do  master tom dare   was the reply  in a stern tone   the fact is  i believe you are a rebel spy  your  explanation of your presence here  when your home is over in new  jersey is not satisfactory at all  i am certain that you have an  ulterior motive in coming  and the only motive that i can think of is  that you came to engage in spy work  take him to the prison at once   men   this last to the soldiers     poor tom  he knew it would be hopeless to expostulate  he felt that he  was doomed to become an inmate of one of the prison ships  and as he  thought it would be useless he said not a word  but accompanied the  soldiers without making any show of resistance      take him past the other encampments and let him see the whole army    called general percy after them   when one has as much curiosity as he  seems to be possessed of  it should be satisfied   this was sarcasm  and intended to hurt tom s feelings and humiliate him  but instead it  only aroused a feeling of resentment in his breast  and almost before  he realized what he was saying  he exclaimed aloud      i d like to kick him       who  the general   queried one of the soldiers      yes   said tom  boldly      you d better not let him hear you say anything like that  sonny       say  comrades   remarked another  maliciously   let s go back and  tell the general what he said       no  let s not   said another   the general would whip out his sword  and cut the boy s head off  come on  it will be punishment sufficient  to be incarcerated in the old prison ship  even if he is a spy       i guess you re right about that  comrade       if it was me   spoke up another   i believe i d rather have my head  cut off and be done with it  than to be imprisoned in that old hulk       i guess you re about right   agreed the first speaker   i certainly  would hate to have to change places with you  my boy      tom decided that the prison ship must be a terrible place  and he was  destined to soon find that such was really the case     they passed the main encampment of the british  as they went to the  beach  and the patriot youth thought that the british would be hard to  defeat  with such a strong army      there must be fifteen or twenty thousand soldiers there  was his  estimate     soon the little party was at the beach  and getting into the old  row boat  the soldiers rowed out to the hulk furthest north  and  assisted tom to the deck  here they found a british soldier on guard      what have you got there  comrades   this soldier asked  looking at  tom in surprise      another prisoner  hawkins  he is only a boy  but the general is of  the opinion that he is a rebel spy  so down he goes into the hold with  the rest of the rebels       all right  down with him  but i wouldn t think the rebels would send  out such a young one to do spy work       well  the general thinks he s a spy  and that settles it       it certainly does so far as i am concerned  down with him      the hatch was opened  and tom was assisted down the ladder to the  bottom of the hold  and then leaving him there  with his hands still  tied together behind his back  the soldiers mounted the ladder and put  the hatch in place  leaving tom in complete darkness     as he realized his situation  a shudder went over the youth s form      i don t like this   he murmured         chapter xii    dick does wonderful work      dick dare had been afraid that general percy might connect him with  tom  and suspect that they were in the neighborhood together  but such  a thought evidently did not come to the commander  for happily he  seemed to dismiss the matter from his mind when the soldiers departed  with the boy  he again busied himself with some writing     when dick noted this  he breathed a sigh of relief  it would have been  bad indeed had he been then suspected and made a prisoner  the same as  had been the case with tom  with them both in the old prison hulk   escape would have been difficult  in fact well nigh impossible  but  with dick free to work from the outside  it was different  the youth  believed that he might be able to rescue his brother and the other  prisoners in the prison ship  and he was fully decided to make the  attempt that very night     the afternoon dragged slowly along  dick could hardly wait for  nightfall  for he was eager to get to work  he thought the afternoon  never would end     but it did  at last  and after he had eaten supper  he began mentally  reviewing the task that lay before him  the first thing to do would be  to get away from the encampment  and he decided to do this at once  he  had laid his plans  and going to the colonel  he asked permission to  take a walk      i am not used to camplife  sir   he said   and i feel the need of a  little exercise  if not contrary to the rules  i would like to take a  walk of a mile or so in the country       i guess it will be all right   was the reply   go ahead  but don t  stay too long       i won t  sir  thank you      dick walked boldly out of the encampment  and in order to disarm  suspicion  in case his action should occasion comment  he went toward  the east  to have started north might have aroused suspicion that he  was heading for new york      where away  comrade   queried the sentinel at the east side of the  encampment      oh  out for a little walk for exercise   replied dick  carelessly      all right  the countersign is  the king rules        thank you   said dick   i ll not forget      he walked slowly on  as if merely taking a leisurely stroll  but as  soon as he was out of sight of the sentinel and others  he changed to  a swift pace  and turning  headed toward the prison ships in the bay      now for business   he murmured  grimly   i ll have the patriot  prisoners out of that old hulk before many hours  or i ll know the  reason why      he hastened onward  but paused frequently and listened intently  he  did not want to meet any force of british soldiers then for it would  have been awkward work explaining his presence     he was fortunate  however  in that he did not encounter any redcoats   and in considerably less than an hour he was at the shore  near where  the prison ships were anchored      now the next thing is to get aboard the hulk   was dick s thought     this would be difficult  for the reason that there was a sentinel on  the deck  to reach the hulk and climb aboard without being seen by  this sentinel was a task that would be hard to accomplish  but dick  did not hesitate  he was brave  and eager to rescue his brother and  the other patriot spies and soldiers  and so he located an old boat   got in  and then pulled slowly and carefully toward the prison ship   which could be faintly seen looming up a couple of hundred yards  distant on the water     dick felt that the chances were that the sentinel would have his  attention directed toward the shore  and so he made a half circuit and  approached from the other side  he rowed slowly and cautiously  making  scarcely any noise at all  and was successful in reaching the hulk  without having been discovered  dick had rightly guessed that the  sentinel was at the other side  doubtless keeping a lookout shoreward     dick felt around in the boat  and found a rope ladder  with hooks on  one end  and with the aid of a boathook  he managed to get the hooks  caught over the ship s rail  this accomplished  he stood there and  listened intently  he feared he might have been heard by the sentinel     such did not seem to be the case  however  for all was quiet aboard   and presently the youth began making his way slowly and cautiously up  the ladder  he kept on till his head was even with the top of the  rail  and then he gazed about  trying to locate the sentinel  it was  so dark  however  that he could not see the redcoat  and feeling that  the coast was reasonably clear  dick climbed on up  and over the rail   and a moment later stood on the deck     so far all was well  he had escaped from the british encampment  had  reached the prison hulk  and was on board  now to overpower the  sentinel and rescue the prisoners     the youth paused only long enough to tie the boat s painter to the  rail  and then he slowly and cautiously made his way along the deck   going toward the bow  he reached the end of the cabin  moved quietly  around it  and then started in the other direction  he went with still  greater caution now  for he realized that at any moment he might come  upon the british sentinel     dick knew that there were two soldiers on board all the time  and that  they took turns at standing guard  so one would be on deck and the  other would likely be in the cabin asleep  to capture the one guard   without making a noise that would be heard by the other would be a  difficult matter  but dick was not the kind of youth to be dismayed by  difficulties  their presence only made him the more determined     he advanced carefully  and suddenly he caught sight of a shadowy form  a few feet ahead of him  it was the sentinel  undoubtedly  and luckily  for dick  the redcoat s back was partially toward him  and the soldier  was gazing in almost the opposite direction from that in which dick  was approaching     the youth  after a keen survey of the form  decided that the redcoat s  back was toward him  and so advanced a couple of steps  as silently as  a shadow  he was now close upon the man  and reaching out suddenly  he  grasped the fellow by the throat with both hands  and raising his knee  quickly  struck the soldier in the small of the back  and threw him  with a twisting motion to the deck  then dropping upon the fallen man   dick compressed his windpipe  gripping it with all his might     although but eighteen years of age  dick dare was stronger than the  majority of men  he was naturally powerful  and his life on the farm  had been such as to develop his strength and endurance  and so it  happened that he was easily more than a match for the british soldier   the fact that this fellow had been taken completely by surprise worked  to his disadvantage  too  and although he struggled hard  he was  unable to do anything  and the gripping fingers  compressing his  windpipe like bands of steel  gradually weakened him  for he was  unable to get his breath  neither could he cry out  and the result was  that in about three minutes from the time dick had seized the redcoat   the fellow was lying unconsciously on the deck choked into  insensibility     feeling confident the sentinel would remain unconscious some time   dick left the form lying there  and entered the cabin in search of the  other soldier  a snore sounding from a stateroom at one side guided  the youth  so he entered the compartment  and seizing this redcoat by  the throat  as he had the other  dick quickly choked him into limp  insensibility  this accomplished  he went out on deck  dragged the  other redcoat into the cabin  and into the stateroom  closing the  door  he locked them in      i don t think they will be able to get out of there  even if they  regain consciousness before i get to the prisoners   thought dick     then he went out on deck again and hunted around till he found the  hatchway  removing the covering  he looked down into the hold  but  could see nothing  the darkness there being even greater than on the  deck      hello  down there   he called   are you there  tom       dick  oh  is it really you   came the reply  in the excited voice of  tom dare      yes  it is i   was the reply   how many are there with you  tom  is  father there       no  dick  father isn t here  come down and free us  quick   eagerly    there are twelve of us here  it is a terrible place  slimy and  foul smelling  and there are rats  insects and worms  ugh       climb up the ladder   instructed dick   surely you are not bound       our hands are tied  that s what i meant by telling you to come down  and free us  dick       i ll be with you in moment  tom      dick hastened down the ladder  and was soon standing beside tom  who  had scrambled to his feet  he quickly cut the rope binding his  brother s wrists  and then asked where the other prisoners were      here   replied a hoarse voice   we are right at hand  dick dare  and  glad to welcome you  your brother has told us about you  and we have  been hoping you would succeed in freeing us  though we feared you  might not be able to do so  but you seem to have succeeded  thank god   i am joseph boswick   he continued   one of the spies sent down here  by general washington to secure information regarding the british   there are three more spies  and seven patriot soldiers and all of us  are eager to get out of this terrible hole  as you may well believe       i can easily believe it  mr  boswick  and i ll have your hands free  in a jiffy  and then you can climb the ladder to the deck  and we will  go ashore in the boat  the two british guards are insensible  and  locked in a stateroom       you are a wonder  dare   said boswick  admiration in his tone   well   cut our bonds quickly and we ll try to get out of here      this was speedily done  and a few minutes later the entire party was  on the deck  to climb down into the boat was a simple matter  but it  had only just been accomplished when there came the noise of oars in  rowlocks  from the other side of the hulk  followed by the sound of  voices      some redcoats have come off to the ship  from the shore   whispered  dick  to boswick   we must get away from here in a hurry  for your  escape will be discovered very quickly          chapter xiii    general washington is pleased       we had better get to the shore at once   was the reply   this boat is  so heavily loaded that it would be dangerous to try to go to new york  in it       yes  and it is old and leaky  anyway  we ll go ashore and then head  for brooklyn heights      dick turned the oars and rowed cautiously toward the island  the boat  moved very slowly  for it was deep in the water  and rapid progress  was impossible     the shore was reached presently  however  and at the same instant  there came out of the darkness excited yells from the direction of the  prison ship      they ve discovered your escape   said dick   get ashore  men  as  quickly as possible      the rescued patriots leaped ashore as fast as they could  and then  with dick in the lead  they set out northward      by keeping over pretty close to the water  i think we shall be able  to keep clear of the redcoats   said dick      likely   agreed tom   we mustn t let them capture us now       i ll never go back to that terrible prison pen alive   declared  boswick   i would much rather die fighting       we ll get to the heights and then over to new york in safety    assured dick     the excited voices of the british who had discovered the escape of the  prisoners could be heard for some time  but gradually grew fainter   until at last no sound could be heard  the little party kept steadily  onward  and managed to get past the left end of the british army and  an hour or so later arrived at the patriot encampment on brooklyn  heights     they paused there only long enough to rest a bit and apprise the  officer in command of their escape from the prison ship  then they  went down to the shore and were taken across to the new york side in  boats     they went direct to patriot headquarters  and were quickly ushered  into the presence of the commander in chief  when he saw dick and tom   and also boswick and the other spies and the patriot soldiers that had  been prisoners  his face lighted up with pleasure      you surely have succeeded well  dare   he exclaimed   you have  rescued the patriot prisoners from the british prison ship  and i hope  you have as well secured some important information       i have secured some information  your excellency   replied dick   and  i am pleased because i was able to free the patriots from the  prison ship       you have done well  dick wonderfully well  i congratulate you  my  boy   then he shook hands with boswick and the other spies and the  soldiers and asked them about their experience in the prison ship   according to their words  the prison ship was a terrible place  the  bottom of the hold being water soaked and slimy  and infested by  myriads of insects and worms  which crawled over the prisoners   bodies  stinging and biting them and almost driving them wild  there  were large and vicious rats also  the prisoners were thin and gaunt   and it was evident that they had suffered indeed      you have had a very unpleasant experience  men   said the  commander in chief   but now you are free and will soon be your old  selves again  go to your quarters  get some food and then rest up and  regain your lost strength      the soldiers obeyed  all going save dick  who remained at the command  of general washington  when the others had gone  he turned inquiringly  at dick      what did you learn  my boy   he queried   have you secured any  information of value       i haven t secured a great deal of information  your excellency   was  the reply   i learned the numerical strength of the british army  for  one thing       that is important  what is the number       twenty five thousand      a sober  thoughtful look settled over the face of the  commander in chief      that is about five thousand more than i figured on   he murmured    well  i am glad to have knowledge of their strength  even though it  is greater than i had expected it to be       i learned also  that an attack on brooklyn heights  while a  probability at some future time  is not contemplated at an early  date       that is important also  dick  well  did you learn anything else       nothing else  sir  but  if you desire it  i will go back over onto  long island and will keep watch on the british and do my best to learn  of any intended move early enough to get the news to you  so that you  will have time to make a move that will check the enemy       we will wait a few days  dick  and then i may send you again  i  congratulate you on the success of your first attempt at spying  you  did well  dick  exceedingly well  and i shall doubtless make use of  you frequently in the future  if you care to undertake the work       i shall be glad to do so  your excellency  my only wish is to do all  in my power to aid the people of america to secure their independence   and if i can be of value by doing spy work  then i shall take pleasure  in doing it       that is the right spirit  my boy  and i shall call upon you whenever  i have work that i think you can do better than an older man could do  it      then he dismissed dick  who saluted and withdrew  going to his  quarters     he found tom there  engaged in telling the story of his and dick s  adventures over on long island  and ben and the other soldiers were  listening eagerly  their eyes shining  they greeted dick joyously      say  i wish i had been with you two fellows  old man   said ben  foster   you have got the bulge on the rest of us  and that isn t  fair  you have already encountered the redcoats and had adventures  with them  while the rest of us have had to stay cooped up here in the  city   ben pretended to be vexed with dick and tom  but it was only  pretense      you boys will get all the adventure you want  one of these days  i  think   smiled dick   there is going to be a battle over on long  island sooner or later  and then you will get all the fighting you  want       hurroo   cried tim murphy   shure an  thot is phwat we are afther  wantin   oi dunno  it s all av us wull foight to the last gasp  sure  an  we wull       yah  ve vill fighd lige eferyting   declared fritz schmockenburg   ve  are nod

soon  enough  without doubt  for the british have twenty five thousand  soldiers  while we have not more than eighteen thousand       that is pretty big odds   said ben  with a shake of the head      so it is   agreed dick   but the patriots will give a good account of  themselves when the time comes  i feel certain       yah  ve vill gif ein goot accound mit mysellufs   said fritz  the  dutch soldier      just listen to thot  wull yez   remarked tim  scathingly   shure an   there is agotism fur yez       well  i hope all of us will always give a good account of ourselves    said dick  quietly   and i believe we will       we ll try to  dick   said ben  earnestly     a few days later general washington again summoned dick and told him  to go over on long island and see if he could learn anything regarding  the intentions of the british      you will have to be very careful  this time  however  dick   he  cautioned   for you are known to many of the british  and if they  should see you  they would capture you  and that would be bad       true  sir   said dick   i will be very careful  i will not let them  capture me  if i can help myself   then  after receiving his  instructions  dick saluted and withdrew     after supper he set out  and crossing the east river  made his way in  the direction of the british encampment  which was about five miles  distant  to the southward  he did not need to go to brooklyn heights  to see general putnam  for the reason that he now knew more about the  location of the enemy than putnam did     dick did not walk rapidly  for he felt that it were better to proceed  with caution  for if he went too swiftly he could not exercise much  care  and the result might be unpleasant  as there was danger that he  might run into a party of british  by going slowly he could avoid this  danger     two hours from the time he crossed the east river  he was in the  vicinity of the british encampment  and he moved slowly around it   trying to figure out some way to get where he could secure  information  but to no avail  he could not devise any means of doing  this  to enter the lines was out of the question  for there would  likely be some of the soldiers who would recognize him as the youth  who had joined the british army a few days before and then deserted   doubtless the british were aware of the fact  also  that the same  youth had set the prisoners free from the prison ship     dick remained near the british encampment till after midnight  but  could do nothing to further the purpose for which he had come  and so  he retired to a clump of trees situated about a quarter of a mile from  the edge of the encampment  and hunting up a place under some bushes   lay down and went to sleep     he slept soundly till morning  and then got up and took a survey of  the british encampment  the sun was just rising  and everything was  quiet in the camp  the soldiers were still asleep  with the exception  of the sentinels  who could be seen slowly pacing their beats     dick had nothing to eat  but did not let that bother him  he was  prepared to go without food all day  if by so doing he would have a  better chance of securing information regarding the enemy  he watched  till the british soldiers got up and ate their breakfast  and then as  he saw small groups moving about  some coming almost to the clump of  trees  he decided that it would be best to climb up into a tree and  conceal himself amid the leaves  and selecting a tree with very heavy  foliage  he climbed well up into it  here he took up as comfortable a  position as possible  watching the enemy and awaiting developments     all was quiet till noon  and then as he saw the soldiers eating their  dinners  he was assailed by a feeling of hunger  he resolutely  dismissed the thought of food  however  and stuck to his position  he  was determined to stay till evening  at any rate  and then if he had  not secured any information  he would go to a farmhouse which he saw  about a mile distant  to the eastward  and get something to eat  after  which he would return to his post  he was determined to remain in the  vicinity of the army till he learned something of value in the way of  news regarding the intentions of the british  if it took him a week     he climbed down out of the tree presently and walked about  in the  thicket  stretching in legs and feeling much better afterward  for his  position had been a cramped one at the best     when the british soldiers began moving around again  after dinner   dick climbed up into the tree once more  for some of the redcoats  might visit the clump of trees at any time  a party of four of the  soldiers did enter the thicket an hour or so later  and throwing  themselves down in the shade  talked and laughed for some time  but  although dick listened with intense eagerness  no words were spoken  that gave him any information  if the soldiers knew of any intended  move on the part of the british army  they did not mention the fact in  their conversation  which was made up of idle talk  of the kind as  such men would naturally indulge in     when they left and returned to the encampment dick drew a breath of  relief  for he felt that every minute they remained in the clump of  trees he was in danger of discovery  he might make a noise  in  shifting his position  and be heard  or he might have to sneeze  or  cough  and if he were to be discovered  it would go hard with him  for  he would undoubtedly be deemed a spy     after the redcoats returned to the encampment  dick descended to the  ground and walked about a while  being careful to keep the most of the  thicket between himself and the enemy  after half an hour on the  ground  he again climbed up into the tree     dick began to think the day was to be barren of results  as evening  drew near  but a little while before sundown he caught sight of a  couple of soldiers approaching the clump of trees  as the two drew  near  he got a fair view of their faces  and he had all he could do to  keep from uttering an exclamation  for the two approaching british  soldiers were no others than zeke boggs and lem hicks  dick s enemies   the tory youths from over in new jersey      well  this is a surprise   thought dick   but i remember now  that  ben said zeke told him he and lem were going to join the british army  and be british soldiers  that they were not going to let tom  ben  and  myself get ahead of them  i wonder what they would say if they knew i  was so near them      zeke and lem  dressed in the uniform of british soldiers  entered the  clump of timber and seated themselves on the moss under the tree next  to that dick was in  they had no suspicion that there was anyone other  than themselves present  and talked freely of their plans      how do ye like army life  anyhow  zeke   asked lem  as they lolled on  the grass      oh  pretty well  lem   was the reply   how do ye like et       oh  only so so  zeke  they re too strict ter suit me  i don t like  ter hev ter come an  go just ez sumbuddy tells me  do you       no  i don t  but when er feller enters the army  that s jest whut he  hez ter do       yes  thet s so  well  i guess i ll git used ter et       i ll be glad when we git inter a bettle with the rebels  lem  won t  you       yes  i guess so   the tone was not very decided or enthusiastic   i  hope thet ef we do git inter a battle  we ll meet up with dick an  tom  dare an  ben foster       so do i  i d like ter giv   em a thrashin  in a battle       so would i  an  i guess thet we ll hev a chance to fight the rebels  afore so very long  fur i heerd our colonel tell another officer thet  et hez be n decided ter make an attack on brooklyn heights the  twenty fourth       yes  i heard  im say thet      dick made mental note of this date  he had learned something of value   and from the lips of his enemies  zeke and lem  how angry they would  be if they knew they had done dick dare a kindness   thank you  zeke  and lem   he murmured   you are very kind  and have done me quite a  favor      the two tory youths remained there half an hour or so  and then  returned to the encampment  their conversation had held nothing  further of interest to dick  but what he had learned was sufficient   he had learned when the british intended to make the attack  and that  was just what he had come over there to try to learn  now he was eager  to get back to new york and tell the commander in chief the news     as soon as it was dark  he set out for new york  and reached there a  couple of hours later  he went at once to headquarters  where he told  general washington what he had learned     the commander in chief complimented dick on his success in securing  the information  and next morning he sent three thousand troops over  to reinforce general putnam s force on brooklyn heights  to the  delight of dick  tom and ben  colonel morgan s regiment was among  those sent  and the youths would thus be able to take part in the  battle     when the   th arrived  however  the british did not make the expected  attack  and about mid day general washington came over to the heights  and conferred with putnam  and dick was asked his opinion regarding  the non appearance of the british      i don t understand it  sir   he replied   i heard the two tory youths  say that an attack would be made on the twenty fourth  perhaps the  british have learned that you were expecting them  and have postponed  the attack on that account       that is possible   agreed general washington   well  the only thing  to do  now  is to keep constantly on the lookout and be ready all the  time to repulse an attack       that is the proper course  your excellency   said general putnam     so it was decided to remain in readiness  and to keep out double the  usual number of sentinels  so as to avoid being taken by surprise     this course was adopted  and the patriots kept in readiness for  instant battle  and waited with what patience they could muster   pestered as they were by the hot weather and myriads of mosquitoes   for the british to make an attack         chapter xiv    the haunted house      life in the patriot camp often grew irksome to the volunteers of  washington s army  all were eager to meet their red coat foes  and  prove their mettle in a real battle  thus far the troops gathered in  new york  had been forced to content themselves with occasional  skirmishes with the british outposts  which little affairs only served  to increase their eagerness to  have it out  with the invaders     to make the long days of waiting pass more pleasantly  frequent  excursions were made into the surrounding country in search of  adventures and to pick up whatever delicacies in the way of fruit and  fowl that the outlying farms afforded  tom appointed himself a  committee of one to supply the company to which he and his friends  belonged  he had exhausted most of the well known haunts about camp   and was in the habit of going off on long tramps to find the coveted  fruit     one evening toward dusk tom was sauntering along a quiet country road  hunting for apples  in the course of his wanderings he came upon a  well laden tree standing on the grounds of a neglected estate  far  back amongst the trees was the deserted mansion house  looking  desolate and forbidding in the rays of the sinking sun     about this old place many stories clung of mystery and violent death   from the time of its erection by a runaway nobleman the families who  had unfortunately occupied it had either left in extreme haste and  terror for some far removed section of the country  or had met with  foul play at the hands of a band of gypsies  who appeared in the  neighborhood only when a new occupant moved into the fated homestead   the last family that had lived there had suddenly left the house one  night  two grown up sons  however  returned and told the inquisitive  farmers that although their folks had been frightened away  they  proposed to remain until they had solved the mystery of the place   this perhaps they did the next night  but they both paid for their  curiosity with their lives  for the neighbors found their bodies  suspended from the upper floor over the main stairway  since this last  fatality  the house had been deserted  its bad name growing with each  recounting of its dark history     a little youngster scarce four years old  was playing under the tree   tom helped himself to some apples as was his wont  and speaking  cheerily to the boy  learned that his name was  jackie   a stick of  candy from tom s pocket was greedily accepted by jackie  tom was  feeling blue that day thinking of his father from whom had come no  word  of his mother and sister  and his old home  he wandered on  unobservant of the fact that it was growing dark  and that a storm was  fast approaching  he was suddenly called to a sense of his  surroundings by hearing a cry behind him  and turning back saw that  little jackie was dogging his footsteps     the youngster was tired out now  and wanted  home and mother   so tom  spoke a soothing word or two and they commenced to retrace their  footsteps  he noted now that the storm was soon to break  and jackie  was too tired to hurry  so he gathered the little fellow into his  strong arms  and made fast time for home     by the time they had reached the apple tree it was quite dark  large  drops of rain  the roar of thunder  and the glare of lightning told  tom that he was none too soon  he ran through the unkempt garden  and  was quickly at the door  a sinister looking place it was even in  daylight  and now revealed by an occasional lightning flash  the house  seemed but a wreck of former stateliness  not a light was visible  within  and to tom s loud and hurried rappings on the door  there was  no response     a flash of lightning however  showed tom that the door was unlatched   and with the rain now descending in torrents  he hesitated no longer   but stepped within  there was a rush of wind  a rattle of shutters  a  deafening peal of thunder as if close at hand  and with a crash the  great door suddenly closed     it did not take tom long to determine that he and his little charge  were alone in a deserted mansion      is this your home  jackie   inquired tom     the little fellow whom tom had placed upon the floor was thoroughly  terrified  and could only grasp his answer      it is the haunted house  let me go home       nonsense  jackie  don t be afraid  but where is your home      meantime tom had turned about and was searching for the handle of the  great door  there was none  it had been broken off  and this means of  egress was unavailable      let s see if we can find a window   suggested tom  but jackie clung  closer to his rescuer and began to cry wildly      there is a ghost  it s coming   shrieked the little fellow     tom looked along the depth of the long hall  and at first saw nothing   then at the next flash of lightning he was startled to see two green  and glaring eyes fixed upon him  no thought of such a thing as a ghost  entered his mind  he was far too sensible for that  and had no fear of  spirits  if they were good spirits  he argued  of course they would  not hurt  if they were bad  he might hurt them  he was for advancing  at once to investigate  but his little charge clung to him in  desperate terror     then there came another crash of thunder  and at the same instant a  noise as of an overturned table  and the rattle of pans and pots upon  the floor  but the eyes  they were gone no  they were close upon the  floor  and coming toward them  tom could not deny that he felt a  creeping feeling  and poor jackie  always observant of the goings on   was simply overcome with fright  and buried his head in tom s side to  shut out the dreaded sight      come  jackie  let s get out of here   encouraged tom  and having  observed a window in the room to the left  he once more took up his  charge and made for it     halfway to his objective point  however  he was startled for a moment  to see revealed by a lantern the whiskered face of a man on the other  side of the window  tom stopped short an instant  but not so jackie   who struggled from his protector s embrace calling out   there s  papa      in a brief interval jackie was in his parent s arms  and as they lived  next door to the deserted mansion  tom was soon being thanked time and  again for the rescue of the little runaway      and is the house really haunted   asked tom  and then without waiting  for a reply he answered his own question  but of course i know it is  not       no   was the laughing response   but it has been unoccupied except by  cats  and in some way has gotten that name       and then the eyes we saw        quite likely a stray cat  but still it would not be wondered at if  your nerves got on edge  you are a brave boy  tom dare  and i know i  shall hear of brave deeds of yours in the future      the storm had moderated  and tom now had to hasten back to camp where  he was welcomed for he had for distribution a large bag of apples   given him by jackie s father     that evening about the camp fire tom recounted his adventures to his  friends  and a trip was planned for the next day to explore the  secrets of the old house     the following morning  after drill and the camp duties had been  performed  tom  dick and ben set out for the scene of the previous  day s excitement      i don t believe half of these  haunted house  stories   said tom    ever since    and here he stopped      yes  ever since you thought we had a real ghost  and suggested  leaving the poor spirit to its own reflection while you and the rest  of us made for home   broke in dick      when was that   questioned ben      why  about a year ago   dick responded   four of us spent a night in  a house with a  haunted  reputation  and after numerous fake alarms   caused by the wind shaking the windows or banging the shutters  we at  last got track of the real disturber  who happened along the very  night we were on watch       who was it   questioned ben  eagerly  while tom  remembering his  temporary terror on that night  grew suspiciously red in the face      none other than a marauding cat   dick replied   whose head had stuck  in a can it was drinking from  and who knocked the unwelcome helmet on  the floor in an effort to disengage it      the boys had now reached the old mansion  and a trip through its  ruined rooms failed to reveal anything unusual  so after gathering  another supply of apples  the three returned to camp         chapter xv    dick again does spy work      as the days and weeks dragged slowly past and the british did not make  an attack on the patriot force on brooklyn heights  general washington  became somewhat impatient  he was puzzled by the action  or rather  lack of action of the enemy  and was desirous of learning what it  meant     there was only one way that this could be done by sending a spy to  venture among the enemy and spy upon them  and as dick dare had done  good work for him on two former occasions  the commander in chief  decided to try him again  he had been on the heights  conferring with  general putnam  on the afternoon of august   th  and presently he  summoned an orderly and told him to tell dick dare to come to  headquarters     the orderly saluted and went in search of the youth  whom he found in  company with his brother tom  and ben foster and two or three other  soldiers  talking listlessly and wondering when the british would make  an attack      dick dare  you are wanted at headquarters   said the orderly   the  commander in chief sent me to inform you      dick leaped up with alacrity      i ll go at once   he said      maybe he is wanting you to do some more spy work  dick   suggested  ben      i hope so  i would like to get away from camp and circulate around  awhile       so would i   said tom      yes  and get captured again   grinned ben   you are not cut out for  spy work  tom  you are too impulsive       oh  i don t know about that   demurred tom   i d like to try spying   on my own hook  once  like dick does       i don t think either of us would be as successful as dick   remarked  ben      that is phwat oi think   said tim murphy  the irish soldier   av  inywan  now  could come innywhere near bein  as good at spyin  as  dick  phwy fritz here   he continued with a grin   would be the mon   oi m thinkin       fritz schmockenburg  the dutch soldier  grunted      i bet me dot i vould mage ein better sby as vot your vould  tim  murphies   he said placidly     and then ensued a good natured dispute between the two  who  although  they quarrelled frequently  and to one who did not understand them  would seem to be very angry at each other and enemies in fact  were  the best of friends  and tom and ben egged the two on  for they liked  to hear them talk  it affording something in the way of amusement to  pass away the time  which was beginning to hang heavy on their hands   camp life being rather dull and trying  especially to youths like  them  who had always been used to an active life in the open fields     dick had gone to headquarters  and on reaching there  he was given a  cordial greeting by generals washington and putnam      you sent for me  your excellency   said dick  after saluting      yes  dick   was the reply   i think that i shall again call you into  requisition  how wold you like to again venture out toward the british  lines in search of information      dick s face lighted up eagerly      i would like it first rate  sir   he said      i thought so  and that is the reason i sent for you  well  dick  the  fact is  that we are beginning to grow weary of this state of affairs   and would like to learn what is detaining the enemy and causing them  to hold back from making an attack  and we wish to learn  if possible   if an attack is intended soon  and if so  on what date  you wish to  try your hand at the work of learning this  my boy       i shall be glad to make the attempt to secure the information you  wish  general washington   was the prompt and earnest reply      very well  dick  then the matter is settled  you will leave this  evening  as soon as darkness has come  and will visit the special spot  in the vicinity of the enemy s camp  and learn all that you possibly  can  there is no need of my giving you other than these general  instructions  for you have had sufficient experience as a spy to know  how to go about it yourself       yes  your excellency  i will leave as soon as it is dark  and will do  my best to secure some information of value       i hope that you may succeed  my boy       i hope so  sir      after a little further conversation dick took his departure  and  rejoined his comrades  who looked at him inquiringly      spy work again  dick   queried ben      yes  ben   was the reply      that s what we guessed  when do you start       this evening       i wish i could go with you   said tom      i think it will be better for me to go alone   said dick   i can do  better work alone than if somebody is with me  the general selected me  because i have a likely place to hide       how would it do to take dootchy wid yez  dick   grinned tim   he  thinks he would be a foine spy      dick laughed   i don t know how fritz would make out in that field of  endeavor   he said      he is so big he couldn t get within a mile of the redcoats without  their seeing him   commented ben      yes  that s the only trouble with fritz   said tom   he is too big to  be a success as a spy       i didn t said dot i vould be a goot sby  dick   responded fritz   i  said dot i vould be as goot a sby as vot tim murphies vould be  see   und i vill stand me by dot statements  alretty       wull  oi have not said thot oi would make a good spy  dootchy   said  tim   so you wouldn t have to be much in thot line to aquil me  but  whin it comes to foightin   now  it s mesilf belaves oi have yez bate   fritz  me bye       oh  i don d vos know abouid dot  tim   was the reply   i think dot i  vill do some fighdin  myselufs alretty  ven ve get der retgoads at   yahs       maybe so   grinned tim   we wull wait an see how yez act whin we come  face to face wid the ridcoats       oh  you ll both be brave soldiers  no doubt   said tom   but  you  won t be any ahead of dick  ben and myself  we intend to do some  fighting  too  when the time comes       oi m bettin  thot yez presint a bold face to the inimy   nodded tom   who liked the youths immensely   an  sure  it s meself is wishin  thot  we get a chance at the ridcoats before very long       i hope so  tim   said dick     soon after supper  that evening  dick made his preparations for going  on the expedition  tom cautioned him again and again to be careful   and not take too great risks   i won t be there to help you  and you  will have to depend on yourself   he said      i shall be careful   said dick   but i m going to find out when the  british intend to make an attack  that is  if such a thing is  possible       i hope that you may succeed  dick   encouraged ben      i ll do my best   and then saying good bye to his friends  dick left  the works and set out down the slope  heading in the direction of the  encampment of the british     he walked at a moderate pace  for there was no occasion for haste  he  had the whole night before him     he walked onward an hour or more  and then stopped in the same little  clump of timber which had before sheltered him  climbing a tree  he  looked toward the south  and saw  not very far distant  the campfires  of the british  the enemy were still occupying their old quarters     dick did not of course dare venture into the british encampment  for  the reason that he would be recognized and placed under arrest as a  spy at once  for having pretended to join the force in question only a  few weeks before  and the redcoats would be only too glad to get their  hands on him now      i guess the best thing i can do is to remain here till morning   was  dick s thought   then i can get a good view of the encampment  and  possibly some soldiers may come here to the timber during the day  as  they did before  to loll in the shade  and i may again be able to hear  something of interest      dick climbed down out of the tree and lay down under some bushes and  was soon sound asleep  that was one thing that made dick a good person  for work of this kind  he did not get excited  and could lie down and  sleep soundly almost anywhere  and even with the redcoats in close  proximity to him     he was up with the sun  next morning  and after eating a portion of  the food he had brought along with him  he felt refreshed  and turned  his attention again toward the british encampment  by climbing the  tree  he was enabled to get a good view of the camp  and could see the  british soldiers at work cooking their breakfast over the campfires     away in the distance  toward the bay  dick could make out another  encampment  and knew that this was the main force  under general howe  in person  there was no clump of trees near that encampment  however   which made it difficult of approach for spying purposes  which was the  reason he had come to this division of the army instead     dick remained up in the tree an hour or so  and then descended and lay  down under some bushes at the edge of the clump of the trees  on the  side next to the encampment  and kept a sharp lookout in that  direction  watching eagerly for the coming of some of the soldiers     one  two hours passed  and then dick s patience was rewarded  he saw a  couple of british soldiers have the encampment and come strolling in  the direction of the clump of trees     dick would have liked to remain on the ground  but feared that he  might be discovered in case he did so  and thinking it better to be  careful  he once more careful a position as possible  feeling up as  comfortable a position as possible  owing to the fact that the foliage  was very thick     the two british soldiers came strolling along  talking and laughing   and presently they entered the clump of trees and sat down under the  very tree that dick was in  here they made themselves as comfortable  as possible  and lighting their pipes  smoked and talked lazily     dick listened eagerly  hoping to hear something that would be in the  nature of news  and of value to general washington  but the soldiers  kept their conversation in personal channels  which was not of much  interest to dick      i wish they would talk about the army  and what it intends to do    was dick s thought     but the redcoats did not do this  they talked of matters of no  importance or interest to dick  and after staying an hour or so  they  get up and returned to the encampment     dick was disappointed   i was in hopes that i would learn something  from their conversation   he muttered   well  perhaps some more  soldiers will visit the clump of trees to day  and in that case i may  succeed in securing some information  i hope that such will be the  case  anyway      noon came  and no other soldiers had visited the clump of trees  dick  was not discouraged  however  he felt that he would likely get a  chance to hear other soldiers talk that afternoon     he ate the rest of his food  and then sat down beside a tree and took  it easy for a while  he knew that the soldiers were busy cooking their  dinners  and that none would likely come to the timber for quite a  while     as he sat there  gazing idly over toward the encampment  however  he  suddenly heard footsteps behind him  and turned his head quickly  and  saw a british soldier standing within a few paces of him  musket in  hand  eyeing him suspiciously      hello   greeted the redcoat     dick was surprised and somewhat dismayed as well  but he was a cool  youth  and did not let the fact that he was flustered show on his  face  instead  he affected a cool and careless air  and replied      hello  good afternoon  sir      the soldier stood there  keeping a keen eye on the youth      who are you   he queried      my name is dick morris   dick gave the first name that came to his  mind      humph  what are you doing here       nothing  just sitting here       why are you sitting here   dick believed the soldier was suspicious  of him      i m resting   replied the youth      resting  eh       yes  sir       what made you tired       i have come quite a distance  i walked here from nearly twenty miles  east  and i m resting in the shade  before continuing my journey  no  objection is there       humph  where are you bound for       over on the shore of the bay       what are you going there for       to work for a man  sir       who       an old fisherman       humph  you seem to be interested in the army  yonder  judging by the  way you were looking that way when i came up       yes  sir   replied dick  quietly   when one has never seen an army  before  it does interest one      the redcoat eyed dick searchingly      i m almost inclined to believe that you are not what you make out  yourself to be   he said  after a few moments      why so  sir   dick opened his eyes as if surprised and puzzled and  looked at the soldier inquiringly      because in these times of war  it is often the case that anyone like  yourself may turn out to be a spy       a spy   exclaimed dick  assuming a most astonished expression      yes  and you may be a spy for all i know      dick shook his head   oh  no  you ve got another guess   he said  he  felt that he was doing no wrong in denying being a spy  to a british  soldier      i m not so sure of it   was the stubborn reply   i think that i shall  have to take you into camp and see what general percy has to say about  the matter      dick s heart sank  general percy was the officer he had seen  a few  weeks before  when he had pretended to join the british force  and the  officer would recognize him at once  without doubt  it would not do to  permit himself to be taken into the camp  a prisoner  it would result  disastrously  as he would likely be shot as a spy  for it was known  that he had rescued the patriot prisoners out of the old prison ship  in the bay  and he would be handled severely  even though only a boy  in years  he had proven himself capable of doing a man s work      oh  i wouldn t do that  if i were you   said dick  calmly     the soldier smiled grimly   i suppose you do not view the matter  favorably   he replied   but  i think it my duty to take you into  camp  for you may be a dangerous spy      dick had been doing some swift thinking  and he had made up his mind  that he must not permit himself to be taken into the encampment a  prisoner  he must manage in some way to prevent the soldier from  accomplishing this  the only way  so far as he could see  was to  engage the soldier in a struggle  and overpower him  and as the  redcoat looked a pretty husky fellow  this would likely not be an easy  thing to accomplish  but dick was more than ordinarily strong  and he  was quick and athletic  and a good wrestler  and he believed he could  overpower the soldier  he felt confident he could do so  if he could  succeed in taking the redcoat by surprise     dick  busy thinking  made no reply to the redcoat s last remark  and  the soldier  after waiting a few moments  said sharply   get up  young  fellow      dick rose to his feet  slowly and quietly  his actions were such as  would cause the redcoat to think he did not contemplate offering any  resistance  and this was done purposely  so as to throw the redcoat  off his guard  and it worked that way  for the soldier  with a  careless wave of the hand  said      march along in front of me to the encampment  young fellow  we ll see  what general percy thinks about you      but dick did not march  as ordered to do  instead  he suddenly leaped  upon the amazed soldier  and seizing him by the throat  so as to  prevent his crying out  tripped him  throwing him to the ground  heavily  and then  seated astride the redcoat s body  and holding him  pinned to the earth in spite of his struggles     the soldier was a pretty strong man  but he had been taken at a  disadvantage and by surprise  and so was not in a position to exercise  his full powers  and the result was  that although only a youth of  eighteen years  dick managed to choke the soldier into a state of  insensibility in a very few minutes     and then  when confident that the redcoat was unconscious  dick let go  his hold  and proceeded to bind the redcoat s hands and feet  and gag  him  this accomplished  the youth dragged the soldier into the deepest  and thickest clump of bushes and concealed him there  so that in case  any soldiers came to the timber  later on  they would not discover his  presence     having accomplished this task  dick sat down beside the tree and drew  a long breath of relief and satisfaction      there  that turned out all right  after all   he murmured   but  i  thought at first that i might be taken into camp a prisoner  and that  would have been bad indeed      dick looked toward the encampment keenly  as he spoke  and noted that  all was quiet there  and that none of the soldiers were as yet  evincing any disposition to visit the clump of timber     at least an hour passed  and then dick saw a couple of soldiers leave  the encampment and come toward the timber  as soon as he was certain  they were coming to loll in the shade of the trees  dick climbed the  tree  from there he could hear the conversation of the redcoats  and  there was not much chance that they would discover his presence  the  foliage in the tree as has been noted  being quite thick     the two soldiers entered the edge of the timber and seated themselves  under a tree close to the one dick was in  and sat there  smoking and  talking  their conversation being mainly personal  as had been the  case with the two that had been there in the forenoon  but  after a  while they got to talking about the army  and finally touched upon the  very matter that dick wish to hear discussed  in a general way they  commented upon the bustle  stir and preparation that indicated some  important move      i m glad of it   remarked one   i am getting tired of being cooped up  in camp  i d rather do some marching and fighting       so would i  well  i think it likely that we will have fighting to do  in a few days  if the colonel knew what he was talking about  and i  suppose he did       he had the news from general percy       i suppose so  the general was over to the main encampment yesterday   you know  and likely they held a council of war and decided to make an  attack      dick was straining every nerve to hear distinctly     just then a groan sounded  from amid the clump of bushes in which dick  had placed the soldier he had overpowered  the soldiers heard it  and  looked at each other wonderingly and inquiringly and then gazed keenly  toward the clump of bushes  dick had heard the groan also  and his  heart sank  for he thought that if the soldiers found and released the  other redcoat  a search might be instituted for him  and result in his  discovery and capture      what does that mean  comrade   remarked one of the soldiers      somebody groaned   was the reply   let s take a look in that clump of  bushes and see who is there  and what ails him      they leaped to their feet  and drawing pistols  strode to the edge of  the clump of bushes  and stooping  pushed their way through between  the bushes  a few moments later dick heard an exclamation from the  lips of one of the soldiers  and knew they had discovered the bound  redcoat  the youth had thought of slipping down out of the tree and  trying to make his escape  but did not do so  for he realized that the  chances were that he would be seen and either shot or captured  so he  decided to remain where he was  and risk being discovered     a few minutes later the three redcoats emerged from amid the bushes   the two having freed the redcoat from his bonds  they paused  underneath the tree dick was in  and the redcoat explained about his  encounter with and capture by the person he had suspected of being a  spy and had intended to march into the camp  a prisoner  to dick s  amusement  the redcoat described him as being a big  ferocious looking  fellow  a six footer  and very strong  evidently the soldier did not  want his comrades to know that he had been overpowered and mad a  prisoner by a youth of eighteen years  and smaller than himself      i suppose the rascally spy isn t still in this clump of timer  eh    remarked one of the soldiers  with a glance around      no  not likely   was the reply of the one who had been made a  prisoner   probably he got away from here as quickly as possible   after making a prisoner of me       luckily he was not here to listen to what we were saying   remarked  one  and he looked significantly at the other who agreed     then one suggested that they go into the encampment and make a report  of the affair to the general  the other two assented to this  proposition  and they at once left the clump of trees and made their  way to the encampment     dick was eager  now  to get away from there     he felt that he had important if not really definite information and  wished to get it to general washington as quickly as possible  he knew  that he might succeed in getting away from the clump of timber without  being discovered  but again there was a chance that he would be seen  and captured  and so he decided to wait till nightfall  when he could  slip away in safety  and without being in any danger of being seen   true  the redcoats might come and search the clump of timber  for the  spy the soldier had had the encounter with  but the youth did not  believe they would do so  as they would not think him likely to linger  thereabouts after having had the struggle with the british soldier  there     so dick remained in the timber  and the result justified his judgment   for the soldiers did not come out again to make a search  evidently it  was thought that the spy had taken his departure     when night came  dick slipped away and started in the direction of the  patriot encampment on brooklyn heights  he reached there in safety  a  couple of hours later  and at once went to headquarters and made his  report  general washington being there  conferring with general  putnam     when dick told them of the unwonted activities in the british lines  they were well pleased  and said that if an attack were made they  would be able to hold their position on the heights  in spite of the  superior numbers of the enemy     next day preparations were begun for the reception of the british  and  all was done that could be to make it possible to offer strong and  successful battle to the enemy  then the patriots waited  as patiently  as possible for the coming of the british  who might now come at any  time  the days dragged slowly by  however  and it was not until the  morning of the   th of august that the british advanced to attack   seated in their quarters on the heights  dick  tom and ben  and the  other soldiers were discussing the matter and wishing that the  redcoats would do something  when suddenly the rattle of musketry was  heard  coming from down on the narrows road  near the bay  where  general stirling s division was stationed      to arms   at once shouted general putnam   the british are beginning  the attack      instantly all was excitement  the soldiers grabbed their muskets and  took their places  ready for battle  and down where stirling s force  was there sounded the rattle of musketry  as volleys were exchanged   it was indeed exciting  and dick  tom and ben  their eyes shining   could scarcely contain themselves  they wanted to be at the front   helping fight the redcoats      say  dick  ask general putnam to let us go down there   pleaded ben  foster   i want to help fight the redcoats       yes  do ask him  dick   urged tom   i can t stand staying here  doing  nothing  when there is fighting going on  get him to let us go down  there       all right  i ll try   said dick   i would like it myself  but  i m  afraid he won t be willing to let us go       ask him  anyway   said tom      i will   and dick hastened to general putnam and made his wish known     general putnam listened  but shook his head   no  i can t permit you  to go down there   he said   you must stay here with your company  if  it should go  of course you would go too  but i don t think it will  leave the works      dick nodded  a disappointed look on his face      very well  sir   he said  and turning  started to rejoin his  comrades      it is possible that i may make use of you boys as messengers during  the battle  dick   the general said  he had noted the disappointed  look on the youth s face  and doubtless thought the idea of being used  as messengers would please the boys     it evidently pleased dick  for he turned a beaming face toward the  general and said   thank you  general putnam  if you have any messages  to send to the commanders of the other forces  at the front  we will be  glad to take them       very well  dick  it is likely that i shall want to send some  messages  you boys hold yourselves in readiness to take them       we will do so  sir      then dick hastened back to his comrades and told them the result of  the interview  they were slightly disappointed because of not being  permitted to go and join the troops already engaged in fighting the  british  but were pleased with the idea of being sent to the  commanders with orders      i hope general putnam will have a lot of messages to send   said tom  dare  his eyes shining with excitement      so do i   said ben foster         chapter xvi    the battle of long island      down on the narrows road  general stirling s force was holding its own  against the british  the patriot soldiers were steady and calm  and  loaded and fired regularly and with considerable effect  and had  fortune gone well with sullivan s division  the continental soldiers  would probably have won the battle  but general sullivan  stationed on  the hills south of bedford  was attacked fiercely in front by a strong  force of british  and another force under generals howe and  cornwallis  having marched around to the north of this position  by  way of the jamaica road  attacked sullivan from the rear  and his  force  thus caught between two fires  was driven back and forth among  the trees  with disastrous results     general putnam  watching the battle from the heights  through his  glass  saw that sullivan was in difficulties and in danger of capture   and he decided to send a message to stirling  warning him of this  fact  and ordering him to retreat toward the heights as quickly as  possible for as soon as sullivan s force was overpowered  the british  would sweep on across the fields and fall upon the rear of stirling s  force and capture it  so  having written a brief note  general putnam  summoned dick dare      do you think you can find general stirling   the general asked      i think so  sir   was the reply      he is over on narrows road  you will know him  because he will be  mounted on a large bay horse  get to him as quickly as possible  and  hand him this message   and he gave dick the slip of paper      i will do so  general putnam   said dick  firmly      very good  now hurry  get there as quickly as possible      dick hastened away  running swiftly  and as he passed where tom and  ben were stationed  he called out   i m taking a message to general  stirling       good for you   cried ben      go it   from tom     dick vaulted over the breastworks and then ran down the slope at the  top of his speed      i m a messenger from general putnam   he called to the sentinel  as  he approached the soldier on duty partway down the slope  and then on  he dashed  without slackening speed in the least     soon he was in among the trees and out of sight of the patriot  soldiers on the heights  he knew the direction to go in order to reach  general stirling  and he headed in that direction and kept up his  speed     dick heard the firing over to his left  and knew this was where  general sullivan was having such a hot fight with the enemy  the youth  would pass within two or three hundred yards of the left wing of the  attacking british  and he kept a sharp lookout in that direction  for  he did not want to get shot by any of the british soldiers     presently he caught sight of the right wing of sullivan s force  and  saw the patriot soldiers firing at the british as rapidly as possible   and then he saw the redcoats  who were attacking the patriots from  both the front and the rear     dick wished that he might be able to help the patriot soldiers fight  the british  but he had business of his own to attend to  and so he  kept onward  running at the top of his speed     suddenly  however  when he was perhaps halfway to the point where  general stirling s army was fighting so bravely  he was given a  surprise  and a most unpleasant one for he found himself confronted by  a force of british soldiers  which was making a flank movement  with  the intention  doubtless  of falling upon sullivan s right wing   doubtless another force was executing a similar movement on the  opposite side  to attack sullivan s left wing  and when this movement  was finished  the soldiers under sullivan would be surrounded     dick halted instantly  on catching sight of the approaching soldiers   he had seen them while still they were a couple of hundred yards  distant  they being easy to see owing to the brilliant red of their  coats  which stood out plainly between the trees  he wondered if he  had been seen  if not  it might be possible to escape capture by  hiding if a hiding place could be found  if he were to turn to the  right and run in that direction  with the purpose of getting around  the end of this advancing force  he would be almost certain to be seen  and either shot down or captured  evidently  therefore  the proper  thing for him to do was to hide if he could find a place of  concealment     but could he do this  he glanced around him  eagerly and anxiously  he  was determined to get through the british ranks and deliver the  message to general stirling  if such a thing were possible  it would  never do to fail in the very first work that he was given to do in a  battle with the british  no  he must reach general stirling  general  putnam had shown confidence in dick  and the youth was not going to  give the general reason to think his confidence had been misplaced     but  where could he hide  while pondering this matter  dick was  standing behind a larger tree  and on glancing around this tree  to  see how close the redcoats were  the youth noted an interesting fact   the tree was hollow  there was an opening at least two feet high by a  foot and a half wide  at the bottom  but halfway around to the other  side  in order to enter this opening  dick would have to take the  chance of being seen by the approaching british soldiers     it seemed to be his only chance  however  for he could not hope to run  around the end of the force and escape without being shot down  and to  remain where he was would be to be discovered the instant the soldiers  came up to him     this being settled  dick did not hesitate  but acted at once  he  dropped to the ground  and lying on his stomach  wriggled his way  around the tree trunk  much after the fashion of a huge snake  he  glanced toward the approaching redcoats  and while he could see them  plainly  they being within seventy five yards of him  they had not as  yet  he felt certain  discovered him  this gave him courage  and  quickly he reached the opening and crawled through it and into the  hollow within     crouching back as far from the opening as possible  dick waited  anxiously for the coming of the british soldiers  had they seen him as  he crawled through the opening  would he be hauled out of the hollow  tree and made a prisoner  dick could not say  all he could do was to  wait and see what would happen  if the redcoats had seen him  he would  certainly be captured  but if they had not  then he stood a chance of  escaping discovery  and when they passed  he could continue on his way  and deliver the message to general stirling  how dick wished that this  might be the case     the moments that intervened before the redcoats reached the vicinity  of the tree were anxious ones for dick  he sat there  crouching back  as far as possible from the opening  and waited  and as he heard the  footsteps and voices of the british soldiers  his heart came up into  his throat     it was indeed a critical moment  it was a situation to try the nerve  of the bravest person     louder sounded the footsteps  plainer the voices of the redcoats   closer and closer the soldiers came  and then some of them appeared  opposite the opening  dick s heart was in his mouth  he held his  breath and wondered if some of the redcoats would stop and haul him  out from his hiding place  but no  nothing of the kind occurred  it  was now evident that he had not been seen as he was entering the  hollow tree  and the redcoats merely walked past  without looking  through the opening  and dick was not discovered     eagerly and thankfully he saw the soldiers pass  and when they had all  gone by  and had gotten perhaps fifty yards beyond  he stuck his head  out through the opening and took a look after his enemies  they were  walking swiftly onward  their faces to the front  not one was looking  back  and deeming it was safe  dick crawled out of his hiding place   and heaving a sigh of relief  he again set out in the direction of the  point where stirling s force was giving such valiant battle to the  british     on dick ran  at top speed  and presently he emerged upon the narrows  road  and caught sight of the patriot force  and also of the british   the battle between these two divisions of the armies was still going  on  and dick quickly caught sight of general stirling  who was seated  on his big bay charger  watching the progress of the battle     dick hastened up to the general  and saluting  said   i have message  for you  general stirling  from general putnam      general stirling took the message and quickly read the few words  written there      ah   he exclaimed   sullivan is in sore straits  being attacked from  both front and rear  and i must retreat  or my force will be treated  to the same fate      then he turned to dick  and said   tel general putnam i will begin  retreating toward the heights at once       yes  general stirling   said dick  and then he moved away  in the  direction from which he had come  while general stirling gave the  order for his force to beat a retreat  they obeyed  though  reluctantly  for they did not know that sullivan s force was  practically in the hands of the british  and so could not understand  why the order to retreat was given  they knew there was a strong force  of redcoats over to their left hand  however  and so they kept a sharp  lookout in that direction as they fell back  they were attacked from  that side  by a part of the force  and general stirling  while  fighting valiantly  was surrounded and made a prisoner     dick  from quite a distance  saw the capture of general stirling  and  he remained where he was for a little while  until he saw that the  main force under stirling succeeded in getting past the british and  were coming toward the heights  which they would undoubtedly succeed  in reaching  and then he turned and hastened on up to the heights  and  made his way to general putnam      i delivered the message to general stirling  sir   the youth said    and he told me to say to you that he would begin a retreat at once       very well  dick   said putnam   you did well to deliver the message       i saw his force retreating  sir  from down the slope a ways   went on  dick   and i saw some of the redcoats make a prisoner of general  stirling       so you say  my boy   exclaimed putnam   that is bad  well  it cannot  be helped  but  i think the major portion of his force will succeed in  reaching the heights       yes  i think so  general putnam  the soldiers are coming steadily   and have got past the main part of the british force       thanks for the information  dick   said the general  and then the  youth rejoined his comrades at the breastworks  tom and ben had many  questions to ask  and he told them briefly the story of his trip with  the despatch     the soldiers of stirling s force reached and entered the works on the  heights by the time dick had finished his story  and the battle of  long island was practically ended  the firing ceasing very soon  afterwards     the british army now advanced till in front of brooklyn heights  but  it did not attempt to storm the defenses  doubtless general howe  remembered bunker hill  and felt that a repetition of that experience  would be disastrous to the king s cause     general washington sent over two thousand more soldiers  from new  york  which made the force ten thousand strong within the patriot  works of brooklyn heights  and he was positive  as was general putnam  also  that the heights could be held  that if the british made an  attack it would be disastrous for them     the action of general howe showed that he thought so too  for instead  of getting ready to attack  he stretched his force around the heights   from the east river on the north to the east river again  on the  south  in a semicircle  and it was plain that his intention was to  establish a siege     general washington realized at once that it would not do to stay on  brooklyn heights  under such circumstances  for if the british fleet  were to come up the east river and cut off the patriot army s retreat  in that direction  the only result possible would be the surrender of  the continental army on the heights  as he had no intention of  surrendering  he decided to evacuate the position  and that night all  the boats that could be gathered together were secured and the patriot  army was removed across the river to new york  also all the arms   ammunitions  provisions of every kind  and the heavy artillery  were  ferried over  nothing was left  and when next morning the british  looked up at the works on the heights  they were amazed to see no  signs of life there for so silently and cautiously had the patriots  worked during the night that the british had not gotten an inkling of  the movement  the redcoats pushed up the hill  and climbed over the  works  only to stare around in dismay  nothing was left of the big  army that had been there only the evening before     this achievement of general washington  this wonderful feat of  withdrawing an entire army of ten thousand men  with all the arms   including heavy artillery  and the ammunitions and provisions from  right under the very nose of the enemy  and without the enemy even  suspecting what was going on  will always be considered one of the  greatest triumphs of generalship the world has ever known  this feat   when it became known in england  caused some of the greatest soldiers   and generals  and over in europe as well  to shake their heads and  declare that general washington was a commander who would cause the  british a great deal of trouble  and after events proved that they  were right in their prophecies     general putnam must have told general washington about dick dare  having carried a message practically through the lines of the british   to general stirling  during the battle of long island  for the  commander in chief  happening to see dick the day after the army took  up quarters in new york  spoke to him about the matter  and  complimented him on having successfully delivered the message  thus  probably saving stirling s force from capture     to say that dick was well pleased at receiving words of praise from  the lips of the commander in chief is stating it mildly  and when he  told tom and ben what general washington had said  they were well  pleased also  and declared that the commander in chief should have  cause to be satisfied with all three of them many times before the end  of the war  and  as friends will find  if they read the succeeding  volume of the dare boys series  which will be entitled   the dare boys  on the hudson   the brothers kept their word  and performed many  many  wonderful deeds of daring while fighting for liberty     the british commander in chief now put in a week trying to get the  patriot commander in chief to agree to peace  he stating that the king  would make certain concessions  but as in accordance with the  declaration of independence this was not to be thought of for a  moment  the interviews came to naught  and so the british  commander in chief began making preparations to continue the war  his  next move  undoubtedly would be to capture new york city  and general  washington knew this would be an easy matter  so he made preparations  to retreat to harlem heights  on the banks of the hudson at the north  end of manhattan island  where he would occupy a strategic position     on the fifteenth of september the british made the move that was  expected  warships from admiral howe s fleet ascended the hudson river  as far as bloomingdale  and the east river as far as blackwell s  island  and while they bombarded the north end of the island  general  howe brought his army across from brooklyn in boats  and landed at  kipp s bay  near what is now the foot of   th street     general washington came down from the heights with two brigades of  patriot soldiers  with the purpose of holding the british in check  long enough for general putnam to evacuate the lower part of the city  with the four thousand soldiers under him at that point  this was  accomplished  and when putnam and his men were safe on the heights   the two brigades retired to the heights also  the british then took  possession of new york city  and so the two armies lay  the  continental on the heights and the british in the city  confronting  each other  on manhattan island     it was an interesting situation  and especially so to dick and tom  dare and ben foster  who were now just beginning to feel that they  were soldiers in the patriot army     one evening  a few days after the british took possession of new york  and the patriots took up their station on harlem heights  the  commander in chief of the patriot army made the soldiers a stirring  speech  as they were assembled at the center of the encampment  saying  that he expected each and every soldier to do his full duty  and  support the cause of liberty with his life if need be  the speech made  a great impression on dick  tom and ben  and when they went to their  quarters  they were enthusiastic about it      i ll tell you what  boys   said tom dare   it was wonderful  the way  general washington talked  wasn t it       yes  tom   agreed dick   and we ll come up to his expectations  too   or know the reason why      and in enthusiastic unison tom and ben exclaimed      yes  yes  that we will  dick      and when the time came  they kept their word
