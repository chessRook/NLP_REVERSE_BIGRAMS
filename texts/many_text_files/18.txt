from the maitland club edition         other footnotes are by the  translator   urquhart s translation of book iii  appeared posthumously in        with a new edition of books i  and ii   under motteux s editorship   motteux s rendering of books iv  and v  followed in        occasionally  as  the footnotes indicate  passages omitted by motteux have been restored from  the      copy edited by ozell           the second book         for the reader     the reader here may be pleased to take notice that the copy of verses by  the title of  rablophila   premised to the first book of this translation   being but a kind of mock poem  in imitation of somewhat lately published   as to any indifferent observer will easily appear  by the false quantities  in the latin  the abusive strain of the english  and extravagant  subscription to both   and as such  by a friend of the translator s  at the  desire of some frolic gentlemen of his acquaintance  more for a trial of  skill than prejudicacy to any  composed in his jollity to please their  fancies  was only ordained to be prefixed to a dozen of books  and no more   thereby to save the labour of transcribing so many as were requisite for  satisfying the curiosity of a company of just that number  and that   therefore  the charging of the whole impression with it is merely to be  imputed to the negligence of the pressmen  who  receiving it about the  latter end of the night  were so eager before the next morning to afford  complete books  that  as they began  they went on  without animadverting  what was recommended to their discretion   this is hoped will suffice to  assure the ingenuous reader that in no treatise of the translator s   whether original or translatitious  shall willingly be offered the meanest  rub to the reputation of any worthy gentleman  and that  however providence  dispose of him  no misfortune shall be able to induce his mind to any  complacency in the disparagement of another     again     the pentateuch of rabelais mentioned in the title page of the first book of  this translation being written originally in the french tongue  as it  comprehendeth some of its brusquest dialects   with so much ingeniosity and  wit  that more impressions have been sold thereof in that language than of  any other book that hath been set forth at any time within these fifteen  hundred years  so difficult nevertheless to be turned into any other speech  that many prime spirits in most of the nations of europe  since the year        which was fourscore years ago  after having attempted it  were  constrained with no small regret to give it over as a thing impossible to  be done  is now in its translation thus far advanced  and the remainder  faithfully undertaken with the same hand to be rendered into english by a  person of quality  who  though his lands be sequestered  his house  garrisoned  his other goods sold  and himself detained a prisoner of war at  london  for his having been at worcester fight  hath  at the most earnest  entreaty of some of his especial friends well acquainted with his  inclination to the performance of conducible singularities  promised   besides his version of these two already published  very speedily to offer  up unto this isle of britain the virginity of the translation of the other  three most admirable books of the aforesaid author  provided that by the  plurality of judicious and understanding men it be not declared he hath  already proceeded too far  or that the continuation of the rigour whereby  he is dispossessed of all his both real and personal estate  by pressing  too hard upon him  be not an impediment thereto  and to other more eminent  undertakings of his  as hath been oftentimes very fully mentioned by the  said translator in several original treatises of his own penning  lately by  him so numerously dispersed that there is scarce any  who being skilful in  the english idiom  or curious of any new ingenious invention  hath not  either read them or heard of them         mr  hugh salel to rabelais     if profit mixed with pleasure may suffice  t  extol an author s worth above the skies   thou certainly for both must praised be   i know it  for thy judgment hath in the  contexture of this book set down such high  contentments  mingled with utility   that  as i think  i see democritus  laughing at men as things ridiculous       insist in thy design  for  though we prove      ungrate on earth  thy merit is above         the author s prologue     most illustrious and thrice valorous champions  gentlemen and others  who  willingly apply your minds to the entertainment of pretty conceits and  honest harmless knacks of wit  you have not long ago seen  read  and  understood the great and inestimable chronicle of the huge and mighty giant  gargantua  and  like upright faithfullists  have firmly believed all to be  true that is contained in them  and have very often passed your time with  them amongst honourable ladies and gentlewomen  telling them fair long  stories  when you were out of all other talk  for which you are worthy of  great praise and sempiternal memory   and i do heartily wish that every man  would lay aside his own business  meddle no more with his profession nor  trade  and throw all affairs concerning himself behind his back  to attend  this wholly  without distracting or troubling his mind with anything else   until he have learned them without book  that if by chance the art of  printing should cease  or in case that in time to come all books should  perish  every man might truly teach them unto his children  and deliver  them over to his successors and survivors from hand to hand as a religious  cabal  for there is in it more profit than a rabble of great pocky  loggerheads are able to discern  who surely understand far less in these  little merriments than the fool raclet did in the institutions of  justinian     i have known great and mighty lords  and of those not a few  who  going  a deer hunting  or a hawking after wild ducks  when the chase had not  encountered with the blinks that were cast in her way to retard her course   or that the hawk did but plain and smoothly fly without moving her wings   perceiving the prey by force of flight to have gained bounds of her  have  been much chafed and vexed  as you understand well enough  but the comfort  unto which they had refuge  and that they might not take cold  was to  relate the inestimable deeds of the said gargantua   there are others in  the world  these are no flimflam stories  nor tales of a tub  who  being  much troubled with the toothache  after they had spent their goods upon  physicians without receiving at all any ease of their pain  have found no  more ready remedy than to put the said chronicles betwixt two pieces of  linen cloth made somewhat hot  and so apply them to the place that  smarteth  sinapizing them with a little powder of projection  otherwise  called doribus     but what shall i say of those poor men that are plagued with the pox and  the gout   o how often have we seen them  even immediately after they were  anointed and thoroughly greased  till their faces did glister like the  keyhole of a powdering tub  their teeth dance like the jacks of a pair of  little organs or virginals when they are played upon  and that they foamed  from their very throats like a boar which the mongrel mastiff hounds have  driven in and overthrown amongst the toils   what did they then   all their  consolation was to have some page of the said jolly book read unto them   and we have seen those who have given themselves to a hundred puncheons of  old devils  in case that they did not feel a manifest ease and assuagement  of pain at the hearing of the said book read  even when they were kept in a  purgatory of torment  no more nor less than women in travail use to find  their sorrow abated when the life of st  margaret is read unto them   is  this nothing   find me a book in any language  in any faculty or science  whatsoever  that hath such virtues  properties  and prerogatives  and i  will be content to pay you a quart of tripes   no  my masters  no  it is  peerless  incomparable  and not to be matched  and this am i resolved for  ever to maintain even unto the fire exclusive   and those that will  pertinaciously hold the contrary opinion  let them be accounted abusers   predestinators  impostors  and seducers of the people   it is very true  that there are found in some gallant and stately books  worthy of high  estimation  certain occult and hid properties  in the number of which are  reckoned whippot  orlando furioso  robert the devil  fierabras  william  without fear  huon of bordeaux  monteville  and matabrune  but they are not  comparable to that which we speak of  and the world hath well known by  infallible experience the great emolument and utility which it hath  received by this gargantuine chronicle  for the printers have sold more of  them in two months  time than there will be bought of bibles in nine years     i therefore  your humble slave  being very willing to increase your solace  and recreation yet a little more  do offer you for a present another book  of the same stamp  only that it is a little more reasonable and worthy of  credit than the other was   for think not  unless you wilfully will err  against your knowledge  that i speak of it as the jews do of the law   i  was not born under such a planet  neither did it ever befall me to lie  or  affirm a thing for true

of the horrible and  dreadful feats and prowesses of pantagruel  whose menial servant i have  been ever since i was a page  till this hour that by his leave i am  permitted to visit my cow country  and to know if any of my kindred there  be alive     and therefore  to make an end of this prologue  even as i give myself to a  hundred panniersful of fair devils  body and soul  tripes and guts  in case  that i lie so much as one single word in this whole history  after the like  manner  st  anthony s fire burn you  mahoom s disease whirl you  the  squinance with a stitch in your side and the wolf in your stomach truss  you  the bloody flux seize upon you  the cursed sharp inflammations of  wild fire  as slender and thin as cow s hair strengthened with quicksilver   enter into your fundament  and  like those of sodom and gomorrah  may you  fall into sulphur  fire  and bottomless pits  in case you do not firmly  believe all that i shall relate unto you in this present chronicle           the second book         chapter   i     of the original and antiquity of the great pantagruel     it will not be an idle nor unprofitable thing  seeing we are at leisure  to  put you in mind of the fountain and original source whence is derived unto  us the good pantagruel   for i see that all good historiographers have thus  handled their chronicles  not only the arabians  barbarians  and latins   but also the gentle greeks  who were eternal drinkers   you must therefore  remark that at the beginning of the world  i speak of a long time  it is  above forty quarantains  or forty times forty nights  according to the  supputation of the ancient druids  a little after that abel was killed by  his brother cain  the earth  imbrued with the blood of the just  was one  year so exceeding fertile in all those fruits which it usually produceth to  us  and especially in medlars  that ever since throughout all ages it hath  been called the year of the great medlars  for three of them did fill a  bushel   in it the kalends were found by the grecian almanacks   there was  that year nothing of the month of march in the time of lent  and the middle  of august was in may   in the month of october  as i take it  or at least  september  that i may not err  for i will carefully take heed of that  was  the week so famous in the annals  which they call the week of the three  thursdays  for it had three of them by means of their irregular leap years   called bissextiles  occasioned by the sun s having tripped and stumbled a  little towards the left hand  like a debtor afraid of sergeants  coming  right upon him to arrest him   and the moon varied from her course above  five fathom  and there was manifestly seen the motion of trepidation in the  firmament of the fixed stars  called aplanes  so that the middle pleiade   leaving her fellows  declined towards the equinoctial  and the star named  spica left the constellation of the virgin to withdraw herself towards the  balance  known by the name of libra  which are cases very terrible  and  matters so hard and difficult that astrologians cannot set their teeth in  them  and indeed their teeth had been pretty long if they could have  reached thither     however  account you it for a truth that everybody then did most heartily  eat of these medlars  for they were fair to the eye and in taste delicious   but even as noah  that holy man  to whom we are so much beholding  bound   and obliged  for that he planted to us the vine  from whence we have that  nectarian  delicious  precious  heavenly  joyful  and deific liquor which  they call the piot or tiplage  was deceived in the drinking of it  for he  was ignorant of the great virtue and power thereof  so likewise the men and  women of that time did delight much in the eating of that fair great fruit   but divers and very different accidents did ensue thereupon  for there fell  upon them all in their bodies a most terrible swelling  but not upon all in  the same place  for some were swollen in the belly  and their belly  strouted out big like a great tun  of whom it is written  ventrem  omnipotentem  who were all very honest men  and merry blades   and of this  race came st  fatgulch and shrove tuesday  pansart  mardigras     others  did swell at the shoulders  who in that place were so crump and knobby that  they were therefore called montifers  which is as much to say as  hill carriers  of whom you see some yet in the world  of divers sexes and  degrees   of this race came aesop  some of whose excellent words and deeds  you have in writing   some other puffs did swell in length by the member  which they call the labourer of nature  in such sort that it grew  marvellous long  fat  great  lusty  stirring  and crest risen  in the  antique fashion  so that they made use of it as of a girdle  winding it  five or six times about their waist   but if it happened the foresaid  member to be in good case  spooming with a full sail bunt fair before the  wind  then to have seen those strouting champions  you would have taken  them for men that had their lances settled on their rest to run at the ring  or tilting whintam  quintain    of these  believe me  the race is utterly  lost and quite extinct  as the women say  for they do lament continually  that there are none extant now of those great   c   you know the rest of  the song   others did grow in matter of ballocks so enormously that three  of them would well fill a sack able to contain five quarters of wheat   from them are descended the ballocks of lorraine  which never dwell in  codpieces  but fall down to the bottom of the breeches   others grew in the  legs  and to see them you would have said they had been cranes  or the  reddish long billed storklike scrank legged sea fowls called flamans  or  else men walking upon stilts or scatches   the little grammar school boys   known by the name of grimos  called those leg grown slangams jambus  in  allusion to the french word jambe  which signifieth a leg   in others   their nose did grow so  that it seemed to be the beak of a limbeck  in  every part thereof most variously diapered with the twinkling sparkles of  crimson blisters budding forth  and purpled with pimples all enamelled with  thickset wheals of a sanguine colour  bordered with gules  and such have  you seen the canon or prebend panzoult  and woodenfoot  the physician of  angiers   of which race there were few that looked the ptisane  but all of  them were perfect lovers of the pure septembral juice   naso and ovid had  their extraction from thence  and all those of whom it is written  ne  reminiscaris   others grew in ears  which they had so big that out of one  would have been stuff enough got to make a doublet  a pair of breeches  and  a jacket  whilst with the other they might have covered themselves as with  a spanish cloak   and they say that in bourbonnois this race remaineth yet   others grew in length of body  and of those came the giants  and of them  pantagruel     and the first was chalbroth   who begat sarabroth   who begat faribroth   who begat hurtali  that was a brave eater of

the noble pantagruel  my master     i know that  reading this passage  you will make a doubt within yourselves   and that grounded upon very good reason  which is this  how it is possible  that this relation can be true  seeing at the time of the flood all the  world was destroyed  except noah and seven persons more with him in the  ark  into whose number hurtali is not admitted   doubtless the demand is  well made and very apparent  but the answer shall satisfy you  or my wit is  not rightly caulked   and because i was not at that time to tell you  anything of my own fancy  i will bring unto you the authority of the  massorets  good honest fellows  true ballockeering blades and exact  hebraical bagpipers  who affirm that verily the said hurtali was not within  the ark of noah  neither could he get in  for he was too big  but he sat  astride upon it  with one leg on the one side and another on the other  as  little children use to do upon their wooden horses  or as the great bull of  berne  which was killed at marinian  did ride for his hackney the great  murdering piece called the canon pevier  a pretty beast of a fair and  pleasant amble without all question     in that posture  he  after god  saved the said ark from danger  for with  his legs he gave it the brangle that was needful  and with his foot turned  it whither he pleased  as a ship answereth her rudder   those that were  within sent him up victuals in abundance by a chimney  as people very  thankfully acknowledging the good that he did them   and sometimes they did  talk together as icaromenippus did to jupiter  according to the report of  lucian   have you understood all this well   drink then one good draught  without water  for if you believe it not   no truly do i not  quoth she         chapter   ii     of the nativity of the most dread and redoubted pantagruel     gargantua at the age of four hundred fourscore forty and four years begat  his son pantagruel  upon his wife named badebec  daughter to the king of  the amaurots in utopia  who died in childbirth  for he was so wonderfully  great and lumpish that he could not possibly come forth into the light of  the world without thus suffocating his mother   but that we may fully  understand the cause and reason of the name of pantagruel which at his  baptism was given him  you are to remark that in that year there was so  great drought over all the country of africa that there passed thirty and  six months  three weeks  four days  thirteen hours and a little more  without rain  but with a heat so vehement that the whole earth was parched  and withered by it   neither was it more scorched and dried up with heat in  the days of elijah than it was at that time  for there was not a tree to be  seen that had either leaf or bloom upon it   the grass was without verdure  or greenness  the rivers were drained  the fountains dried up  the poor  fishes  abandoned and forsaken by their proper element  wandering and  crying upon the ground most horribly   the birds did fall down from the air  for want of moisture and dew wherewith to refresh them   the wolves  foxes   harts  wild boars  fallow deer  hares  coneys  weasels  brocks  badgers   and other such beasts  were found dead in the fields with their mouths  open   in respect of men  there was the pity  you should have seen them lay  out their tongues like hares that have been run six hours   many did throw  themselves into the wells   others entered within a cow s belly to be in  the shade  those homer calls alibants   all the country was idle  and could  do no virtue   it was a most lamentable case to have seen the labour of  mortals in defending themselves from the vehemency of this horrific  drought  for they had work enough to do to save the holy water in the  churches from being wasted  but there was such order taken by the counsel  of my lords the cardinals and of our holy father  that none did dare to  take above one lick   yet when anyone came into the church  you should have  seen above twenty poor thirsty fellows hang upon him that was the  distributor of the water  and that with a wide open throat  gaping for some  little drop  like the rich glutton in luke  that might fall by  lest  anything should be lost   o how happy was he in that year who had a cool  cellar under ground  well plenished with fresh wine     the philosopher reports  in moving the question  wherefore it is that the  sea water is salt  that at the time when phoebus gave the government of his  resplendent chariot to his son phaeton  the said phaeton  unskilful in the  art  and not knowing how to keep the ecliptic line betwixt the two tropics  of the latitude of the sun s course  strayed out of his way  and came so  near the earth that he dried up all the countries that were under it   burning a great part of the heavens which the philosophers call via lactea   and the huffsnuffs st  james s way  although the most coped  lofty  and  high crested poets affirm that to be the place where juno s milk fell when  she gave suck to hercules   the earth at that time was so excessively  heated that it fell into an enormous sweat  yea  such a one as made it  sweat out the sea  which is therefore salt  because all sweat is salt  and  this you cannot but confess to be true if you will taste of your own  or of  those that have the pox  when they are put into sweating  it is all one to  me     just such another case fell out this same year   for on a certain friday   when the whole people were bent upon their devotions  and had made goodly  processions  with store of litanies  and fair preachings  and beseechings  of god almighty to look down with his eye of mercy upon their miserable and  disconsolate condition  there was even then visibly seen issue out of the  ground great drops of water  such as fall from a puff bagged man in a top  sweat  and the poor hoidens began to rejoice as if it had been a thing very  profitable unto them  for some said that there was not one drop of moisture  in the air whence they might have any rain  and that the earth did supply  the default of that   other learned men said that it was a shower of the  antipodes  as seneca saith in his fourth book quaestionum naturalium   speaking of the source and spring of nilus   but they were deceived  for   the procession being ended  when everyone went about to gather of this dew   and to drink of it with full bowls  they found that it was nothing but  pickle and the very brine of salt  more brackish in taste than the saltest  water of the sea   and because in that very day pantagruel was born  his  father gave him that name  for panta in greek is as much to say as all  and  gruel in the hagarene language doth signify thirsty  inferring hereby that  at his birth the whole world was a dry and thirsty  as likewise foreseeing  that he would be some day supreme lord and sovereign of the thirsty  ethrappels  which was shown to him at that very same hour by a more evident  sign   for when his mother badebec was in the bringing of him forth  and  that the midwives did wait to receive him  there came first out of her  belly three score and eight tregeneers  that is  salt sellers  every one of  them leading in a halter a mule heavy laden with salt  after whom issued  forth nine dromedaries  with great loads of gammons of bacon and dried  neat s tongues on their backs   then followed seven camels loaded with  links and chitterlings  hogs  puddings  and sausages   after them came out  five great wains  full of leeks  garlic  onions  and chibots  drawn with  five and thirty strong cart horses  which was six for every one  besides  the thiller   at the sight hereof the said midwives were much amazed  yet  some of them said  lo  here is good provision  and indeed we need it  for  we drink but lazily  as if our tongues walked on crutches  and not lustily  like lansman dutches   truly this is a good sign  there is nothing here but  what is fit for us  these are the spurs of wine  that set it a going   as  they were tattling thus together after their own manner of chat  behold   out comes pantagruel all hairy like a bear  whereupon one of them  inspired  with a prophetical spirit  said  this will be a terrible fellow  he is born  with all his hair  he is undoubtedly to do wonderful things  and if he live  he shall have age         chapter   iii     of the grief wherewith gargantua was moved at the decease of his wife  badebec     when pantagruel was born  there was none more astonished and perplexed than  was his father gargantua  for of the one side seeing his wife badebec dead   and on the other side his son pantagruel born  so fair and so great  he  knew not what to say nor what to do   and the doubt that troubled his brain  was to know whether he should cry for the death of his wife or laugh for  the joy of his son   he was hinc inde choked with sophistical arguments   for he framed them very well in modo et figura  but he could not resolve  them  remaining pestered and entangled by this means  like a mouse caught  in a trap or kite snared in a gin   shall i weep  said he   yes  for why   my so good wife is dead  who was the most this  the most that  that ever  was in the world   never shall i see her  never shall i recover such  another  it is unto me an inestimable loss   o my good god  what had i done  that thou shouldest thus punish me   why didst thou not take me away before  her  seeing for me to live without her is but to languish   ah  badebec   badebec  my minion  my dear heart  my sugar  my sweeting  my honey  my  little c    yet it had in circumference full six acres  three rods  five  poles  four yards  two foot  one inch and a half of good woodland measure    my tender peggy  my codpiece darling  my bob and hit  my slipshoe lovey   never shall i see thee   ah  poor pantagruel  thou hast lost thy good  mother  thy sweet nurse  thy well beloved lady   o false death  how  injurious and despiteful hast thou been to me   how malicious and  outrageous have i found thee in taking her from me  my well beloved wife   to whom immortality did of right belong     with these words he did cry like a cow  but on a sudden fell a laughing  like a calf  when pantagruel came into his mind   ha  my little son  said  he  my childilolly  fedlifondy  dandlichucky  my ballocky  my pretty rogue   o how jolly thou art  and how much am i bound to my gracious god  that hath  been pleased to bestow on me a son so fair  so spriteful  so lively  so  smiling  so pleasant  and so gentle   ho  ho  ho  ho  how glad i am   let  us drink  ho  and put away melancholy   bring of the best  rinse the  glasses  lay the cloth  drive out these dogs  blow this fire  light  candles  shut that door there  cut this bread in sippets for brewis  send  away these poor folks in giving them what they ask  hold my gown   i will  strip myself into my doublet  en cuerpo   to make the gossips merry  and  keep them company     as he spake this  he heard the litanies and the mementos of the priests  that carried his wife to be buried  upon which he left the good purpose he  was in  and was suddenly ravished another way  saying  lord god  must i  again contrist myself   this grieves me   i am no longer young  i grow old   the weather is dangerous  i may perhaps take an ague  then shall i be  foiled  if not quite undone   by the faith of a gentleman  it were better  to cry less  and drink more   my wife is dead  well  by g     da jurandi  i  shall not raise her again by my crying   she is well  she is in paradise at  least  if she be no higher   she prayeth to god for us  she is happy  she  is above the sense of our miseries  nor can our calamities reach her   what  though she be dead  must not we also die   the same debt which she hath  paid hangs over our heads  nature will require it of us  and we must all of  us some day taste of the same sauce   let her pass then  and the lord  preserve the survivors  for i must now cast about how to get another wife   but i will tell you what you shall do  said he to the midwives  in france  called wise women  where be they  good folks   i cannot see them    go you  to my wife s interment  and i will the while rock my son  for i find myself  somewhat altered and distempered  and should otherwise be in danger of  falling sick  but drink one good draught first  you will be the better for  it   and believe me  upon mine honour  they at his request went to her  burial and funeral obsequies   in the meanwhile  poor gargantua staying at  home  and willing to have somewhat in remembrance of her to be engraven  upon her tomb  made this epitaph in the manner as followeth       dead is the noble badebec     who had a face like a rebeck     a spanish body  and a belly    of switzerland  she died  i tell ye     in childbirth   pray to god  that her    he pardon wherein she did err     here lies her body  which did live    free from all vice  as i believe       and did decease at my bedside       the year and day in which she died         chapter   iv     of the infancy of pantagruel     i find by the ancient historiographers and poets that divers have been born  in this world after very strange manners  which would be too long to  repeat  read therefore the seventh chapter of pliny  if you have so much  leisure   yet have you never heard of any so wonderful as that of  pantagruel  for it is a very difficult matter to believe  how in the little  time he was in his mother s belly he grew both in body and strength   that  which hercules did was nothing  when in his cradle he slew two serpents   for those serpents were but little and weak  but pantagruel  being yet in  the cradle  did far more admirable things  and more to be amazed at   i  pass by here the relation of how at every one of his meals he supped up the  milk of four thousand and six hundred cows  and how  to make him a skillet  to boil his milk in  there were set a work all the braziers of somure in  anjou  of villedieu in normandy  and of bramont in lorraine   and they  served in this whitepot meat to him in a huge great bell  which is yet to  be seen in the city of bourges in berry  near the palace  but his teeth  were already so well grown  and so strengthened with vigour  that of the  said bell he bit off a great morsel  as very plainly doth appear till this  hour     one day in the morning  when they would have made him suck one of his cows    for he never had any other nurse  as the history tells us  he got one of  his arms loose from the swaddling bands wherewith he was kept fast in the  cradle  laid hold on the said cow under the left foreham  and grasping her  to him ate up her udder and half of her paunch  with the liver and the  kidneys  and had devoured all up if she had not cried out most horribly  as  if the wolves had held her by the legs  at which noise company came in and  took away the said cow from pantagruel   yet could they not so well do it  but that the quarter whereby he caught her was left in his hand  of which  quarter he gulped up the flesh in a trice  even with as much ease as you  would eat a sausage  and that so greedily with desire of more  that  when  they would have taken away the bone from him  he swallowed it down whole   as a cormorant would do a little fish  and afterwards began fumblingly to  say  good  good  good  for he could not yet speak plain  giving them to  understand thereby that he had found it very good  and that he did lack but  so much more   which when they saw that attended him  they bound him with  great cable ropes  like those that are made at tain for the carriage of  salt to lyons  or such as those are whereby the great french ship rides at  anchor in the road of newhaven in normandy   but  on a certain time  a  great bear  which his father had bred  got loose  came towards him  began  to lick his face  for his nurses had not thoroughly wiped his chaps  at  which unexpected approach being on a sudden offended  he as lightly rid  himself of those great cables as samson did of the hawser ropes wherewith  the philistines had tied him  and  by your leave  takes me up my lord the  bear  and tears him to you in pieces like a pullet  which served him for a  gorgeful or good warm bit for that meal     whereupon gargantua  fearing lest the child should hurt himself  caused  four great chains of iron to be made to bind him  and so many strong wooden  arches unto his cradle  most firmly stocked and morticed in huge frames   of those chains you have one at rochelle  which they draw up at night  betwixt the two great towers of the haven   another is at lyons   a third  at angiers   and the fourth was carried away by the devils to bind lucifer   who broke his chains in those days by reason of a colic that did  extraordinarily torment him  taken with eating a sergeant s soul fried for  his breakfast   and therefore you may believe that which nicholas de lyra  saith upon that place of the psalter where it is written  et og regem  basan  that the said og  being yet little  was so strong and robustious   that they were fain to bind him with chains of iron in his cradle   thus  continued pantagruel for a while very calm and quiet  for he was not able  so easily to break those chains  especially having no room in the cradle to  give a swing with his arms   but see what happened once upon a great  holiday that his father gargantua made a sumptuous banquet to all the  princes of his court   i am apt to believe that the menial officers of the  house were so embusied in waiting each on his proper service at the feast   that nobody took care of poor pantagruel  who was left a reculorum   behindhand  all alone  and as forsaken   what did he   hark what he did   good people   he strove and essayed to break the chains of the cradle with  his arms  but could not  for they were too strong for him   then did he  keep with his feet such a stamping stir  and so long  that at last he beat  out the lower end of his cradle  which notwithstanding was made of a great  post five foot in square  and as soon as he had gotten out his feet  he  slid down as well as he could till he had got his soles to the ground  and  then with a mighty force he rose up  carrying his cradle upon his back   bound to him like a tortoise that crawls up against a wall  and to have  seen him  you would have thought it had been a great carrick of five  hundred tons upon one end   in this manner he entered into the great hall  where they were banqueting  and that very boldly  which did much affright  the company  yet  because his arms were tied in  he could not reach  anything to eat  but with great pain stooped now and then a little to take  with the whole flat of his tongue some lick  good bit  or morsel   which  when his father saw  he knew well enough that they had left him without  giving him anything to eat  and therefore commanded that he should be  loosed from the said chains  by the counsel of the princes and lords there  present   besides that also the physicians of gargantua said that  if they  did thus keep him in the cradle  he would be all his lifetime subject to  the stone   when he was unchained  they made him to sit down  where  after  he had fed very well  he took his cradle and broke it into more than five  hundred thousand pieces with one blow of his fist that he struck in the  midst of it  swearing that he would never come into it again         chapter   v     of the acts of the noble pantagruel in his youthful age     thus grew pantagruel from day to day  and to everyone s eye waxed more and  more in all his dimensions  which made his father to rejoice by a natural  affection   therefore caused he to be made for him  whilst he was yet  little  a pretty crossbow wherewith to shoot at small birds  which now they  call the great crossbow at chantelle   then he sent him to the school to  learn  and to spend his youth in virtue   in the prosecution of which  design he came first to poictiers  where  as he studied and profited very  much  he saw that the scholars were oftentimes at leisure and knew not how  to bestow their time  which moved him to take such compassion on them  that  one day he took from a long ledge of rocks  called there passelourdin  a  huge great stone  of about twelve fathom square and fourteen handfuls  thick  and with great ease set it upon four pillars in the midst of a  field  to no other end but that the said scholars  when they had nothing  else to do  might pass their time in getting up on that stone  and feast it  with store of gammons  pasties  and flagons  and carve their names upon it  with a knife  in token of which deed till this hour the stone is called the  lifted stone   and in remembrance hereof there is none entered into the  register and matricular book of the said university  or accounted capable  of taking any degree therein  till he have first drunk in the caballine  fountain of croustelles  passed at passelourdin  and got up upon the lifted  stone     afterwards  reading the delectable chronicles of his ancestors  he found  that geoffrey of lusignan  called geoffrey with the great tooth   grandfather to the cousin in law of the eldest sister of the aunt of the  son in law of the uncle of the good daughter of his stepmother  was  interred at maillezais  therefore one day he took campos  which is a little  vacation from study to play a while   that he might give him a visit as  unto an honest man   and going from poictiers with some of his companions   they passed by the guge  leguge   visiting the noble abbot ardillon  then  by lusignan  by sansay  by celles  by coolonges  by fontenay le comte   saluting the learned tiraqueau  and from thence arrived at maillezais   where he went to see the sepulchre of the said geoffrey with the great  tooth  which made him somewhat afraid  looking upon the picture  whose  lively draughts did set him forth in the representation of a man in an  extreme fury  drawing his great malchus falchion half way out of his  scabbard   when the reason hereof was demanded  the canons of the said  place told him that there was no other cause of it but that pictoribus  atque poetis   c   that is to say  that painters and poets have liberty to  paint and devise what they list after their own fancy   but he was not  satisfied with their answer  and said  he is not thus painted without a  cause  and i suspect that at his death there was some wrong done him   whereof he requireth his kindred to take revenge   i will inquire further  into it  and then do what shall be reasonable   then he returned not to  poictiers  but would take a view of the other universities of france   therefore  going to rochelle  he took shipping and arrived at bordeaux   where he found no great exercise  only now and then he would see some  mariners and lightermen a wrestling on the quay or strand by the  river side   from thence he came to toulouse  where he learned to dance very  well  and to play with the two handed sword  as the fashion of the scholars  of the said university is to bestir themselves in games whereof they may  have their hands full  but he stayed not long there when he saw that they  did cause burn their regents alive like red herring  saying  now god forbid  that i should die this death  for i am by nature sufficiently dry already   without heating myself any further     he went then to montpellier  where he met with the good wives of mirevaux   and good jovial company withal  and thought to have set himself to the  study of physic  but he considered that that calling was too troublesome  and melancholic  and that physicians did smell of glisters like old devils   therefore he resolved he would study the laws  but seeing that there were  but three scald  and one bald pated legist in that place  he departed from  thence  and in his way made the bridge of guard and the amphitheatre of  nimes in less than three hours  which  nevertheless  seems to be a more  divine than human work   after that he came to avignon  where he was not  above three days before he fell in love  for the women there take great  delight in playing at the close buttock game  because it is papal ground   which his tutor and pedagogue epistemon perceiving  he drew him out of that  place  and brought him to valence in the dauphiny  where he saw no great  matter of recreation  only that the lubbers of the town did beat the  scholars  which so incensed him with anger  that when  upon a certain very  fair sunday  the people being at their public dancing in the streets  and  one of the scholars offering to put himself into the ring to partake of  that sport  the foresaid lubberly fellows would not permit him the  admittance into their society  he  taking the scholar s part  so belaboured  them with blows  and laid such load upon them  that he drove them all  before him  even to the brink of the river rhone  and would have there  drowned them  but that they did squat to the ground  and there lay close a  full half league under the river   the hole is to be seen there yet     after that he departed from thence  and in three strides and one leap came  to angiers  where he found himself very well  and would have continued  there some space  but that the plague drove them away   so from thence he  came to bourges  where he studied a good long time  and profited very much  in the faculty of the laws  and would sometimes say that the books of the  civil law were like unto a wonderfully precious  royal  and triumphant robe  of cloth of gold edged with dirt  for in the world are no goodlier books to  be seen  more ornate  nor more eloquent than the texts of the pandects  but  the bordering of them  that is to say  the gloss of accursius  is so  scurvy  vile  base  and unsavoury  that it is nothing but filthiness and  villainy     going from bourges  he came to orleans  where he found store of swaggering  scholars that made him great entertainment at his coming  and with whom he  learned to play at tennis so well that he was a master at that game   for  the students of the said place make a prime exercise of it  and sometimes  they carried him unto cupid s houses of commerce  in that city termed  islands  because of their being most ordinarily environed with other  houses  and not contiguous to any   there to recreate his person at the  sport of poussavant  which the wenches of london call the ferkers in and  in   as for breaking his head with over much study  he had an especial care  not to do it in any case  for fear of spoiling his eyes   which he the  rather observed  for that it was told him by one of his teachers  there  called regents  that the pain of the eyes was the most hurtful thing of any  to the sight   for this cause  when he one day was made a licentiate  or  graduate in law  one of the scholars of his acquaintance  who of learning  had not much more than his burden  though instead of that he could dance  very well and play at tennis  made the blazon and device of the licentiates  in the said university  saying       so you have in your hand a racket     a tennis ball in your cod placket     a pandect law in your cap s tippet     and that you have the skill to trip it    in a low dance  you will b  allowed    the grant of the licentiate s hood         chapter   vi     how pantagruel met with a limousin  who too affectedly did counterfeit the  french language     upon a certain day  i know not when  pantagruel walking after supper with  some of his fellow students without that gate of the city through which we  enter on the road to paris  encountered with a young spruce like scholar  that was coming upon the same very way  and  after they had saluted one  another  asked him thus  my friend  from whence comest thou now   the  scholar answered him  from the alme  inclyte  and celebrate academy  which  is vocitated lutetia   what is the meaning of this  said pantagruel to one  of his men   it is  answered he  from paris   thou comest from paris then   said pantagruel  and how do you spend your time there  you my masters the  students of paris   the scholar answered  we transfretate the sequan at the  dilucul and crepuscul  we deambulate by the compites and quadrives of the  urb  we despumate the latial verbocination  and  like verisimilary  amorabons  we captat the benevolence of the omnijugal  omniform and  omnigenal feminine sex   upon certain diecules we invisat the lupanares   and in a venerian ecstasy inculcate our veretres into the penitissime  recesses of the pudends of these amicabilissim meretricules   then do we  cauponisate in the meritory taberns of the pineapple  the castle  the  magdalene  and the mule  goodly vervecine spatules perforaminated with  petrocile   and if by fortune there be rarity or penury of pecune in our  marsupies  and that they be exhausted of ferruginean metal  for the shot we  dimit our codices and oppignerat our vestments  whilst we prestolate the  coming of the tabellaries from the penates and patriotic lares   to which  pantagruel answered  what devilish language is this   by the lord  i think  thou art some kind of heretick   my lord  no  said the scholar  for  libentissimally  as soon as it illucesceth any minutule slice of the day  i  demigrate into one of these so well architected minsters  and there   irrorating myself with fair lustral water  i mumble off little parcels of  some missic precation of our sacrificuls  and  submurmurating my horary  precules  i elevate and absterge my anime from its nocturnal inquinations   i revere the olympicols   i latrially venere the supernal astripotent   i  dilige and redame my proxims   i observe the decalogical precepts  and   according to the facultatule of my vires  i do not discede from them one  late unguicule   nevertheless  it is veriform  that because mammona doth  not supergurgitate anything in my loculs  that i am somewhat rare and lent  to supererogate the elemosynes to those egents that hostially queritate  their stipe     prut  tut  said pantagruel  what doth this fool mean to say   i think he is  upon the forging of some diabolical tongue  and that enchanter like he  would charm us   to whom one of his men said  without doubt  sir  this  fellow would counterfeit the language of the parisians  but he doth only  flay the latin  imagining by so doing that he doth highly pindarize it in  most eloquent terms  and strongly conceiteth himself to be therefore a  great orator in the french  because he disdaineth the common manner of  speaking   to which pantagruel said  is it true   the scholar answered  my  worshipful lord  my genie is not apt nate to that which this flagitious  nebulon saith  to excoriate the cut ic ule of our vernacular gallic  but  vice versally i gnave opere  and by veles and rames enite to locupletate it  with the latinicome redundance   by g    said pantagruel  i will teach you  to speak   but first come hither  and tell me whence thou art   to this the  scholar answered  the primeval origin of my aves and ataves was indigenary  of the lemovic regions  where requiesceth the corpor of the hagiotat st   martial   i understand thee very well  said pantagruel   when all comes to  all  thou art a limousin  and thou wilt here by thy affected speech  counterfeit the parisians   well now  come hither  i must show thee a new  trick  and handsomely give thee the combfeat   with this he took him by the  throat  saying to him  thou flayest the latin  by st  john  i will make  thee flay the fox  for i will now flay thee alive   then began the poor  limousin to cry  haw  gwid maaster  haw  laord  my halp  and st  marshaw   haw  i m worried   haw  my thropple  the bean of my cragg is bruck   haw   for gauad s seck lawt my lean  mawster  waw  waw  waw   now  said  pantagruel  thou speakest naturally  and so let him go  for the poor  limousin had totally bewrayed and thoroughly conshit his breeches  which  were not deep and large enough  but round straight cannioned gregs  having  in the seat a piece like a keeling s tail  and therefore in french called   de chausses a queue de merlus   then  said pantagruel  st  alipantin  what  civet   fie  to the devil with this turnip eater  as he stinks  and so let  him go   but this hug of pantagruel s was such a terror to him all the days  of his life  and took such deep impression in his fancy  that very often   distracted with sudden affrightments  he would startle and say that  pantagruel held him by the neck   besides that  it procured him a continual  drought and desire to drink  so that after some few years he died of the  death roland  in plain english called thirst  a work of divine vengeance   showing us that which saith the philosopher and aulus gellius  that it  becometh us to speak according to the common language  and that we should   as said octavian augustus  strive to shun all strange and unknown terms  with as much heedfulness and circumspection as pilots of ships use to avoid  the rocks and banks in the sea         chapter   vii     how pantagruel came to paris  and of the choice books of the library of st   victor     after that pantagruel had studied very well at orleans  he resolved to see  the great university at paris  but  before his departure  he was informed  that there was a huge big bell at st  anian in the said town of orleans   under the ground  which had been there above two hundred and fourteen  years  for it was so great that they could not by any device get it so much  as above the ground  although they used all the means that are found in  vitruvius de architectura  albertus de re aedificatoria  euclid  theon   archimedes  and hero de ingeniis  for all that was to no purpose   wherefore  condescending heartily to the humble request of the citizens and  inhabitants of the said town  he determined to remove it to the tower that  was erected for it   with that he came to the place where it was  and  lifted it out of the ground with his little finger as easily as you would  have done a hawk s bell or bellwether s tingle tangle  but  before he would  carry it to the foresaid tower or steeple appointed for it  he would needs  make some music with it about the town  and ring it alongst all the streets  as he carried it in his hand  wherewith all the people were very glad   but  there happened one great inconveniency  for with carrying it so  and  ringing it about the streets  all the good orleans wine turned instantly   waxed flat and was spoiled  which nobody there did perceive till the night  following  for every man found himself so altered and a dry with drinking  these flat wines  that they did nothing but spit  and that as white as  malta cotton  saying  we have of the pantagruel  and our very throats are  salted   this done  he came to paris with his retinue   and at his entry  everyone came out to see him  as you know well enough that the people of  paris is sottish by nature  by b flat and b sharp  and beheld him with  great astonishment  mixed with no less fear that he would carry away the  palace into some other country  a remotis  and far from them  as his father  formerly had done the great peal of bells at our lady s church to tie about  his mare s neck   now after he had stayed there a pretty space  and studied  very well in all the seven liberal arts  he said it was a good town to live  in  but not to die  for that the grave digging rogues of st  innocent used  in frosty nights to warm their bums with dead men s bones   in his abode  there he found the library of st  victor a very stately and magnific one   especially in some books which were there  of which followeth the repertory  and catalogue  et

  chapter   viii     how pantagruel  being at paris  received letters from his father gargantua   and the copy of them     pantagruel studied very hard  as you may well conceive  and profited  accordingly  for he had an excellent understanding and notable wit   together with a capacity in memory equal to the measure of twelve oil  budgets or butts of olives   and  as he was there abiding one day  he  received a letter from his father in manner as followeth     most dear son   amongst the gifts  graces  and prerogatives  with which the  sovereign plasmator god almighty hath endowed and adorned human nature at  the beginning  that seems to me most singular and excellent by which we may  in a mortal state attain to a kind of immortality  and in the course of  this transitory life perpetuate our name and seed  which is done by a  progeny issued from us in the lawful bonds of matrimony   whereby that in  some measure is restored unto us which was taken from us by the sin of our  first parents  to whom it was said that  because they had not obeyed the  commandment of god their creator  they should die  and by death should be  brought to nought that so stately frame and plasmature wherein the man at  first had been created     but by this means of seminal propagation there   which continueth  in the  old copy   continueth in the children what was lost in the parents  and in  the grandchildren that which perished in their fathers  and so successively  until the day of the last judgment  when jesus christ shall have rendered  up to god the father his kingdom in a peaceable condition  out of all  danger and contamination of sin  for then shall cease all generations and  corruptions  and the elements leave off their continual transmutations   seeing the so much desired peace shall be attained unto and enjoyed  and  that all things shall be brought to their end and period   and  therefore   not without just and reasonable cause do i give thanks to god my saviour  and preserver  for that he hath enabled me to see my bald old age  reflourish in thy youth  for when  at his good pleasure  who rules and  governs all things  my soul shall leave this mortal habitation  i shall not  account myself wholly to die  but to pass from one place unto another   considering that  in and by that  i continue in my visible image living in  the world  visiting and conversing with people of honour  and other my good  friends  as i was wont to do   which conversation of mine  although it was  not without sin  because we are all of us trespassers  and therefore ought  continually to beseech his divine majesty to blot our transgressions out of  his memory  yet was it  by the help and grace of god  without all manner of  reproach before men     wherefore  if those qualities of the mind but shine in thee wherewith i am  endowed  as in thee remaineth the perfect image of my body  thou wilt be  esteemed by all men to be the perfect guardian and treasure of the  immortality of our name   but  if otherwise  i shall truly take but small  pleasure to see it  considering that the lesser part of me  which is the  body  would abide in thee  and the best  to wit  that which is the soul   and by which our name continues blessed amongst men  would be degenerate  and abastardized   this i do not speak out of any distrust that i have of  thy virtue  which i have heretofore already tried  but to encourage thee  yet more earnestly to proceed from good to better   and that which i now  write unto thee is not so much that thou shouldst live in this virtuous  course  as that thou shouldst rejoice in so living and having lived  and  cheer up thyself with the like resolution in time to come  to the  prosecution and accomplishment of which enterprise and generous undertaking  thou mayst easily remember how that i have spared nothing  but have so  helped thee  as if i had had no other treasure in this world but to see  thee once in my life completely well bred and accomplished  as well in  virtue  honesty  and valour  as in all liberal knowledge and civility  and  so to leave thee after my death as a mirror representing the person of me  thy father  and if not so excellent  and such in deed as i do wish thee   yet such in my desire     but although my deceased father of happy memory  grangousier  had bent his  best endeavours to make me profit in all perfection and political  knowledge  and that my labour and study was fully correspondent to  yea   went beyond his desire  nevertheless  as thou mayest well understand  the  time then was not so proper and fit for learning as it is at present   neither had i plenty of such good masters as thou hast had   for that time  was darksome  obscured with clouds of ignorance  and savouring a little of  the infelicity and calamity of the goths  who had  wherever they set  footing  destroyed all good literature  which in my age hath by the divine  goodness been restored unto its former light and dignity  and that with  such amendment and increase of the knowledge  that now hardly should i be  admitted unto the first form of the little grammar schoolboys  i say  i   who in my youthful days was  and that justly  reputed the most learned of  that age   which i do not speak in vain boasting  although i might lawfully  do it in writing unto thee  in verification whereof thou hast the authority  of marcus tullius in his book of old age  and the sentence of plutarch in  the book entitled how a man may praise himself without envy  but to give  thee an emulous encouragement to strive yet further     now is it that the minds of men are qualified with all manner of  discipline  and the old sciences revived which for many ages were extinct   now it is that the learned languages are to their pristine purity restored   viz   greek  without which a man may be ashamed to account himself a  scholar  hebrew  arabic  chaldaean  and latin   printing likewise is now in  use  so elegant and so correct that better cannot be imagined  although it  was found out but in my time by divine inspiration  as by a diabolical  suggestion on the other side was the invention of ordnance   all the world  is full of knowing men  of most learned schoolmasters  and vast libraries   and it appears to me as a truth  that neither in plato s time  nor  cicero s  nor papinian s  there was ever such conveniency for studying as  we see at this day there is   nor must any adventure henceforward to come  in public  or present himself in company  that hath not been pretty well  polished in the shop of minerva   i see robbers  hangmen  freebooters   tapsters  ostlers  and such like  of the very rubbish of the people  more  learned now than the doctors and preachers were in my time     what shall i say   the very women and children have aspired to this praise  and celestial manner of good learning   yet so it is that  in the age i am  now of  i have been constrained to learn the greek tongue  which i  contemned not like cato  but had not the leisure in my younger years to  attend the study of it  and take much delight in the reading of plutarch s  morals  the pleasant dialogues of plato  the monuments of pausanias  and  the antiquities of athenaeus  in waiting on the hour wherein god my creator  shall call me and command me to depart from this earth and transitory  pilgrimage   wherefore  my son  i admonish thee to employ thy youth to  profit as well as thou canst  both in thy studies and in virtue   thou art  at paris  where the laudable examples of many brave men may stir up thy  mind to gallant actions  and hast likewise for thy tutor and pedagogue the  learned epistemon  who by his lively and vocal documents may instruct thee  in the arts and sciences     i intend  and will have it so  that thou learn the languages perfectly   first of all the greek  as quintilian will have it  secondly  the latin   and then the hebrew  for the holy scripture sake  and then the chaldee and  arabic likewise  and that thou frame thy style in greek in imitation of  plato  and for the latin after cicero   let there be no history which thou  shalt not have ready in thy memory  unto the prosecuting of which design   books of cosmography will be very conducible and help thee much   of the  liberal arts of geometry  arithmetic  and music  i gave thee some taste  when thou wert yet little  and not above five or six years old   proceed  further in them  and learn the remainder if thou canst   as for astronomy   study all the rules thereof   let pass  nevertheless  the divining and  judicial astrology  and the art of lullius  as being nothing else but plain  abuses and vanities   as for the civil law  of that i would have thee to  know the texts by heart  and then to confer them with philosophy     now  in matter of the knowledge of the works of nature  i would have thee  to study that exactly  and that so there be no sea  river  nor fountain  of  which thou dost not know the fishes  all the fowls of the air  all the  several kinds of shrubs and trees  whether in forests or orchards  all the  sorts of herbs and flowers that grow upon the ground  all the various  metals that are hid within the bowels of the earth  together with all the  diversity of precious stones that are to be seen in the orient and south  parts of the world   let nothing of all these be hidden from thee   then  fail not most carefully to peruse the books of the greek  arabian  and  latin physicians  not despising the talmudists and cabalists  and by  frequent anatomies get thee the perfect knowledge of the other world   called the microcosm  which is man   and at some hours of the day apply thy  mind to the study of the holy scriptures  first in greek  the new  testament  with the epistles of the apostles  and then the old testament in  hebrew   in brief  let me see thee an abyss and bottomless pit of  knowledge  for from henceforward  as thou growest great and becomest a man   thou must part from this tranquillity and rest of study  thou must learn  chivalry  warfare  and the exercises of the field  the better thereby to  defend my house and our friends  and to succour and protect them at all  their needs against the invasion and assaults of evildoers     furthermore  i will that very shortly thou try how much thou hast profited   which thou canst not better do than by maintaining publicly theses and  conclusions in all arts against all persons whatsoever  and by haunting the  company of learned men  both at paris and otherwhere   but because  as the  wise man solomon saith  wisdom entereth not into a malicious mind  and that  knowledge without conscience is but the ruin of the soul  it behoveth thee  to serve  to love  to fear god  and on him to cast all thy thoughts and all  thy hope  and by faith formed in charity to cleave unto him  so that thou  mayst never be separated from him by thy sins   suspect the abuses of the  world   set not thy heart upon vanity  for this life is transitory  but the  word of the lord endureth for ever   be serviceable to all thy neighbours   and love them as thyself   reverence thy preceptors   shun the conversation  of those whom thou desirest not to resemble  and receive not in vain the  graces which god hath bestowed upon thee   and  when thou shalt see that  thou hast attained to all the knowledge that is to be acquired in that  part  return unto me  that i may see thee and give thee my blessing before  i die   my son  the peace and grace of our lord be with thee   amen         thy father gargantua       from utopia the   th day of the month of march     these letters being received and read  pantagruel plucked up his heart   took a fresh courage to him  and was inflamed with a desire to profit in  his studies more than ever  so that if you had seen him  how he took pains   and how he advanced in learning  you would have said that the vivacity of  his spirit amidst the books was like a great fire amongst dry wood  so  active it was  vigorous and indefatigable         chapter   ix     how pantagruel found panurge  whom he loved all his lifetime     one day  as pantagruel was taking a walk without the city  towards st   anthony s abbey  discoursing and philosophating with his own servants and  some other scholars   he  met with a young man of very comely stature and  surpassing handsome in all the lineaments of his body  but in several parts  thereof most pitifully wounded  in such bad equipage in matter of his  apparel  which was but tatters and rags  and every way so far out of order  that he seemed to have been a fighting with mastiff dogs  from whose fury  he had made an escape  or to say better  he looked  in the condition  wherein he then was  like an apple gatherer of the country of perche     as far off as pantagruel saw him  he said to those that stood by  do you  see that man there  who is a coming hither upon the road from charenton  bridge   by my faith  he is only poor in fortune  for i may assure you that  by his physiognomy it appeareth that nature hath extracted him from some  rich and noble race  and that too much curiosity hath thrown him upon  adventures which possibly have reduced him to this indigence  want  and  penury   now as he was just amongst them  pantagruel said unto him  let me  entreat you  friend  that you may be pleased to stop here a little and  answer me to that which i shall ask you  and i am confident you will not  think your time ill bestowed  for i have an extreme desire  according to my  ability  to give you some supply in this distress wherein i see you are   because i do very much commiserate your case  which truly moves me to great  pity   therefore  my friend  tell me who you are  whence you come  whither  you go  what you desire  and what your name is   the companion answered him  in the german  the first edition reads  dutch    tongue  thus      junker  gott geb euch gluck und heil

 i  have no skill in that gibberish of yours  therefore  if you would have us  to understand you  speak to us in some other language   then did the droll  answer him thus      albarildim gotfano

you understand none of  this  said pantagruel to the company   i believe  said epistemon  that this  is the language of the antipodes  and such a hard one that the devil  himself knows not what to

again      signor mio  voi vedete per essempio  che la cornamusa non suona mai   s ella non ha il ventre pieno   cosi io parimente non vi saprei contare le  mie fortune  se prima il tribulato ventre

other  and nothing of either   then said panurge      lord  if you be so virtuous of intelligence as you be naturally relieved  to the body  you should have pity of me   for nature hath made us equal   but fortune hath some exalted and others deprived  nevertheless is virtue  often deprived and the virtuous men despised  for before the last end none  is good     the following is the passage as it stands in the first edition   urquhart seems to have rendered rabelais  indifferent english into worse  scotch  and this  with probably the use of contractions in his ms   or  the  oddness  of

sounds very like it   and  as he was about to  have begun some purpose  the companion said      jam toties vos per sacra  perque deos deasque omnes obtestatus sum  ut si  quae vos pietas permovet  egestatem meam solaremini  nec hilum proficio  clamans et ejulans   sinite  quaeso  sinite  viri impii  quo me fata vocant  abire  nec ultra vanis vestris interpellationibus obtundatis  memores  veteris illius adagii  quo venter famelicus auriculis carere dicitur    well  my friend  said pantagruel  but cannot you speak french   that i can  do  sir  very well  said the companion  god be thanked   it is my natural  language and mother tongue  for i was born and bred in my younger years in  the garden of france  to wit  touraine   then  said pantagruel  tell us  what is your name  and from whence you are come  for  by my faith  i have  already stamped in my mind such a deep impression of love towards you   that  if you will condescend unto my will  you shall not depart out of my  company  and you and i shall make up another couple of friends such as  aeneas and achates were   sir  said the companion  my true and proper  christian name is panurge  and now i come out of turkey  to which country i  was carried away prisoner at that time when they went to metelin with a  mischief   and willingly would i relate unto you my fortunes  which are  more wonderful than those of ulysses were  but  seeing that it pleaseth you  to retain me with you  i most heartily accept of the offer  protesting  never to leave you should you go to all the devils in hell   we shall have  therefore more leisure at another time  and a fitter opportunity wherein to  report them  for at this present i am in a very urgent necessity to feed   my teeth are sharp  my belly empty  my throat dry  and my stomach fierce  and burning  all is ready   if you will but set me to work  it will be as  good as a balsamum for sore eyes to see me gulch and raven it   for god s  sake  give order for it   then pantagruel commanded that they should carry  him home and provide him good store of victuals  which being done  he ate  very well that evening  and  capon like  went early to bed  then slept  until dinner time the next day  so that he made but three steps and one  leap from the bed to the board         chapter   x     how pantagruel judged so equitably of a controversy  which was wonderfully  obscure and difficult  that  by reason of his just decree therein  he was  reputed to have a most admirable judgment     pantagruel  very well remembering his father s letter and admonitions   would one day make trial of his knowledge   thereupon  in all the  carrefours  that is  throughout all the four quarters  streets  and corners  of the city  he set up conclusions to the number of nine thousand seven  hundred sixty and four  in all manner of learning  touching in them the  hardest doubts that are in any science   and first of all  in the fodder  street he held dispute against all the regents or fellows of colleges   artists or masters of arts  and orators  and did so gallantly that he  overthrew them and set them all upon their tails   he went afterwards to  the sorbonne  where he maintained argument against all the theologians or  divines  for the space of six weeks  from four o clock in the morning until  six in the evening  except an interval of two hours to refresh themselves  and take their repast   and at this were present the greatest part of the  lords of the court  the masters of requests  presidents  counsellors  those  of the accompts  secretaries  advocates  and others  as also the sheriffs  of the said town  with the physicians and professors of the canon law   amongst which  it is to be remarked  that the greatest part were stubborn  jades  and in their opinions obstinate  but he took such course with them  that  for all their ergoes and fallacies  he put their backs to the wall   gravelled them in the deepest questions  and made it visibly appear to the  world that  compared to him  they were but monkeys and a knot of muffled  calves   whereupon everybody began to keep a bustling noise and talk of his  so marvellous knowledge  through all degrees of persons of both sexes  even  to the very laundresses  brokers  roast meat sellers  penknife makers  and  others  who  when he passed along in the street  would say  this is he  in  which he took delight  as demosthenes  the prince of greek orators  did   when an old crouching wife  pointing at him with her fingers  said  that is  the man     now at this same very time there was a process or suit in law depending in  court between two great lords  of which one was called my lord kissbreech   plaintiff of one side  and the other my lord suckfist  defendant of the  other  whose controversy was so high and difficult in law that the court of  parliament could make nothing of it   and therefore  by the commandment of  the king  there were assembled four of the greatest and most learned of all  the parliaments of france  together with the great council  and all the  principal regents of the universities  not only of france  but of england  also and italy  such as jason  philippus decius  petrus de petronibus  and  a rabble of other old rabbinists   who being thus met together  after they  had thereupon consulted for the space of six and forty weeks  finding that  they could not fasten their teeth in it  nor with such clearness understand  the case as that they might in any manner of way be able to right it  or  take up the difference betwixt the two aforesaid parties  it did so  grievously vex them that they most villainously conshit themselves for  shame   in this great extremity one amongst them  named du douhet  the  learnedest of all  and more expert and prudent than any of the rest  whilst  one day they were thus at their wits  end  all to be dunced and  philogrobolized in their brains  said unto them  we have been here  my  masters  a good long space  without doing anything else than trifle away  both our time and money  and can nevertheless find neither brim nor bottom  in this matter  for the more we study about it the less we understand  therein  which is a great shame and disgrace to us  and a heavy burden to  our consciences  yea  such that in my opinion we shall not rid ourselves of  it without dishonour  unless we take some other course  for we do nothing  but dote in our consultations     see  therefore  what i have thought upon   you have heard much talking of  that worthy personage named master pantagruel  who hath been found to be  learned above the capacity of this present age  by the proofs he gave in  those great disputations which he held publicly against all men   my  opinion is  that we send for him to confer with him about this business   for never any man will encompass the bringing of it to an end if he do it  not     hereunto all the counsellors and doctors willingly agreed  and according to  that their result having instantly sent for him  they entreated him to be  pleased to canvass the process and sift it thoroughly  that  after a deep  search and narrow examination of all the points thereof  he might forthwith  make the report unto them such as he shall think good in true and legal  knowledge   to this effect they delivered into his hands the bags wherein  were the writs and pancarts concerning that suit  which for bulk and weight  were almost enough to lade four great couillard or stoned asses  but  pantagruel said unto them  are the two lords between whom this debate and  process is yet living   it was answered him  yes   to what a devil  then   said he  serve so many paltry heaps and bundles of papers and copies which  you give me   is it not better to hear their controversy from their own  mouths whilst they are face to face before us  than to read these vile  fopperies  which are nothing but trumperies  deceits  diabolical cozenages  of cepola  pernicious slights and subversions of equity   for i am sure  that you  and all those through whose hands this process has passed  have  by your devices added what you could to it pro et contra in such sort that   although their difference perhaps was clear and easy enough to determine at  first  you have obscured it and made it more intricate by the frivolous   sottish  unreasonable  and foolish reasons and opinions of accursius   baldus  bartolus  de castro  de imola  hippolytus  panormo  bertachin   alexander  curtius  and those other old mastiffs  who never understood the  least law of the pandects  they being but mere blockheads and great tithe  calves  ignorant of all that which was needful for the understanding of the  laws  for  as it is most certain  they had not the knowledge either of the  greek or latin tongue  but only of the gothic and barbarian   the laws   nevertheless  were first taken from the greeks  according to the testimony  of ulpian  l  poster  de origine juris  which we likewise may perceive by  that all the laws are full of greek words and sentences   and then we find  that they are reduced into a latin style the most elegant and ornate that  whole language is able to afford  without excepting that of any that ever  wrote therein  nay  not of sallust  varro  cicero  seneca  titus livius   nor quintilian   how then could these old dotards be able to understand  aright the text of the laws who never in their time had looked upon a good  latin book  as doth evidently enough appear by the rudeness of their style   which is fitter for a chimney sweeper  or for a cook or a scullion  than  for a jurisconsult and doctor in the laws     furthermore  seeing the laws are excerpted out of the middle of moral and  natural philosophy  how should these fools have understood it  that have   by g    studied less in philosophy than my mule   in respect of human  learning and the knowledge of antiquities and history they were truly laden  with those faculties as a toad is with feathers   and yet of all this the  laws are so full that without it they cannot be understood  as i intend  more fully to show unto you in a peculiar treatise which on that purpose i  am about to publish   therefore  if you will that i take any meddling in  this process  first cause all these papers to be burnt  secondly  make the  two gentlemen come personally before me  and afterwards  when i shall have  heard them  i will tell you my opinion freely without any feignedness or  dissimulation whatsoever     some amongst them did contradict this motion  as you know that in all  companies there are more fools than wise men  and that the greater part  always surmounts the better  as saith titus livius in speaking of the  carthaginians   but the foresaid du douhet held the contrary opinion   maintaining that pantagruel had said well  and what was right  in affirming  that these records  bills of inquest  replies  rejoinders  exceptions   depositions  and other such diableries of truth entangling writs  were but  engines wherewith to overthrow justice and unnecessarily to prolong such  suits as did depend before them  and that  therefore  the devil would carry  them all away to hell if they did not take another course and proceeded not  in times coming according to the prescripts of evangelical and  philosophical equity   in fine  all the papers were burnt  and the two  gentlemen summoned and personally convented   at whose appearance before  the court pantagruel said unto them  are you they that have this great  difference betwixt you   yes  my lord  said they   which of you  said  pantagruel  is the plaintiff   it is i  said my lord kissbreech   go to   then  my friend  said he  and relate your matter unto me from point to  point  according to the real truth  or else  by cock s body  if i find you  to lie so much as in one word  i will make you shorter by the head  and  take it from off your shoulders to show others by your example that in  justice and judgment men ought to speak nothing but the truth   therefore  take heed you do not add nor impair anything in the narration of your case   begin         chapter   xi     how the lords of kissbreech and suckfist did plead before pantagruel  without an attorney     then began kissbreech in manner as followeth   my lord  it is true that a  good woman of my house carried eggs to the market to sell   be covered   kissbreech  said pantagruel   thanks to you  my lord  said the lord  kissbreech  but to the purpose   there passed betwixt the two tropics the  sum of threepence towards the zenith and a halfpenny  forasmuch as the  riphaean mountains had been that year oppressed with a great sterility of  counterfeit gudgeons and shows without substance  by means of the babbling  tattle and fond fibs seditiously raised between the gibblegabblers and  accursian gibberish mongers for the rebellion of the switzers  who had  assembled themselves to the full number of the bumbees and myrmidons to go  a handsel getting on the first day of the new year  at that very time when  they give brewis to the oxen and deliver the key of the coals to the  country girls for serving in of the oats to the dogs   all the night long  they did nothing else  keeping their hands still upon the pot  but  despatch  both on foot and horseback  leaden sealed writs or letters  to  wit  papal commissions commonly called bulls  to stop the boats  for the  tailors and seamsters would have made of the stolen shreds and clippings a  goodly sagbut to cover the face of the ocean  which then was great with  child of a potful of cabbage  according to the opinion of the  hay bundle makers   but the physicians said that by the urine they  could discern no manifest sign of the bustard s pace  nor how to eat  double tongued mattocks with mustard  unless the lords and gentlemen of the  court should be pleased to give by b mol express command to the pox not to  run about any longer in gleaning up of coppersmiths and tinkers  for the  jobbernolls had already a pretty good beginning in their dance of the  british jig called the estrindore  to a perfect diapason  with one foot in  the fire  and their head in the middle  as goodman ragot was wont to say     ha  my masters  god moderates all things  and disposeth of them at his  pleasure  so that against unlucky fortune a carter broke his frisking whip   which was all the wind instrument he had   this was done at his return from  the little paltry town  even then when master antitus of cressplots was  licentiated  and had passed his degrees in all dullery and blockishness   according to this sentence of the canonists  beati dunces  quoniam ipsi  stumblaverunt   but that which makes lent to be so high  by st  fiacre of  bry  is for nothing else but that the pentecost never comes but to my cost   yet  on afore there  ho  a little rain stills a great wind  and we must  think so  seeing that the sergeant hath propounded the matter so far above  my reach  that the clerks and secondaries could not with the benefit  thereof lick their fingers  feathered with ganders  so orbicularly as they  were wont in other things to do   and we do manifestly see that everyone  acknowledgeth himself to be in the error wherewith another hath been  charged  reserving only those cases whereby we are obliged to take an  ocular inspection in a perspective glass of these things towards the place  in the chimney where hangeth the sign of the wine of forty girths  which  have been always accounted very necessary for the number of twenty pannels  and pack saddles of the bankrupt protectionaries of five years  respite   howsoever  at least  he that would not let fly the fowl before the  cheesecakes ought in law to have discovered his reason why not  for the  memory is often lost with a wayward shoeing   well  god keep theobald  mitain from all danger   then said pantagruel  hold there   ho  my friend   soft and fair  speak at leisure and soberly without putting yourself in  choler   i understand the case   go on   now then  my lord  said  kissbreech  the foresaid good woman saying her gaudez and audi nos  could  not cover herself with a treacherous backblow  ascending by the wounds and  passions of the privileges of the universities  unless by the virtue of a  warming pan she had angelically fomented every part of her body in covering  them with a hedge of garden beds  then giving in a swift unavoidable thirst   thrust  very near to the place where they sell the old rags whereof the  painters of flanders make great use when they are about neatly to clap on  shoes on grasshoppers  locusts  cigals  and such like fly fowls  so strange  to us that i am wonderfully astonished why the world doth not lay  seeing  it is so good to hatch     here the lord of suckfist would have interrupted him and spoken somewhat   whereupon pantagruel said unto him  st  by st  anthony s belly  doth it  become thee to speak without command   i sweat here with the extremity of  labour and exceeding toil i take to understand the proceeding of your  mutual difference  and yet thou comest to trouble and disquiet me   peace   in the devil s name  peace   thou shalt be permitted to speak thy bellyful  when this man hath done  and no sooner   go on  said he to kissbreech   speak calmly  and do not overheat yourself with too much haste     i perceiving  then  said kissbreech  that the pragmatical sanction did make  no mention of it  and that the holy pope to everyone gave liberty to fart  at his own ease  if that the blankets had no streaks wherein the liars were  to be crossed with a ruffian like crew  and  the rainbow being newly  sharpened at milan to bring forth larks  gave his full consent that the  good woman should tread down the heel of the hip gut pangs  by virtue of a  solemn protestation put in by the little testiculated or codsted fishes   which  to tell the truth  were at that time very necessary for  understanding the syntax and construction of old boots   therefore john  calf  her cousin gervais once removed with a log from the woodstack  very  seriously advised her not to put herself into the hazard of quagswagging in  the lee  to be scoured with a buck of linen clothes till first she had  kindled the paper   this counsel she laid hold on  because he desired her  to take nothing and throw out  for non de ponte vadit  qui cum sapientia  cadit   matters thus standing  seeing the masters of the chamber of  accompts or members of that committee did not fully agree amongst  themselves in casting up the number of the almany whistles  whereof were  framed those spectacles for princes which have been lately printed at  antwerp  i must needs think that it makes a bad return of the writ  and  that the adverse party is not to be believed  in sacer verbo dotis   for  that  having a great desire to obey the pleasure of the king  i armed  myself from toe to top with belly furniture  of the soles of good  venison pasties  to go see how my grape gatherers and vintagers had pinked  and cut full of small holes their high coped caps  to lecher it the better   and play at in and in   and indeed the time was very dangerous in coming  from the fair  in so far that many trained bowmen were cast at the muster  and quite rejected  although the chimney tops were high enough  according to  the proportion of the windgalls in the legs of horses  or of the malanders   which in the esteem of expert farriers is no better disease  or else the  story of ronypatifam or lamibaudichon  interpreted by some to be the tale of  a tub or of a roasted horse  savours of apocrypha  and is not an authentic  history   and by this means there was that year great abundance  throughout  all the country of artois  of tawny buzzing beetles  to the no small profit  of the gentlemen great stick faggot carriers  when they did eat without  disdaining the cocklicranes  till their belly was like to crack with it  again   as for my own part  such is my christian charity towards my  neighbours  that i could wish from my heart everyone had as good a voice  it  would make us play the better at the tennis and the balloon   and truly  my  lord  to express the real truth without dissimulation  i cannot but say that  those petty subtle devices which are found out in the etymologizing of  pattens would descend more easily into the river of seine  to serve for ever  at the millers  bridge upon the said water  as it was heretofore decreed by  the king of the canarians  according to the sentence or judgment given  thereupon  which is to be seen in the registry and records within the  clerk s office of this house     and  therefore  my lord  i do most humbly require  that by your lordship  there may be said and declared upon the case what is reasonable  with  costs  damages  and interests   then said pantagruel  my friend  is this  all you have to say   kissbreech answered  yes  my lord  for i have told  all the tu autem  and have not varied at all upon mine honour in so much as  one single word   you then  said pantagruel  my lord of suckfist  say what  you will  and be brief  without omitting  nevertheless  anything that may  serve to the purpose         chapter   xii     how the lord of suckfist pleaded before pantagruel     then began the lord suckfist in manner as followeth   my lord  and you my  masters  if the iniquity of men were as easily seen in categorical judgment  as we can discern flies in a milkpot  the world s four oxen had not been so  eaten up with rats  nor had so many ears upon the earth been nibbled away  so scurvily   for although all that my adversary hath spoken be of a very  soft and downy truth  in so much as concerns the letter and history of the  factum  yet nevertheless the crafty slights  cunning subtleties  sly  cozenages  and little troubling entanglements are hid under the rosepot   the common cloak and cover of all fraudulent deceits     should i endure that  when i am eating my pottage equal with the best  and  that without either thinking or speaking any manner of ill  they rudely  come to vex  trouble  and perplex my brains with that antique proverb which  saith       who in his pottage eating drinks will not     when he is dead and buried  see one jot     and  good lady  how many great captains have we seen in the day of battle   when in open field the sacrament was distributed in luncheons of the  sanctified bread of the confraternity  the more honestly to nod their  heads  play on the lute  and crack with their tails  to make pretty little  platform leaps in keeping level by the ground   but now the world is  unshackled from the corners of the packs of leicester   one flies out  lewdly and becomes debauched  another  likewise  five  four  and two  and  that at such random that  if the court take not some course therein  it  will make as bad a season in matter of gleaning this year as ever it made   or it will make goblets   if any poor creature go to the stoves to  illuminate his muzzle with a cowsherd or to buy winter boots  and that the  sergeants passing by  or those of the watch  happen to receive the  decoction of a clyster or the fecal matter of a close stool upon their  rustling wrangling clutter keeping masterships  should any because of that  make bold to clip the shillings and testers and fry the wooden dishes   sometimes  when we think one thing  god does another  and when the sun is  wholly set all beasts are in the shade   let me never be believed again  if  i do not gallantly prove it by several people who have seen the light of  the day     in the year thirty and six  buying a dutch curtail  which was a middle sized  horse  both high and short  of a wool good enough and dyed in grain  as the  goldsmiths assured me  although the notary put an  c  in it  i told really  that i was not a clerk of so much learning as to snatch at the moon with my  teeth  but  as for the butter firkin where vulcanian deeds and evidences  were sealed  the rumour was  and the report thereof went current  that  salt beef will make one find the way to the wine without a candle  though it  were hid in the bottom of a collier s sack  and that with his drawers on he  were mounted on a barbed horse furnished with a fronstal  and such arms   thighs  and leg pieces as are requisite for the well frying and broiling of  a swaggering sauciness   here is a sheep s head  and it is well they make a  proverb of this  that it is good to see black cows in burnt wood when one  attains to the enjoyment of his love   i had a consultation upon this point  with my masters the clerks  who for resolution concluded in frisesomorum  that there is nothing like to mowing in the summer  and sweeping clean away  in water  well garnished with paper  ink  pens  and penknives  of lyons upon  the river of rhone  dolopym dolopof  tarabin tarabas  tut  prut  pish  for   incontinently after that armour begins to smell of garlic  the rust will go  near to eat the liver  not of him that wears it  and then do they nothing  else but withstand others  courses  and wryneckedly set up their bristles   gainst one another  in lightly passing over their afternoon s sleep  and  this is that which maketh salt so dear  my lords  believe not when the said  good woman had with birdlime caught the shoveler fowl  the better before a  sergeant s witness to deliver the younger son s portion to him  that the  sheep s pluck or hog s haslet did dodge and shrink back in the usurers   purses  or that there could be anything better to preserve one from the  cannibals than to take a rope of onions  knit with three hundred turnips   and a little of a calf s chaldern of the best allay that the alchemists have  provided   and  that they daub and do over with clay  as also calcinate and  burn to dust these pantoufles  muff in muff out  mouflin mouflard  with the  fine sauce of the juice of the rabble rout  whilst they hide themselves in  some petty mouldwarphole  saving always the little slices of bacon   now  if  the dice will not favour you with any other throw but ambes ace and the  chance of three at the great end  mark well the ace  then take me your dame   settle her in a corner of the bed  and whisk me her up drilletrille  there   there  toureloura la la  which when you have done  take a hearty draught of  the best  despicando grenovillibus  in despite of the frogs  whose fair  coarse bebuskined stockings shall be set apart for the little green geese or  mewed goslings  which  fattened in a coop  take delight to sport themselves  at the wagtail game  waiting for the beating of the metal and heating of the  wax by the slavering drivellers of consolation     very true it is  that the four oxen which are in debate  and whereof  mention was made  were somewhat short in memory   nevertheless  to  understand the game aright  they feared neither the cormorant nor mallard  of savoy  which put the good people of my country in great hope that their  children some time should become very skilful in algorism   therefore is  it  that by a law rubric and special sentence thereof  that we cannot fail  to take the wolf if we make our hedges higher than the windmill  whereof  somewhat was spoken by the plaintiff   but the great devil did envy it  and  by that means put the high dutches far behind  who played the devils in  swilling down and tippling at the good liquor  trink  mein herr  trink   trink  by two of my table men in the corner point i have gained the lurch   for it is not probable  nor is there any appearance of truth in this  saying  that at paris upon a little bridge the hen is proportionable  and  were they as copped and high crested as marsh whoops  if veritably they did  not sacrifice the printer s pumpet balls at moreb  with a new edge set upon  them by text letters or those of a swift writing hand  it is all one to me   so that the headband of the book breed not moths or worms in it   and put  the case that  at the coupling together of the buckhounds  the little  puppies shall have waxed proud before the notary could have given an  account of the serving of his writ by the cabalistic art  it will  necessarily follow  under correction of the better judgment of the court   that six acres of meadow ground of the greatest breadth will make three  butts of fine ink  without paying ready money  considering that  at the  funeral of king charles  we might have had the fathom in open market for  one and two  that is  deuce ace   this i may affirm with a safe conscience   upon my oath of wool     and i see ordinarily in all good bagpipes  that  when they go to the  counterfeiting of the chirping of small birds  by swinging a broom three  times about a chimney  and putting his name upon record  they do nothing  but bend a crossbow backwards  and wind a horn  if perhaps it be too hot   and that  by making it fast to a rope he was to draw  immediately after the  sight of the letters  the cows were restored to him   such another sentence  after the homeliest manner was pronounced in the seventeenth year  because  of the bad government of louzefougarouse  whereunto it may please the court  to have regard   i desire to be rightly understood  for truly  i say not  but that in all equity  and with an upright conscience  those may very well  be dispossessed who drink holy water as one would do a weaver s shuttle   whereof suppositories are made to those that will not resign  but on the  terms of ell and tell and giving of one thing for another   tunc  my lords   quid juris pro minoribus   for the common custom of the salic law is such   that the first incendiary or firebrand of sedition that flays the cow and  wipes his nose in a full concert of music without blowing in the cobbler s  stitches  should in the time of the nightmare sublimate the penury of his  member by moss gathered when people are like to founder themselves at the  mess at midnight  to give the estrapade to these white wines of anjou that  do the fear of the leg in lifting it by horsemen called the gambetta  and  that neck to neck after the fashion of brittany  concluding as before with  costs  damages  and interests     after that the lord of suckfist had ended  pantagruel said to the lord of  kissbreech  my friend  have you a mind to make any reply to what is said   no  my lord  answered kissbreech  for i have spoke all i intended  and  nothing but the truth   therefore  put an end for god s sake to our  difference  for we are here at great charge         chapter   xiii     how pantagruel gave judgment upon the difference of the two lords     then pantagruel  rising up  assembled all the presidents  counsellors  and  doctors that were there  and said unto them  come now  my masters  you have  heard vivae vocis oraculo  the controversy that is in question  what do you  think of it   they answered him  we have indeed heard it  but have not  understood the devil so much as one circumstance of the case  and therefore  we beseech you  una voce  and in courtesy request you that you would give  sentence as you think good  and  ex nunc prout ex tunc  we are satisfied  with it  and do ratify it with our full consents   well  my masters  said  pantagruel  seeing you are so pleased  i will do it  but i do not truly  find the case so difficult as you make it   your paragraph caton  the law  frater  the law gallus  the law quinque pedum  the law vinum  the law si  dominus  the law mater  the law mulier bona  to the law si quis  the law  pomponius  the law fundi  the law emptor  the law praetor  the law  venditor  and a great many others  are far more intricate in my opinion   after he had spoke this  he walked a turn or two about the hall  plodding  very profoundly  as one may think  for he did groan like an ass whilst they  girth him too hard  with the very intensiveness of considering how he was  bound in conscience to do right to both parties  without varying or  accepting of persons   then he returned  sat down  and began to pronounce  sentence as followeth     having seen  heard  calculated  and well considered of the difference  between the lords of kissbreech and suckfist  the court saith unto them   that in regard of the sudden quaking  shivering  and hoariness of the  flickermouse  bravely declining from the estival solstice  to attempt by  private means the surprisal of toyish trifles in those who are a little  unwell for having taken a draught too much  through the lewd demeanour and  vexation of the beetles that inhabit the diarodal  diarhomal  climate of an  hypocritical ape on horseback  bending a crossbow backwards  the plaintiff  truly had just cause to calfet  or with oakum to stop the chinks of the  galleon which the good woman blew up with wind  having one foot shod and  the other bare  reimbursing and restoring to him  low and stiff in his  conscience  as many bladder nuts and wild pistaches as there is of hair in  eighteen cows  with as much for the embroiderer  and so much for that   he  is likewise declared innocent of the case privileged from the knapdardies   into the danger whereof it was thought he had incurred  because he could  not jocundly and with fulness of freedom untruss and dung  by the decision  of a pair of gloves perfumed with the scent of bum gunshot at the  walnut tree taper  as is usual in his country of mirebalais   slacking   therefore  the topsail  and letting go the bowline with the brazen bullets   wherewith the mariners did by way of protestation bake in pastemeat great  store of pulse interquilted with the dormouse  whose hawk s bells were made  with a puntinaria  after the manner of hungary or flanders lace  and which  his brother in law carried in a pannier  lying near to three chevrons or  bordered gules  whilst he was clean out of heart  drooping and crestfallen  by the too narrow sifting  canvassing  and curious examining of the matter  in the angularly doghole of nasty scoundrels  from whence we shoot at the  vermiformal popinjay with the flap made of a foxtail     but in that he chargeth the defendant that he was a botcher  cheese eater   and trimmer of man s flesh embalmed  which in the arsiversy swagfall tumble  was not found true  as by the defendant was very well discussed     the court  therefore  doth condemn and amerce him in three porringers of  curds  well cemented and closed together  shining like pearls  and  codpieced after the fashion of the country  to be paid unto the said  defendant about the middle of august in may   but  on the other part  the  defendant shall be bound to furnish him with hay and stubble for stopping  the caltrops of his throat  troubled and impulregafized  with gabardines  garbled shufflingly  and friends as before  without costs and for cause     which sentence being pronounced  the two parties departed both contented  with the decree  which was a thing almost incredible   for it never came to  pass since the great rain  nor shall the like occur in thirteen jubilees  hereafter  that two parties contradictorily contending in judgment be  equally satisfied and well pleased with the definitive sentence   as for  the counsellors and other doctors in the law that were there present  they  were all so ravished with admiration at the more than human wisdom of  pantagruel  which they did most clearly perceive to be in him by his so  accurate decision of this so difficult and thorny cause  that their spirits  with the extremity of the rapture being elevated above the pitch of  actuating the organs of the body  they fell into a trance and sudden  ecstasy  wherein they stayed for the space of three long hours  and had  been so as yet in that condition had not some good people fetched store of  vinegar and rose water to bring them again unto their former sense and  understanding  for the which god be praised everywhere   and so be it         chapter   xiv     how panurge related the manner how he escaped out of the hands of the  turks     the great wit and judgment of pantagruel was immediately after this made  known unto all the world by setting forth his praises in print  and putting  upon record this late wonderful proof he hath given thereof amongst the  rolls of the crown and registers of the palace  in such sort that everybody  began to say that solomon  who by a probable guess only  without any  further certainty  caused the child to be delivered to its own mother   showed never in his time such a masterpiece of wisdom as the good  pantagruel hath done   happy are we  therefore  that have him in our  country   and indeed they would have made him thereupon master of the  requests and president in the court  but he refused all  very graciously  thanking them for their offer   for  said he  there is too much slavery in  these offices  and very hardly can they be saved that do exercise them   considering the great corruption that is amongst men   which makes me  believe  if the empty seats of angels be not filled with other kind of  people than those  we shall not have the final judgment these seven  thousand  sixty and seven jubilees yet to come  and so cusanus will be  deceived in his conjecture   remember that i have told you of it  and given  you fair advertisement in time and place convenient     but if you have any hogsheads of good wine  i willingly will accept of a  present of that   which they very heartily did do  in sending him of the  best that was in the city  and he drank reasonably well  but poor panurge  bibbed and boused of it most villainously  for he was as dry as a  red herring  as lean as a rake  and  like a poor  lank  slender cat  walked  gingerly as if he had trod upon eggs   so that by someone being admonished   in the midst of his draught of a large deep bowl full of excellent claret  with these words  fair and softly  gossip  you suck up as if you were mad    i give thee to the devil  said he  thou hast not found here thy little  tippling sippers of paris  that drink no more than the little bird called a  spink or chaffinch  and never take in their beakful of liquor till they be  bobbed on the tails after the manner of the sparrows   o companion  if i  could mount up as well as i can get down  i had been long ere this above  the sphere of the moon with empedocles   but i cannot tell what a devil  this means   this wine is so good and delicious  that the more i drink  thereof the more i am athirst   i believe that the shadow of my master  pantagruel engendereth the altered and thirsty men  as the moon doth the  catarrhs and defluxions   at which word the company began to laugh  which  pantagruel perceiving  said  panurge  what is that which moves you to laugh  so   sir  said he  i was telling them that these devilish turks are very  unhappy in that they never drink one drop of wine  and that though there  were no other harm in all mahomet s alcoran  yet for this one base point of  abstinence from wine which therein is commanded  i would not submit myself  unto their law   but now tell me  said pantagruel  how you escaped out of  their hands  by g    sir  said panurge  i will not lie to you in one word     the rascally turks had broached me upon a spit all larded like a rabbit   for i was so dry and meagre that otherwise of my flesh they would have made  but very bad meat  and in this manner began to roast me alive   as they  were thus roasting me  i recommended myself unto the divine grace  having  in my mind the good st  lawrence  and always hoped in god that he would  deliver me out of this torment   which came to pass  and that very  strangely   for as i did commit myself with all my heart unto god  crying   lord god  help me   lord god  save me   lord god  take me out of this pain  and hellish torture  wherein these traitorous dogs detain me for my  sincerity in the maintenance of thy law   the roaster or turnspit fell  asleep by the divine will  or else by the virtue of some good mercury  who  cunningly brought argus into a sleep for all his hundred eyes   when i saw  that he did no longer turn me in roasting  i looked upon him  and perceived  that he was fast asleep   then took i up in my teeth a firebrand by the end  where it was not burnt  and cast it into the lap of my roaster  and another  did i throw as well as i could under a field couch that was placed near to  the chimney  wherein was the straw bed of my master turnspit   presently  the fire took hold in the straw  and from the straw to the bed  and from  the bed to the loft  which was planked and ceiled with fir  after the  fashion of the foot of a lamp   but the best was  that the fire which i had  cast into the lap of my paltry roaster burnt all his groin  and was  beginning to cease  seize  upon his cullions  when he became sensible of  the danger  for his smelling was not so bad but that he felt it sooner than  he could have seen daylight   then suddenly getting up  and in a great  amazement running to the window  he cried out to the streets as high as he  could  dal baroth  dal baroth  dal baroth  which is as much to say as fire   fire  fire   incontinently turning about  he came straight towards me to  throw me quite into the fire  and to that effect had already cut the ropes  wherewith my hands were tied  and was undoing the cords from off my feet   when the master of the house hearing him cry fire  and smelling the smoke  from the very street where he was walking with some other bashaws and  mustaphas  ran with all the speed he had to save what he could  and to  carry away his jewels   yet such was his rage  before he could well resolve  how to go about it  that he caught the broach whereon i was spitted and  therewith killed my roaster stark dead  of which wound he died there for  want of government or otherwise  for he ran him in with the spit a little  above the navel  towards the right flank  till he pierced the third lappet  of his liver  and the blow slanting upwards from the midriff or diaphragm   through which it had made penetration  the spit passed athwart the  pericardium or capsule of his heart  and came out above at his shoulders   betwixt the spondyls or turning joints of the chine of the back and the  left homoplat  which we call the shoulder blade     true it is  for i will not lie  that  in drawing the spit out of my body i  fell to the ground near unto the andirons  and so by the fall took some  hurt  which indeed had been greater  but that the lardons  or little slices  of bacon wherewith i was stuck  kept off the blow   my bashaw then seeing  the case to be desperate  his house burnt without remission  and all his  goods lost  gave himself over unto all the devils in hell  calling upon  some of them by their names  grilgoth  astaroth  rappalus  and gribouillis   nine several times   which when i saw  i had above sixpence  worth of fear   dreading that the devils would come even then to carry away this fool  and   seeing me so near him  would perhaps snatch me up to   i am already   thought i  half roasted  and my lardons will be the cause of my mischief   for these devils are very liquorous of lardons  according to the authority  which you have of the philosopher jamblicus  and murmault  in the apology  of bossutis  adulterated pro magistros nostros   but for my better security  i made the sign of the cross  crying  hageos  athanatos  ho theos  and none  came   at which my rogue bashaw being very much aggrieved would  in  transpiercing his heart with my spit  have killed himself  and to that  purpose had set it against his breast  but it could not enter  because it  was not sharp enough   whereupon i perceiving that he was not like to work  upon his body the effect which he intended  although he did not spare all  the force he had to thrust it forward  came up to him and said  master  bugrino  thou dost here but trifle away thy time  or rashly lose it  for  thou wilt never kill thyself thus as thou doest   well  thou mayst hurt or  bruise somewhat within thee  so as to make thee languish all thy lifetime  most pitifully amongst the hands of the chirurgeons  but if thou wilt be  counselled by me  i will kill thee clear outright  so that thou shalt not  so much as feel it  and trust me  for i have killed a great many others   who have found themselves very well after it   ha  my friend  said he  i  prithee do so  and for thy pains i will give thee my codpiece  budget    take  here it is  there are six hundred seraphs in it  and some fine  diamonds and most excellent rubies   and where are they  said epistemon   by st  john  said panurge  they are a good way hence  if they always keep  going   but where is the last year s snow   this was the greatest care that  villon the parisian poet took   make an end  said pantagruel  that we may  know how thou didst dress thy bashaw   by the faith of an honest man  said  panurge  i do not lie in one word   i swaddled him in a scurvy  swathel binding which i found lying there half burnt  and with my cords tied  him roister like both hand and foot  in such sort that he was not able to  wince  then passed my spit through his throat  and hanged him thereon   fastening the end thereof at two great hooks or crampirons  upon which they  did hang their halberds  and then  kindling a fair fire under him  did flame  you up my milourt  as they use to do dry herrings in a chimney   with this   taking his budget and a little javelin that was upon the foresaid hooks  i  ran away a fair gallop rake  and god he knows how i did smell my shoulder of  mutton     when i was come down into the street  i found everybody come to put out the  fire with store of water  and seeing me so half roasted  they did naturally  pity my case  and threw all their water upon me  which  by a most joyful  refreshing of me  did me very much good   then did they present me with  some victuals  but i could not eat much  because they gave me nothing to  drink but water after their fashion   other hurt they did me none  only one  little villainous turkey knobbreasted rogue came thiefteously to snatch  away some of my lardons  but i gave him such a sturdy thump and sound rap  on the fingers with all the weight of my javelin  that he came no more the  second time   shortly after this there came towards me a pretty young  corinthian wench  who brought me a boxful of conserves  of round mirabolan  plums  called emblicks  and looked upon my poor robin with an eye of great  compassion  as it was flea bitten and pinked with the sparkles of the fire  from whence it came  for it reached no farther in length  believe me  than  my knees   but note that this roasting cured me entirely of a sciatica   whereunto i had been subject above seven years before  upon that side which  my roaster by falling asleep suffered to be burnt     now  whilst they were thus busy about me  the fire triumphed  never ask  how   for it took hold on above two thousand houses  which one of them  espying cried out  saying  by mahoom s belly  all the city is on fire  and  we do nevertheless stand gazing here  without offering to make any relief   upon this everyone ran to save his own  for my part  i took my way towards  the gate   when i was got upon the knap of a little hillock not far off  i  turned me about as did lot s wife  and  looking back  saw all the city  burning in a fair fire  whereat i was so glad that i had almost beshit  myself for joy   but god punished me well for it   how  said pantagruel   thus  said panurge  for when with pleasure i beheld this jolly fire   jesting with myself  and saying  ha  poor flies  ha  poor mice  you will  have a bad winter of it this year  the fire is in your reeks  it is in your  bed straw  out come more than six  yea  more than thirteen hundred and  eleven dogs  great and small  altogether out of the town  flying away from  the fire   at the first approach they ran all upon me  being carried on by  the scent of my lecherous half roasted flesh  and had even then devoured me  in a trice  if my good angel had not well inspired me with the instruction  of a remedy very sovereign against the toothache   and wherefore  said  pantagruel  wert thou afraid of the toothache or pain of the teeth   wert  thou not cured of thy rheums   by palm sunday  said panurge  is there any  greater pain of the teeth than when the dogs have you by the legs   but on  a sudden  as my good angel directed me  i thought upon my lardons  and  threw them into the midst of the field amongst them   then did the dogs  run  and fight with one another at fair teeth which should have the  lardons   by this means they left me  and i left them also bustling with  and hairing one another   thus did i escape frolic and lively  gramercy  roastmeat and cookery         chapter   xv     how panurge showed a very new way to build the walls of paris     pantagruel one day  to refresh himself of his study  went a walking towards  st  marcel s suburbs  to see the extravagancy of the gobeline building  and  to taste of their spiced bread   panurge was with him  having always a  flagon under his gown and a good slice of a gammon of bacon  for without  this he never went  saying that it was as a yeoman of the guard to him  to  preserve his body from harm   other sword carried he none  and  when  pantagruel would have given him one  he answered that he needed none  for  that it would but heat his milt   yea but  said epistemon  if thou shouldst  be set upon  how wouldst thou defend thyself   with great buskinades or  brodkin blows  answered he  provided thrusts were forbidden   at their  return  panurge considered the walls of the city of paris  and in derision  said to pantagruel  see what fair walls here are   o how strong they are   and well fitted to keep geese in a mew or coop to fatten them   by my  beard  they are competently scurvy for such a city as this is  for a cow  with one fart would go near to overthrow above six fathoms of them   o my  friend  said pantagruel  dost thou know what agesilaus said when he was  asked why the great city of lacedaemon was not enclosed with walls   lo  here  said he  the walls of the city  in showing them the inhabitants and  citizens thereof  so strong  so well armed  and so expert in military  discipline  signifying thereby that there is no wall but of bones  and that  towns and cities cannot have a surer wall nor better fortification than the  prowess and virtue of the citizens and inhabitants   so is this city so  strong  by the great number of warlike people that are in it  that they  care not for making any other walls   besides  whosoever would go about to  wall it  as strasbourg  orleans  or ferrara  would find it almost  impossible  the cost and charges would be so excessive   yea but  said  panurge  it is good  nevertheless  to have an outside of stone when we are  invaded by our enemies  were it but to ask  who is below there   as for the  enormous expense which you say would be needful for undertaking the great  work of walling this city about  if the gentlemen of the town will be  pleased to give me a good rough cup of wine  i will show them a pretty   strange  and new way  how they may build them good cheap   how  said  pantagruel   do not speak of it then  answered panurge  and i will tell it  you   i see that the sine quo nons  kallibistris  or contrapunctums of the  women of this country are better cheap than stones   of them should the  walls be built  ranging them in good symmetry by the rules of architecture   and placing the largest in the first ranks  then sloping downwards  ridge wise  like the back of an ass   the middle sized ones must be ranked  next  and last of all the least and smallest   this done  there must be a  fine little interlacing of them  like points of diamonds  as is to be seen  in the great tower of bourges  with a like number of the nudinnudos   nilnisistandos  and stiff bracmards  that dwell in amongst the claustral  codpieces   what devil were able to overthrow such walls   there is no metal  like it to resist blows  in so far that  if culverin shot should come to  graze upon it  you would incontinently see distil from thence the blessed  fruit of the great pox as small as rain   beware  in the name of the devils   and hold off   furthermore  no thunderbolt or lightning would fall upon it   for why   they are all either blest or consecrated   i see but one  inconveniency in it   ho  ho  ha  ha  ha  said pantagruel  and what is that   it is  that the flies would be so liquorish of them that you would wonder   and would quickly gather there together  and there leave their ordure and  excretions  and so all the work would be spoiled   but see how that might be  remedied   they must be wiped and made rid of the flies with fair foxtails   or great good viedazes  which are ass pizzles  of provence   and to this  purpose i will tell you  as we go to supper  a brave example set down by  frater lubinus  libro de compotationibus mendicantium     in the time that the beasts did speak  which is not yet three days since  a  poor lion  walking through the forest of bieure  and saying his own little  private devotions  passed under a tree where there was a roguish collier  gotten up to cut down wood  who  seeing the lion  cast his hatchet at him  and wounded him enormously in one of his legs  whereupon the lion halting   he so long toiled and turmoiled himself in roaming up and down the forest  to find help  that at last he met with a carpenter  who willingly looked  upon his wound  cleansed it as well as he could  and filled it with moss   telling him that he must wipe his wound well that the flies might not do  their excrements in it  whilst he should go search for some yarrow or  millefoil  commonly called the carpenter s herb   the lion  being thus  healed  walked along in the forest at what time a sempiternous crone and  old hag was picking up and gathering some sticks in the said forest  who   seeing the lion coming towards her  for fear fell down backwards  in such  sort that the wind blew up her gown  coats  and smock  even as far as above  her shoulders  which the lion perceiving  for pity ran to see whether she  had taken any hurt by the fall  and thereupon considering her how do you  call it  said  o poor woman  who hath thus wounded thee   which words when  he had spoken  he espied a fox  whom he called to come to him saying   gossip reynard  hau  hither  hither  and for cause   when the fox was come   he said unto him  my gossip and friend  they have hurt this good woman here  between the legs most villainously  and there is a manifest solution of  continuity   see how great a wound it is  even from the tail up to the  navel  in measure four  nay full five handfuls and a half   this is the  blow of a hatchet  i doubt me  it is an old wound  and therefore  that the  flies may not get into it  wipe it lustily well and hard  i prithee  both  within and without  thou hast a good tail  and long   wipe  my friend   wipe  i beseech thee  and in the meanwhile i will go get some moss to put  into it  for thus ought we to succour and help one another   wipe it hard   thus  my friend  wipe it well  for this wound must be often wiped   otherwise the party cannot be at ease   go to  wipe well  my little gossip   wipe  god hath furnished thee with a tail  thou hast a long one  and of a  bigness proportionable  wipe hard  and be not weary   a good wiper  who  in  wiping continually  wipeth with his wipard  by wasps shall never be  wounded   wipe  my pretty minion  wipe  my little bully  i will not stay  long   then went he to get store of moss  and when he was a little way off   he cried out in speaking to the fox thus  wipe well still  gossip  wipe   and let it never grieve thee to wipe well  my little gossip  i will put  thee into service to be wiper to don pedro de castile  wipe  only wipe  and  no more   the poor fox wiped as hard as he could  here and there  within  and without  but the false old trot did so fizzle and fist that she stunk  like a hundred devils  which put the poor fox to a great deal of ill ease   for he knew not to what side to turn himself to escape the unsavoury  perfume of this old woman s postern blasts   and whilst to that effect he  was shifting hither and thither  without knowing how to shun the annoyance  of those unwholesome gusts  he saw that behind there was yet another hole   not so great as that which he did wipe  out of which came this filthy and  infectious air   the lion at last returned  bringing with him of moss more  than eighteen packs would hold  and began to put into the wound with a  staff which he had provided for that purpose  and had already put in full  sixteen packs and a half  at which he was amazed   what a devil  said he   this wound is very deep  it would hold above two cartloads of moss   the  fox  perceiving this  said unto the lion  o gossip lion  my friend  i pray  thee do not put in all thy moss there  keep somewhat  for there is yet here  another little hole  that stinks like five hundred devils  i am almost  choked with the smell thereof  it is so pestiferous and empoisoning     thus must these walls be kept from the flies  and wages allowed to some for  wiping of them   then said pantagruel  how dost thou know that the privy  parts of women are at such a cheap rate   for in this city there are many  virtuous  honest  and chaste women besides the maids   et ubi prenus  said  panurge   i will give you my opinion of it  and that upon certain and  assured knowledge   i do not brag that i have bumbasted four hundred and  seventeen since i came into this city  though it be but nine days ago  but  this very morning i met with a good fellow  who  in a wallet such as  aesop s was  carried two little girls of two or three years old at the  most  one before and the other behind   he demanded alms of me  but i made  him answer that i had more cods than pence   afterwards i asked him  good  man  these two girls  are they maids   brother  said he  i have carried  them thus these two years  and in regard of her that is before  whom i see  continually  in my opinion she is a virgin  nevertheless i will not put my  finger in the fire for it  as for her that is behind  doubtless i can say  nothing     indeed  said pantagruel  thou art a gentle companion  i will have thee to  be apparelled in my livery   and therefore caused him to be clothed most  gallantly according to the fashion that then was  only that panurge would  have the codpiece of his breeches three foot long  and in shape square  not  round  which was done  and was well worth the seeing   oftentimes was he  wont to say  that the world had not yet known the emolument and utility  that is in wearing great codpieces  but time would one day teach it them   as all things have been invented in time   god keep from hurt  said he  the  good fellow whose long codpiece or braguet hath saved his life   god keep  from hurt him whose long braguet hath been worth to him in one day one  hundred threescore thousand and nine crowns   god keep from hurt him who by  his long braguet hath saved a whole city from dying by famine   and  by g    i will make a book of the commodity of long braguets when i shall have more  leisure   and indeed he composed a fair great book with figures  but it is  not printed as yet that i know of         chapter   xvi     of the qualities and conditions of panurge     panurge was of a middle stature  not too high nor too low  and had somewhat  an aquiline nose  made like the handle of a razor   he was at that time  five and thirty years old or thereabouts  fine to gild like a leaden  dagger  for he was a notable cheater and coney catcher  he was a very  gallant and proper man of his person  only that he was a little lecherous   and naturally subject to a kind of disease which at that time they called  lack of money  it is an incomparable grief  yet  notwithstanding  he had  three score and three tricks to come by it at his need  of which the most  honourable and most ordinary was in manner of thieving  secret purloining  and filching  for he was a wicked lewd rogue  a cozener  drinker  roister   rover  and a very dissolute and debauched fellow  if there were any in  paris  otherwise  and in all matters else  the best and most virtuous man  in the world  and he was still contriving some plot  and devising mischief  against the sergeants and the watch     at one time he assembled three or four especial good hacksters and roaring  boys  made them in the evening drink like templars  afterwards led them  till they came under st  genevieve  or about the college of navarre  and   at the hour that the watch was coming up that way  which he knew by putting  his sword upon the pavement  and his ear by it  and  when he heard his  sword shake  it was an infallible sign that the watch was near at that  instant  then he and his companions took a tumbrel or dung cart  and gave  it the brangle  hurling it with all their force down the hill  and so  overthrew all the poor watchmen like pigs  and then ran away upon the other  side  for in less than two days he knew all the streets  lanes  and  turnings in paris as well as his deus det     at another time he made in some fair place  where the said watch was to  pass  a train of gunpowder  and  at the very instant that they went along   set fire to it  and then made himself sport to see what good grace they had  in running away  thinking that st  anthony s fire had caught them by the  legs   as for the poor masters of arts  he did persecute them above all  others   when he encountered with any of them upon the street  he would not  never fail to put some trick or other upon them  sometimes putting the bit  of a fried turd in their graduate hoods  at other times pinning on little  foxtails or hares  ears behind them  or some such other roguish prank   one  day that they were appointed all to meet in the fodder street  sorbonne    he made a borbonesa tart  or filthy and slovenly compound  made of store of  garlic  of assafoetida  of castoreum  of dogs  turds very warm  which he  steeped  tempered  and liquefied in the corrupt matter of pocky boils and  pestiferous botches  and  very early in the morning therewith anointed all  the pavement  in such sort that the devil could not have endured it  which  made all these good people there to lay up their gorges  and vomit what was  upon their stomachs before all the world  as if they had flayed the fox   and ten or twelve of them died of the plague  fourteen became lepers   eighteen grew lousy  and about seven and twenty had the pox  but he did not  care a button for it   he commonly carried a whip under his gown  wherewith  he whipped without remission the pages whom he found carrying wine to their  masters  to make them mend their pace   in his coat he had above six and  twenty little fobs and pockets always full  one with some lead water  and a  little knife as sharp as a glover s needle  wherewith he used to cut  purses  another with some kind of bitter stuff  which he threw into the  eyes of those he met  another with clotburrs  penned with little geese  or  capon s feathers  which he cast upon the gowns and caps of honest people   and often made them fair horns  which they wore about all the city   sometimes all their life   very often  also  upon the women s french hoods  would he stick in the hind part somewhat made in the shape of a man s  member   in another  he had a great many little horns full of fleas and  lice  which he borrowed from the beggars of st  innocent  and cast them  with small canes or quills to write with into the necks of the daintiest  gentlewomen that he could find  yea  even in the church  for he never  seated himself above in the choir  but always sat in the body of the church  amongst the women  both at mass  at vespers  and at sermon   in another  he  used to have good store of hooks and buckles  wherewith he would couple men  and women together that sat in company close to one another  but especially  those that wore gowns of crimson taffeties  that  when they were about to  go away  they might rend all their gowns   in another  he had a squib  furnished with tinder  matches  stones to strike fire  and all other  tackling necessary for it   in another  two or three burning glasses   wherewith he made both men and women sometimes mad  and in the church put  them quite out of countenance  for he said that there was but an  antistrophe  or little more difference than of a literal inversion  between  a woman folle a la messe and molle a la fesse  that is  foolish at the mass  and of a pliant buttock     in another  he had a good deal of needles and thread  wherewith he did a  thousand little devilish pranks   one time  at the entry of the palace unto  the great hall  where a certain grey friar or cordelier was to say mass to  the counsellors  he did help to apparel him and put on his vestments  but  in the accoutring of him he sewed on his alb  surplice  or stole  to his  gown and shirt  and then withdrew himself when the said lords of the court  or counsellors came to hear the said mass  but when it came to the ite   missa est  that the poor frater would have laid by his stole or surplice   as the fashion then was  he plucked off withal both his frock and shirt   which were well sewed together  and thereby stripping himself up to the  very shoulders showed his bel vedere to all the world  together with his  don cypriano  which was no small one  as you may imagine   and the friar  still kept haling  but so much the more did he discover himself and lay  open his back parts  till one of the lords of the court said  how now   what s the matter   will this fair father make us here an offering of his  tail to kiss it   nay  st  anthony s fire kiss it for us   from thenceforth  it was ordained that the poor fathers should never disrobe themselves any  more before the world  but in their vestry room  or sextry  as they call  it  especially in the presence of women  lest it should tempt them to the  sin of longing and disordinate desire   the people then asked why it was  the friars had so long and large genitories   the said panurge resolved the  problem very neatly  saying  that which makes asses to have such great ears  is that their dams did put no biggins on their heads  as alliaco mentioneth  in his suppositions   by the like reason  that which makes the genitories  or generation tools of those so fair fraters so long is  for that they wear  no bottomed breeches  and therefore their jolly member  having no  impediment  hangeth dangling at liberty as far as it can reach  with a  wiggle waggle down to their knees  as women carry their paternoster beads   and the cause wherefore they have it so correspondently great is  that in  this constant wig wagging the humours of the body descend into the said  member   for  according to the legists  agitation and continual motion is  cause of attraction     item  he had another pocket full of itching powder  called stone alum   whereof he would cast some into the backs of those women whom he judged to  be most beautiful and stately  which did so ticklishly gall them  that some  would strip themselves in the open view of the world  and others dance like  a cock upon hot embers  or a drumstick on a tabor   others  again  ran  about the streets  and he would run after them   to such as were in the  stripping vein he would very civilly come to offer his attendance  and  cover them with his cloak  like a courteous and very gracious man     item  in another he had a little leather bottle full of old oil  wherewith   when he saw any man or woman in a rich new handsome suit  he would grease   smutch  and spoil all the best parts of it under colour and pretence of  touching them  saying  this is good cloth  this is good satin  good  taffeties   madam  god give you all that your noble heart desireth   you  have a new suit  pretty sir   and you a new gown  sweet mistress   god give  you joy of it  and maintain you in all prosperity   and with this would lay  his hand upon their shoulder  at which touch such a villainous spot was  left behind  so enormously engraven to perpetuity in the very soul  body   and reputation  that the devil himself could never have taken it away   then  upon his departing  he would say  madam  take heed you do not fall   for there is a filthy great hole before you  whereinto if you put your  foot  you will quite spoil yourself     another he had all full of euphorbium  very finely pulverized   in that  powder did he lay a fair handkerchief curiously wrought  which he had  stolen from a pretty seamstress of the palace  in taking away a louse from  off her bosom which he had put there himself  and  when he came into the  company of some good ladies  he would trifle them into a discourse of some  fine workmanship of bone lace  then immediately put his hand into their  bosom  asking them  and this work  is it of flanders  or of hainault  and  then drew out his handkerchief  and said  hold  hold  look what work here  is  it is of foutignan or of fontarabia  and shaking it hard at their nose   made them sneeze for four hours without ceasing   in the meanwhile he would  fart like a horse  and the women would laugh and say  how now  do you fart   panurge   no  no  madam  said he  i do but tune my tail to the plain song  of the music which you make with your nose   in another he had a picklock   a pelican  a crampiron  a crook  and some other iron tools  wherewith there  was no door nor coffer which he would not pick open   he had another full  of little cups  wherewith he played very artificially  for he had his  fingers made to his hand  like those of minerva or arachne  and had  heretofore cried treacle   and when he changed a teston  cardecu  or any  other piece of money  the changer had been more subtle than a fox if  panurge had not at every time made five or six sols  that is  some six or  seven pence   vanish away invisibly  openly  and manifestly  without making  any hurt or lesion  whereof the changer should have felt nothing but the  wind         chapter   xvii     how panurge gained the pardons  and married the old women  and of the suit  in law which he had at paris     one day i found panurge very much out of countenance  melancholic  and  silent  which made me suspect that he had no money  whereupon i said unto  him  panurge  you are sick  as i do very well perceive by your physiognomy   and i know the disease   you have a flux in your purse  but take no care   i have yet sevenpence halfpenny that never saw father nor mother  which  shall not be wanting  no more than the pox  in your necessity   whereunto  he answered me  well  well  for money one day i shall have but too much   for i have a philosopher s stone which attracts money out of men s purses  as the adamant doth iron   but will you go with me to gain the pardons   said he   by my faith  said i  i am no great pardon taker in this world  if  i shall be any such in the other  i cannot tell  yet let us go  in god s  name  it is but one farthing more or less  but  said he  lend me then a  farthing upon interest   no  no  said i  i will give it you freely  and  from my heart   grates vobis dominos  said he     so we went along  beginning at st  gervase  and i got the pardons at the  first box only  for in those matters very little contenteth me   then did i  say my small suffrages and the prayers of st  brigid  but he gained them  all at the boxes  and always gave money to everyone of the pardoners   from  thence we went to our lady s church  to st  john s  to st  anthony s  and  so to the other churches  where there was a banquet  bank  of pardons   for  my part  i gained no more of them  but he at all the boxes kissed the  relics  and gave at everyone   to be brief  when we were returned  he  brought me to drink at the castle tavern  and there showed me ten or twelve  of his little bags full of money  at which i blessed myself  and made the  sign of the cross  saying  where have you recovered so much money in so  little time   unto which he answered me that he had taken it out of the  basins of the pardons   for in giving them the first farthing  said he  i  put it in with such sleight of hand and so dexterously that it appeared to  be a threepence  thus with one hand i took threepence  ninepence  or  sixpence at the least  and with the other as much  and so through all the  churches where we have been   yea but  said i  you damn yourself like a  snake  and are withal a thief and sacrilegious person   true  said he  in  your opinion  but i am not of that mind  for the pardoners do give me it   when they say unto me in presenting the relics to kiss  centuplum accipies   that is  that for one penny i should take a hundred  for accipies is spoken  according to the manner of the hebrews  who use the future tense instead of  the imperative  as you have in the law  diliges dominum  that is  dilige   even so  when the pardon bearer says to me  centuplum accipies  his meaning  is  centuplum accipe  and so doth rabbi kimy and rabbi aben ezra expound  it  and all the massorets  et ibi bartholus   moreover  pope sixtus gave me  fifteen hundred francs of yearly pension  which in english money is a  hundred and fifty pounds  upon his ecclesiastical revenues and treasure   for having cured him of a cankerous botch  which did so torment him that he  thought to have been a cripple by it all his life   thus i do pay myself at  my own hand  for otherwise i get nothing upon the said ecclesiastical  treasure   ho  my friend  said he  if thou didst know what advantage i  made  and how well i feathered my nest  by the pope s bull of the crusade   thou wouldst wonder exceedingly   it was worth to me above six thousand  florins  in english coin six hundred pounds   and what a devil is become of  them  said i  for of that money thou hast not one halfpenny   they returned  from whence they came  said he  they did no more but change their master     but i employed at least three thousand of them  that is  three hundred  pounds english  in marrying  not young virgins  for they find but too many  husbands  but great old sempiternous trots which had not so much as one  tooth in their heads  and that out of the consideration i had that these  good old women had very well spent the time of their youth in playing at  the close buttock game to all comers  serving the foremost first  till no  man would have any more dealing with them   and  by g    i will have their  skin coat shaken once yet before they die   by this means  to one i gave a  hundred florins  to another six score  to another three hundred  according  to that they were infamous  detestable  and abominable   for  by how much  the more horrible and execrable they were  so much the more must i needs  have given them  otherwise the devil would not have jummed them   presently  i went to some great and fat wood porter  or such like  and did myself make  the match   but  before i did show him the old hags  i made a fair muster  to him of the crowns  saying  good fellow  see what i will give thee if  thou wilt but condescend to duffle  dinfredaille  or lecher it one good  time   then began the poor rogues to gape like old mules  and i caused to  be provided for them a banquet  with drink of the best  and store of  spiceries  to put the old women in rut and heat of lust   to be short  they  occupied all  like good souls  only  to those that were horribly ugly and  ill favoured  i caused their head to be put within a bag  to hide their  face     besides all this  i have lost a great deal in suits of law   and what  lawsuits couldst thou have  said i  thou hast neither house nor lands   my  friend  said he  the gentlewomen of this city had found out  by the  instigation of the devil of hell  a manner of high mounted bands and  neckerchiefs for women  which did so closely cover their bosoms that men  could no more put their hands under   for they had put the slit behind  and  those neckcloths were wholly shut before  whereat the poor sad  contemplative lovers were much discontented   upon a fair tuesday i  presented a petition to the court  making myself a party against the said  gentlewomen  and showing the great interest that i pretended therein   protesting that by the same reason i would cause the codpiece of my  breeches to be sewed behind  if the court would not take order for it   in  sum  the gentlewomen put in their defences  showing the grounds they went  upon  and constituted their attorney for the prosecuting of the cause   but  i pursued them so vigorously  that by a sentence of the court it was  decreed those high neckcloths should be no longer worn if they were not a  little cleft and open before  but it cost me a good sum of money   i had  another very filthy and beastly process against the dung farmer called  master fifi and his deputies  that they should no more read privily the  pipe  puncheon  nor quart of sentences  but in fair full day  and that in  the fodder schools  in face of the arrian  artitian  sophisters  where i  was ordained to pay the charges  by reason of some clause mistaken in the  relation of the sergeant   another time i framed a complaint to the court  against the mules of the presidents  counsellors  and others  tending to  this purpose  that  when in the lower court of the palace they left them to  champ on their bridles  some bibs were made for them  by the counsellors   wives   that with their drivelling they might not spoil the pavement  to  the end that the pages of the palace what play upon it with their dice  or  at the game of coxbody  at their own ease  without spoiling their breeches  at the knees   and for this i had a fair decree  but it cost me dear   now  reckon up what expense i was at in little banquets which from day to day i  made to the pages of the palace   and to what end  said i   my friend  said  he  thou hast no pastime at all in this world   i have more than the king   and if thou wilt join thyself with me  we will do the devil together   no   no  said i  by st  adauras  that will i not  for thou wilt be hanged one  time or another   and thou  said he  wilt be interred some time or other   now which is most honourable  the air or the earth   ho  grosse pecore     whilst the pages are at their banqueting  i keep their mules  and to  someone i cut the stirrup leather of the mounting side till it hang but by  a thin strap or thread  that when the great puffguts of the counsellor or  some other hath taken his swing to get up  he may fall flat on his side  like a pork  and so furnish the spectators with more than a hundred francs   worth of laughter   but i laugh yet further to think how at his home coming  the master page is to be whipped like green rye  which makes me not to  repent what i have bestowed in feasting them   in brief  he had  as i said  before  three score and three ways to acquire money  but he had two hundred  and fourteen to spend it  besides his drinking         chapter   xviii     how a great scholar of england would have argued against pantagruel  and  was overcome by panurge     in that same time a certain learned man named thaumast  hearing the fame  and renown of pantagruel s incomparable knowledge  came out of his own  country of england with an intent only to see him  to try thereby and prove  whether his knowledge in effect was so great as it was reported to be   in  this resolution being arrived at paris  he went forthwith unto the house of  the said pantagruel  who was lodged in the palace of st  denis  and was  then walking in the garden thereof with panurge  philosophizing after the  fashion of the peripatetics   at his first entrance he startled  and was  almost out of his wits for fear  seeing him so great and so tall   then did  he salute him courteously as the manner is  and said unto him  very true it  is  saith plato the prince of philosophers  that if the image and knowledge  of wisdom were corporeal and visible to the eyes of mortals  it would stir  up all the world to admire her   which we may the rather believe that the  very bare report thereof  scattered in the air  if it happen to be received  into the ears of men  who  for being studious and lovers of virtuous things  are called philosophers  doth not suffer them to sleep nor rest in quiet   but so pricketh them up and sets them on fire to run unto the place where  the person is  in whom the said knowledge is said to have built her temple  and uttered her oracles   as it was manifestly shown unto us in the queen  of sheba  who came from the utmost borders of the east and persian sea  to  see the order of solomon s house and to hear his wisdom  in anacharsis  who  came out of scythia  even unto athens  to see solon  in pythagoras  who  travelled far to visit the memphitical vaticinators  in plato  who went a  great way off to see the magicians of egypt  and architus of tarentum  in  apollonius tyaneus  who went as far as unto mount caucasus  passed along  the scythians  the massagetes  the indians  and sailed over the great river  phison  even to the brachmans to see hiarchus  as likewise unto babylon   chaldea  media  assyria  parthia  syria  phoenicia  arabia  palestina  and  alexandria  even unto aethiopia  to see the gymnosophists   the like  example have we of titus livius  whom to see and hear divers studious  persons came to rome from the confines of france and spain   i dare not  reckon myself in the number of those so excellent persons  but well would  be called studious  and a lover  not only of learning  but of learned men  also   and indeed  having heard the report of your so inestimable  knowledge  i have left my country  my friends  my kindred  and my house   and am come thus far  valuing at nothing the length of the way  the  tediousness of the sea  nor strangeness of the land  and that only to see  you and to confer with you about some passages in philosophy  of geomancy   and of the cabalistic art  whereof i am doubtful and cannot satisfy my  mind  which if you can resolve  i yield myself unto you for a slave  henceforward  together with all my posterity  for other gift have i none  that i can esteem a recompense sufficient for so great a favour   i will  reduce them into writing  and to morrow publish them to all the learned men  in the city  that we may dispute publicly before them     but see in what manner i mean that we shall dispute   i will not argue pro  et contra  as do the sottish sophisters of this town and other places   likewise i will not dispute after the manner of the academics by  declamation  nor yet by numbers  as pythagoras was wont to do  and as picus  de la mirandula did of late at rome   but i will dispute by signs only  without speaking  for the matters are so abstruse  hard  and arduous  that  words proceeding from the mouth of man will never be sufficient for  unfolding of them to my liking   may it  therefore  please your  magnificence to be there  it shall be at the great hall of navarre at seven  o clock in the morning   when he had spoken these words  pantagruel very  honourably said unto him   sir  of the graces that god hath bestowed upon  me  i would not deny to communicate unto any man to my power   for whatever  comes from him is good  and his pleasure is that it should be increased  when we come amongst men worthy and fit to receive this celestial manna of  honest literature   in which number  because that in this time  as i do  already very plainly perceive  thou holdest the first rank  i give thee  notice that at all hours thou shalt find me ready to condescend to every  one of thy requests according to my poor ability  although i ought rather  to learn of thee than thou of me   but  as thou hast protested  we will  confer of these doubts together  and will seek out the resolution  even  unto the bottom of that undrainable well where heraclitus says the truth  lies hidden   and i do highly commend the manner of arguing which thou hast  proposed  to wit  by signs without speaking  for by this means thou and i  shall understand one another well enough  and yet shall be free from this  clapping of hands which these blockish sophisters make when any of the  arguers hath gotten the better of the argument   now to morrow i will not  fail to meet thee at the place and hour that thou hast appointed  but let  me entreat thee that there be not any strife or uproar between us  and that  we seek not the honour and applause of men  but the truth only   to which  thaumast answered   the lord god maintain you in his favour and grace  and   instead of my thankfulness to you  pour down his blessings upon you  for  that your highness and magnificent greatness hath not disdained to descend  to the grant of the request of my poor baseness   so farewell till  to morrow   farewell  said pantagruel     gentlemen  you that read this present discourse  think not that ever men  were more elevated and transported in their thoughts than all this night  were both thaumast and pantagruel  for the said thaumast said to the keeper  of the house of cluny  where he was lodged  that in all his life he had  never known himself so dry as he was that night   i think  said he  that  pantagruel held me by the throat   give order  i pray you  that we may have  some drink  and see that some fresh water be brought to us  to gargle my  palate   on the other side  pantagruel stretched his wits as high as he  could  entering into very deep and serious meditations  and did nothing all  that night but dote upon and turn over the book of beda  de numeris et  signis  plotin s book  de inenarrabilibus  the book of proclus  de magia   the book of artemidorus peri oneirokritikon  of anaxagoras  peri zemeion   dinarius  peri aphaton  the books of philiston  hipponax  peri  anekphoneton  and a rabble of others  so long  that panurge said unto him     my lord  leave all these thoughts and go to bed  for i perceive your  spirits to be so troubled by a too intensive bending of them  that you may  easily fall into some quotidian fever with this so excessive thinking and  plodding   but  having first drunk five and twenty or thirty good draughts   retire yourself and sleep your fill  for in the morning i will argue  against and answer my master the englishman  and if i drive him not ad  metam non loqui  then call me knave   yea but  said he  my friend panurge   he is marvellously learned  how wilt thou be able to answer him   very  well  answered panurge  i pray you talk no more of it  but let me alone   is any man so learned as the devils are   no  indeed  said pantagruel   without god s especial grace   yet for all that  said panurge  i have  argued against them  gravelled and blanked them in disputation  and laid  them so squat upon their tails that i have made them look like monkeys   therefore be assured that to morrow i will make this vain glorious  englishman to skite vinegar before all the world   so panurge spent the  night with tippling amongst the pages  and played away all the points of  his breeches at primus secundus and at peck point  in french called la  vergette   yet  when the condescended on time was come  he failed not to  conduct his master pantagruel to the appointed place  unto which  believe  me  there was neither great nor small in paris but came  thinking with  themselves that this devilish pantagruel  who had overthrown and vanquished  in dispute all these doting fresh water sophisters  would now get full  payment and be tickled to some purpose   for this englishman is a terrible  bustler and horrible coil keeper   we will see who will be conqueror  for  he never met with his match before     thus all being assembled  thaumast stayed for them  and then  when  pantagruel and panurge came into the hall  all the schoolboys  professors  of arts  senior sophisters  and bachelors began to clap their hands  as  their scurvy custom is   but pantagruel cried out with a loud voice  as if  it had been the sound of a double cannon  saying  peace  with a devil to  you  peace   by g    you rogues  if you trouble me here  i will cut off the  heads of everyone of you   at which words they remained all daunted and  astonished like so many ducks  and durst not do so much as cough  although  they had swallowed fifteen pounds of feathers   withal they grew so dry  with this only voice  that they laid out their tongues a full half foot  beyond their mouths  as if pantagruel had salted all their throats   then  began panurge to speak  saying to the englishman  sir  are you come hither  to dispute contentiously in those propositions you have set down  or   otherwise  but to learn and know the truth   to which answered thaumast   sir  no other thing brought me hither but the great desire i had to learn  and to know that of which i have doubted all my life long  and have neither  found book nor man able to content me in the resolution of those doubts  which i have proposed   and  as for disputing contentiously  i will not do  it  for it is too base a thing  and therefore leave it to those sottish  sophisters who in their disputes do not search for the truth  but for  contradiction only and debate   then said panurge  if i  who am but a mean  and inconsiderable disciple of my master my lord pantagruel  content and  satisfy you in all and everything  it were a thing below my said master  wherewith to trouble him   therefore is it fitter that he be chairman  and  sit as a judge and moderator of our discourse and purpose  and give you  satisfaction in many things wherein perhaps i shall be wanting to your  expectation   truly  said thaumast  it is very well said  begin then   now  you must note that panurge had set at the end of his long codpiece a pretty  tuft of red silk  as also of white  green  and blue  and within it had put  a fair orange         chapter   xix     how panurge put to a nonplus the englishman that argued by signs     everybody then taking heed  and hearkening with great silence  the  englishman lift up on high into the air his two hands severally  clunching  in all the tops of his fingers together  after the manner which  a la  chinonnese  they call the hen s arse  and struck the one hand on the other  by the nails four several times   then he  opening them  struck the one  with the flat of the other till it yielded a clashing noise  and that only  once   again  in joining them as before  he struck twice  and afterwards  four times in opening them   then did he lay them joined  and extended the  one towards the other  as if he had been devoutly to send up his prayers  unto god   panurge suddenly lifted up in the air his right hand  and put  the thumb thereof into the nostril of the same side  holding his four  fingers straight out  and closed orderly in a parallel line to the point of  his nose  shutting the left eye wholly  and making the other wink with a  profound depression of the eyebrows and eyelids   then lifted he up his  left hand  with hard wringing and stretching forth his four fingers and  elevating his thumb  which he held in a line directly correspondent to the  situation of his right hand  with the distance of a cubit and a half  between them   this done  in the same form he abased towards the ground  about the one and the other hand   lastly  he held them in the midst  as  aiming right at the englishman s nose   and if mercury   said the  englishman   there panurge interrupted him  and said  you have spoken   mask     then made the englishman this sign   his left hand all open he lifted up  into the air  then instantly shut into his fist the four fingers thereof   and his thumb extended at length he placed upon the gristle of his nose   presently after  he lifted up his right hand all open  and all open abased  and bent it downwards  putting the thumb thereof in the very place where  the little finger of the left hand did close in the fist  and the four  right hand fingers he softly moved in the air   then contrarily he did with  the right hand what he had done with the left  and with the left what he  had done with the right     panurge  being not a whit amazed at this  drew out into the air his  trismegist codpiece with the left hand  and with his right drew forth a  truncheon of a white ox rib  and two pieces of wood of a like form  one of  black ebony and the other of incarnation brasil  and put them betwixt the  fingers of that hand in good symmetry  then  knocking them together  made  such a noise as the lepers of brittany use to do with their clappering  clickets  yet better resounding and far more harmonious  and with his  tongue contracted in his mouth did very merrily warble it  always looking  fixedly upon the englishman   the divines  physicians  and chirurgeons that  were there thought that by this sign he would have inferred that the  englishman was a leper   the counsellors  lawyers  and decretalists  conceived that by doing this he would have concluded some kind of mortal  felicity to consist in leprosy  as the lord maintained heretofore     the englishman for all this was nothing daunted  but holding up his two  hands in the air  kept them in such form that he closed the three  master fingers in his fist  and passing his thumbs through his indical or  foremost and middle fingers  his auriculary or little fingers remained  extended and stretched out  and so presented he them to panurge   then  joined he them so that the right thumb touched the left  and the left little  finger touched the right   hereat panurge  without speaking one word  lift  up his hands and made this sign     he put the nail of the forefinger of his left hand to the nail of the thumb  of the same  making in the middle of the distance as it were a buckle  and  of his right hand shut up all the fingers into his fist  except the  forefinger  which he often thrust in and out through the said two others of  the left hand   then stretched he out the forefinger and middle finger or  medical of his right hand  holding them asunder as much as he could  and  thrusting them towards thaumast   then did he put the thumb of his left  hand upon the corner of his left eye  stretching out all his hand like the  wing of a bird or the fin of a fish  and moving it very daintily this way  and that way  he did as much with his right hand upon the corner of his  right eye   thaumast began then to wax somewhat pale  and to tremble  and  made him this sign     with the middle finger of his right hand he struck against the muscle of  the palm or pulp which is under the thumb   then put he the forefinger of  the right hand in the like buckle of the left  but he put it under  and not  over  as panurge did   then panurge knocked one hand against another  and  blowed in his palm  and put again the forefinger of his right hand into the  overture or mouth of the left  pulling it often in and out   then held he  out his chin  most intentively looking upon thaumast   the people there   which understood nothing in the other signs  knew very well that therein he  demanded  without speaking a word to thaumast  what do you mean by that   in effect  thaumast then began to sweat great drops  and seemed to all the  spectators a man strangely ravished in high contemplation   then he  bethought himself  and put all the nails of his left hand against those of  his right  opening his fingers as if they had been semicircles  and with  this sign lift up his hands as high as he could   whereupon panurge  presently put the thumb of his right hand under his jaws  and the little  finger thereof in the mouth of the left hand  and in this posture made his  teeth to sound very melodiously  the upper against the lower   with this  thaumast  with great toil and vexation of spirit  rose up  but in rising  let a great baker s fart  for the bran came after  and pissing withal very  strong vinegar  stunk like all the devils in hell   the company began to  stop their noses  for he had conskited himself with mere anguish and  perplexity   then lifted he up his right hand  clunching it in such sort  that he brought the ends of all his fingers to meet together  and his left  hand he laid flat upon his breast   whereat panurge drew out his long  codpiece with his tuff  and stretched it forth a cubit and a half  holding  it in the air with his right hand  and with his left took out his orange   and  casting it up into the air seven times  at the eighth he hid it in the  fist of his right hand  holding it steadily up on high  and then began to  shake his fair codpiece  showing it to thaumast     after that  thaumast began to puff up his two cheeks like a player on a  bagpipe  and blew as if he had been to puff up a pig s bladder   whereupon  panurge put one finger of his left hand in his nockandrow  by some called  st  patrick s hole  and with his mouth sucked in the air  in such a manner  as when one eats oysters in the shell  or when we sup up our broth   this  done  he opened his mouth somewhat  and struck his right hand flat upon it   making therewith a great and a deep sound  as if it came from the  superficies of the midriff through the trachiartery or pipe of the lungs   and this he did for sixteen times  but thaumast did always keep blowing  like a goose   then panurge put the forefinger of his right hand into his  mouth  pressing it very hard to the muscles thereof  then he drew it out   and withal made a great noise  as when little boys shoot pellets out of the  pot cannons made of the hollow sticks of the branch of an alder tree  and  he did it nine times     then thaumast cried out  ha  my masters  a great secret   with this he put  in his hand up to the elbow  then drew out a dagger that he had  holding it  by the point downwards   whereat panurge took his long codpiece  and shook  it as hard as he could against his thighs  then put his two hands entwined  in manner of a comb upon his head  laying out his tongue as far as he was  able  and turning his eyes in his head like a goat that is ready to die   ha  i understand  said thaumast  but what  making such a sign that he put  the haft of his dagger against his breast  and upon the point thereof the  flat of his hand  turning in a little the ends of his fingers   whereat  panurge held down his head on the left side  and put his middle finger into  his right ear  holding up his thumb bolt upright   then he crossed his two  arms upon his breast and coughed five times  and at the fifth time he  struck his right foot against the ground   then he lift up his left arm   and closing all his fingers into his fist  held his thumb against his  forehead  striking with his right hand six times against his breast   but  thaumast  as not content therewith  put the thumb of his left hand upon the  top of his nose  shutting the rest of his said hand  whereupon panurge set  his two master fingers upon each side of his mouth  drawing it as much as  he was able  and widening it so that he showed all his teeth  and with his  two thumbs plucked down his two eyelids very low  making therewith a very  ill favoured countenance  as it seemed to the company         chapter   xx     how thaumast relateth the virtues and knowledge of panurge     then panurge rose up  and  putting off his cap  did very kindly thank the  said panurge  and with a loud voice said unto all the people that were  there   my lords  gentlemen  and others  at this time may i to some good  purpose speak that evangelical word  et ecce plus quam salomon hic   you  have here in your presence an incomparable treasure  that is  my lord  pantagruel  whose great renown hath brought me hither  out of the very  heart of england  to confer with him about the insoluble problems  both in  magic  alchemy  the cabal  geomancy  astrology  and philosophy  which i had  in my mind   but at present i am angry even with fame itself  which i think  was envious to him  for that it did not declare the thousandth part of the  worth that indeed is in him   you have seen how his disciple only hath  satisfied me  and hath told me more than i asked of him   besides  he hath  opened unto me  and resolved other inestimable doubts  wherein i can assure  you he hath to me discovered the very true well  fountain  and abyss of the  encyclopaedia of learning  yea  in such a sort that i did not think i  should ever have found a man that could have made his skill appear in so  much as the first elements of that concerning which we disputed by signs   without speaking either word or half word   but  in fine  i will reduce  into writing that which we have said and concluded  that the world may not  take them to be fooleries  and will thereafter cause them to be printed   that everyone may learn as i have done   judge  then  what the master had  been able to say  seeing the disciple hath done so valiantly  for  non est  discipulus super magistrum   howsoever  god be praised  and i do very  humbly thank you for the honour that you have done us at this act   god  reward you for it eternally   the like thanks gave pantagruel to all the  company  and  going from thence  he carried thaumast to dinner with him   and believe that they drank as much as their skins could hold  or  as the  phrase is  with unbuttoned bellies  for in that age they made fast their  bellies with buttons  as we do now the collars of our doublets or jerkins    even till they neither knew where they were nor whence they came   blessed  lady  how they did carouse it  and pluck  as we say  at the kid s leather   and flagons to trot  and they to toot  draw  give  page  some wine here   reach hither  fill with a devil  so   there was not one but did drink five  and twenty or thirty pipes   can you tell how   even sicut terra sine aqua   for the weather was hot  and  besides that  they were very dry   in matter  of the exposition of the propositions set down by thaumast  and the  signification of the signs which they used in their disputation  i would  have set them down for you according to their own relation  but i have been  told that thaumast made a great book of it  imprinted at london  wherein he  hath set down all  without omitting anything  and therefore at this time i  do pass by it         chapter   xxi     how panurge was in love with a lady of paris     panurge began to be in great reputation in the city of paris by means of  this disputation wherein he prevailed against the englishman  and from  thenceforth made his codpiece to be very useful to him   to which effect he  had it pinked with pretty little embroideries after the romanesca fashion   and the world did praise him publicly  in so far that there was a song made  of him  which little children did use to sing when they were to fetch  mustard   he was withal made welcome in all companies of ladies and  gentlewomen  so that at last he became presumptuous  and went about to  bring to his lure one of the greatest ladies in the city   and  indeed   leaving a rabble of long prologues and protestations  which ordinarily  these dolent contemplative lent lovers make who never meddle with the  flesh  one day he said unto her  madam  it would be a very great benefit to  the commonwealth  delightful to you  honourable to your progeny  and  necessary for me  that i cover you for the propagating of my race  and  believe it  for experience will teach it you   the lady at this word thrust  him back above a hundred leagues  saying  you mischievous fool  is it for  you to talk thus unto me   whom do you think you have in hand   begone   never to come in my sight again  for  if one thing were not  i would have  your legs and arms cut off   well  said he  that were all one to me  to  want both legs and arms  provided you and i had but one merry bout together  at the brangle buttock game  for herewithin is  in showing her his long  codpiece  master john thursday  who will play you such an antic that you  shall feel the sweetness thereof even to the very marrow of your bones   he  is a gallant  and doth so well know how to find out all the corners   creeks  and ingrained inmates in your carnal trap  that after him there  needs no broom  he ll sweep so well before  and leave nothing to his  followers to work upon   whereunto the lady answered  go  villain  go   if  you speak to me one such word more  i will cry out and make you to be  knocked down with blows   ha  said he  you are not so bad as you say  no   or else i am deceived in your physiognomy   for sooner shall the earth  mount up unto the heavens  and the highest heavens descend unto the hells   and all the course of nature be quite perverted  than that in so great  beauty and neatness as in you is there should be one drop of gall or  malice   they say  indeed  that hardly shall a man ever see a fair woman  that is not also stubborn   yet that is spoke only of those vulgar  beauties  but yours is so excellent  so singular  and so heavenly  that i  believe nature hath given it you as a paragon and masterpiece of her art   to make us know what she can do when she will employ all her skill and all  her power   there is nothing in you but honey  but sugar  but a sweet and  celestial manna   to you it was to whom paris ought to have adjudged the  golden apple  not to venus  no  nor to juno  nor to minerva  for never was  there so much magnificence in juno  so much wisdom in minerva  nor so much  comeliness in venus as there is in you   o heavenly gods and goddesses   how happy shall that man be to whom you will grant the favour to embrace  her  to kiss her  and to rub his bacon with hers   by g    that shall be i   i know it well  for she loves me already her bellyful  i am sure of it  and  so was i predestinated to it by the fairies   and therefore  that we lose  no time  put on  thrust out your gammons   and would have embraced her  but  she made as if she would put out her head at the window to call her  neighbours for help   then panurge on a sudden ran out  and in his running  away said  madam  stay here till i come again  i will go call them myself   do not you take so much pains   thus went he away  not much caring for the  repulse he had got  nor made he any whit the worse cheer for it   the next  day he came to the church at the time she went to mass   at the door he  gave her some of the holy water  bowing himself very low before her   afterwards he kneeled down by her very familiarly and said unto her  madam   know that i am so amorous of you that i can neither piss nor dung for love   i do not know  lady  what you mean  but if i should take any hurt by it   how much you would be to blame   go  said she  go   i do not care  let me  alone to say my prayers   ay but  said he  equivocate upon this   a beau  mont le viconte  or  to fair mount the prick cunts   i cannot  said she   it is  said he  a beau con le vit monte  or to a fair c     the pr      mounts   and upon this  pray to god to give you that which your noble  heart desireth  and i pray you give me these paternosters   take them  said  she  and trouble me no longer   this done  she would have taken off her  paternosters  which were made of a kind of yellow stone called cestrin  and  adorned with great spots of gold  but panurge nimbly drew out one of his  knives  wherewith he cut them off very handsomely  and whilst he was going  away to carry them to the brokers  he said to her  will you have my knife   no  no  said she   but  said he  to the purpose   i am at your commandment   body and goods  tripes and bowels     in the meantime the lady was not very well content with the want of her  paternosters  for they were one of her implements to keep her countenance  by in the church  then thought with herself  this bold flouting roister is  some giddy  fantastical  light headed fool of a strange country   i shall  never recover my paternosters again   what will my husband say   he will no  doubt be angry with me   but i will tell him that a thief hath cut them off  from my hands in the church  which he will easily believe  seeing the end  of the ribbon left at my girdle   after dinner panurge went to see her   carrying in his sleeve a great purse full of palace crowns  called  counters  and began to say unto her  which of us two loveth other best  you  me  or i you   whereunto she answered  as for me  i do not hate you  for   as god commands  i love all the world   but to the purpose  said he  are  not you in love with me   i have  said she  told you so many times already  that you should talk so no more to me  and if you speak of it again i will  teach you that i am not one to be talked unto dishonestly   get you hence  packing  and deliver me my paternosters  that my husband may not ask me for  them     how now  madam  said he  your paternosters   nay  by mine oath  i will not  do so  but i will give you others   had you rather have them of gold well  enamelled in great round knobs  or after the manner of love knots  or   otherwise  all massive  like great ingots  or if you had rather have them  of ebony  of jacinth  or of grained gold  with the marks of fine  turquoises  or of fair topazes  marked with fine sapphires  or of baleu  rubies  with great marks of diamonds of eight and twenty squares   no  no   all this is too little   i know a fair bracelet of fine emeralds  marked  with spotted ambergris  and at the buckle a persian pearl as big as an  orange   it will not cost above five and twenty thousand ducats   i will  make you a present of it  for i have ready coin enough   and withal he made  a noise with his counters  as if they had been french crowns     will you have a piece of velvet  either of the violet colour or of crimson  dyed in grain  or a piece of broached or crimson satin   will you have  chains  gold  tablets  rings   you need no more but say  yes  so far as  fifty thousand ducats may reach  it is but as nothing to me   by the virtue  of which words he made the water come in her mouth  but she said unto him   no  i thank you  i will have nothing of you   by g    said he  but i will  have somewhat of you  yet shall it be that which shall cost you nothing   neither shall you have a jot the less when you have given it   hold     showing his long codpiece  this is master john goodfellow  that asks for  lodging   and with that would have embraced her  but she began to cry out   yet not very loud   then panurge put off his counterfeit garb  changed his  false visage  and said unto her  you will not then otherwise let me do a  little   a turd for you   you do not deserve so much good  nor so much  honour  but  by g    i will make the dogs ride you   and with this he ran  away as fast as he could  for fear of blows  whereof he was naturally  fearful         chapter   xxii     how panurge served a parisian lady a trick that pleased her not very well     now you must note that the next day was the great festival of corpus  christi  called the sacre  wherein all women put on their best apparel  and  on that day the said lady was clothed in a rich gown of crimson satin   under which she wore a very costly white velvet petticoat     the day of the eve  called the vigil  panurge searched so long of one side  and another that he found a hot or salt bitch  which  when he had tied her  with his girdle  he led to his chamber and fed her very well all that day  and night   in the morning thereafter he killed her  and took that part of  her which the greek geomancers know  and cut it into several small pieces  as small as he could   then  carrying it away as close as might be  he went  to the place where the lady was to come along to follow the procession  as  the custom is upon the said holy day  and when she came in panurge  sprinkled some holy water on her  saluting her very courteously   then  a  little while after she had said her petty devotions  he sat down close by  her upon the same bench  and gave her this roundelay in writing  in manner  as followeth       a roundelay       for this one time  that i to you my love    discovered  you did too cruel prove     to send me packing  hopeless  and so soon     who never any wrong to you had done     in any kind of action  word  or thought     so that  if my suit liked you not  you ought    t  have spoke more civilly  and to this sense     my friend  be pleased to depart from hence       for this one time       what hurt do i  to wish you to remark     with favour and compassion  how a spark    of your great beauty hath inflamed my heart    with deep affection  and that  for my part     i only ask that you with me would dance    the brangle gay in feats of dalliance       for this one time     and  as she was opening this paper to see what it was  panurge very  promptly and lightly scattered the drug that he had upon her in divers  places  but especially in the plaits of her sleeves and of her gown   then  said he unto her  madam  the poor lovers are not always at ease   as for  me  i hope that those heavy nights  those pains and troubles  which i  suffer for love of you  shall be a deduction to me of so much pain in  purgatory  yet  at the least  pray to god to give me patience in my misery   panurge had no sooner spoke this but all the dogs that were in the church  came running to this lady with the smell of the drugs that he had strewed  upon her  both small and great  big and little  all came  laying out their  member  smelling to her  and pissing everywhere upon her  it was the  greatest villainy in the world   panurge made the fashion of driving them  away  then took his leave of her and withdrew himself into some chapel or  oratory of the said church to see the sport  for these villainous dogs did  compiss all her habiliments  and left none of her attire unbesprinkled with  their staling  insomuch that a tall greyhound pissed upon her head  others  in her sleeves  others on her crupper piece  and the little ones pissed  upon her pataines  so that all the women that were round about her had much  ado to save her   whereat panurge very heartily laughing  he said to one of  the lords of the city  i believe that same lady is hot  or else that some  greyhound hath covered her lately   and when he saw that all the dogs were  flocking about her  yarring at the retardment of their access to her  and  every way keeping such a coil with her as they are wont to do about a proud  or salt bitch  he forthwith departed from thence  and went to call  pantagruel  not forgetting in his way alongst the streets through which he  went  where he found any dogs to give them a bang with his foot  saying   will you not go with your fellows to the wedding   away  hence  avant   avant  with a devil avant   and being come home  he said to pantagruel   master  i pray you come and see all the dogs of the country  how they are  assembled about a lady  the fairest in the city  and would duffle and line  her   whereunto pantagruel willingly condescended  and saw the mystery   which he found very pretty and strange   but the best was at the  procession  in which were seen above six hundred thousand and fourteen dogs  about her  which did very much trouble and molest her  and whithersoever  she passed  those dogs that came afresh  tracing her footsteps  followed  her at the heels  and pissed in the way where her gown had touched   all  the world stood gazing at this spectacle  considering the countenance of  those dogs  who  leaping up  got about her neck and spoiled all her  gorgeous accoutrements  for the which she could find no remedy but to  retire unto her house  which was a palace   thither she went  and the dogs  after her  she ran to hide herself  but the chambermaids could not abstain  from laughing   when she was entered into the house and had shut the door  upon herself  all the dogs came running of half a league round  and did so  well bepiss the gate of her house that there they made a stream with their  urine wherein a duck might have very well swimmed  and it is the same  current that now runs at st  victor  in which gobelin dyeth scarlet  for  the specifical virtue of these piss dogs  as our master doribus did  heretofore preach publicly   so may god help you  a mill would have ground  corn with it   yet not so much as those of basacle at toulouse         chapter   xxiii     how pantagruel departed from paris  hearing news that the dipsodes had  invaded the land of the amaurots  and the cause wherefore the leagues are  so short in france     a little while after pantagruel heard news that his father gargantua had  been translated into the land of the fairies by morgue  as heretofore were  ogier and arthur  as also   in the original edition it stands  together   and that    m   that the report of his translation being spread abroad  the  dipsodes had issued out beyond their borders  with inroads had wasted a  great part of utopia  and at that very time had besieged the great city of  the amaurots   whereupon departing from paris without bidding any man  farewell  for the business required diligence  he came to rouen     now pantagruel in his journey seeing that the leagues of that little  territory about paris called france were very short in regard of those of  other countries  demanded the cause and reason of it from panurge  who told  him a story which marotus of the lac  monachus  set down in the acts of the  kings of canarre  saying that in old times countries were not distinguished  into leagues  miles  furlongs  nor parasangs  until that king pharamond  divided them  which was done in manner as followeth   the said king chose  at paris a hundred fair  gallant  lusty  brisk young men  all resolute and  bold adventurers in cupid s duels  together with a hundred comely  pretty   handsome  lovely and well complexioned wenches of picardy  all which he  caused to be well entertained and highly fed for the space of eight days   then having called for them  he delivered to every one of the young men his  wench  with store of money to defray their charges  and this injunction  besides  to go unto divers places here and there   and wheresoever they  should biscot and thrum their wenches  that  they setting a stone there  it  should be accounted for a league   thus went away those brave fellows and  sprightly blades most merrily  and because they were fresh and had been at  rest  they very often jummed and fanfreluched almost at every field s end   and this is the cause why the leagues about paris are so short   but when  they had gone a great way  and were now as weary as poor devils  all the  oil in their lamps being almost spent  they did not chink and duffle so  often  but contented themselves  i mean for the men s part  with one scurvy  paltry bout in a day  and this is that which makes the leagues in brittany   delanes  germany  and other more remote countries so long   other men give  other reasons for it  but this seems to me of all other the best   to which  pantagruel willingly adhered   parting from rouen  they arrived at  honfleur  where they took shipping  pantagruel  panurge  epistemon   eusthenes  and carpalin     in which place  waiting for a favourable wind  and caulking their ship   he received from a lady of paris  which i  he  had formerly kept and  entertained a good long time  a letter directed on the outside thus     to the best beloved of the fair women  and least loyal of the valiant men    p n t g r l         chapter   xxiv     a letter which a messenger brought to pantagruel from a lady of paris   together with the exposition of a posy written in a gold ring     when pantagruel had read the superscription he was much amazed  and  therefore demanded of the said messenger the name of her that had sent it   then opened he the letter  and found nothing written in it  nor otherwise  enclosed  but only a gold ring  with a square table diamond   wondering at  this  he called panurge to him  and showed him the case   whereupon panurge  told him that the leaf of paper was written upon  but with such cunning and  artifice that no man could see the writing at the first sight  therefore   to find it out  he set it by the fire to see if it was made with sal  ammoniac soaked in water   then put he it into the water  to see if the  letter was written with the juice of tithymalle   after that he held it up  against the candle  to see if it was written with the juice of white  onions     then he rubbed one part of it with oil of nuts  to see if it were not  written with the lee of a fig tree  and another part of it with the milk of  a woman giving suck to her eldest daughter  to see if it was written with  the blood of red toads or green earth frogs   afterwards he rubbed one  corner with the ashes of a swallow s nest  to see if it were not written  with the dew that is found within the herb alcakengy  called the  winter cherry   he rubbed  after that  one end with ear wax  to see if it  were not written with the gall of a raven   then did he dip it into vinegar   to try if it was not written with the juice of the garden spurge   after  that he greased it with the fat of a bat or flittermouse  to see if it was  not written with the sperm of a whale  which some call ambergris   then put  it very fairly into a basinful of fresh water  and forthwith took it out  to  see whether it were written with stone alum   but after all experiments   when he perceived that he could find out nothing  he called the messenger  and asked him  good fellow  the lady that sent thee hither  did she not give  thee a staff to bring with thee  thinking that it had been according to the  conceit whereof aulus gellius maketh mention   and the messenger answered  him  no  sir   then panurge would have caused his head to be shaven  to see  whether the lady had written upon his bald pate  with the hard lye whereof  soap is made  that which she meant  but  perceiving that his hair was very  long  he forbore  considering that it could not have grown to so great a  length in so short a time     then he said to pantagruel  master  by the virtue of g    i cannot tell  what to do nor say in it   for  to know whether there be anything written  upon this or no  i have made use of a good part of that which master  francisco di nianto  the tuscan  sets down  who hath written the manner of  reading letters that do not appear  that which zoroastes published  peri  grammaton acriton  and calphurnius bassus  de literis illegibilibus   but i  can see nothing  nor do i believe that there is anything else in it than  the ring   let us  therefore  look upon it   which when they had done  they  found this in hebrew written within  lamach saba ch thani  whereupon they  called epistemon  and asked him what that meant   to which he answered that  they were hebrew words  signifying  wherefore hast thou forsaken me   upon  that panurge suddenly replied  i know the mystery   do you see this  diamond   it is a false one   this  then  is the exposition of that which  the lady means  diamant faux  that is  false lover  why hast thou forsaken  me   which interpretation pantagruel presently understood  and withal  remembering that at his departure he had not bid the lady farewell  he was  very sorry  and would fain have returned to paris to make his peace with  her   but epistemon put him in mind of aeneas s departure from dido  and  the saying of heraclitus of tarentum  that the ship being at anchor  when  need requireth we must cut the cable rather than lose time about untying of  it   and that he should lay aside all other thoughts to succour the city of  his nativity  which was then in danger   and  indeed  within an hour after  that the wind arose at the north north west  wherewith they hoist sail  and  put out  even into the main sea  so that within few days  passing by porto  sancto and by the madeiras  they went ashore in the canary islands   parting from thence  they passed by capobianco  by senege  by capoverde  by  gambre  by sagres  by melli  by the cap di buona speranza  and set ashore  again in the kingdom of melinda   parting from thence  they sailed away  with a tramontane or northerly wind  passing by meden  by uti  by uden  by  gelasim  by the isles of the fairies  and alongst the kingdom of achorie   till at last they arrived at the port of utopia  distant from the city of  the amaurots three leagues and somewhat more     when they were ashore  and pretty well refreshed  pantagruel said   gentlemen  the city is not far from hence  therefore  were it not amiss   before we set forward  to advise well what is to be done  that we be not  like the athenians  who never took counsel until after the fact   are you  resolved to live and die with me   yes  sir  said they all  and be as  confident of us as of your own fingers   well  said he  there is but one  thing that keeps my mind in great doubt and suspense  which is this  that i  know not in what order nor of what number the enemy is that layeth siege to  the city  for  if i were certain of that  i should go forward and set on  with the better assurance   let us therefore consult together  and bethink  ourselves by what means we may come to this intelligence   whereunto they  all said  let us go thither and see  and stay you here for us  for this  very day  without further respite  do we make account to bring you a  certain report thereof     myself  said panurge  will undertake to enter into their camp  within the  very midst of their guards  unespied by their watch  and merrily feast and  lecher it at their cost  without being known of any  to see the artillery  and the tents of all the captains  and thrust myself in with a grave and  magnific carriage amongst all their troops and companies  without being  discovered   the devil would not be able to peck me out with all his  circumventions  for i am of the race of zopyrus     and i  said epistemon  know all the plots and strategems of the valiant  captains and warlike champions of former ages  together with all the tricks  and subtleties of the art of war   i will go  and  though i be detected and  revealed  i will escape by making them believe of you whatever i please   for i am of the race of sinon     i  said eusthenes  will enter and set upon them in their trenches  in spite  of their sentries and all their guards  for i will tread upon their bellies  and break their legs and arms  yea  though they were every whit as strong  as the devil himself  for i am of the race of hercules     and i  said carpalin  will get in there if the birds can enter  for i am so  nimble of body  and light withal  that i shall have leaped over their  trenches  and ran clean through all their camp  before that they perceive  me  neither do i fear shot  nor arrow  nor horse  how swift soever  were he  the pegasus of perseus or pacolet  being assured that i shall be able to  make a safe and sound escape before them all without any hurt   i will  undertake to walk upon the ears of corn or grass in the meadows  without  making either of them do so much as bow under me  for i am of the race of  camilla the amazon         chapter   xxv     how panurge  carpalin  eusthenes  and epistemon  the gentlemen attendants  of pantagruel  vanquished and discomfited six hundred and threescore  horsemen very cunningly     as he was speaking this  they perceived six hundred and threescore light  horsemen  gallantly mounted  who made an outroad thither to see what ship  it was that was newly arrived in the harbour  and came in a full gallop to  take them if they had been able   then said pantagruel  my lads  retire  yourselves unto the ship  here are some of our enemies coming apace  but i  will kill them here before you like beasts  although they were ten times so  many  in the meantime  withdraw yourselves  and take your sport at it   then answered panurge  no  sir  there is no reason that you should do so   but  on the contrary  retire you unto the ship  both you and the rest  for  i alone will here discomfit them  but we must not linger  come  set  forward   whereunto the others said  it is well advised  sir  withdraw  yourself  and we will help panurge here  so shall you know what we are able  to do   then said pantagruel  well  i am content  but  if that you be too  weak  i will not fail to come to your assistance   with this panurge took  two great cables of the ship and tied them to the kemstock or capstan which  was on the deck towards the hatches  and fastened them in the ground   making a long circuit  the one further off  the other within that   then  said he to epistemon  go aboard the ship  and  when i give you a call  turn  about the capstan upon the orlop diligently  drawing unto you the two  cable ropes  and said to eusthenes and to carpalin  my bullies  stay you  here  and offer yourselves freely to your enemies   do as they bid you  and  make as if you would yield unto them  but take heed you come not within the  compass of the ropes  be sure to keep yourselves free of them   and  presently he went aboard the ship  and took a bundle of straw and a barrel  of gunpowder  strewed it round about the compass of the cords  and stood by  with a brand of fire or match lighted in his hand   presently came the  horsemen with great fury  and the foremost ran almost home to the ship   and  by reason of the slipperiness of the bank  they fell  they and their  horses  to the number of four and forty  which the rest seeing  came on   thinking that resistance had been made them at their arrival   but panurge  said unto them  my masters  i believe that you have hurt yourselves  i pray  you pardon us  for it is not our fault  but the slipperiness of the  sea water that is always flowing  we submit ourselves to your good pleasure   so said likewise his two other fellows  and epistemon that was upon the  deck   in the meantime panurge withdrew himself  and seeing that they were  all within the compass of the cables  and that his two companions were  retired  making room for all those horses which came in a crowd  thronging  upon the neck of one another to see the ship and such as were in it  cried  out on a sudden to epistemon  draw  draw   then began epistemon to wind  about the capstan  by doing whereof the two cables so entangled and  empestered the legs of the horses  that they were all of them thrown down  to the ground easily  together with their riders   but they  seeing that   drew their swords  and would have cut them  whereupon panurge set fire to  the train  and there burnt them up all like damned souls  both men and  horses  not one escaping save one alone  who being mounted on a fleet  turkey courser  by mere speed in flight got himself out of the circle of  the ropes   but when carpalin perceived him  he ran after him with such  nimbleness and celerity that he overtook him in less than a hundred paces   then  leaping close behind him upon the crupper of his horse  clasped him  in his arms  and brought him back to the ship     this exploit being ended  pantagruel was very jovial  and wondrously  commended the industry of these gentlemen  whom he called his  fellow soldiers  and made them refresh themselves and feed well and merrily  upon the seashore  and drink heartily with their bellies upon the ground   and their prisoner with them  whom they admitted to that familiarity  only  that the poor devil was somewhat afraid that pantagruel would have eaten him  up whole  which  considering the wideness of his mouth and capacity of his  throat was no great matter for him to have done  for he could have done it  as easily as you would eat a small comfit  he showing no more in his throat  than would a grain of millet seed in the mouth of an ass         chapter   xxvi     how pantagruel and his company were weary in eating still salt meats  and  how carpalin went a hunting to have some venison     thus as they talked and chatted together  carpalin said  and  by the belly  of st  quenet  shall we never eat any venison   this salt meat makes me  horribly dry   i will go fetch you a quarter of one of those horses which  we have burnt  it is well roasted already   as he was rising up to go about  it  he perceived under the side of a wood a fair great roebuck  which was  come out of his fort  as i conceive  at the sight of panurge s fire   him  did he pursue and run after with as much vigour and swiftness as if it had  been a bolt out of a crossbow  and caught him in a moment  and whilst he  was in his course he with his hands took in the air four great bustards   seven bitterns  six and twenty grey partridges  two and thirty red legged  ones  sixteen pheasants  nine woodcocks  nineteen herons  two and thirty  cushats and ringdoves  and with his feet killed ten or twelve hares and  rabbits  which were then at relief and pretty big withal  eighteen rails in  a knot together  with fifteen young wild boars  two little beavers  and  three great foxes   so  striking the kid with his falchion athwart the  head  he killed him  and  bearing him on his back  he in his return took up  his hares  rails  and young wild boars  and  as far off as he could be  heard  cried out and said  panurge  my friend  vinegar  vinegar   then the  good pantagruel  thinking he had fainted  commanded them to provide him  some vinegar  but panurge knew well that there was some good prey in hands   and forthwith showed unto noble pantagruel how he was bearing upon his back  a fair roebuck  and all his girdle bordered with hares   then immediately  did epistemon make  in the name of the nine muses  nine antique wooden  spits   eusthenes did help to flay  and panurge placed two great cuirassier  saddles in such sort that they served for andirons  and making their  prisoner to be their cook  they roasted their venison by the fire wherein  the horsemen were burnt  and making great cheer with a good deal of  vinegar  the devil a one of them did forbear from his victuals  it was a  triumphant and incomparable spectacle to see how they ravened and devoured   then said pantagruel  would to god every one of you had two pairs of little  anthem or sacring bells hanging at your chin  and that i had at mine the  great clocks of rennes  of poictiers  of tours  and of cambray  to see what  a peal they would ring with the wagging of our chaps   but  said panurge   it were better we thought a little upon our business  and by what means we  might get the upper hand of our enemies   that is well remembered  said  pantagruel   therefore spoke he thus to the prisoner  my friend  tell us  here the truth  and do not lie to us at all  if thou wouldst not be flayed  alive  for it is i that eat the little children   relate unto us at full  the order  the number  and the strength of the army   to which the prisoner  answered  sir  know for a truth that in the army there are three hundred  giants  all armed with armour of proof  and wonderful great   nevertheless   not fully so great as you  except one that is their head  named loupgarou   who is armed from head to foot with cyclopical anvils   furthermore  one  hundred three score and three thousand foot  all armed with the skins of  hobgoblins  strong and valiant men  eleven thousand four hundred  men at arms or cuirassiers  three thousand six hundred double cannons  and  arquebusiers without number  four score and fourteen thousand pioneers  one  hundred and fifty thousand whores  fair like goddesses   that is for me   said panurge   whereof some are amazons  some lionnoises  others  parisiennes  taurangelles  angevines  poictevines  normandes  and high  dutch  there are of them of all countries and all languages     yea but  said pantagruel  is the king there   yes  sir  said the prisoner   he is there in person  and we call him anarchus  king of the dipsodes   which is as much to say as thirsty people  for you never saw men more  thirsty  nor more willing to drink  and his tent is guarded by the giants   it is enough  said pantagruel   come  brave boys  are you resolved to go  with me   to which panurge answered  god confound him that leaves you   i  have already bethought myself how i will kill them all like pigs  and so  the devil one leg of them shall escape   but i am somewhat troubled about  one thing   and what is that  said pantagruel   it is  said panurge  how i  shall be able to set forward to the justling and bragmardizing of all the  whores that be there this afternoon  in such sort that there escape not one  unbumped by me  breasted and jummed after the ordinary fashion of man and  women in the venetian conflict   ha  ha  ha  ha  said pantagruel     and carpalin said   the devil take these sink holes  if  by g    i do not  bumbaste some one of them   then said eusthenes   what  shall not i have  any  whose paces  since we came from rouen  were never so well winded up as  that my needle could mount to ten or eleven o clock  till now that i have  it hard  stiff  and strong  like a hundred devils   truly  said panurge   thou shalt have of the fattest  and of those that are most plump and in the  best case     how now  said epistemon  everyone shall ride  and i must lead the ass   the  devil take him that will do so   we will make use of the right of war  qui  potest capere  capiat   no  no  said panurge  but tie thine ass to a crook   and ride as the world doth   and the good pantagruel laughed at all this   and said unto them  you reckon without your host   i am much afraid that   before it be night  i shall see you in such taking that you will have no  great stomach to ride  but more like to be rode upon with sound blows of  pike and lance   baste  said epistemon  enough of that   i will not fail to  bring them to you  either to roast or boil  to fry or put in paste   they  are not so many in number as were in the army of xerxes  for he had thirty  hundred thousand fighting men  if you will believe herodotus and trogus  pompeius  and yet themistocles with a few men overthrew them all   for  god s sake  take you no care for that   cobsminny  cobsminny  said panurge   my codpiece alone shall suffice to overthrow all the men  and my st   sweephole  that dwells within it  shall lay all the women squat upon their  backs   up then  my lads  said pantagruel  and let us march along         chapter   xxvii     how pantagruel set up one trophy in memorial of their valour  and panurge  another in remembrance of the hares   how pantagruel likewise with his  farts begat little men  and with his fisgs little women  and how panurge  broke a great staff over two glasses     before we depart hence  said pantagruel  in remembrance of the exploit that  you have now performed i will in this place erect a fair trophy   then  every man amongst them  with great joy and fine little country songs  set  up a huge big post  whereunto they hanged a great cuirassier saddle  the  fronstal of a barbed horse  bridle bosses  pulley pieces for the knees   stirrup leathers  spurs  stirrups  a coat of mail  a corslet tempered with  steel  a battle axe  a strong  short  and sharp horseman s sword  a  gauntlet  a horseman s mace  gushet armour for the armpits  leg harness   and a gorget  with all other furniture needful for the decorement of a  triumphant arch  in sign of a trophy   and then pantagruel  for an eternal  memorial  wrote this victorial ditton  as followeth         here was the prowess made apparent of    four brave and valiant champions of proof     who  without any arms but wit  at once     like fabius  or the two scipions     burnt in a fire six hundred and threescore    crablice  strong rogues ne er vanquished before     by this each king may learn  rook  pawn  and knight     that sleight is much more prevalent than might         for victory       as all men see       hangs on the ditty      of that committee      where the great god      hath his abode       nor doth he it to strong and great men give     but to his elect  as we must believe     therefore shall he obtain wealth and esteem     who thorough faith doth put his trust in him     whilst pantagruel was writing these foresaid verses  panurge halved and  fixed upon a great stake the horns of a roebuck  together with the skin and  the right forefoot thereof  the ears of three leverets  the chine of a  coney  the jaws of a hare  the wings of two bustards  the feet of four  queest doves  a bottle or borracho full of vinegar  a horn wherein to put  salt  a wooden spit  a larding stick  a scurvy kettle full of holes  a  dripping pan to make sauce in  an earthen salt cellar  and a goblet of  beauvais   then  in imitation of pantagruel s verses and trophy  wrote that  which followeth         here was it that four jovial blades sat down    to a profound carousing  and to crown    their banquet with those wines which please best great    bacchus  the monarch of their drinking state     then were the reins and furch of a young hare     with salt and vinegar  displayed there     of which to snatch a bit or two at once    they all fell on like hungry scorpions         for th  inventories      of defensories      say that in heat      we must drink neat      all out  and of      the choicest stuff       but it is bad to eat of young hare s flesh     unless with vinegar we it refresh     receive this tenet  then  without control     that vinegar of that meat is the soul     then said pantagruel  come  my lads  let us begone  we have stayed here too  long about our victuals  for very seldom doth it fall out that the greatest  eaters do the most martial exploits   there is no shadow like that of  flying colours  no smoke like that of horses  no clattering like that of  armour   at this epistemon began to smile  and said  there is no shadow  like that of the kitchen  no smoke like that of pasties  and no clattering  like that of goblets   unto which answered panurge  there is no shadow like  that of curtains  no smoke like that of women s breasts  and no clattering  like that of ballocks   then forthwith rising up he gave a fart  a leap   and a whistle  and most joyfully cried out aloud  ever live pantagruel   when pantagruel saw that  he would have done as much  but with the fart  that he let the earth trembled nine leagues about  wherewith and with the  corrupted air he begot above three and fifty thousand little men   ill favoured dwarfs  and with one fisg that he let he made as many little  women  crouching down  as you shall see in divers places  which never grow  but like cow s tails  downwards  or  like the limosin radishes  round   how  now  said panurge  are your farts so fertile and fruitful   by g    here be  brave farted men and fisgued women  let them be married together  they will  beget fine hornets and dorflies   so did pantagruel  and called them  pigmies   those he sent to live in an island thereby  where since that time  they are increased mightily   but the cranes make war with them  continually  against which they do most courageously defend themselves  for  these little ends of men and dandiprats  whom in scotland they call  whiphandles and knots of a tar barrel  are commonly very testy and  choleric  the physical reason whereof is  because their heart is near their  spleen     at this same time panurge took two drinking glasses that were there  both  of one bigness  and filled them with water up to the brim  and set one of  them upon one stool and the other upon another  placing them about one foot  from one another   then he took the staff of a javelin  about five foot and  a half long  and put it upon the two glasses  so that the two ends of the  staff did come just to the brims of the glasses   this done  he took a  great stake or billet of wood  and said to pantagruel and to the rest  my  masters  behold how easily we shall have the victory over our enemies  for  just as i shall break this staff here upon these glasses  without either  breaking or crazing of them  nay  which is more  without spilling one drop  of the water that is within them  even so shall we break the heads of our  dipsodes without receiving any of us any wound or loss in our person or  goods   but  that you may not think there is any witchcraft in this  hold   said he to eusthenes  strike upon the midst as hard as thou canst with this  log   eusthenes did so  and the staff broke in two pieces  and not one drop  of the water fell out of the glasses   then said he  i know a great many  such other tricks  let us now therefore march boldly and with assurance         chapter   xxviii     how pantagruel got the victory very strangely over the dipsodes and the  giants     after all this talk  pantagruel took the prisoner to him and sent him away   saying  go thou unto thy king in his camp  and tell him tidings of what  thou hast seen  and let him resolve to feast me to morrow about noon  for   as soon as my galleys shall come  which will be to morrow at furthest  i  will prove unto him by eighteen hundred thousand fighting men and seven  thousand giants  all of them greater than i am  that he hath done foolishly  and against reason thus to invade my country   wherein pantagruel feigned  that he had an army at sea   but the prisoner answered that he would yield  himself to be his slave  and that he was content never to return to his own  people  but rather with pantagruel to fight against them  and for god s  sake besought him that he might be permitted so to do   whereunto  pantagruel would not give consent  but commanded him to depart thence  speedily and begone as he had told him  and to that effect gave him a  boxful of euphorbium  together with some grains of the black chameleon  thistle  steeped into aqua vitae  and made up into the condiment of a wet  sucket  commanding him to carry it to his king  and to say unto him  that  if he were able to eat one ounce of that without drinking after it  he  might then be able to resist him without any fear or apprehension of  danger     the prisoner then besought him with joined hands that in the hour of the  battle he would have compassion upon him   whereat pantagruel said unto  him  after that thou hast delivered all unto the king  put thy whole  confidence in god  and he will not forsake thee  because  although for my  part i be mighty  as thou mayst see  and have an infinite number of men in  arms  i do nevertheless trust neither in my force nor in mine industry  but  all my confidence is in god my protector  who doth never forsake those that  in him do put their trust and confidence   this done  the prisoner  requested him that he would afford him some reasonable composition for his  ransom   to which pantagruel answered  that his end was not to rob nor  ransom men  but to enrich them and reduce them to total liberty   go thy  way  said he  in the peace of the living god  and never follow evil  company  lest some mischief befall thee   the prisoner being gone   pantagruel said to his men  gentlemen  i have made this prisoner believe  that we have an army at sea  as also that we will not assault them till  to morrow at noon  to the end that they  doubting of the great arrival of  our men  may spend this night in providing and strengthening themselves   but in the meantime my intention is that we charge them about the hour  of the first sleep     let us leave pantagruel here with his apostles  and speak of king anarchus  and his army   when the prisoner was come he went unto the king and told  him how there was a great giant come  called pantagruel  who had overthrown  and made to be cruelly roasted all the six hundred and nine and fifty  horsemen  and he alone escaped to bring the news   besides that  he was  charged by the said giant to tell him that the next day  about noon  he  must make a dinner ready for him  for at that hour he was resolved to set  upon him   then did he give him that box wherein were those confitures   but as soon as he had swallowed down one spoonful of them  he was taken  with such a heat in the throat  together with an ulceration in the flap of  the top of the windpipe  that his tongue peeled with it in such sort that   for all they could do unto him  he found no ease at all but by drinking  only without cessation  for as soon as ever he took the goblet from his  head  his tongue was on a fire  and therefore they did nothing but still  pour in wine into his throat with a funnel   which when his captains   bashaws  and guard of his body did see  they tasted of the same drugs to  try whether they were so thirst procuring and alterative or no   but it so  befell them as it had done their king  and they plied the flagon so well  that the noise ran throughout all the camp  how the prisoner was returned   that the next day they were to have an assault  that the king and his  captains did already prepare themselves for it  together with his guards   and that with carousing lustily and quaffing as hard as they could   every  man  therefore  in the army began to tipple  ply the pot  swill and guzzle  it as fast as they could   in sum  they drunk so much  and so long  that  they fell asleep like pigs  all out of order throughout the whole camp     let us now return to the good pantagruel  and relate how he carried himself  in this business   departing from the place of the trophies  he took the  mast of their ship in his hand like a pilgrim s staff  and put within the  top of it two hundred and seven and thirty puncheons of white wine of  anjou  the rest was of rouen  and tied up to his girdle the bark all full  of salt  as easily as the lansquenets carry their little panniers  and so  set onward on his way with his fellow soldiers   when he was come near to  the enemy s camp  panurge said unto him  sir  if you would do well  let  down this white wine of anjou from the scuttle of the mast of the ship   that we may all drink thereof  like bretons     hereunto pantagruel very willingly consented  and they drank so neat that  there was not so much as one poor drop left of two hundred and seven and  thirty puncheons  except one boracho or leathern bottle of tours which  panurge filled for himself  for he called that his vademecum  and some  scurvy lees of wine in the bottom  which served him instead of vinegar   after they had whittled and curried the can pretty handsomely  panurge gave  pantagruel to eat some devilish drugs compounded of lithotripton  which is  a stone dissolving ingredient  nephrocatarticon  that purgeth the reins   the marmalade of quinces  called codiniac  a confection of cantharides   which are green flies breeding on the tops of olive trees  and other kinds  of diuretic or piss procuring simples   this done  pantagruel said to  carpalin  go into the city  scrambling like a cat against the wall  as you  can well do  and tell them that now presently they come out and charge  their enemies as rudely as they can  and having said so  come down  taking  a lighted torch with you  wherewith you shall set on fire all the tents and  pavilions in the camp  then cry as loud as you are able with your great  voice  and then come away from thence   yea but  said carpalin  were it not  good to cloy all their ordnance   no  no  said pantagruel  only blow up all  their powder   carpalin  obeying him  departed suddenly and did as he was  appointed by pantagruel  and all the combatants came forth that were in the  city  and when he had set fire in the tents and pavilions  he passed so  lightly through them  and so highly and profoundly did they snort and  sleep  that they never perceived him   he came to the place where their  artillery was  and set their munition on fire   but here was the danger   the fire was so sudden that poor carpalin had almost been burnt   and had  it not been for his wonderful agility he had been fried like a roasting  pig   but he departed away so speedily that a bolt or arrow out of a  crossbow could not have had a swifter motion   when he was clear of their  trenches  he shouted aloud  and cried out so dreadfully  and with such  amazement to the hearers  that it seemed all the devils of hell had been  let loose   at which noise the enemies awaked  but can you tell how   even  no less astonished than are monks at the ringing of the first peal to  matins  which in lusonnois is called rub ballock     in the meantime pantagruel began to sow the salt that he had in his bark   and because they slept with an open gaping mouth  he filled all their  throats with it  so that those poor wretches were by it made to cough like  foxes   ha  pantagruel  how thou addest greater heat to the firebrand that  is in us   suddenly pantagruel had will to piss  by means of the drugs  which panurge had given him  and pissed amidst the camp so well and so  copiously that he drowned them all  and there was a particular deluge ten  leagues round about  of such considerable depth that the history saith  if  his father s great mare had been there  and pissed likewise  it would  undoubtedly have been a more enormous deluge than that of deucalion  for  she did never piss but she made a river greater than is either the rhone or  the danube   which those that were come out of the city seeing  said  they  are all cruelly slain  see how the blood runs along   but they were  deceived in thinking pantagruel s urine had been the blood of their  enemies  for they could not see but by the light of the fire of the  pavilions and some small light of the moon     the enemies  after that they were awaked  seeing on one side the fire in  the camp  and on the other the inundation of the urinal deluge  could not  tell what to say nor what to think   some said that it was the end of the  world and the final judgment  which ought to be by fire   others again  thought that the sea gods  neptune  proteus  triton  and the rest of them   did persecute them  for that indeed they found it to be like sea water and  salt     o who were able now condignly to relate how pantagruel did demean himself  against the three hundred giants   o my muse  my calliope  my thalia   inspire me at this time  restore unto me my spirits  for this is the  logical bridge of asses   here is the pitfall  here is the difficulty  to  have ability enough to express the horrible battle that was fought   ah   would to god that i had now a bottle of the best wine that ever those drank  who shall read this so veridical history         chapter   xxix     how pantagruel discomfited the three hundred giants armed with free stone   and loupgarou their captain     the giants  seeing all their camp drowned  carried away their king anarchus  upon their backs as well as they could out of the fort  as aeneas did to  his father anchises  in the time of the conflagration of troy   when  panurge perceived them  he said to pantagruel  sir  yonder are the giants  coming forth against you  lay on them with your mast gallantly  like an old  fencer  for now is the time that you must show yourself a brave man and an  honest   and for our part we will not fail you   i myself will kill to you  a good many boldly enough  for why  david killed goliath very easily  and  then this great lecher  eusthenes  who is stronger than four oxen  will not  spare himself   be of good courage  therefore  and valiant  charge amongst  them with point and edge  and by all manner of means   well  said  pantagruel  of courage i have more than for fifty francs  but let us be  wise  for hercules first never undertook against two   that is well cacked   well scummered  said panurge  do you compare yourself with hercules   you  have  by g    more strength in your teeth  and more scent in your bum  than  ever hercules had in all his body and soul   so much is a man worth as he  esteems himself   whilst they spake those words  behold  loupgarou was come  with all his giants  who  seeing pantagruel in a manner alone  was carried  away with temerity and presumption  for hopes that he had to kill the good  man   whereupon he said to his companions the giants  you wenchers of the  low country  by mahoom  if any of you undertake to fight against these men  here  i will put you cruelly to death   it is my will that you let me fight  single   in the meantime you shall have good sport to look upon us     then all the other giants retired with their king to the place where the  flagons stood  and panurge and his comrades with them  who counterfeited  those that have had the pox  for he wreathed about his mouth  shrunk up his  fingers  and with a harsh and hoarse voice said unto them  i forsake  od   fellow soldiers  if i would have it to be believed that we make any war at  all   give us somewhat to eat with you whilest our masters fight against  one another   to this the king and giants jointly condescended  and  accordingly made them to banquet with them   in the meantime panurge told  them the follies of turpin  the examples of st  nicholas  and the tale of a  tub   loupgarou then set forward towards pantagruel  with a mace all of  steel  and that of the best sort  weighing nine thousand seven hundred  quintals and two quarterons  at the end whereof were thirteen pointed  diamonds  the least whereof was as big as the greatest bell of our lady s  church at paris  there might want perhaps the thickness of a nail  or at  most  that i may not lie  of the back of those knives which they call  cutlugs or earcutters  but for a little off or on  more or less  it is no  matter  and it was enchanted in such sort that it could never break  but   contrarily  all that it did touch did break immediately   thus  then  as he  approached with great fierceness and pride of heart  pantagruel  casting up  his eyes to heaven  recommended himself to god with all his soul  making  such a vow as followeth     o thou lord god  who hast always been my protector and my saviour  thou  seest the distress wherein i am at this time   nothing brings me hither but  a natural zeal  which thou hast permitted unto mortals  to keep and defend  themselves  their wives and children  country and family  in case thy own  proper cause were not in question  which is the faith  for in such a  business thou wilt have no coadjutors  only a catholic confession and  service of thy word  and hast forbidden us all arming and defence   for  thou art the almighty  who in thine own cause  and where thine own business  is taken to heart  canst defend it far beyond all that we can conceive   thou who hast thousand thousands of hundreds of millions of legions of  angels  the least of which is able to kill all mortal men  and turn about  the heavens and earth at his pleasure  as heretofore it very plainly  appeared in the army of sennacherib   if it may please thee  therefore  at  this time to assist me  as my whole trust and confidence is in thee alone   i vow unto thee  that in all countries whatsoever wherein i shall have any  power or authority  whether in this of utopia or elsewhere  i will cause  thy holy gospel to be purely  simply  and entirely preached  so that the  abuses of a rabble of hypocrites and false prophets  who by human  constitutions and depraved inventions have empoisoned all the world  shall  be quite exterminated from about me     this vow was no sooner made  but there was heard a voice from heaven  saying  hoc fac et vinces  that is to say  do this  and thou shalt  overcome   then pantagruel  seeing that loupgarou with his mouth wide open  was drawing near to him  went against him boldly  and cried out as loud as  he was able  thou diest  villain  thou diest  purposing by his horrible cry  to make him afraid  according to the discipline of the lacedaemonians   withal  he immediately cast at him out of his bark  which he wore at his  girdle  eighteen cags and four bushels of salt  wherewith he filled both  his mouth  throat  nose  and eyes   at this loupgarou was so highly  incensed that  most fiercely setting upon him  he thought even then with a  blow of his mace to have beat out his brains   but pantagruel was very  nimble  and had always a quick foot and a quick eye  and therefore with his  left foot did he step back one pace  yet not so nimbly but that the blow   falling upon the bark  broke it in four thousand four score and six pieces   and threw all the rest of the salt about the ground   pantagruel  seeing  that  most gallantly displayed the vigour of his arms  and  according to  the art of the axe  gave him with the great end of his mast a homethrust a  little above the breast  then  bringing along the blow to the left side   with a slash struck him between the neck and shoulders   after that   advancing his right foot  he gave him a push upon the couillons with the  upper end of his said mast  wherewith breaking the scuttle on the top  thereof  he spilt three or four puncheons of wine that were left therein     upon that loupgarou thought that he had pierced his bladder  and that the  wine that came forth had been his urine   pantagruel  being not content  with this  would have doubled it by a side blow  but loupgarou  lifting  up his mace  advanced one step upon him  and with all his force would  have dashed it upon pantagruel  wherein  to speak the truth  he so  sprightfully carried himself  that  if god had not succoured the good  pantagruel  he had been cloven from the top of his head to the bottom of  his milt   but the blow glanced to the right side by the brisk nimbleness  of pantagruel  and his mace sank into the ground above threescore and  thirteen foot  through a huge rock  out of which the fire did issue greater  than nine thousand and six tons   pantagruel  seeing him busy about  plucking out his mace  which stuck in the ground between the rocks  ran  upon him  and would have clean cut off his head  if by mischance his mast  had not touched a little against the stock of loupgarou s mace  which was  enchanted  as we have said before   by this means his mast broke off about  three handfuls above his hand  whereat he stood amazed like a bell founder   and cried out  ah  panurge  where art thou   panurge  seeing that  said to  the king and the giants  by g    they will hurt one another if they be not  parted   but the giants were as merry as if they had been at a wedding   then carpalin would have risen from thence to help his master  but one of  the giants said unto him  by golfarin  the nephew of mahoom  if thou stir  hence i will put thee in the bottom of my breeches instead of a  suppository  which cannot choose but do me good   for in my belly i am very  costive  and cannot well cagar without gnashing my teeth and making many  filthy faces   then pantagruel  thus destitute of a staff  took up the end  of his mast  striking athwart and alongst upon the giant  but he did him no  more hurt than you would do with a fillip upon a smith s anvil   in the   mean  time loupgarou was drawing his mace out of the ground  and  having  already plucked it out  was ready therewith to have struck pantagruel  who   being very quick in turning  avoided all his blows in taking only the  defensive part in hand  until on a sudden he saw that loupgarou did  threaten him with these words  saying  now  villain  will not i fail to  chop thee as small as minced meat  and keep thee henceforth from ever  making any more poor men athirst   for then  without any more ado   pantagruel struck him such a blow with his foot against the belly that he  made him fall backwards  his heels over his head  and dragged him thus  along at flay buttock above a flight shot   then loupgarou cried out   bleeding at the throat  mahoom  mahoom  mahoom  at which noise all the  giants arose to succour him   but panurge said unto them  gentlemen  do not  go  if will believe me  for our master is mad  and strikes athwart and  alongst  he cares not where  he will do you a mischief   but the giants  made no account of it  seeing that pantagruel had never a staff     and when pantagruel saw those giants approach very near unto him  he took  loupgarou by the two feet  and lift up his body like a pike in the air   wherewith  it being harnessed with anvils  he laid such heavy load amongst  those giants armed with free stone  that  striking them down as a mason  doth little knobs of stones  there was not one of them that stood before  him whom he threw not flat to the ground   and by the breaking of this  stony armour there was made such a horrible rumble as put me in mind of the  fall of the butter tower of st  stephen s at bourges when it melted before  the sun   panurge  with carpalin and eusthenes  did cut in the mean time  the throats of those that were struck down  in such sort that there escaped  not one   pantagruel to any man s sight was like a mower  who with his  scythe  which was loupgarou  cut down the meadow grass  to wit  the giants   but with this fencing of pantagruel s loupgarou lost his head  which  happened when pantagruel struck down one whose name was riflandouille  or  pudding plunderer  who was armed cap a pie with grison stones  one chip  whereof splintering abroad cut off epistemon s neck clean and fair   for  otherwise the most part of them were but lightly armed with a kind of sandy  brittle stone  and the rest with slates   at last  when he saw that they  were all dead  he threw the body of loupgarou as hard as he could against  the city  where falling like a frog upon his belly in the great piazza  thereof  he with the said fall killed a singed he cat  a wet she cat  a  farting duck  and a bridled goose         chapter   xxx     how epistemon  who had his head cut off  was finely healed by panurge  and  of the news which he brought from the devils  and of the damned people in  hell     this gigantal victory being ended  pantagruel withdrew himself to the place  of the flagons  and called for panurge and the rest  who came unto him safe  and sound  except eusthenes  whom one of the giants had scratched a little  in the face whilst he was about the cutting of his throat  and epistemon   who appeared not at all   whereat pantagruel was so aggrieved that he would  have killed himself   but panurge said unto him  nay  sir  stay a while   and we will search for him amongst the dead  and find out the truth of all   thus as they went seeking after him  they found him stark dead  with his  head between his arms all bloody   then eusthenes cried out  ah  cruel  death  hast thou taken from me the perfectest amongst men   at which words  pantagruel rose up with the greatest grief that ever any man did see  and  said to panurge  ha  my friend  the prophecy of your two glasses and the  javelin staff was a great deal too deceitful   but panurge answered  my  dear bullies all  weep not one drop more  for  he being yet all hot  i will  make him as sound as ever he was   in saying this  he took the head and  held it warm foregainst his codpiece  that the wind might not enter into  it   eusthenes and carpalin carried the body to the place where they had  banqueted  not out of any hope that ever he would recover  but that  pantagruel might see it     nevertheless panurge gave him very good comfort  saying  if i do not heal  him  i will be content to lose my head  which is a fool s wager   leave  off  therefore  crying  and help me   then cleansed he his neck very well  with pure white wine  and  after that  took his head  and into it synapised  some powder of diamerdis  which he always carried about him in one of his  bags   afterwards he anointed it with i know not what ointment  and set it  on very just  vein against vein  sinew against sinew  and spondyle against  spondyle  that he might not be wry necked  for such people he mortally  hated   this done  he gave it round about some fifteen or sixteen stitches  with a needle that it might not fall off again  then  on all sides and  everywhere  he put a little ointment on it  which he called resuscitative     suddenly epistemon began to breathe  then opened his eyes  yawned  sneezed   and afterwards let a great household fart   whereupon panurge said  now   certainly  he is healed   and therefore gave him to drink a large full  glass of strong white wine  with a sugared toast   in this fashion was  epistemon finely healed  only that he was somewhat hoarse for above three  weeks together  and had a dry cough of which he could not be rid but by the  force of continual drinking   and now he began to speak  and said that he  had seen the devil  had spoken with lucifer familiarly  and had been very  merry in hell and in the elysian fields  affirming very seriously before  them all that the devils were boon companions and merry fellows   but  in  respect of the damned  he said he was very sorry that panurge had so soon  called him back into this world again  for  said he  i took wonderful  delight to see them   how so  said pantagruel   because they do not use  them there  said epistemon  so badly as you think they do   their estate  and condition of living is but only changed after a very strange manner   for i saw alexander the great there amending and patching on clouts upon  old breeches and stockings

flayer of dead horses     all the knights of the round table were poor day labourers  employed to row  over the rivers of cocytus  phlegeton  styx  acheron  and lethe  when my  lords the devils had a mind to recreate themselves upon the water  as in  the like occasion are hired the boatmen at lyons  the gondoliers of venice   and oars at london   but with this difference  that these poor knights have  only for their fare a bob or flirt on the nose  and in the evening a morsel  of coarse mouldy bread     trajan was a fisher of frogs   antoninus  a lackey   commodus  a jet maker   pertinax  a

ratcatcher   pope sixtus  an anointer of those that have the pox     what  said pantagruel  have they the pox there too   surely  said  epistemon  i never saw so many   there are there  i think  above a hundred  millions  for believe  that those who have not had the pox in this world  must have it in the other     cotsbody  said panurge  then i am free  for i have been as far as the hole  of gibraltar  reached unto the outmost bounds of hercules  and gathered of  the ripest     ogier the dane was a furbisher of armour   the king tigranes  a mender of thatched houses   galien restored  a

keeper   hortensia  a spinstress   livia  a grater of verdigris     after this manner  those that had been great lords and ladies here  got but  a poor scurvy wretched living there below   and  on the contrary  the  philosophers and others  who in this world had been altogether indigent and  wanting  were great lords there in their turn   i saw diogenes there strut  it out most pompously  and in great magnificence  with a rich purple gown  on him  and a golden sceptre in his right hand   and  which is more  he  would now and then make alexander the great mad  so enormously would he  abuse him when he had not well patched his breeches  for he used to pay his  skin with sound bastinadoes   i saw epictetus there  most gallantly  apparelled after the french fashion  sitting under a pleasant arbour  with  store of handsome gentlewomen  frolicking  drinking  dancing  and making  good cheer  with abundance of crowns of the sun   above the lattice were  written these verses for his device       to leap and dance  to sport and play       and drink good wine both white and brown     or nothing else do all the day      but tell bags full of many a crown     when he saw me  he invited me to drink with him very courteously  and i  being willing to be entreated  we tippled and chopined together most  theologically   in the meantime came cyrus to beg one farthing of him for  the honour of mercury  therewith to buy a few onions for his supper   no   no  said epictetus  i do not use in my almsgiving to bestow farthings   hold  thou varlet  there s a crown for thee  be an honest man   cyrus was  exceeding glad to have met with such a booty  but the other poor rogues   the kings that are there below  as alexander  darius  and others  stole it  away from him by night   i saw pathelin  the treasurer of rhadamanthus   who  in cheapening the pudding pies that pope julius cried  asked him how  much a dozen   three blanks  said the pope   nay  said pathelin  three  blows with a cudgel   lay them down here  you rascal  and go fetch more   the poor pope went away weeping  who  when he came to his master  the  pie maker  told him that they had taken away his pudding pies   whereupon  his master gave him such a sound lash with an eel skin  that his own would  have been worth nothing to make bag pipe bags of   i saw master john le  maire there personate the pope in such fashion that he made all the poor  kings and popes of this world kiss his feet  and  taking great state upon  him  gave them his benediction  saying  get the pardons  rogues  get the  pardons  they are good cheap   i absolve you of bread and pottage  and  dispense with you to be never good for anything   then  calling caillet and  triboulet to him  he spoke these words  my lords the cardinals  despatch  their bulls  to wit  to each of them a blow with a cudgel upon the reins   which accordingly was forthwith performed   i heard master francis villon  ask xerxes  how much the mess of mustard   a farthing  said xerxes   to  which the said villon answered  the pox take thee for a villain   as much of  square eared wheat is not worth half that price  and now thou offerest to  enhance the price of victuals   with this he pissed in his pot  as the  mustard makers of paris used to do   i saw the trained bowman of the bathing  tub  known by the name of the francarcher de baignolet  who  being one of  the trustees of the inquisition  when he saw perce forest making water  against a wall in which was painted the fire of st  anthony  declared him  heretic  and would have caused him to be burnt alive had it not been for  morgant  who  for his proficiat and other small fees  gave him nine tuns of  beer     well  said pantagruel  reserve all these fair stories for another time   only tell us how the usurers are there handled   i saw them  said  epistemon  all very busily employed in seeking of rusty pins and old nails  in the kennels of the streets  as you see poor wretched rogues do in this  world   but the quintal  or hundredweight  of this old ironware is there  valued but at the price of a cantle of bread  and yet they have but a very  bad despatch and riddance in the sale of it   thus the poor misers are  sometimes three whole weeks without eating one morsel or crumb of bread   and yet work both day and night  looking for the fair to come   nevertheless  of all this labour  toil  and misery  they reckon nothing  so  cursedly active they are in the prosecution of that their base calling  in  hopes  at the end of the year  to earn some scurvy penny by it     come  said pantagruel  let us now make ourselves merry one bout  and drink   my lads  i beseech you  for it is very good drinking all this month   then  did they uncase their flagons by heaps and dozens  and with their  leaguer provision made excellent good cheer   but the poor king anarchus  could not all this while settle himself towards any fit of mirth  whereupon  panurge said  of what trade shall we make my lord the king here  that he may  be skilful in the art when he goes thither to sojourn amongst all the devils  of hell   indeed  said pantagruel  that was well advised of thee   do with  him what thou wilt  i give him to thee   gramercy  said panurge  the present  is not to be refused  and i love it from you         chapter   xxxi     how pantagruel entered into the city of the amaurots  and how panurge  married king anarchus to an old lantern carrying hag  and made him a crier  of green sauce     after this wonderful victory  pantagruel sent carpalin unto the city of the  amaurots to declare and signify unto them how the king anarchus was taken  prisoner and all the enemies of the city overthrown   which news when they  heard all the inhabitants of the city came forth to meet him in good order   and with a great triumphant pomp  conducting him with a heavenly joy into  the city  where innumerable bonfires were set on through all the parts  thereof  and fair round tables  which were furnished with store of good  victuals  set out in the middle of the streets   this was a renewing of the  golden age in the time of saturn  so good was the cheer which then they  made     but pantagruel  having assembled the whole senate and common councilmen of  the town  said  my masters  we must now strike the iron whilst it is hot   it is therefore my will that  before we frolic it any longer  we advise how  to assault and take the whole kingdom of the dipsodes   to which effect let  those that will go with me provide themselves against to morrow after  drinking  for then will i begin to march   not that i need any more men  than i have to help me to conquer it  for i could make it as sure that way  as if i had it already  but i see this city is so full of inhabitants that  they scarce can turn in the streets   i will  therefore  carry them as a  colony into dipsody  and will give them all that country  which is fair   wealthy  fruitful  and pleasant  above all other countries in the world  as  many of you can tell who have been there heretofore   everyone of you   therefore  that will go along  let him provide himself as i have said   this counsel and resolution being published in the city  the next morning  there assembled in the piazza before the palace to the number of eighteen  hundred fifty six thousand and eleven  besides women and little children   thus began they to march straight into dipsody  in such good order as did  the people of israel when they departed out of egypt to pass over the red  sea     but before we proceed any further in this purpose  i will tell you how  panurge handled his prisoner the king anarchus  for  having remembered that  which epistemon had related  how the kings and rich men in this world were  used in the elysian fields  and how they got their living there by base and  ignoble trades  he  therefore  one day apparelled his king in a pretty  little canvas doublet  all jagged and pinked like the tippet of a light  horseman s cap  together with a pair of large mariner s breeches  and  stockings without shoes   for  said he  they would but spoil his sight     and a little peach coloured bonnet with a great capon s feather in it  i  lie  for i think he had two  and a very handsome girdle of a sky colour and  green  in french called pers et vert   saying that such a livery did become  him well  for that he had always been perverse  and in this plight bringing  him before pantagruel  said unto him  do you know this roister   no   indeed  said pantagruel   it is  said panurge  my lord the king of the  three batches  or threadbare sovereign   i intend to make him an honest  man   these devilish kings which we have here are but as so many calves   they know nothing and are good for nothing but to do a thousand mischiefs  to their poor subjects  and to trouble all the world with war for their  unjust and detestable pleasure   i will put him to a trade  and make him a  crier of green sauce   go to  begin and cry  do you lack any green sauce   and the poor devil cried   that is too low  said panurge  then took him by  the ear  saying  sing higher in ge  sol  re  ut   so  so poor devil  thou  hast a good throat  thou wert never so happy as to be no longer king   and  pantagruel made himself merry with all this  for i dare boldly say that he  was the best little gaffer that was to be seen between this and the end of  a staff   thus was anarchus made a good crier of green sauce   two days  thereafter panurge married him with an old lantern carrying hag  and he  himself made the wedding with fine sheep s heads  brave haslets with  mustard  gallant salligots with garlic  of which he sent five horseloads  unto pantagruel  which he ate up all  he found them so appetizing   and for their drink they had a kind of small well watered wine  and some  sorbapple cider   and  to make them dance  he hired a blind man that  made music to them with a wind broach     after dinner he led them to the palace and showed them to pantagruel  and  said  pointing to the married woman  you need not fear that she will crack   why  said pantagruel   because  said panurge  she is well slit and broke up  already   what do you mean by that  said pantagruel   do not you see  said  panurge  that the chestnuts which are roasted in the fire  if they be whole  they crack as if they were mad  and  to keep them from cracking  they make  an incision in them and slit them   so this new bride is in her lower parts  well slit before  and therefore will not crack behind     pantagruel gave them a little lodge near the lower street and a mortar of  stone wherein to bray and pound their sauce  and in this manner did they do  their little business  he being as pretty a crier of green sauce as ever  was seen in the country of utopia   but i have been told since that his  wife doth beat him like plaister  and the poor sot dare not defend himself   he is so simple         chapter   xxxii     how pantagruel with his tongue covered a whole army  and what the author  saw in his mouth     thus  as pantagruel with all his army had entered into the country of the  dipsodes  everyone was glad of it  and incontinently rendered themselves  unto him  bringing him out of their own good wills the keys of all the  cities where he went  the almirods only excepted  who  being resolved to  hold out against him  made answer to his heralds that they would not yield  but upon very honourable and good conditions     what  said pantagruel  do they ask any better terms than the hand at the  pot and the glass in their fist   come  let us go sack them  and put them  all to the sword   then did they put themselves in good order  as being  fully determined to give an assault  but by the way  passing through a  large field  they were overtaken with a great shower of rain  whereat they  began to shiver and tremble  to crowd  press  and thrust close to one  another   when pantagruel saw that  he made their captains tell them that  it was nothing  and that he saw well above the clouds that it would be  nothing but a little dew  but  howsoever  that they should put themselves  in order  and he would cover them   then did they put themselves in a close  order  and stood as near to  each  other as they could  and pantagruel drew  out his tongue only half way and covered them all  as a hen doth her  chickens   in the meantime  i  who relate to you these so veritable  stories  hid myself under a burdock leaf  which was not much less in  largeness than the arch of the bridge of montrible  but when i saw them  thus covered  i went towards them to shelter myself likewise  which i could  not do  for that they were so  as the saying is  at the yard s end there is  no cloth left   then  as well as i could  i got upon it  and went along  full two leagues upon his tongue  and so long marched that at last i came  into his mouth   but  o gods and goddesses  what did i see there   jupiter  confound me with his trisulc lightning if i lie   i walked there as they do  in sophia  at  constantinople  and saw there great rocks  like the  mountains in denmark  i believe that those were his teeth   i saw also fair  meadows  large forests  great and strong cities not a jot less than lyons  or poictiers   the first man i met with there was a good honest fellow  planting coleworts  whereat being very much amazed  i asked him  my friend   what dost thou make here   i plant coleworts  said he   but how  and  wherewith  said i   ha  sir  said he  everyone cannot have his ballocks as  heavy as a mortar  neither can we be all rich   thus do i get my poor  living  and carry them to the market to sell in the city which is here  behind   jesus  said i  is there here a new world   sure  said he  it is  never a jot new  but it is commonly reported that  without this  there is  an earth  whereof the inhabitants enjoy the light of a sun and a moon  and  that it is full of and replenished with very good commodities  but yet this  is more ancient than that   yea but  said i  my friend  what is the name of  that city whither thou carriest thy coleworts to sell   it is called  aspharage  said he  and all the indwellers are christians  very honest men   and will make you good cheer   to be brief  i resolved to go thither   now   in my way  i met with a fellow that was lying in wait to catch pigeons  of  whom i asked  my friend  from whence come these pigeons   sir  said he   they come from the other world   then i thought that  when pantagruel  yawned  the pigeons went into his mouth in whole flocks  thinking that it  had been a pigeon house     then i went into the city  which i found fair  very strong  and seated in a  good air  but at my entry the guard demanded of me my pass or ticket   whereat i was much astonished  and asked them  my masters  is there any  danger of the plague here   o lord  said they  they die hard by here so  fast that the cart runs about the streets   good god  said i  and where   whereunto they answered that it was in larynx and pharynx  which are two  great cities such as rouen and nantes  rich and of great trading   and the  cause of the plague was by a stinking and infectious exhalation which  lately vapoured out of the abysms  whereof there have died above two and  twenty hundred and threescore thousand and sixteen persons within this  sevennight   then i considered  calculated  and found that it was a rank  and unsavoury breathing which came out of pantagruel s stomach when he did  eat so much garlic  as we have aforesaid     parting from thence  i passed amongst the rocks  which were his teeth  and  never left walking till i got up on one of them  and there i found the  pleasantest places in the world  great large tennis courts  fair galleries   sweet meadows  store of vines  and an infinite number of banqueting summer  outhouses in the fields  after the italian fashion  full of pleasure and  delight  where i stayed full four months  and never made better cheer in my  life as then   after that i went down by the hinder teeth to come to the  chaps   but in the way i was robbed by thieves in a great forest that is in  the territory towards the ears   then  after a little further travelling  i  fell upon a pretty petty village  truly i have forgot the name of it  where  i was yet merrier than ever  and got some certain money to live by   can  you tell how   by sleeping   for there they hire men by the day to sleep   and they get by it sixpence a day  but they that can snort hard get at  least ninepence   how i had been robbed in the valley i informed the  senators  who told me that  in very truth  the people of that side were bad  livers and naturally thievish  whereby i perceived well that  as we have  with us the countries cisalpine and transalpine  that is  behither and  beyond the mountains  so have they there the countries cidentine and  tradentine  that is  behither and beyond the teeth   but it is far better  living on this side  and the air is purer   then i began to think that it  is very true which is commonly said  that the one half of the world knoweth  not how the other half liveth  seeing none before myself had ever written  of that country  wherein are above five and twenty kingdoms inhabited   besides deserts  and a great arm of the sea   concerning which purpose i  have composed a great book  entitled  the history of the throttias  because  they dwell in the throat of my master pantagruel     at last i was willing to return  and  passing by his beard  i cast myself  upon his shoulders  and from thence slid down to the ground  and fell  before him   as soon as i was perceived by him  he asked me  whence comest  thou  alcofribas   i answered him  out of your mouth  my lord   and how  long hast thou been there  said he   since the time  said i  that you went  against the almirods   that is about six months ago  said he   and  wherewith didst thou live   what didst thou drink   i answered  my lord  of  the same that you did  and of the daintiest morsels that passed through  your throat i took toll   yea but  said he  where didst thou shite   in  your throat  my lord  said i   ha  ha  thou art a merry fellow  said he   we have with the help of god conquered all the land of the dipsodes  i will  give thee the chastelleine  or lairdship of salmigondin   gramercy  my  lord  said i  you gratify me beyond all that i have deserved of you         chapter   xxxiii     how pantagruel became sick  and the manner how he was recovered     a while after this the good pantagruel fell sick  and had such an  obstruction in his stomach that he could neither eat nor drink  and   because mischief seldom comes alone  a hot piss seized on him  which  tormented him more than you would believe   his physicians nevertheless  helped him very well  and with store of lenitives and diuretic drugs made  him piss away his pain   his urine was so hot that since that time it is  not yet cold  and you have of it in divers places of france  according to  the course that it took  and they are called the hot baths  as          at coderets       at limous       at dast       at ballervie  balleruc        at neric     at bourbonansie  and elsewhere in italy       at mongros       at appone     at sancto petro de padua       at st  helen       at casa nuova     at st  bartholomew  in the county of boulogne     at the porrette  and a thousand other places     and i wonder much at a rabble of foolish philosophers and physicians  who  spend their time in disputing whence the heat of the said waters cometh   whether it be by reason of borax  or sulphur  or alum  or saltpetre  that  is within the mine   for they do nothing but dote  and better were it for  them to rub their arse against a thistle than to waste away their time thus  in disputing of that whereof they know not the original  for the resolution  is easy  neither need we to inquire any further than that the said baths  came by a hot piss of the good pantagruel     now to tell you after what manner he was cured of his principal disease   i  let pass how for a minorative or gentle potion he took four hundred pound  weight of colophoniac scammony  six score and eighteen cartloads of cassia   an eleven thousand and nine hundred pound weight of rhubarb  besides other  confuse jumblings of sundry drugs   you must understand that by the advice  of the physicians it was ordained that what did offend his stomach should  be taken away  and therefore they made seventeen great balls of copper   each whereof was bigger than that which is to be seen on the top of st   peter s needle at rome  and in such sort that they did open in the midst  and shut with a spring   into one of them entered one of his men carrying a  lantern and a torch lighted  and so pantagruel swallowed him down like a  little pill   into seven others went seven country fellows  having every  one of them a shovel on his neck   into nine others entered nine  wood carriers  having each of them a basket hung at his neck  and so were  they swallowed down like pills   when they were in his stomach  every one  undid his spring  and came out of their cabins   the first whereof was he  that carried the lantern  and so they fell more than half a league into a  most horrible gulf  more stinking and infectious than ever was mephitis  or  the marshes of the camerina  or the abominably unsavoury lake of sorbona   whereof strabo maketh mention   and had it not been that they had very well  antidoted their stomach  heart  and wine pot  which is called the noddle   they had been altogether suffocated and choked with these detestable  vapours   o what a perfume   o what an evaporation wherewith to bewray the  masks or mufflers of young mangy queans   after that  with groping and  smelling they came near to the faecal matter and the corrupted humours   finally  they found a montjoy or heap of ordure and filth   then fell the  pioneers to work to dig it up  and the rest with their shovels filled the  baskets  and when all was cleansed every one retired himself into his ball     this done  pantagruel enforcing himself to vomit  very easily brought them  out  and they made no more show in his mouth than a fart in yours   but   when they came merrily out of their pills  i thought upon the grecians  coming out of the trojan horse   by this means was he healed and brought  unto his former state and convalescence  and of these brazen pills  or  rather copper balls  you have one at orleans  upon the steeple of the holy  cross church         chapter   xxxiv     the conclusion of this present book  and the excuse of the author     now  my masters  you have heard a beginning of the horrific history of my  lord and master pantagruel   here will i make an end of the first book   my  head aches a little  and i perceive that the registers of my brain are  somewhat jumbled and disordered with this septembral juice   you shall have  the rest of the history at frankfort mart next coming  and there shall you  see how panurge was married and made a cuckold within a month after his  wedding  how pantagruel found out the philosopher s stone  the manner how  he found it  and the way how to use it  how he passed over the caspian  mountains  and how he sailed through the atlantic sea  defeated the  cannibals  and conquered the isles of pearls  how he married the daughter  of the king of india  called presthan  how he fought against the devil and  burnt up five chambers of hell  ransacked the great black chamber  threw  proserpina into the fire  broke five teeth to lucifer  and the horn that  was in his arse  how he visited the regions of the moon to know whether  indeed the moon were not entire and whole  or if the women had three  quarters of it in their heads  and a thousand other little merriments all  veritable   these are brave things truly   good night  gentlemen   perdonate mi  and think not so much upon my faults that you forget your  own     if you say to me  master  it would seem that you were not very wise in  writing to us these flimflam stories and pleasant fooleries  i answer you   that you are not much wiser to spend your time in reading them   nevertheless  if you read them to make yourselves merry  as in manner of  pastime i wrote them  you and i both are far more worthy of pardon than a  great rabble of squint minded fellows  dissembling and counterfeit saints   demure lookers  hypocrites  pretended zealots  tough friars  buskin monks   and other such sects of men  who disguise themselves like masquers to  deceive the world   for  whilst they give the common people to understand  that they are busied about nothing but contemplation and devotion in  fastings and maceration of their sensuality  and that only to sustain and  aliment the small frailty of their humanity  it is so far otherwise that   on the contrary  god knows what cheer they make  et curios simulant  sed  bacchanalia vivunt   you may read it in great letters in the colouring of  their red snouts  and gulching bellies as big as a

druggists to  make thereof pomander oil   fly from these men  abhor and hate them as much  as i do  and upon my faith you will find yourselves the better for it   and  if you desire to be good

the history of the rise and progress of the colony of south carolina           chap  vii            sidenote  the form of legal governments     from that period in which the right and title to the lands of carolina  were sold  and surrendered to the king  and he assumed the immediate care  and government of the province  a new aera commences in the annals of  that country  which may be called the aera of its freedom  security  and  happiness  the carolineans who had long laboured under innumerable  hardships and troubles  from a weak proprietary establishment  at last  obtained the great object of their desires  a royal government  the  constitution of which depended on commissions issued by the crown to the  governor  and the instructions which attended those commissions  the form  of all provincial governments was borrowed from that of their mother  country  which was not a plan of systematic rules drawn before hand by  speculative men  but a constitution which was the result of many ages of  wisdom and experience  its great object is the public good  in promoting  of which all are equally concerned  it is a constitution which has a  remedy within itself for every political disorder  which  when properly  applied  must ever contribute to its stability and duration  after the  model of this british constitution the government of carolina now assumed  a form like the other regal ones on the continent  which were composed of  three branches  of a governor  a council  and an assembly  the crown  having the appointment of the governor  delegates to him  its  constitutional powers  civil and military  the power of legislation as  far as the king possesses it  its judicial and executive powers  together  with those of chancery and admiralty jurisdiction  and also those of  supreme ordinary  all these powers  as they exist in the crown  are known  by the laws of the realm  as they are entrusted to governors  they are  declared and defined by their commissions patent  the council  though  differing in many respects from the house of peers  are intended to  represent that house  and are appointed by the king during pleasure  for  supporting the prerogatives of the crown in the province  the assembly  consists of the representatives of the people  and are elected by them as  the house of commons in great britain  to be the guardians of their  lives  liberties  and properties  here also the constitution confides in  the good behaviour of the representatives  for should they presume in any  respect to betray their trust  it gives the people more frequent  opportunities than even in britain  of chusing others in their stead  the  governor convenes  prorogues  and dissolves these assemblies  and has a  negative on the bills of both houses  after bills have received his  assent  they are sent to great britain for the royal approbation  in  consequence of which they have the force of laws in the province  this is  a general sketch of the royal governments  which are intended to resemble  the constitution of great britain  as nearly as the local circumstances  of the provinces will admit  and which  notwithstanding its  imperfections  is certainly the best form of government upon earth  by  the instructions which the governor receives from time to time from  england  his power no doubt is greatly circumscribed  but it is his duty  to transmit authentic accounts of the state of his province  in order  that the instructions given him may be proper  and calculated for  promoting not only the good of the province  but also that of the british  empire          sidenote  sir alexander cumming sent out to treat of peace with the                 indians     after the purchase of the province  the first object of the royal concern  was  to establish the peace of the colony on the most firm and permanent  foundation  and for this purpose treaties of union and alliance with  indian nations were judged to be essentially necessary  domestic security  being first established  the colonists might then apply themselves to  industry with vigour and success  and while they enriched themselves   they would at the same time enlarge the commerce and trade of the  mother country  for this purpose sir alexander cumming was appointed  and  sent out to conclude a treaty of alliance with the cherokees  at this  time a warlike and formidable nation of savages  these indians occupied  the lands about the head of savanna river  and backwards among the  apalachian mountains  the country they claimed as their hunting grounds  was of immense extent  and its boundaries had never been clearly  ascertained  the inhabitants of their different towns were computed to  amount to more than twenty thousand  six thousand of whom were warriors   fit on any emergency to take the field  an alliance with such a nation  was an object of the highest consequence to carolina  and likewise to the  mother country  now engaged for its defence and protection          sidenote  brings with him to england seven cherokees     about the beginning of the year       sir alexander arrived in carolina   and made preparations for his journey to the distant hills  for his  guides he procured some indian traders  well acquainted with the woods   and an interpreter who understood the cherokee language  to assist him in  his negociations  when he reached keowee  abort three hundred miles from  charlestown  the chiefs of the lower towns there met him  and received  him with marks of great friendship and esteem  he immediately dispatched  messengers to the middle  the valley  and over hill settlements  and  summoned a general meeting of all their chiefs  to hold a congress with  him at nequassee  accordingly in the month of april the chief warriors of  all the cherokee towns assembled at the place appointed  after the  various indian ceremonies were over  sir alexander made a speech to them   acquainting them by whose authority he was sent  and representing the  great power and goodness of his sovereign king george  how he  and all  his other subjects  paid a cheerful obedience to his laws  and of course  were protected by him from all harm  that he had come a great way to  demand of moytoy  and all the chieftains of the nation  to acknowledge  themselves the subjects of his king  and to promise obedience to his  authority  and as he loved them  and was answerable to his sovereign for  their good and peaceable behaviour  he hoped they would agree to what he  should now require of them  upon which the chiefs  falling on their  knees  solemnly promised fidelity and obedience  calling upon all that  was terrible to fall upon them if they violated their promise  sir  alexander then  by their unanimous consent  nominated moytoy commander  and chief of the cherokee nation  and enjoined all the warriors of the  different tribes to acknowledge him for their king  to whom they were to  be accountable for their conduct  to this they also agreed  provided  moytoy should be made answerable to sir alexander for his behaviour to  them  after which many useful presents were made them  and the congress  ended to the great satisfaction of both parties  the crown was brought  from tenassee  their chief town  which with five eagle tails  and four  scalps of their enemies  moytoy presented to sir alexander  requesting  him  on his arrival at britain  to lay them at his majesty s feet  but  sir alexander proposed to moytoy  that he should depute some of their  chiefs to accompany him to england  there to do homage in person to the  great king  accordingly six of them agreed  and accompanied sir alexander  to charlestown  where being joined by another  they embarked for england  in the fox man of war  and arrived at dover in june               sidenote  who enter into a treaty of peace and alliance     we shall not pretend to describe their behaviour at the sight of london   or their wonder and astonishment at the greatness of the city  the number  of the people  and the splendour of the army and court  being admitted  into the presence of the king  they  in the name of their nation   promised to continue for ever his majesty s faithful and obedient  subjects  a treaty was accordingly drawn up  and signed by alured popple   secretary to the lords commissioners of trade and plantations  on one  side  and by the marks of the six chiefs  on the other  the preamble to  this treaty recites   that whereas the six chiefs  with the consent of  the whole nation of cherokees  at a general meeting of their nation at  nequassee  were deputed by moytoy  their chief warrior  to attend sir  alexander cumming to great britain  where they had seen the great king  george  and sir alexander  by authority from moytoy and all the  cherokees  had laid the crown of their nation  with the scalps of their  enemies and feathers of glory  at his majesty s feet  as a pledge of  their loyalty  and whereas the great king had commanded the lords  commissioners of trade and plantations to inform the indians  that the  english on all sides of the mountains and lakes were his people  their  friends his friends  and their enemies his enemies  that he took it  kindly the great nation of cherokees had sent them so far  to brighten  the chain of friendship between him and them  and between his people and  their people  that the chain of friendship between him and the cherokees  is now like the sun  which shines both in britain and also upon the great  mountains where they live  and equally warms the hearts of indians and  englishmen  that as there is no spots or blackness in the sun  so neither  is there any rust or foulness on this chain  and as the king had fastened  one end to his breast  he defied them to carry the other end of the chain  and fasten it to the breast of moytoy of telliquo  and to the breasts of  all their old wise men  their captains  and people  never more to be made  loose or broken      the great king and the cherokees being thus fastened together by a chain  of friendship  he has ordered  and it is agreed  that his children in  carolina do trade with the indians  and furnish them with all manner of  goods they want  and to make haste to build houses and plant corn from  charlestown  towards the towns of cherokees behind the great mountains   that he desires the english and indians may live together as children of  one family  that the cherokees be always ready to fight against any  nation  whether white men or indians  who shall dare to molest or hurt  the english  that the nation of cherokees shall  on their part  take care  to keep the trading path clean  that there be no blood on the path where  the english tread  even though they should be accompanied with other  people with whom the cherokees may be at war  that the cherokees shall  not suffer their people to trade with white men of any other nation but  the english  nor permit white men of any other nation to build any forts  or cabins  or plant any corn among them  upon lands which belong to the  great king  and if any such attempt shall be made  the cherokees must  acquaint the english governor therewith  and do whatever he directs  in  order to maintain and defend the great king s right to the country of  carolina  that if any negroes shall run away into the woods from their  english masters  the cherokees shall endeavour to apprehend them  and  bring them to the plantation from whence they run away  or to the  governor  and for every slave so apprehended and brought back  the indian  that brings him shall receive a gun and a watch coat  and if by any  accident it shall happen  that an englishman shall kill a cherokee  the  king or chief of the nation shall first complain to the english governor   and the man who did the harm shall be punished by the english laws as if  he had killed an englishman  and in like manner  if any indian happens to  kill an englishman  the indian shall be delivered up to the governor  to  be punished by the same english laws as if he were an englishman      this was the substance of the first treaty between the king and the  cherokees  every article of which was accompanied with presents of  different kinds  such as cloth  guns  shot  vermilion  flints  hatchets   knives  the indians were given to understand   that these were the words  of the great king  whom they had seen  and as a token that his heart was  open and true to his children the cherokees  and to all their people  a  belt was given the warriors  which they were told the king desired them  to keep  and shew to all their people  to their children  and children s  children  to confirm what was now spoken  and to bind this agreement of  peace and friendship between the english and cherokees  as long as the  rivers shall run  the mountains shall last  or the sun shall shine           sidenote  speech of a cherokee warrior     this treaty  that it might be the easier understood  was drawn up in  language as similar as possible to that of the indians  which at this  time was very little known in england  and given to them  certified and  approved by sir alexander cumming  in answer to which  skijagustah  in  name of the rest  made a speech to the following effect    we are come  hither from a mountainous place  where nothing but darkness is to be  found  but we are now in a place where there is light   there was a  person in our country  he gave us a yellow token of warlike honour  which  is left with moytoy of telliquo   and as warriors we received it   he  came to us like a warrior from you   a man he is   his talk is  upright  and the token he left preserves his memory among us   we look  upon you as if the great king were present   we love you as representing  the great king   we shall die in the same way of thinking   the crown of  our nation is different from that which the great king george wears  and  from that we saw in the tower   but to us it is all one   the chain of  friendship shall be carried to our people   we look upon the great king  george as the sun  and as our father  and upon ourselves as his  children   for though we are red  and you are white  yet our hands and  hearts are joined together   when we shall have acquainted our people  with what we have seen  our children from generation to generation will  always remember it   in war we shall always be one with you  the enemies  of the great king shall be our enemies   his people and ours shall be  one  and shall die together   we came hither naked and poor as the worms  of the earth  but you have every thing   and we that have nothing must  love you  and will never break the chain of friendship which is between  us   here stands the governor of carolina  whom we know   this small rope  we show you is all that we have to bind our slaves with  and it may be  broken   but you have iron chains for yours   however  if we catch your  slaves  we will bind them as well as we can  and deliver them to our  friends  and take no pay for it   we have looked round for the person  that was in our country  he is not here   however  we must say he talked  uprightly to us  and we shall never forget him   your white people may  very safely build houses near us   we shall hurt nothing that belongs to  them  for we are children of one father  the great king  and shall live  and die together   then laying down his feathers upon the table he added    this is our way of talking  which is the same thing to us as your  letters in the book are to you  and to you beloved men we deliver these  feathers in confirmation of all we have said      the cherokees  however barbarous  were a free and independent people  and  this method of obtaining a share of their lands by the general consent   was fair and honourable in itself  and most agreeable to the general  principles of equity  and the english constitution  an agreement is made  with them  in consequence of which the king could not only give a just  title to indian lands  but  by indians becoming his voluntary subjects   the colonists obtained peaceable possession  the cherokees held abundance  of territory from nature  and with little injury to themselves could  spare a share of it  but reason and justice required that it be obtained  by paction or agreement  by such treaties mutual presents were made   mutual obligations were established  and  for the performance of the  conditions required  the honour and faith of both parties were pledged   even to men in a barbarous state such policy was the most agreeable  as  will afterwards clearly appear  for the cherokees  in consequence of this  treaty  for many years  remained in a state of perfect friendship and  peace with the colonists  who followed their various employments in the  neighbourhood of those indians  without the least terror or molestation          sidenote  robert johnson governor     about the beginning of the year       robert johnson  who had been  governor of carolina while in the possession of the lords proprietors   having received a commission from the king  investing him with the same  office and authority  arrived in the province  he brought back these  indian chiefs  possessed with the highest ideas of the power and  greatness of the english nation  and not a little pleased with the kind  and generous treatment they had received  the carolineans  who had always  entertained the highest esteem for this gentleman  even in the time of  their greatest confusion  having now obtained him in the character of  king s governor  a thing they formerly had so earnestly desired  received  him with the greatest demonstrations of joy  sensible of his wisdom and  virtue  and his strong attachment to the colony  they promised themselves  much prosperity and happiness under his gentle administration     this new governor  from his knowledge of the province  and the  dispositions of the people  was not only well qualified for his high  office  but he had a council to assist him  composed of the most  respectable inhabitants  thomas broughton was appointed  lieutenant governor  and robert wright chief justice  the other members  of the council were  william bull  james kinloch  alexander skene  john  fenwick  arthur middleton  joseph wragg  francis yonge  john hamerton   and thomas waring  at the first meeting of assembly  the governor  recommended to both houses  to embrace the earliest opportunity of  testifying their gratitude to his majesty for purchasing seven eight  parts of the province  and taking it under his particular care  he  enjoined them to put the laws in execution against impiety and  immorality  and as the most effectual means of discouraging vice  to  attend carefully to the education of youth  he acquainted them of the  treaty which had been concluded in england with the cherokees  which he  hoped would be attended with beneficial and happy consequences  he  recommended the payment of public debts  the establishment of public  credit  and peace and unanimity among themselves as the chief objects of  their attention  for if they should prove faithful subjects to his  majesty  and attend to the welfare and prosperity of their country  he  hoped soon to see it  now under the protection of a great and powerful  nation  in as flourishing and prosperous a situation as any of the other  settlements on the continent  they in return presented to him the most  loyal and affectionate addresses  and entered on their public  deliberations with uncommon harmony and great satisfaction          sidenote  several indulgences granted the people     for the encouragement of the people  now connected with the mother  country both by mutual affection and the mutual benefits of commerce   several favours and indulgences were granted them  the restraint upon  rice  an innumerated commodity  was partly taken off  and  that it might  arrive more seasonably and in better condition at the market  the  colonists were permitted to send it to any port southward of cape  finisterre  a discount upon hemp was also allowed by parliament  the  arrears of quit rents bought from the proprietors were remitted by a  bounty from the crown  for the benefit and enlargement of trade their  bills of credit were continued  and seventy seven thousand pounds were  stamped and issued by virtue of an act of the legislature  called the  appropriation law  seventy pieces of cannon were sent out by the king   and the governor had instructions to build one fort at port royal  and  another on the river alatamaha  an independent company of foot was  allowed for their defence by land  and ships of war were stationed there  for the protection of trade  these and many more favours flowed to the  colony  now emerging from the depths of poverty and oppression  and  arising to a state of freedom  ease and affluence          sidenote  happy effects of peace and security     as a natural consequence of its domestic security  the credit of the  province in england increased  the merchants of london  bristol  and  liverpool turned their eyes to carolina  as a new and promising channel  of trade  and established houses in charlestown for conducting their  business with the greater ease and success  they poured in slaves from  africa for cultivating their lands  and manufactures of britain for  supplying the plantations  by which means the planters obtained great  credit  and goods at a much cheaper rate than they could be obtained from  any other nation  in consequence of which the planters having greater  strength  turned their whole attention to cultivation  and cleared the  lands with greater facility and success  the lands arose in value  and  men of foresight and judgment began to look out and secure the richest  spots for themselves  with that ardour and keenness which the prospects  of riches naturally inspire  the produce of the province in a few years  was doubled  during this year above thirty nine thousand barrels of rice  were exported  besides deer skins  furs  naval stores  and provisions   and above one thousand five hundred negroes were imported into it  from  this period its exports kept pace with its imports  and secured its  credit in england  the rate of exchange had now arisen to seven hundred   per cent  i  e   seven hundred carolina money was given for a bill of an  hundred pounds sterling on england  at which rate it afterwards  continued  with little variation  for upwards of forty years     hitherto small and inconsiderable was the progress in cultivation  carolina had made  and the face of the country appeared like a desert   with little spots here and there cleared  scarcely discernible amidst the  immense forest  the colonists were slovenly farmers  owing to the vast  quantities of lands  and the easy and cheap terms of obtaining them  for  a good crop they were more indebted to the great power of vegetation and  natural richness of the soil  than to their own good culture and  judicious management  they had abundance of the necessaries  and several  of the conveniencies of life  but their habitations were clumsy and  miserable huts  and having no chaises  all travellers were exposed in  open boats or on horseback to the violent heat of the climate  their  houses were constructed of wood  by erecting first a wooden frame  and  then covering it with clap boards without  and plastering it with lime  within  of which they had plenty made from oyster shells  charlestown  at  this time  consisted of between five and six hundred houses  mostly built  of timber  and neither well constructed nor comfortable  plain  indications of the wretchedness and poverty of the people  however  from  this period the province improved in building as well as in many other  respects  many ingenious artificers and tradesmen of different kinds  found encouragement in it  and introduced a taste for brick buildings   and more neat and pleasant habitations  in process of time  as the colony  increased in numbers  the face of the country changed  and exhibited an  appearance of industry and plenty  the planters made a rapid progress  towards wealth and independence  and the trade being well protected   yearly increased and flourished          sidenote  a project formed for planting a new colony    at the same time  for the relief of poor and indigent people of great  britain and ireland  and for the farther security of carolina  the  settlement of a new colony between the rivers alatamaha and savanna was  projected in england  this large territory  situated on the south west of  carolina  yet lay waste  without an inhabitant except its original  savages  private compassion and public spirit conspired towards promoting  the excellent design  several persons of humanity and opulence having  observed many families and valuable subjects oppressed with the miseries  of poverty at home  united  and formed a plan for raising money and  transporting them to this part of america  for this purpose they applied  to the king  obtained from him letters patent  bearing date june  th         for legally carrying into execution what they had generously  projected  they called the new province georgia  in honour of the king   who likewise greatly encouraged the undertaking  a corporation consisting  of twenty one persons was constituted  by the name of trustees  for  settling and establishing the colony of georgia  which was separated from  carolina by the river savanna  the trustees having first set an example  themselves  by largely contributing towards the scheme  undertook also to  solicit benefactions from others  and to apply the money towards  clothing  arming  purchasing utensils for cultivation  and transporting  such poor people as should consent to go over and begin a settlement   they however confined not their views to the subjects of britain alone   but wisely opened a door also for oppressed and indigent protestants from  other nations  to prevent any misapplication or abuse of charitable  donations  they agreed to deposit the money in the bank of england  and  to enter in a book the names of all the charitable benefactors  together  with the sums contributed by each of them  and to bind and oblige  themselves  and their successors in office  to lay a state of the money  received and expended before the lord chancellor of england  the lord  chief justice of the king s bench and common pleas  the master of the  rolls  and the lord chief baron of the exchequer     when this scheme of the trustees with respect to the settlement of  georgia was made public  the well wishers of mankind in every part of  britain highly approved of an undertaking so humane and disinterested  to  consult the public happiness  regardless of private interest  and to  stretch forth a bountiful hand for relief of distressed fellow creatures   were considered as examples of uncommon benevolence and virtue  and  therefore worthy of general imitation  the ancient romans  famous for  their courage and magnanimity  ranked the planting of colonies among  their noblest works  and such as added greater lustre to their empire  than their most glorious wars and victories  by the latter old cities  were plundered and destroyed  by the former new ones were founded and  established  the latter ravaged the dominions of enemies  and depopulated  the world  the former improved new territories  provided for unfortunate  friends  and added strength to the state  the benevolent founders of the  colony of georgia perhaps may challenge the annals of any nation to  produce a design more generous and praise worthy than that they had  undertaken  they voluntarily offered their money  their labour  and time   for promoting what appeared to them the good of others  leaving  themselves nothing for reward but the inexpressible satisfaction arising  from virtuous actions  among other great ends they had also in view the  conversion and civilization of indian savages  if their public  regulations were afterwards found improper and impracticable  if their  plan of settlement proved too narrow and circumscribed  praise   nevertheless  is due to them  human policy at best is imperfect  but   when the design appears so evidently good and disinterested  the candid  and impartial part of the world will make many allowances for them   considering their ignorance of the country  and the many defects that  cleave to all codes of laws  even when framed by the wisest legislators     about the middle of july        the trustees for georgia held their first  general meeting  when lord percival was chosen president of the  corporation  after all the members had qualified themselves  agreeable to  the charter  for the faithful discharge of the trust  a common seal was  ordered to be made  the device was  on one side  two figures resting upon  urns  representing the rivers alatamaha and savanna  the boundaries of  the province  between them the genius of the colony seated  with a cap of  liberty on his head  a spear in one hand and a cornucopia in the other   with the inscription  colonia georgia aug   on the other side was a  represention of silk worms  some beginning and others having finished  their web  with the motto  non sibi sed aliis  a very proper emblem   signifying  that the nature of the establishment was such  that neither  the first trustees nor their successors could have any views of interest   it being entirely designed for the benefit and happiness of others          sidenote  james oglethorpe carries a colony to georgia     in november following  one hundred and sixteen settlers embarked at  gravesend for georgia  having their passage paid  and every thing  requisite for building and cultivation furnished them by the corporation   they could not properly be called adventurers  as they run no risque but  what arose from the change of climate  and as they were to be maintained  until by their industry they were able to support themselves  james  oglethorpe  one of the trustees  embarked along with them  and proved a  zealous and active promoter of the settlement  in the beginning of the  year following oglethorpe arrived in charlestown  where he was received  by the governor and council in the kindest manner  and treated with every  mark of civility and respect  governor johnson  sensible of the great  advantage that must accrue to carolina from this new colony  gave all the  encouragement and assistance in his power to forward the settlement  many  of the carolineans sent them provisions  and hogs  and cows to begin  their stock  william bull  a man of knowledge and experience  agreed to  accompany mr  oglethorpe  and the rangers and scout boats were ordered to  attend him to georgia  after their arrival at yamacraw  oglethorpe and  bull explored the country  and having found an high and pleasant spot of  ground  situated on a navigable river  they fixed on this place as the  most convenient and healthy situation for the settlers  on this hill they  marked out a town  and  from the indian name of the river which ran past  it  called it savanna  a small fort was erected on the banks of it as a  place of refuge  and some guns were mounted on it for the defence of the  colony  the people were set to work in felling trees and building huts  for themselves  and oglethorpe animated and encouraged them  by exposing  himself to all the hardships which the poor objects of his compassion  endured  he formed them into a company of militia  appointed officers  from among themselves  and furnished them with arms and ammunition  to  shew the indians how expert they were at the use of arms  he frequently  exercised them  and as they had been trained beforehand by the serjeants  of the guards in london  they performed their various parts in a manner  little inferior to regular troops          sidenote  he treats with indians for a share of their lands     having thus put his colony in as good a situation as possible  the next  object of his attention was to treat with the indians for a share of  their possessions  the principal tribes that at this time occupied the  territory were the upper and lower creeks  the former were numerous and  strong  the latter  by diseases and war  had been reduced to a smaller  number  both tribes together were computed to amount to about twenty five  thousand  men  women and children  those indians  according to a treaty  formerly made with governor nicolson  laid claim to the lands lying  south west of savanna river  and  to procure their friendship for this  infant colony  was an object of the highest consequence  but as the tribe  of indians settled at yamacraw was inconsiderable  oglethorpe judged it  necessary to have the other tribes also to join with them in the treaty   to accomplish this union he found an indian woman named mary  who had  married a trader from carolina  and who could speak both the english and  creek languages  and perceiving that she had great influence among  indians  and might be made useful as an interpreter in forming treaties  of alliance with them  he therefore first purchased her friendship with  presents  and afterwards settled an hundred pounds yearly on her  as a  reward for her services  by her assistance he summoned a general meeting  of the chiefs  to hold a congress with him at savanna  in order to  procure their consent to the peaceable settlement of his colony  at this  congress fifty chieftains were present  when oglethorpe represented to  them the great power  wisdom and wealth of the english nation  and the  many advantages that would accrue to indians in general from a connection  and friendship with them  and as they had plenty of lands  he hoped they  would freely resign a share of them to his people  who were come for  their benefit and instruction to settle among them  after having  distributed some presents  which must always attend every proposal of  friendship and peace  an agreement was made  and then tomochichi  in name  of the creek warriors  addressed him in the following manner   here is a  little present  and  giving him a buffaloe s skin  adorned on the inside  with the head and feathers of an eagle  desired him to accept it  because  the eagle was an emblem of speed  and the buffalo of strength  he told  him  that the english were as swift as the bird and as strong as the  beast  since  like the former  they flew over vast seas to the uttermost  parts of the earth  and  like the latter  they were so strong that  nothing could withstand them  he said  the feathers of the eagle were  soft  and signified love  the buffalo s skin was warm  and signified  protection  and therefore he hoped the english would love and protect  their little families   oglethorpe accordingly accepted the present  and  after having concluded this treaty limited by the nature of their  government  was nevertheless great  as they always directed the public  councils in all affairs relative to peace and war  it is true their young  men  fond of fame and glory from warlike exploits  and rejoicing in  opportunities of distinguishing themselves  will now and then  in  contempt to the power of their old leaders  break out in scalping  parties  to moderate and restrain the fiery passions of the young men   the sages find generally the greatest difficulties  especially as these  passions are often roused by gross frauds and impositions  unprincipled  and avaricious traders sometimes resided among them  who  that they might  the more easily cheat them  first filled the savages drunk  and then took  all manner of advantages of them in the course of traffic  when the  indian recovered from his fit of drunkenness  and finding himself robbed  of his treasures  for procuring which he had perhaps hunted a whole year   he is filled with fury  and breathes vengeance and resentment  no  authority can then restrain him within the bounds of moderation  at such  a juncture in vain does the leader of the greatest influence interpose   he spurns at every person that presumes to check that arm by which alone  he defends his property against the hands of fraud and injustice  among  themselves indeed theft is scarcely known  and injuries of this kind are  seldom committed  and had the traders observed in general the same  justice and equity in their dealings with them  as they commonly practice  among themselves  it would have been an easy matter with their wise and  grave leaders to maintain peace in all the different intercourses between  europeans and indians  tomochichi acknowledged  that the governor of the  world had given the english great wisdom  power and riches  insomuch that  they wanted nothing  he had given indians great territories  yet they  wanted every thing  and he prevailed on the creeks freely to resign such  lands to the english as were of no use to themselves  and to allow them  to settle among them  on purpose that they might get instruction  and be  supplied with the various necessaries of life  he persuaded them  that  the english were a generous nation  and would trade with them on the most  just and honourable terms  that they were brethren and friends  and would  protect them from danger  and go with them to war against all their  enemies     some say that james oglethorpe  when he came out to settle this colony in  georgia  brought along with him sir walter raleigh s journals  written by  his own hand  and by the latitude of the place  and the traditions of the  indians  it appeared to him that sir walter had landed at the mouth of  savanna river  indeed during his wild and chimerical attempts for finding  out a golden country  it is not improbable that this brave adventurer  visited many different places  the indians acknowledged that their  fathers once held a conference with a warrior who came over the great  waters  at a little distance from savanna  there is an high mount of  earth  under which they say the indian king lies interred  who talked  with the english warrior  and that he desired to be buried in the same  place where this conference was held  but having little authority with  respect to this matter  we leave the particular relation of it to men in  circumstances more favourable for intelligence          sidenote  the colony of switzers brought to carolina     while the security of carolina  against external enemies  by this  settlement of georgia  engaged the attention of british government  the  means of its internal improvement and population at the same time were  not neglected  john peter pury  a native of neufchatel in switzerland   having formed a design of leaving his native country  paid a visit to  carolina  in order to inform himself of the circumstances  and situation  of the province  after viewing the lands there  and procuring all the  information he could  with respect to the terms of obtaining them  he  returned to britain  the government entered into a contract with him   and  for the encouragement of the people  agreed to give lands and four  hundred pounds sterling for every hundred effective men he should  transport from switzerland to carolina  pury  while in carolina  having  furnished himself with a flattering account of the soil and climate  and  of the excellence and freedom of the provincial government  returned to  switzerland  and  published it among the people  immediately one hundred  and seventy poor switzers agreed to follow him  and were transported to  the fertile and delightful province as he described it  and not long  afterwards two hundred more came over  and joined them  the governor   agreeable to instructions  allotted forty thousand acres of lands for the  use of the swiss settlement on the north east side of savanna river  and  a town was marked out for their accommodation  which he called  purisburgh  from the name of the principal promoter of the settlement   mr  bignion  a swiss minister  whom they had engaged to go with them   having received episcopal ordination from the bishop of london  settled  among them for their religious instruction  on the one hand the governor  and council  happy in the acquisition of such a force  allotted each of  them his separate tract of land  and gave every encouragement in their  power to the people  on the other  the poor swiss emigrants began their  labours with uncommon zeal and courage  highly elevated with the idea of  possessing landed estates  and big with the hopes of future success   however  in a short time they felt the many inconveniencies attending a  change of climate  several of them sickened and died  and others found  all the hardships of the first state of colonization falling heavily upon  them  they became discontented with the provisions allowed them  and  complained to government of the persons employed to distribute them  and   to double their distress  the period for receiving the bounty expired  before they had made such progress in cultivation as to raise sufficient  provisions for themselves and families  the spirit of murmur crept into  the poor swiss settlement  and the people finding themselves oppressed  with indigence and distress  could consider their situation in no other  light than a state of banishment  and not only blamed pury for deceiving  them  but also heartily repented their leaving their native country          sidenote  eleven townships marked out     according to the new plan adopted in england for the more speedy  population and settlement of the province  the governor had instructions  to mark out eleven townships  in square plats  on the sides of rivers   consisting each of twenty thousand acres  and to divide the lands within  them into shares of fifty acres for each man  woman  and child  that  should come over to occupy and improve them  each township was to form a  parish  and all the inhabitants were to have an equal right to the river   so soon as the parish should increase to the number of an hundred  families  they were to have right to send two members of their own  election to the assembly  and to enjoy the same privileges as the other  parishes already established  each settler was to pay four shillings a  year for every hundred acres of land  excepting the first ten years   during which term they were to be rent free  governor johnson issued a  warrant to st  john  surveyor general of the province  empowering him to  go and mark out those townships  but he having demanded an exorbitant sum  of money for his trouble  the members of the council agreed among  themselves to do this piece of service for their country  accordingly  eleven townships were marked out by them in the following situations  two  on river alatamacha  two on savanna  two on santee  one on pedee  one on  wacamaw  one on watcree  and one on black rivers          sidenote  a struggle about lands     the old planters now acquiring every year greater strength of hands  by  the large importation of negroes  and extensive credit from england   began to turn their attention more closely than ever to the lands of the  province  a spirit of emulation broke out among them for securing tracts  of the richest ground  but especially such as were most conveniently  situated for navigation  complaints were made to the assembly  that all  the valuable lands on navigable rivers and creeks adjacent to port royal  had been run out in exorbitant tracts  under colour of patents granted by  the proprietors to cassiques and landgraves  by which the complainants   who had  at the hazard of their lives  defended the country  were  hindered from obtaining such lands as could be useful and beneficial  at  the established quit rents  though the attorney and solicitor general of  england had declared such patents void  among others  job rothmaller and  thomas cooper  having been accused of some illegal practices with respect  to this matter  a petition was presented to the assembly by thirty nine  inhabitants of granville county in their vindication  when the assembly  examined into the matter  they ordered their messenger forthwith to take  into custody job rothmaller and thomas cooper  for aiding  assisting  and  superintending the deputy surveyor in marking out tracks of land already  surveyed  contrary to the quit rent act  but cooper  being taken into  custody  applied to chief justice wright for a writ of  habeas corpus    which was granted  the assembly  however  sensible of the ill  consequences that would attend such illegal practices  determined to put  a stop to them by an act made on purpose  they complained to the governor  and council against the surveyor general  for encouraging land jobbers   and allowing such liberties as tended to create litigious disputes in the  province  and to involve it in great confusion  in consequence of which   the governor  to give an effectual check to such practices  prohibited  st  john to survey lands to any person without an express warrant from  him  the surveyor general  however  determined to make the most of his  office  and having a considerable number to support him  represented both  governor and council as persons disaffected to his majesty s government   and enemies to the interest of the country  being highly offended at the  assembly  he began to take great liberties without doors  and to turn  some of their speeches into ridicule  upon which an order was issued to  take st  john also into custody  and then the commons came to the  following spirited resolutions   that it is the undeniable privilege of  this assembly to commit such persons they may judge to deserve it  that  the freedom of speech and debate ought not to be impeached or questioned  in any court or place out of that house  that it is a contempt and  violation of the privileges of that house  to call in question any of  their commitments  that no writ of  habeas corpus  lies in favour of any  person committed by that house  and that the messenger attending do yield  no obedience to such  and that the chief justice be made acquainted with  these resolutions   in consequence of which  wright complained before the  governor and council of these resolutions  as tending to the dissolution  of all government  and charged the lower house with disallowing his  majesty s undoubted prerogative  and with renouncing obedience to his  writs of  habeas corpus   but the council in general approved of their  conduct  and were of opinion  that the assembly of carolina had that same  privilege there  that the house of commons had in england  in short  this  affair created some trouble in the colony  for while a strong party  from  motives of private interest  supported the chief justice  the assembly  resolved   that he appeared to be prejudiced against the people  and was  therefore unworthy of the office he held  and that it would tend to the  tranquillity of the province immediately to suspend him      in this situation was the colony about the end of the year       each  planter  eager in the pursuit of large possessions of land  which were  formerly neglected  because of little value  strenuously vied with his  neighbour for a superiority of fortune  and seemed impatient of every  restraint that hindered or cramped him in his favourite pursuit  many  favours and indulgences had already been granted them from the crown  for  promoting their success and prosperity  and for securing the province  against external enemies  what farther favours they expected  we may  learn from the following memorial and representation of the state of  carolina  transmitted to his majesty  bearing date april  th        and  signed by the governor  the president of the council  and the speaker of  the commons house of assembly          sidenote  state of the colony      your majesty s most dutiful subjects of this province  having often  felt  with hearts full of gratitude  the many signal instances of your  majesty s peculiar favour and protection  to those distant parts of your  dominions  and especially those late proofs of your majesty s most  gracious and benign care  so wisely calculated for the preservation of  this your majesty s frontier province on the continent of america  by  your royal charter to the trustees for establishing the colony of  georgia  and your great goodness so timely applied  for the promoting the  settlement of the swiss at purisburgh  encouraged by such views of your  majesty s wise and paternal care  extended to your remotest subjects  and  excited by the duty we owe to your most sacred majesty  to be always  watchful for the support and security of your majesty s interest   especially at this very critical conjuncture  when the flame of a war  breaking out in europe may very speedily be lighted here  in this your  majesty s frontier province  which  in situation  is known to be of the  utmost importance to the general trade and traffic in america  we   therefore  your majesty s most faithful governor  council  and commons   convened in your majesty s province of south carolina  crave leave with  great humility to represent to your majesty the present state and  condition of this your province  and how greatly it stands in need of  your majesty s gracious and timely succour in case of a war  to assist  our defence against the french and spaniards  or any other enemies to  your majesty s dominions  as well as against the many nations of savages  which so nearly threaten the safety of your majesty s subjects      the province of south carolina  and the new colony of georgia  are the  southern frontiers of all your majesty s dominions on the continent of  america  to the south and south west of which is situated the strong  castle of st  augustine  garrisoned by four hundred spaniards  who have  several nations of indians under their subjection  besides several other  small settlements and garrisons  some of which are not eighty miles  distant from the colony of georgia  to the south west and west of us the  french have erected a considerable town  near fort thoulouse on the  moville river  and several other forts and garrisons  some not above  three hundred miles distant from our settlements  and at new orleans on  the mississippi river  since her late majesty queen anne s war  they have  exceedingly increased their strength and traffic  and have now many forts  and garrisons on both sides of that great river for several hundred miles  up the same  and since his most christian majesty has taken out of the  mississippi company the government of that country into his own hands   the french natives in canada come daily down in shoals to settle all  along that river  where many regular forces have of late been sent over  by the king to strengthen the garrisons in those places  and  according  to our best and latest advices  they have five hundred men in pay   constantly employed as wood rangers  to keep their neighbouring indians  in subjection  and to prevent the distant ones from disturbing the  settlements  which management of the french has so well succeeded  that  we are very well assured they have now wholly in their possession and  under their influence  the several numerous nations of indians that are  situated near the mississippi river  one of which  called the choctaws   by estimation consists of about five thousand fighting men  and who were  always deemed a very warlike nation  lies on this side the river  not  above four hundred miles distant from our out settlements  among whom  as  well as several other nations of indians  many french europeans have been  sent to settle  whom the priests and missionaries among them encourage to  take indian wives  and use divers other alluring methods to attach the  indians the better to the french alliance  by which means the french are  become throughly acquainted with the indian way  warring and living in  the woods  and have now a great number of white men among them  able to  perform a long march with an army of indians upon any expedition      we further beg leave to inform your majesty  that if the measures of  france should provoke your majesty to a state of hostility against it in  europe  we have great reason to expect an invasion will be here made upon  your majesty s subjects by the french and indians from the mississippi  settlements  they have already paved a way for a design of that nature   by erecting a fort called the albama fort  alias fort lewis  in the  middle of the upper creek indians  upon a navigable river leading to  mobile  which they have kept well garrisoned and mounted with fourteen  pieces of cannon  and have lately been prevented from erecting a second  nearer to us on that quarter  the upper creeks are a nation very bold   active and daring  consisting of about two thousand five hundred fighting  men   and not above one hundred and fifty miles distant from the  choctaws   whom  through we heretofore have traded with  claimed and held  in our alliance  yet the french  on account of that fort and a superior  ability to make them liberal presents  have been for some time striving  to draw them over to their interest  and have succeeded with some of the  towns of the creeks  which  if they can be secured in your majesty s  interest  are the only nation which your majesty s subjects here can  depend upon as the best barrier against any attempts either of the french  or their confederate indians      we most humbly beg leave farther to inform your majesty  that the french  at mobile perceiving that they could not gain the indians to their  interest without buying their deer skins   which is the only commodity  the indians have to purchase necessaries with   and the french not being  able to dispose of those skins by reason of their having no vent for them  in old france  they have found means to encourage vessels from hence   new york  and other places   which are not prohibited by the acts of  trade   to truck those skins with them for indian trading goods   especially the british woollen manufactures  which the french dispose of  to the creeks and choctaws  and other indians  by which means the indians  are much more alienated from our interest  and on every occasion object  to us that the french can supply them with strouds and blankets as well  as the english  which would have the contrary effect if they were wholly  supplied with those commodities by your majesty s subjects trading with  them  if a stop were therefore put to that pernicious trade with the  french  the chief dependence of the creek indians would be on this  government  and that of georgia  to supply them with goods  by which  means great part of the choctaws  living next the creeks  would see the  advantage the creek indians enjoyed by having british woollen  manufactures wholly from your majesty s subjects  and thereby be invited  in a short time to enter into a treaty of commerce with us  which they  have lately made some offers for  and which  if effected  will soon  lessen the interest of the french with those indians  and by degrees  attach them to that of your majesty      the only expedient we can propose to recover and confirm that nation to  your majesty s interest  is by speedily making them presents to withdraw  them from the french alliance  and by building some forts among them your  majesty may be put in such a situation  that on the first notice of  hostilities with the french  your majesty may be able at once to reduce  the albama fort  and we may then stand against the french and their  indians  which  if not timely prepared for before a war breaks out  we  have too much reason to fear we may be soon over run by the united  strength of the french  the creeks and choctaws  with many other nations  of their indian allies  for  should the creeks become wholly enemies  who  are well acquainted with all our settlements  we probably should also be  soon deserted by the cherokees  and a few others  small tribes of  indians  who  for the sake of our booty  would readily join to make us a  prey to the french and savages  ever since the late indian war  the  offences given us then by the creeks have made that nation very jealous  of your majesty s subjects of this province  we have therefore concerted  measures with the honourable james oglethorpe  esq  who  being at the  head of a new colony  will  we hope  be successful for your majesty s  interest among that people  he has already by presents attached the lower  creeks to your majesty  and has laudably undertaken to endeavour the  fixing a garrison among the upper creeks  the expence of which is already  in part provided for in this session of the general assembly of this  province  we hope therefore to prevent the french from encroaching  farther on your majesty s territories  until your majesty is graciously  pleased further to strengthen and secure the same      we find the cherokee nation has lately become very insolent to your  majesty s subjects trading among them  notwithstanding the many favours  the chiefs of that nation received from your majesty in great britain   besides a considerable expence which your majesty s subjects of this  province have been at in making them presents  which inclines us to  believe that the french  by their indians  have been tampering with them   we therefore beg leave to inform your majesty  that the building and  mounting some forts likewise among the cherokees  and making them  presents will be highly necessary to keep them steady in their duty to  your majesty  lest the french may prevail in seducing that nation  which  they may the more readily be inclined to from the prospect of getting  considerable plunder in slaves  cattle    c   commodities which they very  well know we have among us  several other forts will be indispensibly  necessary  to be a cover to your majesty s subjects settled backwards in  this province  as also to those of the colony of georgia  both which in  length are very extensive  for though the trustees for establishing the  colony of georgia  by a particular scheme of good management  painfully  conducted by the gentleman engaged here in that charitable enterprise   has put that small part of the colony  which he has not yet been able to  establish  in a tenable condition  against the spaniards of florida which  lie to the southward  yet the back exposition of those colonies to the  vast number of french and indians which border on the westward  must  in  case of a war  cry greatly aloud for your majesty s gracious and timely  succour  the expense of our safety on such an occasion  we must  with all  humility  acquaint your majesty  either for men or money  can never be  effected by your majesty s subjects of this province  who  in conjunction  with georgia  do not in the whole amount to more than three thousand five  hundred men  which compose the militia  and wholly consist of planters   tradesmen  and other men of business      besides the many dangers which by land we are exposed to from so many  enemies that lie on the back of us  we further beg leave to represent to  your majesty  the defenceless condition of our ports and harbours  where  any enemies of your majesty s dominions may very easily by sea invade us   there being no fortifications capable of making much resistance  those in  charlestown harbour are now in a very shattered condition  occasioned by  the late violent storms and hurricanes  which already cost this country a  great deal of money  and now requires several thousands of pounds to  repair the old and build new ones  to mount the ordnance which your  majesty was graciously pleased to send us  which  with great concern  we  must inform your majesty we have not yet been able to accomplish  being  lately obliged  for the defence and support of this your majesty s  province and government  to raise  by a tax on the inhabitants  a supply  of above forty thousand pounds paper currency  per annum   which is a  considerable deal more than a third part of all the currency among us  a  charge which your majesty s subjects of this province are but barely able  to sustain  since your majesty s royal instruction to your majesty s  governor here  an entire stop has been put to the duties which before  accrued from european goods imported  and if a war should happen  or any  thing extraordinary  to be farther expensive here  we should be under the  utmost difficulties to provide additionally for the same  lest an  increase of taxes with an apprehension of danger  should drive away many  of our present inhabitants  as well as discourage others from coming here  to settle for the defence and improvement of your majesty s province   there being several daily moving with their families and effects to north  carolina  where there are no such fears and burdens      we must therefore beg leave to inform your majesty  that  amidst our  other perilous circumstances  we are subject to many intestine dangers  from the great number of negroes that are now among us  who amount at  least to twenty two thousand persons  and are three to one of all your  majesty s white subjects in this province  insurrections against us have  been often attempted  and would at any time prove very fatal if the  french should instigate them  by artfully giving them an expectation of  freedom  in such a situation we most humbly crave leave to acquaint your  majesty  that even the present ordinary expences necessary for the care  and support of this your majesty s province and government  cannot be  provided for by your majesty s subjects of this province  without your  majesty s gracious pleasure to continue those laws for establishing the  duty on negroes and other duties for seven years  and for appropriating  the same  which now lie before your majesty for your royal assent and  approbation  and the further expences that will be requisite for the  erecting some forts  and establishing garrisons in the several necessary  places  so as to form a barrier for the security of this your majesty s  province  we most humbly submit to your majesty      your majesty s subjects of this province  with fulness of zeal  duty and  affection to your most gracious and sacred majesty  are so highly  sensible of the great importance of this province to the french  that we  must conceive it more than probable  if a war should happen  they will  use all endeavours to bring this country under their subjection  they  would be thereby enabled to support their sugar islands with all sorts of  provisions and lumber by an easy navigation  which to our great advantage  is not so practicable from the present french colonies  besides the  facility of gaining then to their interest most of the indian trade on  the northern continent  they might then easily unite the canadees and  choctaws  with the many other nations of indians which are now in their  interest  and the several ports and harbours of carolina and georgia   which now enable your majesty to be absolute master of the passage  through the gulf of florida  and to impede  at your pleasure  the  transportation home of the spanish treasure  would then prove for many  convenient harbours for your majesty s enemies  by their privateers or  ships of war to annoy a great part of the british trade to america  as  well as that which is carried on through the gulf from jamaica  besides  the loss which great britain must feel in so considerable a part of its  navigation  as well as the exports of masts  pitch  tar  and turpentine   which  without any dependence on the northern parts of europe  are from  hence plentifully supplied for the use of the british shipping      this is the present state and condition of your majesty s province of  south carolina  utterly incapable of finding funds sufficient for the  defence of this wide frontier  and so destitute of white men  that even  money itself cannot here raise a sufficient body of them      with all humility we therefore beg leave to lay ourselves at the feet of  your majesty  humbly imploring your majesty s most gracious care in the  extremities we should be reduced to on the breaking out of a war  and  that your majesty would be graciously pleased to extend your protection  to us  as your majesty  in your great wisdom  shall think proper           sidenote  the regulations of the trustees     in the mean time the trustees for georgia had been employed in framing a  plan of settlement and establishing such public regulations as they  judged most proper for answering the great end of the corporation  in  this general plan they considered each inhabitant both as a planter and a  soldier who must be provided with arms and ammunition for defence  as  well as with tools and utensils for cultivation  as the strength of the  province was their chief object in view  they agreed to establish such  tenures for holding lands in it as they judged most favourable for a  military establishment  each tract of land granted was considered as a  military fief  for which the possessor was to appear in arms  and take  the field  when called upon for the public defence  to prevent large  tracts from falling in process of time into one hand  they agreed to  grant their lands in tail male in preference to tail general  on the  termination of the estate in tail male  the lands were to revert to the  trust  and such lands thus reverting were to be granted again to such  persons  as the common council of the trust should judge most  advantageous for the colony  only the trustees in such a case were to pay  special regard to the daughters of such persons as had made improvements  on their lots  especially when not already provided for by marriage  the  wives of such persons as should survive them  were to be during their  lives entitled to the mansion house  and one half of the lands improved  by their husbands  no man was to be permitted to depart the province  without licence  if any part of the lands granted by the trustees  shall  not by cultivated  cleared  and fenced round about with a worm fence  or  pales  six feet high  within eighteen years from the date of the grant   such part was to revert to the trust  and the grant with respect to it to  be void  all forfeitures for non residence  high treason  felonies    c    were to the trustees for the use and benefit of the colony  the use of  negroes was to be absolutely prohibited  and also the importation of rum   none of the colonists were to be permitted to trade with indians  but  such as should obtain a special licence for that purpose          sidenote  their impolitical restrictions     these were some of the fundamental regulations established by the  trustees of georgia  and perhaps the imagination of man could scarcely  have framed a system of rules worse adapted to the circumstances and  situation of the poor settlers  and of more pernicious consequence to the  prosperity of the province  yet  although the trustees were greatly  mistaken  with respect to their plan of settlement  it must be  acknowledged their views were generous  as the people sent out by them  were the poor and unfortunate  who were to be provided with necessaries  at their public store  they received their lands upon condition of  cultivation  and by their personal residence  of defence  silk and wine  being the chief articles intended to be raised  they judged negroes were  not requisite to these purposes  as the colony was designed to be a  barrier to south carolina  against the spanish settlement at augustine  they imagined that negroes would rather weaken than strengthen it  and  that such poor colonists would run into debt  and ruin themselves by  purchasing them  rum was judged pernicious to health  and ruinous to the  infant settlement  a free trade with indians was considered as a thing  that might have a tendency to involve the people in quarrels and troubles  with the powerful savages  and expose them to danger and destruction   such were probably the motives which induced those humane and generous  persons to impose such foolish and ridiculous restrictions on their  colony  for by granting their small estates in tail male  they drove the  settlers from georgia  who soon found that abundance of lands could be  obtained in america upon a larger scale  and on much better terms  by the  prohibition of negroes  they rendered it impracticable in such a climate  to make any impression on the thick forest  europeans being utterly  unqualified for the heavy task  by their discharging a trade with the  west indies  they not only deprived the colonists of an excellent and  convenient market for their lumber  of which they had abundance on their  lands  but also of rum  which  when mixed with a sufficient quantity of  water  has been found in experience the cheapest  the most refreshing   and nourishing drink for workmen in such a soggy and burning climate  the  trustees  like other distant legislators  who framed their regulations  upon principles of speculation  were liable to many errors and mistakes   and however good their design  their rules were found improper and  impracticable  the carolineans plainly perceived  that they would prove  unsurmountable obstacles to the progress and prosperity of the colony   and therefore from motives of pity began to invite the poor georgians to  come over savanna river  and settle in carolina  being convinced that  they could never succeed under such impolitic and oppressive  restrictions          sidenote  two colonies of highlanders and germans sent out     besides the large sums of money which the trustees had expended for the  settlement of georgia  the parliament had also granted during the two  past years thirty six thousand pounds towards carrying into execution the  humane purpose of the corporation  but after the representation and  memorial from the legislature of carolina reached britain  the nation  considered georgia to be of the utmost importance to the british  settlements in america  and began to make still more vigorous efforts for  its speedy population  the first embarkations of poor people from  england  being collected from towns and cities  were found equally idle  and useless members of society abroad  as they had been at home  an hardy  and bold race of man  inured to rural labour and fatigue  they were  persuaded would be much better adapted both for cultivation and defence   to find men possessed of these qualifications  the trustees turned their  eyes to germany and the highlands of scotland  and resolved to send over  a number of scotch and german labourers to their infant province  when  they published their terms at inverness  an hundred and thirty  highlanders immediately accepted them  and were transported to georgia  a  town ship on the river alatamaha  which was considered as the boundary  between the british and spanish territories  was allotted for the  highlanders  on which dangerous situation they settled  and built a town   which they called new inverness  about the same time an hundred and  seventy germans embarked with james oglethorpe  and were fixed in another  quarter  so that  in the space of three years  georgia received above  four hundred british subjects  and about an hundred and seventy  foreigners  afterwards several adventurers  both from scotland and  germany  followed their countrymen  and added further strength to the  province  and the trustees flattered themselves with the hopes of soon  seeing it in a promising condition          sidenote  thomas broughton lieut  governor of carolina     the same year carolina lost robert johnson  her favourite governor  whose  death was as much lamented by the people  as during his life he had been  beloved and respected  the province having been much indebted to his  wisdom  courage and abilities  to perpetuate his memory among them  and   in testimony of their esteem  a monument was erected in their church at  the public expence  after his decease the government devolved on thomas  broughton  a plain honest man  but little distinguished either for his  knowledge or valour  as the welfare of the province depended greatly on  its government  no man ought to be entrusted with such a charge but men  of approved virtue and capacity  there is as much danger arising to a  community from a feeble and contemptible government  as from an excess of  power committed to its rulers  weak and unexperienced hands hold the  reins of government with awkwardness and difficulty  and being easily  imposed upon  their authority sinks into contempt  at this time many of  the leading men of the colony scrupled not to practise impositions  and  being eagerly bent on engrossing lands  the lieutenant governor freely  granted them warrants  and the planters  provided they acquired large  possessions  were not very scrupulous about the legality of the way and  manner in which they were obtained          sidenote  oglethorpe fortifies georgia     james oglethorpe having brought a number of great guns with him from  england  now began to fortify georgia  by erecting strong holds on its  frontiers  where he judged they might be useful for its safety and  protection  at one place  which he called augusta a fort was erected on  the banks of savanna river  which was excellently situated for protecting  the indian trade  and holding treaties of commerce and alliance with  several of the savage nations  at another place  called frederica  on an  island nigh the mouth of the river alatamaha  another fort  with four  regular bastions  was erected  and several pieces of cannon were mounted  on it  ten miles nearer the sea a battery was raised  commanding the  entrance into the sound  through which all ships of force must come that  might be sent against frederica  to keep little garrisons in these forts   to help the trustees to defray the expences of such public works  ten  thousand pounds were granted by the parliament of great britain          sidenote  which gives umbrage to the spaniards     while james oglethorpe was thus busily employed in strengthening georgia   he received a message from the governor of augustine  acquainting him  that a spanish commissioner from havanna had arrived there  in order to  make certain demands of him  and would meet him at frederica for that  purpose  at the same time he had advice  that three companies of foot had  came along with him to that spanish settlement  a few days afterwards  this commissioner came to georgia by sea  and oglethorpe  unwilling to  permit him to come to frederica  dispatched a sloop to bring him into  jekyl sound  where he intended to hold a conference with him  here the  commissioner had the modesty to demand  that oglethorpe and his people  should immediately evacuate all the territories to the southward of st   helena sound  as they belonged to the king of spain  who was determined  to maintain his right to them  and if he refuted to comply with his  demand  he had orders to proceed to charlestown and lay the same before  the governor and council of that province  oglethorpe endeavoured to  convince him that his catholic majesty had been misinformed with respect  to those territories  but to no purpose  his instructions were  peremptory  and the conference broke up without coming to any agreement   after which oglethorpe embarked with all possible expedition  and sailed  for england     during his absence the strict law of the trustees  respecting the rum  trade  had like to have created a quarrel between the carolineans and  georgians  the fortification at augusta had induced some traders of  carolina to open stores at that place  so conveniently situated for  commerce with indian nations  for this purpose  land carriage being  expensive  they intended to force their way by water with loaded boats up  savanna river to their stores at augusta  but as they passed the town of  savanna  the magistrates rashly ordered the boats to be stopt  the  packages to be opened  the casks of rum to be staved  and the people to  be confined  such injurious treatment was not to be suffered  the  carolineans determined to give a check to their insolence  and for that  purpose deputed two persons  one from the council and another from the  assembly  to demand of the georgians by what authority they presumed to  seize and destroy the effects of their traders  or to compel them to  submit to their code of laws  the magistrates of georgia  sensible of  their error  made great concessions to the deputies  and treated them  with the utmost civility and respect  the goods were instantly ordered to  be returned  the people to be set at liberty  and all manner of  satisfaction was given to the deputies they could have expected  strict  orders were sent to the agents of georgia among indians not to molest the  traders from carolina  but to give them all the assistance and protection  in their power  the carolineans  on the other hand  engaged not to  smuggle any strong liquors among the settlers of georgia  and the  navigation on the river savanna was declared equally open and free to  both provinces          sidenote  the brave chickesaws defeat the french     about the same time the french took the field against the emperor  and  the flames of war kindling between such powerful potentates  would  it  was thought  inevitably spread  and involve all europe in the quarrel  in  case great britain should interfere in this matter  and declare in favour  of the emperor  orders were sent out to the governors of quebec and new  orleans to invade the weakest frontiers of the british settlements of  america  for this purpose an army was formed in new france  and  preparations were made for uniting the force of canada and louisiana to  attack carolina  but before this design was put in execution  advice  came  that the clouds of war which threatened europe were dispersed  and  a general peace was restored  by the mediation of britain and holland   this put a stop to the motions of the main body in canada  however  a  detachment of two hundred french and four hundred indians were sent down  the mississippi  to meet a party from new orleans to cut off the  chickesaw indians  this tribe were the firm allies of britain  and the  bravest nation of savages on the continent  but consisted only of between  six and eight hundred gun men  the french having encroached in their  lands  and built some forts nigh them  had on that account drawn upon  themselves their invincible enmity and resentment  the chickesaws had  long obstinately opposed their progress up the river mississippi  and  were now the chief obstacle that prevented a regular communication  between louisiana and canada  the french determined to remove it  by  extirpating this troublesome nation  and for this purpose fell down the  river in boats to the place where they expected to meet their friends  from new orleans  but the party from the southward not coming up at the  time appointed  and the canadians thinking themselves strong enough for  the enterprize  began the war by attacking the chickesaw towns  upon  which the savages gathered together above three hundred warriors  gave  the french battle in an open field  and  though with considerable loss   compleatly defeated them  above forty frenchmen and eight indians were  killed on the spot  and the rest were taken prisoners  among whom was  their commander  and chief  brother to mons  bienville  governor of new  orleans  hard was the fate of the unfortunate prisoners  who for several  days were kept almost perishing with hunger in the wilderness  and at  last were tied to a stake  tortured  and burned to death  another party  of french from mobile  in the same year  advanced against the creeks  who  were also unsuccessful  and obliged to retreat with considerable loss   carolina rejoiced at those disasters  and began now more than ever to  court the friendship and interest of these rude nations in their  neighbourhood  considering them as the best barrier against their natural  enemies          sidenote  religious state of the colony     by this time the episcopalian form of divine worship had gained ground in  carolina  and was more countenanced by the people than any other  that  zeal for the right of private judgment had much abated  and those  prejudices against the hierarchy  which the first emigrants carried from  england with them  were now almost entirely worn off from the succeeding  generation  to bring about this change  no doubt the well timed zeal and  extensive bounty of the society  incorporated for the propagation of the  gospel  had greatly contributed  at this time the corporation had no less  than twelve missionaries in carolina  each of whom shared of their  bounty  indeed  a mild church government  together with able  virtuous   and prudent teachers  in time commonly give the establishment in every  country a superiority over all sectaries  spacious churches had been  erected in the province  which were pretty well supplied with clergymen   who were paid from the public treasury  and countenanced by the civil  authority  all which favoured the established church  the dissenters of  carolina were not only obliged to erect and uphold their churches  and  maintain their clergy by private contributions  but also to contribute  their share in the way of taxes  in proportion to their ability  equally  with their neighbours  towards the maintenance of the poor  and the  support of the establishment  this indeed many of them considered as a  grievance  but having but few friends in the provincial assembly  no  redress could be obtained for them  besides  the establishment gave its  adherents many advantageous privileges in point of power and authority  over persons of other denominations  it gave them the best chance for  being elected members of the legislature  and of course of being  appointed to offices  both civil and military in their respective  districts  over youthful minds  fond of power  pomp and military parade   such advantages have great weight  dissenters indeed had the free choice  of their ministers  but even this is often the cause of division  when  differences happen in a parish  the minority must yield  and therefore  through private pique  discontent or resentment  they often conform to  the establishment  it is always difficult  and often impossible for a  minister to please all parties  especially where all claim an equal right  to judge and chuse for themselves  and divisions and subdivisions seldom  fail to ruin the power and influence of all sectaries  this was evidently  the case in carolina for many of the posterity of rigid dissenters were  now found firm adherents to the church of england  which had grown  numerous on the ruins of the dissenting interest          sidenote  the association of presbyterians     however  the emigrants from scotland and ireland  most of whom were  presbyterians  still composed a considerable party of the province  and  kept up the presbyterian form of worship in it  archibald stobo  of whom  i have formerly taken notice  by great diligence and ability still  preserved a number of followers  an association had been formed in favour  of this mode of religious worship  by messrs  stobo  fisher  and  witherspoon  three ministers of the church of scotland  together with  joseph stanyarn  and joseph blake  men of respectable characters and  considerable fortunes  the presbyterians had already erected churches at  charlestown  wiltown  and in three of the maritime islands  for the use  of the people adhering to that form of religious worship  as the  inhabitants multiplied  several more in different parts of the province  afterwards joined them  and built churches  particularly at jacksonburgh   indian town  port royal  and williamsburgh  the first clergymen having  received their ordination in the church of scotland  the fundamental  rules of the association were framed according to the forms  doctrines   and discipline of that establishment  to which they agreed to conform as  closely as their local circumstances would admit  these ministers adopted  this mode of religious worship  not only from a persuasion of its  conformity to the primitive apostolic form  but also from a conviction of  its being  of all others  the most favourable to civil liberty  equality   and independence  sensible that not only natural endowments  but also a  competent measure of learning and acquired knowledge were necessary to  qualify men for the sacred function  and enable them to discharge the  duties of it with honour and success  they associated on purpose to  prevent deluded mechanics  and illiterate novices from creeping into the  pulpit  to the disgrace of the character  and the injury of religion  in  different parts of the province  persons of this stamp had appeared  who  cried down all establishments  both civil and religions  and seduced weak  minds from the duties of allegiance  and all that the presbytery could do  was to prevent them from teaching under the sanction of their authority   but this association of presbyterians having little countenance from  government  and no name or authority in law  their success depended  wholly on the superior knowledge  popular talents and exemplary life of  their ministers  from time to time clergymen were afterwards sent out at  the request of the people from scotland and ireland  and the colonists  contributed to maintain them  till at length funds were established in  trust by private legacies and donations  to be appropriated for the  support of presbyterian ministers  and the encouragement of that mode of  religious worship and government          sidenote  remarks on paper currency     i have several times made remarks on the paper currency of the province   which the planters were always for increasing  and the merchants and  money lenders for sinking  the exchange of london  like a commercial  thermometer  served to measure the rise or fall of paper credit in  carolina  and the price of bills of exchange commonly ascertained the  value of their current money  the permanent riches of the country  consisted in lands  houses  and negroes  and the produce of the lands   improved by negroes  raw materials  provisions  and naval stores  were  exchanged for what the province wanted from other countries  the  attention of the mercantile part was chiefly employed about staple  commodities  and as their great object was present profit it was natural  for them to be governed by that great axiom in trade  whoever brings  commodities cheapest and in the best order to market  must always meet  with the greatest encouragement and success  the planters  on the other  hand  attended to the balance of trade  which was turned in their favour   and concluded  that when the exports of any province exceeded its  imports  whatever losses private persons might now and then sustain  yet  that province upon the whole was growing rich  let us suppose  what was  indeed far from being the case  that georgia so far advanced in  improvement as to rival carolina in raw materials  and exchangeable  commodities  and to undersell her at the markets in europe  this  advantage could only arise from the superior quality of her lands  the  cheapness of her labour  or her landed men being contented with smaller  profits  in such a case it was the business of the carolina merchants to  lower the price of her commodities  in order to reap the same advantages  with her neighbours  and this could only be done by reducing the quantity  of paper money in circulation  if gold and silver only past current in  georgia  which by general consent was the medium of commerce throughout  the world  if she had a sufficient quantity of them to answer the  purposes of trade  and no paper currency had been permitted to pass  current  in such case her commodities would bring their full value at the  provincial market  and no more  according to the general standard of  money in europe  supposing also that carolina had a quantity of gold and  silver in circulation  sufficient for the purposes of commerce  and that  the planters  in order to raise the value of their produce  should issue  paper money equal to the quantity of gold and silver in circulation  the  consequence would be  the price of labour  and of all articles of  exportation would be doubled  but as the markets of europe remained the  same  and her commodities being of the same kind and quality with those  of georgia  they would not bring an higher price  some persons must be  losers  and in the fist instance this loss must fall on the mercantile  interest  and moneyed men  therefore this superabundance of paper credit   on whose foundation the deluded province built its visionary fabric of  great wealth  was not only useless  but prejudicial with respect to the  community  paper money in such large quantities is the bane of commerce   a kind of fictitious wealth  making men by high founding language imagine  they are worth thousands and millions  while a ship s load of it would  not procure for the country a regiment of auxiliary troops in time of  war  nor a suit of clothes at an european market in time of peace  had  america  from its first settlement  prohibited paper money altogether   her staple commodities must have brought her  in the course of commerce   vast sums of gold and silver  which would have circulated through the  continent  and answered all the purposes of trade both foreign and  domestic  it is true the value of gold and silver is equally nominal  and  rises and falls like the value of other articles of commerce  in  proportion to the quantity in circulation  but as nations in general have  fixed on these metals as the medium of trade  this has served to stamp a  value on them  and render them the means not only of procuring every  where the necessaries of life  but by supporting public credit  the chief  means also of national protection     however  some distinction in point of policy should perhaps be made  between a colony in its infancy  and a nation already possessed of  wealth  and in an advanced state of agriculture and commerce  especially  while the former is united to  and under the protection of the latter  to  a growing colony  such as carolina  paper credit  under certain  limitations  was useful in several respects  especially as the gold and  silver always left the country  when it answered the purpose of the  merchant for remittance better than produce  this credit served to  procure the planter strength of hands to clear and cultivate his fields   from which the real wealth of the province arose  but in an improved  country such as england  supported by labourers  manufacturers and trade   large emissions of paper money lessen the value of gold and silver  and  both cause them to leave the country  and its produce and manufactures to  come dearer to market  adventurous planters in carolina  eager to obtain  a number of negroes  always stretched their credit with the traders to  its utmost pitch  for as negroes on good lands cleared themselves in a  few years  they by this means made an annual addition to their capital  stock  after obtaining this credit  it then became their interest to  maintain their superiority in assembly  and discharge their debt to the  merchants in the easiest manner they could  the increase of paper money  always proved to them a considerable assistance  as it advanced the price  of those commodities they brought to the market  by which they cancelled  their debts with the merchants  so that however much this currency might  depreciate  the loss occasioned by it from time to time fell not on the  adventurous planters  but on the merchants and money lenders  who were  obliged to take it in payment of debts  or produce  which always arose in  price in proportion to its depreciation     in excuse for increasing provincial paper money the planters always pled  the exigencies of the public  such as warlike expeditions  raising  fortifications  providing military stores  and maintaining garrisons   those no doubt rendered the measure sometimes necessary  and often  reasonable  but private interest had also considerable weight in adopting  it  and carrying it into execution  in the year       a bill of exchange  on london  for a hundred pounds sterling  sold for seven hundred and  fifty pounds carolina currency  of this the merchants might complain  but  from this period they had too little weight in the public councils to  obtain any redress  the only resource left for them was to raise the  price of negroes  and british articles of importation  according to the  advanced price of produce  and bills of exchange  however  the exchange  again fell to seven hundred  per cent   at which standard it afterwards  rested and remained          sidenote  small progress of georgia     by this time the poor colonists of georgia  after trial  had become fully  convinced of the impropriety and folly of the plan of settlement framed  by the trustees  which  however well intended  was ill adapted to their  circumstances  and ruinous to the settlement  in the province of  carolina  which lay adjacent  the colonists discovered that there they  could obtain lands not only on better terms  but also liberty to purchase  negroes to assist in clearing and cultivating them  they found labour in  the burning climate intolerable  and the dangers and hardships to which  they were subjected unsurmountable  instead of raising commodities for  exportation  the georgians  by the labour of several years  were not yet  able to raise provisions sufficient to support themselves and families   under each discouragements  numbers retired to the carolina side of the  river  where they had better prospects of success  and the magistrates  observed the infant colony sinking into ruin  and likely to be totally  deserted  the freeholders in and round savanna assembled together  and  drew up a state of their deplorable circumstances  and transmitted it to  the trustees  in which they represented their success in georgia as a  thing absolutely impossible  without the enjoyment of the same liberties  and privileges with their neighbours in carolina  in two respects they  implored relief from the trustees  they desired a fee simple or free  title to their lands  and liberty to import negroes under certain  limitations  without which they declared they had neither encouragement  to labour  nor ability to provide for their posterity  but the colony of  highlanders  instead of joining in this application  to a man  remonstrated against the introduction of slaves  as they lay contiguous  to the spanish dominions  they were apprehensive that these enemies would  entice their slaves from them in time of peace  and in time of war  instigate them to rise against their masters  besides  they considered  perpetual slavery as shocking to human nature  and deemed the permission  of it as a grievance  and which in some future day might also prove a  scourge  and make many feel the smart of that oppression they so  earnestly desired to introduce  for as the spaniards had proclaimed

families were exposed  to barbarous domestics  provoked perhaps by harsh usage  or grown  desperate through misery and oppression          sidenote  hardships of the first settlers     few persons who are acquainted with the country will wonder at the  complaints of the poor settlers in georgia  for if we consider the  climate to which they were sent  and the labours and hardships they had  to undergo  we may rather be astonished that any of them survived the  first year after their arrival  when james oglethorpe took possession of  this wilderness  the whole was an immense thick forest  excepting  savannas  which are natural plains where no trees grow  and a few indian  fields  where the savages planted maize for their subsistence  in the  province there were the same wild animals  fishes  reptiles and insects   which were found in carolina  the country in the maritime parts was  likewise a spacious plain  covered with pine trees  where the lands were  barren and sandy  and with narrow slips of oaks  hickory  cypress  cane    c  where the lands were of a better quality  rains  thunder storms   hurricanes  and whirlwinds  were equally frequent in the one province as  in the other  little difference could be perceived in the soil  which in  both was barren or swampy  and the same diseases were common to both  the  lands being covered with wood  through which the sea breezes could not  penetrate  there was little agitation in the air  which at some seasons  was thick  heavy and foggy  and at others clear  close  and suffocating   both which are very pernicious to health  the air of the swampy land was  pregnant with innumerable noxious qualities  insomuch that a more  unwholesome climate was not perhaps to be found in the universe  the poor  settlers considered this howling wilderness to which they were brought   to have been designed by nature rather for the habitation of wild beasts  than human creatures  they found that diseases  or even misfortunes were  in effect equally fatal  for though neither of them might prove mortal   yet either would disable them from living  and reduce them to a state in  which they might more properly be said to perish than to die     nothing has retarded the progress and improvement of these southern  settlements more than the inattention shewn to the natural productions of  the soil  and the preference which has commonly been given to articles  transplanted from europe  over the whole world different articles of  produce are suited to different soils and climates  as georgia lay so  convenient for supplying the west indies with maize  indian pease  and  potatoes  for which the demand was very great  perhaps the first planters  could scarcely have turned their attention to more profitable articles   but without strength of hands little advantage could be reaped from them   it is true the west india islands would produce such articles  yet the  planters would never cultivate them  while they could obtain them by  purchase  the lands there suited other productions more valuable and  advantageous  abundance of stock  particularly hogs and black cattle   might have been raised in georgia for the same market  lumber was also in  demand  and might have been rendered profitable to the province  but  nothing could succeed there under the foolish restrictions of the  trustees  european grain  such as wheat  oats  barley  and rye  thrived  very ill on the maritime parts  and even silk and wine were found upon  trial by no means to answer their expectations  the bounties given for  raising the latter were an encouragement to the settlers  but either no  pains were taken to instruct the people in the proper methods of raising  them  or the soil and climate were ill adapted for the purpose  the poor  and ignorant planters applied themselves to those articles of husbandry  to which probably they had been formerly accustomed  but which poorly  rewarded them and left them  after all their toil  in a starved and  miserable condition     the complaints of the georgians  however ignorant they might be  ought  not to have been entirely disregarded by the trustees  experience  suggested those inconveniencies and troubles from which they implored  relief  the hints they gave certainly ought to have been improved towards  correcting errors in the first plan of settlement  and framing another  more favourable and advantageous  such scattered thoughts of individuals  sometimes afford wise men materials for forming just judgments  and  improving towards the establishment of the best and most beneficial  regulations  the people governed ought never to be excluded from the  attention and regard of their governors  the honour of the trustees  depended on the success and happiness of the settlers  and it was  impossible for the people to succeed and be happy without those  encouragements  liberties and privileges absolutely necessary to the  first state of colonization  a free title to their land  liberty to chuse  it  and then to manage it in such a manner as appeared to themselves most  conducive to their interest  were the principal incentives to industry   and industry  well directed  is the grand source of opulence to every  country     it must be acknowledged  for the credit of the benevolent trustees  that  they sent out these emigrants to georgia under several very favourable  circumstances  they paid the expences of their passage  and furnished  them with clothes  arms  ammunition  and instruments of husbandry  they  gave them lands  and bought for some of them cows and hogs to begin their  flock  they maintained their family during the first year of their  occupancy  or until they should receive some return from their lands  so  that if the planters were exposed to hazards from the climate  and  obliged to undergo labour  they certainly entered on their task with  several advantages  the taxes demanded  comparatively speaking  were a  mere trifle  for their encouragement they wrought entirely for  themselves  and for some time were favoured with a free and generous  maintenance          sidenote  an

bishops  and unable by their utmost diligence to procure a  comfortable subsistence for their families  embarked for carolina  the  first colony of irish people had lands granted them near santee river   and formed the settlement called williamsburgh township  but  notwithstanding the bounty of the crown  these poor emigrants remained  for several years in low and miserable circumstances  the rigours of the  climate  joined to the want of precaution  so common to strangers  proved  fatal to numbers of them  having but scanty provisions in the first age  of cultivation  vast numbers  by their heavy labour  being both  debilitated in body and dejected in spirit  sickened and died in the  woods  but as this township received frequent supplies from the same  quarter  the irish settlement  amidst every hardship  increased in  number  and at length they applied to the merchants for negroes  who  entrusted them with a few  by which means they were relieved from the  severest

treaty  the british  merchants claimed the privilege of cutting logwood on the bay of  campeachy  this liberty indeed had been tolerated on the part of spain  for several years  and the british merchants  from avaricious motives   had begun a traffic with the spaniards  and supplied them with goods of  english manufacture   to prevent this illicit trade  the spaniards  doubled the number of ships stationed in mexico for guarding the coast   giving them orders to board and search every english vessel found in  those seas  to seize on all that carried contraband commodities  and  confine the sailors  at length not only smugglers  but fair traders were  searched and detained  so that all commerce in those seas was entirely  obstructed  the british merchants again and again complained to the  ministry of depredations committed  and damages sustained  which indeed  produced one remonstrance after another to the spanish court  all which  were answered only by evasive promises and delays  the spaniards  flattered the british minister  by telling him  they would enquire into  the occasion of such grievances  and settle all differences by way of  negotiation  sir robert walpole

account of the spanish  preparations  and the feeble and defenceless condition of georgia  and  imploring his majesty s gracious assistance  in consequence of which  a  regiment of six hundred effective men was ordered to be raised  with a  view of sending them to georgia  the king having made james oglethorpe  major general of all the forces of the two provinces  gave him the  command of

their grateful sense of  his majesty s paternal care in the strongest terms  the georgians  who  had been for some time harassed with frequent alarms  now found  themselves happily relieved  and placed in such circumstances as enabled  them to bid defiance to the spanish power  parties of the regiment were  sent to the different garrisons  and the expence the trustees had  formerly been at in maintaining them of course ceased  the general held  his head quarters at frederica  but raised forts on some other islands  lying nearer the spaniards  particularly in cumberland and jekyl islands

general  oglethorpe to cultivate the firmest friendship with indian nations  that  they might be ready on every emergency to assist him  during his absence  the spaniards had made several attempts to seduce the creeks  who were  much attached to oglethorpe  by telling them he was at augustine  and  promised them great presents in case they would pay him a visit at that  place  accordingly some of their leaders went down to see the beloved  man  but not finding him there  they were highly offended  and resolved  immediately to return to their nation  the spanish governor  in order to  cover the fraud  or probably with a design of conveying those leaders out  of the way  that they might the more easily corrupt their nation  told  them  that the general lay sick on board of a ship in the harbour  where  he would be extremely glad to see them  but the savages were jealous of  some bad design  and refused to go  and even rejected their presents and  offers of alliance  when they returned to their nation  they found an  invitation from general oglethorpe to all the chieftains to meet him at  frederica  which plainly discovered to them the insidious designs of the  spaniards  and helped not a little to increase his power and influence  among them  a number of their head warriors immediately set out to meet  him at the place appointed  where the general thanked them for their  fidelity  made them many valuable presents  and renewed the treaty of  friendship and alliance with them  at this congress the creeks seemed  better satisfied than usual  agreed to march a thousand men to the  general s assistance whenever he should demand them  and invited him up  to see their towns  but as he was then busy  he excused himself  by  promising to visit them next summer

by this time the king of england had resolved to vindicate the honour of  his crown  and maintain his right to those territories in georgia   together with the freedom of commerce and navigation in the mexican seas   the pacific system of sir robert walpole had drawn upon him the  displeasure of the nation  particularly of the mercantile part  and that  amazing power and authority he had long maintained began to decline  the  spirit of the nation was rouzed  insomuch that the administration could  no longer wink at the insults  depredations  and cruelties of spain   instructions were sent to the british ambassador at the court of madrid   to demand in the most absolute terms a compensation for the injuries of  trade  which  upon calculation  amounted to two hundred thousand pounds  sterling  and at the same time a squadron of ten ships of the line  under  the command of admiral haddock  were sent to the mediterranean sea  this  produced an order from the spanish court to their ambassador  to allow  the accounts of the british merchants  upon condition that the spanish  demand on the south sea company be deducted  and that oglethorpe be  recalled from georgia  and no more employed in that quarter  as he had  there made great encroachments on his catholic majesty s dominions  these  conditions were received at the court of britain with that indignation  which might have been expected from an injured and incensed nation  in  answer to which the spanish ambassador was given to understand  that the  king of great britain was determined never to relinquish his right to a  single foot of land in the province of georgia  and that he must allow  his subjects to make reprisals  since satisfaction for their losses in  trade could in no other way be obtained  in this

hardships in georgia  to which they had not been accustomed in  britain  several of them were discontented and ungovernable  at length a  plot was discovered in the camp for assassinating their general  two  companies of the regiment had been drawn from gibraltar  some of whom  could speak the spanish language  while stationed on cumberland island   the spanish out posts on the other side could approach so near as to  converse with the british soldiers  one of whom had even been in the  spanish service  and not only understood their language  but also had so  much of a roman catholic spirit as to harbour an aversion to protestant  heretics  the spaniards had found means to corrupt this villain  who  debauched the minds of several of his neighbours  insomuch that they  united and formed a design first to murder general oglethorpe  and then  make their escape to augustine  accordingly  on a certain day a number of  soldiers under arms came up to the general  and made some extraordinary  demands  which being refused  they instantly cried out  one and all  and  immediately one of them discharged his piece at him  and being only at  the distance of a few paces  the ball whizzed over his shoulder  but the  powder singed his clothes  and burnt his face  another presented his  piece  which flashed in the pan  a third drew his hanger and attempted to  stab him  but the

concealed effort of spanish policy  another of a  more dangerous nature soon followed in carolina  which might have been  attended with much more bloody and fatal effects  at this time there were  above forty thousand negroes in the province  a fierce  hardy and strong  race  whose constitutions were adapted to the warm climate  whose nerves  were braced with constant labour  and who could scarcely be supposed to  be contented with that oppressive yoke under which they groaned  long had  liberty and protection been promised and proclaimed to them by the  spaniards at augustine  nor were all the negroes in the province  strangers to the proclamation  at different times spanish emissaries had  been found secretly tampering with them  and persuading them to fly from  slavery to florida  and several had made their escape to that settlement   of these negro refugees the governor of florida had formed a regiment   appointing officers from among themselves  allowing them the same pay and  clothing them in the same uniform with the regular spanish soldiers  the  most sensible part of the slaves in carolina were not ignorant of this  spanish regiment  for whenever they run away from their masters  they  constantly directed their course to this quarter  to no place could negro  serjeants be sent for enlisting men where they could have a better  prospect of success  two spaniards were caught in georgia  and committed  to jail  for enticing slaves to leave carolina and join this regiment   five negroes  who were cattle hunters at indian land  some of whom  belonged to captain

charlestown from the southward   met them  and  observing them armed  quickly rode out of their way  he  spread the alarm  which soon reached the presbyterian church at wiltown   where archibald stobo was preaching to a numerous congregation of  planters in that quarter  by a law of the province all planters were  obliged to carry their arms to church  which at this critical juncture  proved a very useful and necessary regulation  the women were left in  church trembling with fear while the militia  under the command of  captain bee  marched in quest of the negroes  who by this time had become  formidable from the number that joined them  they had marched above  twelve miles  and spread desolation through all the plantations in their  way  having found rum in some houses  and drank freely of it  they halted  in an open field  and began to sing and dance  by way of triumph  during  these rejoicings the militia discovered them  and stationed themselves in  different places around them  to prevent them from making their escape   the intoxication of several of the slaves favoured the assailants  one  party advanced into the open field and attacked them  and  having killed  some negroes

consternation by this  insurrection  in which above twenty persons were murdered before it was  quelled  and had not the people in that quarter been fortunately  collected together at church  it is probable many more would have  suffered  or had it become general  the whole colony must have fallen a  sacrifice to their great power and indiscriminate fury  it was commonly  believed  and not without reason  that the spaniards were deeply  concerned in promoting the mischief  and by their secret influence and  intrigues with slaves had instigated them to this massacre  having  already four companies of negroes in their service  by penetrating into  carolina  and putting the province into confusion  they might no doubt  have raised many more  but  to prevent farther attempts  governor bull  sent an express to general oglethorpe with advice of the insurrection   desiring him to double his vigilance in georgia  and seize all straggling  spaniards and negroes  in consequence of which a proclamation was issued  to stop all slaves found in that province  offering a reward for every  one they might catch attempting to run off  at the same time a company of  rangers were employed to

bull laid his  letter before the provincial assembly  recommending to them to raise a  regiment  and give him all possible assistance in an enterprize of such  interesting consequence  the assembly  sensible of the vast advantages  that must accrue to them from getting rid of such troublesome neighbours   resolved that so soon as the general should communicate to them his plan  of operations  together with a state of the assistance requisite  at the  same time making it appear that there was a probability of success  they  would most cheerfully assist him  the carolineans  however  were  apprehensive  that as that garrison had proved such a painful thorn in  their side in time of peace  they would have more to dread from it in  time of war  and although the colony had been much distressed by the  small pox and the yellow fever for two years past  which had cut off the  hopes of many flourishing families  the people  nevertheless  lent a very  favourable ear to the proposal

lieutenant dunbar  and returned to the place of general  rendezvous  where he was joined by colonel vanderdussen  with the  carolina regiment  and a company of highlanders  under the command of  captain m intosh  but by this time six spanish half galleys  with long  brass nine pounders  and two sloops loaded with provisions  had got into  the harbour at augustine  a few days afterwards  the general marched with  his whole force  consisting of above two thousand men  regulars   provincials and indians  to fort moosa  situated within two miles of  augustine  which on his approach the spanish garrison evacuated  and  retired into the town  he immediately ordered the gates of this fort to  be burnt  three breaches to be made in its walls  and then proceeded to  reconnoitre the town and castle     notwithstanding the dispatch of the british army  the spaniards  during  their stay at fort diego  had collected all the cattle in the woods  around them  and drove them into the town  and the general found  both  from a view of the works  and the intelligence he had received from  prisoners  that more difficulty would attend this enterprize than he at  first expected  indeed  if he intended a surprize  he ought not to have  stopped at fort diego  for by that delay the enemy had notice of his  approach  and time to gather their whole force  and put themselves in a  posture of

arched over  and newly made bomb proof  fifty pieces of cannon were  mounted  several of which were twenty four pounders  besides the castle   the town was entrenched with ten salient angles  on each of which some  small cannon were mounted  the garrison consisted of seven hundred  regulars  two troops of horse  four companies of armed negroes  besides  the militia of the province  and indians          sidenote  invests augustine     the general now plainly perceived that an attack by land upon the town   and an attempt to take the castle by storm would cost him dear before he  could reduce the place  and therefore changed his plan of operations   with the assistance of the ships of war  which were now lying at anchor  off augustine bar  he resolved to turn the siege into a blockade  and try  to shut up every channel by which provisions could be conveyed to the  garrison  for this purpose he left colonel palmer with ninety five  highlanders  and forty two indians at fort moosa  with orders to scour  the woods around the town  and intercept all supplies of cattle from the  country by land  and  for the safety of his men  he at the same time  ordered him to encamp every night in a different place  to keep strict  watch around his camp  and by all means avoid coming to any action  this  small party was the whole force the general left for guarding the land  side  then he sent colonel vanderdussen  with the carolina regiment  over  a small creek  to take possession of a neck of land called point quartel   above a mile distant from the castle  with orders to erect a battery upon  it  while he himself  with his regiment  and the greatest part of the  indians  embarked in boats  and landed on the island of anastatia  in  this island the spaniards had a small party of men stationed for a guard   who immediately fled to town  and as it lay opposite to the castle  from  this place  the general resolved to bombard the town  captain pierce  stationed one of his ships to guard the passage  by way of the motanzas   and with the others blocked up the mouth of the harbour  so that the  spaniards were cut off from all supplies by sea  on the island of  anastatia batteries were soon erected  and several cannon mounted by the  assistance of the active and enterprising sailors  having made these  dispositions  general oglethorpe then summoned the spanish governor to a  surrender  but the haughty don  secure in his strong hold  sent him for  answer  that he would be glad to shake hands with him in his castle     this insulting answer excited the highest degree of wrath and indignation  in the general s mind  and made him resolve to exert himself to the  utmost for humbling his pride  the opportunity of surprizing the place  being now lost  he had no other secure method left but to attack it at  the distance in which he then stood  for this purpose he opened his  batteries against the castle  and at the same time threw a number of  shells into the town  the fire was returned with equal spirit both from  the spanish fort and from six half gallies in the harbour  but so great  was the distance  that though they continued the cannonade for several  days  little execution was done on either side  captain warren  a brave  naval officer  perceiving that all efforts in this way for demolishing  the castle were vain and ineffectual  proposed to destroy the spanish  gallies in the harbour  by an attack in the night  and offered to go  himself and head the attempt  a council of war was held to consider of  and concert a plan for that service  but  upon sounding the bar  it was  found it would admit no large ship to the attack  and with small ones it  was judged rash and impracticable  the gallies being covered by the  cannon of the castle  and therefore that design was dropt          sidenote  raises the siege     in the mean time the spanish commander observing the besiegers  embarrassed  and their operations beginning to relax  sent out a  detachment of three hundred men against colonel palmer  who surprised him  at fort moosa  and  while most of his party lay asleep  cut them almost  entirely to pieces  a few that accidentally escaped  went over in a small  boat to the carolina regiment at point quartel  some of the chickesaw  indians coming from that fort having met with a spaniard  cut off his  head  agreeable to their savage manner of waging war  and presented it to  the general in his camp  but he rejected it with abhorrence  calling them  barbarous dogs  and bidding them begone  at this disdainful behaviour   however  the chickesaws were offended  declaring  that if they had  carried the head of an englishman to the french  they would not have  treated them so  and perhaps the general discovered more humanity than  good policy by it  for these indians  who knew none of the european  customs and refinements in war  soon after deserted him  about the same  time the vessel stationed at the metanzas being ordered off  some small  ships from the havanna with provisions  and a reinforcement of men  got  into augustine  by that narrow channel  to the relief of the garrison  a  party of creeks having surprised one of their small boats  brought four  spanish prisoners to the general  who informed him  that the garrison had  received seven hundred men  and a large supply of provisions  then all  prospects of starving the enemy being lost  the army began to despair of  forcing the place to surrender  the carolinean troops  enfeebled by the  heat  dispirited by sickness  and fatigued by fruitless efforts  marched  away in large bodies  the navy being short of provisions  and the usual  season of hurricanes approaching  the commander judged it imprudent to  hazard his majesty s ships  by remaining longer on that coast  last of  all  the general himself  sick of a fever  and his regiment worn out with  fatigue  and rendered unfit for action by a flux  with sorrow and regret  followed  and reached frederica about the   th of july          thus ended the unsuccessful expedition against augustine  to the great  disappointment of both georgia and carolina  many heavy reflections were  afterwards thrown out against general oglethorpe for his conduct during  the whole enterprize  perhaps the only chance of success he had from the  beginning was by surprising this garrison in the night by some sudden  attempt  he was blamed for remaining so long at fort diego  by which  means the enemy had full intelligence of his approach  and time to  prepare for receiving him  he was charged with timidity afterwards  in  making no bold attempt on the town  it was said  that the officer who  means to act on the offensive  where difficulties must be surmounted   ought to display some courage  and that too much timidity in war is often  as culpable as too much temerity  great caution he indeed used for saving  his men  for excepting those who fell by the sword in fort moosa  he lost  more men by sickness than by the hands of the enemy  though the disaster  of colonel palmer  in which many brave highlanders were massacred  was  perhaps occasioned chiefly by want of vigilance and a disobedience of  orders  yet many were of opinion  that it was too hazardous to have left  so small a party on the main land  exposed to sallies from a superior  enemy  and entirely cut off from all possibility of support and  assistance from the main body  in short  the carolineans called in  question the general s military judgment and skill in many respects  and  protested that he had spent the time in barren deliberations  harassed  the men with unnecessary marches  allowed them not a sufficient quantity  of provisions  and poisoned them with breakish water  he  on the other  hand  declared he had no confidence in the firmness and courage of the  provincials  for that they refused obedience to his orders  and at last  abandoned his camp  and retreated to carolina  the truth was  so strongly  fortified was the place  both by nature and art  that probably the  attempt must have failed  though it had been conducted by the ablest  officer  and executed by the best disciplined troops  the miscarriage   however  was particularly ruinous to carolina  having not only subjected  the province to a great expence  but also left it in a worse situation  than it was before the attempt          sidenote  a great fire at charlestown     the same year stands distinguished in the annals of carolina  not only  for this unsuccessful expedition against the spaniards  but also for a  desolating fire  which in november following broke out in the capital   and laid the half of it in ruins  this fire began about two o clock in  the afternoon  and burnt with unquenchable violence until eight at night   the houses being built of wood  and the wind blowing hard at north west   the flames spread with astonishing rapidity  from broad street  where the  fire kindled  to granville s bastion  almost every house was at one time  in flames  and exhibited an awful and striking scene  the vast quantities  of deerskins  rum  pitch  tar  turpentine and powder  in the different  stores  served to increase the horror  and the more speedily to spread  the desolation  amidst the cries and shrieks of women and children  and  the bursting forth of flames in different quarters  occasioned by the  violent wind  which carried the burning shingles to a great distance  the  men were put into confusion  and so anxious were they about the safety of  their families  that they could not be prevailed upon to unite their  efforts for extinguishing the fire  the sailors from the men of war  and  ships in the harbour were the most active and adventurous hands engaged  in the service  but such was the violence of the flames  that it baffled  all the art and power of man  and burnt until the calmness of the evening  closed the dreadful scene  three hundred of the best and most convenient  buildings in the town were consumed  which  together with lots of goods   and provincial commodities  amounted to a prodigious sum  happily few  lives were lost  but the lamentations of ruined families were heard in  every quarter  in short  from a flourishing condition the town was  reduced in the space of six hours to the lowest and most deplorable  state  all those inhabitants whose houses escaped the flames  went around  and kindly invited their unfortunate neighbours to them  so that two and  three families were lodged in places built only for the accommodation of  one  after the legislature met  to take the miserable state of the people  under consideration  they agreed to make application to the british  parliament for relief  the british parliament voted twenty thousand  pounds sterling  to be distributed among the sufferers at charlestown   which relief was equally seasonable and useful on the one side  as it was  generous and noble on the other  no time should obliterate the  impressions of such benevolent actions  this gift certainly deserved to  be wrote on the table of every heart  in the most indelible characters   for all men must acknowledge  that it merited the warmest returns of  gratitude  not only from the unfortunate objects of such bounty  but from  the whole province          sidenote  a petition in favour of the rice trade     while the war between great britain and spain continued  a bill was  brought into parliament to prevent the exportation of rice  among other  articles of provision  to france or spain  with a view to distress these  enemies as much as possible  in consequence of which  a representation to  the following effect  in behalf of the province of carolina  and the  merchants concerned in that trade  was presented to the house of commons  while the bill was depending before them  praying that the article of  rice might be excepted out of the bill  and endeavouring to prove  that  the prohibiting its importation would be highly detrimental to great  britain  and in no respect to her enemies   the inhabitants of south  carolina have not any manufactures of their own  but are supplied from  great britain with all their clothing  and the other manufactures by them  consumed  to the amount of one hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling  a year  the only commodity of consequence produced in south carolina is  rice  and they reckon it as much their staple commodity as sugar is to  barbadoes and jamaica  or tobacco to virginia and maryland  so that if  any stop be put to the exportation of rice from south carolina to europe   it will not only render the planters there incapable of paying their  debts  but also reduce the government of that province to such  difficulties for want of money  as at this present precarious time may  render the whole colony an easy prey to their neighbours the indians and  spaniards  and also to those yet more dangerous enemies their own  negroes  who are ready to revolt on the first opportunity  and are eight  times as many in number as there are white men able to bear arms  and the  danger in this respect is greater since the unhappy expedition to  augustine      from the year       when his majesty purchased south carolina  the trade  of it hath so increased  that their annual exports and imports of late  have been double the value of what they were in the said year  and their  exports of rice in particular have increased in a greater proportion   for  from the year      to       being ten years  both included  the  whole export of rice was         barrels  making        tons  from the       to       being also ten years  the whole export of rice was          barrels  making        tons  so that the export of the latter ten years  exceeded the former by         barrels  or        tons  and of the vast  quantities of rice thus exported  scarcely one fifteenth part is consumed  either in great britain or in any part of the british dominions  so that  the produce of the other fourteen parts is clear gain to the nation   whereas almost all the sugar  and one fourth part of the tobacco   exported from the british colonies  are consumed by the people of great  britain  or by british subjects  from whence it is evident  that the  national gain arising from rice is several times as great in proportion   as the national gain arising from either sugar or tobacco      this year   viz         in particular  we shall export from south  carolina above ninety thousand barrels of rice  of which quantity there  will not be three thousand barrels used here  so that the clear national  gain upon that export will be very great  for at the lowest computation   of twenty five shillings sterling  per  barrel  the eighty seven thousand  barrels exported will amount in value to one hundred and eight thousand  seven hundred and fifty pounds  at the first hand  whereto there must be  added the charge of freight    c   from south carolina to europe  which  amount to more than the first cost of the rice  and are also gain to  great britain  so that the least gain upon this article for the present  year will be two hundred and twenty thousand pounds  over and above the  naval advantage of annually employing more than one hundred and sixty  ships of one hundred tons each       rice being an enumerated commodity  it cannot be exported from south  carolina without giving bond for double the value that the same shall be  landed in great britain  or in some of the british plantations  excepting  to the southward of cape finisterre  which last was permitted by a law  made in the year       and the motive for such permission was  that the  rice might arrive more seasonably and in better condition at market  we  have hereunto added an account of the several quantities of rice which  have been exported from south carolina to the different european markets  since the said law was made  and it will thereby appear  that we have not  in those ten years been able to find sale for any considerable quantity  of rice in spain  for in all that time we have not sold above three  thousand five hundred and seventy barrels to the spaniards  making only  three hundred and fifty seven barrels annually upon a medium  nor can we  in the time to come expect any alteration in favour of our rice trade  there  because the spaniards are supplied with an inferior sort of rice  from turkey    c   equally agreeable to them and a great deal cheaper  than ours  the truth whereof appears by the rice taken in a ship called  the baltic merchant and carried into st  sebastians  where it was sold at  a price so much under the market rate here  or in holland  as to  encourage the sending of it thence to holland and hamburgh      in france the importation of carolina rice without licence is  prohibited  and though during the last and present years there hath  by  permission  been some consumption of it there  yet the whole did not  exceed nine thousand barrels  and they have received from turkey so much  rice of the present year s growth  as to make that commodity five  shillings  per       lb   cheaper at marseilles than here  and even at  dunkirk it is one shilling and sixpence  per       lb   cheaper than  here  so that there is not any prospect of a demand for carolina rice in  france  even if liberty could be obtained for sending the same to any  port of that kingdom      germany and holland are the countries where we find the best market for  our rice  and there the greater part of it is consumed  so that the  present intended embargo  or prohibitory law  cannot have any other  effect  in relation to rice  than that of preventing our allies from  using what our enemies do not want  nor we ourselves consume more than a  twentieth part of  and which is of so perishable a nature  that even in a  cold climate it doth not keep above a year without decaying  and in a  warm climate it perishes entirely  the great consumption of rice in  germany and holland is during the winter season  when pease and all kinds  of pulse    c   are scarce  and the rice intended for those markets ought  to be brought there before the frost begins  time enough to be carried up  the rivers  so that preventing the exportation only a few days may be  attended with this had consequence  that by the frost the winter sale may  be lost      and as we have now   viz   since november   th  above ten thousand  barrels of old rice arrived  so we may in a few weeks expect double that  quantity  besides the new crop now shipping off from carolina  the  stopping of all which  in a country where there is not any sale for it   instead of permitting the same to be carried to the only places of  consumption  must soon reduce the price thereof to so low a rate  that  the merchants who have purchased that rice will not be able to sell it  for the prime cost  much less will they be able to recover the money they  have paid for duty  freight  and other charges thereon  which amount to  double the first cost  for the rice that an hundred pounds sterling will  purchase in south carolina  costs the importer two hundred more in  british duties  freight  and other charges             an account of rice exported in ten years after the province was      purchased for the king                                   barrels        to portugal                             to gibraltar                            to spain                                to france                               to great britain       ireland  and the      british plantations                     to holland  hamburgh      and bremen  including           barrels to sweden      and denmark                                                                     total quantity exported      in those ten years                     thus it appears  that by prohibiting the exportation of rice from this  kingdom  the merchants who have purchased the vast quantities before  mentioned will not only lose the money it cost them  but twice as much  more in duties  freight  and other charges  by their having a perishable  commodity embargoed in a country where it is not used  or if  instead of  laying the prohibition here  it be laid in south carolina  that province   the planters there  and the merchants who deal with them  must all be  involved in ruin  the province  for want of means to support the expense  of government  the planters  for want of the means to pay their debts and  provide future supplies  and the merchants  by not only losing those  debts  but twice as much more in the freight  duties  and other charges   upon rice which they cannot sell  so that  in either case  a very  profitable colony  and the merchants concerned in the trade of it  would  be ruined for the present  if not totally lost to this kingdom  by  prohibiting the exportation of rice  and all this without doing any  national good in another way  for such prohibition could not in any shape  distress our enemies  it is therefore humbly hoped  that rice will be  excepted out of the bill now before the honourable house of commons      as this representation contains a distinct account of the produce and  trade of the province  and shews its usefulness and importance to great  britain  we judged it worthy of the particular attention of our readers   and therefore have inserted it  with respect to the internal dangers  arising from the savage nature and vast number of the slaves  mentioned  in this and a former state of the province  we shall now make some  remarks  in which we will be naturally led to consider their miserable  condition  and the harsh treatment to which slavery necessarily subjects  them          sidenote  remarks on the treatment of slaves     that slavery has been practiced by many of the most civilized nations in  the world  is indeed a truth evident from the history of them  in war the  conquerors were supposed to have a right to the life of their captives   insomuch that they might kill  torture or enslave them  as they thought  proper  yet  though war may be justifiable on the principles of  self preservation and defence  it is no easy matter to vindicate the  conqueror s right to murder or enslave a disarmed enemy  slavery in  general  like several other enormities  ought to be ascribed to the  corruption and avarice of men  rather than to any principles of nature  and humanity  which evidently testify against it  and that vindication  which is drawn from the custom and practice of ancient nations in favour  of such an institution  is equally applicable to many other enormities  which are a shame and disgrace to human nature  helpless children have  been exposed to the fury of wild beasts  pride and ambition have spread  their desolations far and wide  but such practices are not therefore  humane and just  that many nations have encouraged slavery  and that the  remains of it are still observable among the freest of them  are argument  which none will plead for their honour and credit  that species of  servitude which still remains in britain among the labourers in the coal  mines    c   is very different from that to which the natives of africa  are subjected in the western world  because such labourers voluntarily  enter on such servitude  they acquire wages as their reward  and both  their persons and properties are under the protection of the laws of the  realm     upon the slightest reflection all men must confess  that those africans   whom the powers of europe have conspired to enslave  are by nature  equally free and independent  equally susceptible of pain and pleasure   equally averse from bondage and misery  as europeans themselves  like all  rude nations  they have a strong attachment to their native country  and  to those friends and relations with whom they spent the early years of  life  by this trade being torn from those nearest connections  and  transported to a distant land  it is no easy thing to describe the  uneasiness and pain they must endure from such violence and banishment   during the passage being loaded with irons  and cooped up in a ship   oppressed with the most gloomy apprehensions  many of them sicken and die  through fear and regret  the provisions made for the voyage by the  merchants and masters of ships  who consult their worldly interest more  than the dictates of humanity  we may be sure are neither of the best  kind  nor distributed among them in the most plentiful manner  after  their arrival they are sold and delivered over to the colonists  to whose  temper  language and manners they are utter strangers  where their  situation for some time  in case of harsh usage  is little better than  that of the dumb beasts  having no language but groans in which they can  express their pains  nor any friend to pity or relieve them  some destroy  themselves through despair  and from a persuasion they fondly entertain   that  after death  they will return to their beloved friends and native  country          sidenote  the hardships of their situation     after the sale the purchasers become vested with the absolute property of  them  according to the laws  usages  and customs of the trade  and  whatever hardships are thereby imposed on those foreigners  the planters  are so far excusable  having the sanction of the supreme legislature for  the purchase they make  the laws of england  from necessity or  expediency  have permitted such labourers to be imported among them  and  therefore  on their part  the purchase  however injurious  cannot be  illegal  having acquired this kind of property  it then lies with the  colonists to frame laws and regulations for the future management of  their slaves  in doing this  absolute obedience and non resistance are  fundamental principles established for the government of them  and  enforced by the severest penalties  all laws framed with respect to them   give their masters such authority over them as is under few limitations   their power of correction may be said to be only not allowed to extend to  death  however severely beat and abused  no negro can bring an action  against his owner  or appear as an evidence against white men  in any  court of law or justice  their natural rights as human creatures are  entirely disregarded  and punishments are commonly inflicted according to  the will of their master  however cruel and barbarous his disposition may  be  a common place of correction is instituted  to which they are sent to  receive such a number of stripes as their owners shall order  and such  blunders have been committed in giving and executing those orders  that  the innocent sometimes have suffered along with the guilty  in short   such is their miserable condition  that they are exposed defenceless to  the insolence  caprice  and passions of owners  obliged to labour all  their life without any prospect of reward  or any hope of an end of their  toil until the day of their death  at the decease of their masters they  descend  like other estates of inheritance  to the heir at law  and  sometimes to thoughtless and giddy youth  habituated from their earliest  days to treat them like brutes  at other times  no doubt  they are more  fortunate  but their condition of life evidently subjects them to harsh  usage even from the best of masters  and we leave the world to judge what  they have to expect from the worst     indeed it must be acknowledged  in justice to the planters of carolina in  general  that they treat their slaves with as much  and perhaps more  tenderness  than those of any british colony where slavery exists  yet a  disinterested stranger must observe  even among the best of masters   several instances of cruelty and negligence in the manner of managing  their slaves  comparatively speaking  they are well clothed and fed in  that province  which while they continue in health fits and qualifies  them for their task  when they happen to fall sick  they are carefully  attended by a physician  in which respect their condition is better than  that of the poorest class of labourers in europe  but in the west indies   we have been told  they are both covered with rags and have a scanty  portion of provisions allowed them  in which case urgent necessity and  pinching hunger must often urge them to pilfer  and commit many injuries  to which otherwise they would have no inclination  and for which they  incur severe punishment  in cases of violence and murder committed on  these wretched creatures  it is next to impossible to have the  delinquents brought to punishment  for either the grand jury refuse to  find the bill  or the petty jury bring in the verdict not guilty  when  they are tempted to fly to the woods to shun severe labour or punishment  then they may be hunted down or shot as wild beasts  when whipped to  death  the murderer  after all  is only subjected to an inconsiderable  fine  or a short imprisonment  by the provincial laws  it is impossible  that the author of nature ever intended human beings for such a wretched  fate  for surely he who gave life  gave also an undoubted right to the  means of self preservation and happiness  and all the common rights and  privileges of nature     but there is another circumstance which renders their case still more  wretched and deplorable  good masters and mistresses  whose humanity and  a sense of interest will not permit them to treat their negroes in a  harsh manner  do not always reside at their plantations  many planters  have several settlements at considerable distances from the place where  they usually live  which they visit perhaps only three or four times in a  year  in their absence the charge of negroes is given to overseers  many  of whom are ignorant and cruel  and all totally disinterested in the  welfare of their charge  in such a case it can scarcely be expected that  justice will be equally dispensed  or punishments properly inflicted  the  negroes  however  ly entirely at the mercy of such men  and such monsters  they sometimes are  as can inflict misery in sport  and hear the groans  extorted from nature with laughter and triumph  all slaves under their  care must yield absolute obedience to their orders  however unreasonable  and difficult  or suffer punishment for their disobedience  it would  rouze the anguish and indignation of a humane person to stand by while a  puny overseer chastises those slaves  and behold with what piercing  stripes he furrows the back of an able negro  whose greatness of soul  will not suffer him to complain  and whose strength could crush his  tormentor to atoms  the unmerciful whip with which they are chastised is  made of cow skin  hardened  twisted  and tapering  which brings the blood  with every blow  and leaves a scar on their naked back which they carry  with them to their grave  at the arbitrary will of such managers  many of  them with hearts of adamant  this unfortunate race are brought to the  post of correction  often no doubt through malice and wantonness  often  for the most trifling offences  and sometimes  o horrid  when entirely  innocent  can it be deemed wonderful  that such unhappy creatures should  now and then be tempted to assert the rights of nature  must not such  harsh usage often fire them with desires of liberty and vengeance  what  can be expected but that they should sometimes give those oppressors  grounds of fear  who have subjected them to such intolerable hardships     but from those labourers in the field the colonials have perhaps less  danger to dread  than from the number of tradesmen and mechanics in  towns  and domestic slaves  many negroes discover great capacities  and  an amazing aptness for learning trades  where dangerous tools are used   and many owners  from motives of profit and advantage  breed them to be  coopers  carpenters  bricklayers  smiths  and other trades  out of mere  ostentation the colonists also keep a number of them about their  families  who attend their tables  and hear their conversation  which  very often turns upon their own various arts  plots  and assassinations   from such open and imprudent conversation those domestics may no doubt  take dangerous hints  which  on a fair opportunity  may be applied to  their owners hurt  they have also easy access to fire arms  which gives  them a double advantage for mischief  when they are of a passionate and  revengeful disposition  such domestic slaves seldom want an opportunity  of striking a sudden blow  and avenging themselves  in case of ill usage   by killing or poisoning their owners  such crimes have often been  committed in the colonies  and punished  and there is reason to believe  they have also frequently happened  when they have passed undiscovered   prudence and self preservation strongly dictate to the carolineans the  necessity of guarding against those dangers which arise from domestic  slaves  many of whom are idle  cunning and deceitful          sidenote  oppressed with ignorance and superstition     in other respects the policy of the colonists  with respect to the  management and treatment of slaves is extremely defective  the hardships  to which their bodies are exposed  would be much more tolerable and  justifiable  were any provision made for civilizing and improving their  minds  but how grievous their circumstances when we consider  that   together with their bodily toil and misery  they are also kept in heathen  ignorance and darkness  destitute of the means of instruction  and  excluded in a manner from the pale of the christian church  humanity  places every rational creature upon a level  and gives all an equal title  those rights of nature  which are essential to life and happiness   christianity breathes a spirit of benevolence  gentleness  and compassion  for mankind in general  of what nation or complexion soever they be  as  government has tolerated and established slavery in the plantations  the  supreme charge of these creatures may be regarded rather as a national  than a provincial concern  being members of a great empire  living under  its supreme care and jurisdiction  and contributing to the increase of  trade and commerce  to the improvement and opulence of the british  dominions  they are unquestionably entitled to a share of national  benevolence and christian charity  an institution for their religious  instruction was an object of such usefulness and importance  that it  merited the attention of the supreme legislature  and the expence of a  few superb and perhaps empty churches in england  would certainly have  been better employed in erecting some neat buildings in the plantations  for this beneficial purpose  to such an institution the merchants of  britain  especially those who owe a great part of their opulence to the  labours of africans  and whose plea for the trade was the bringing them  within the pale of the christian church  ought certainly to have  contributed in the most liberal manner  the profits of the trade   abstracting from other considerations  could well admit of it  but every  principle of compassion for the ignorant  the poor  and the unfortunate   powerfully dictates the same duty  the neglect of which  to every  impartial judge  must appear in a very inexcusable and criminal light   masters of slaves under the french and spanish jurisdictions  are obliged  by law to allow them time for instruction  and to bring them up in the  knowledge and practice of the catholic religion  is it not a reproach to  the subjects of britain  who profess to be the freest and most civilized  people upon earth  that no provision is made for this purpose  and that  they suffer so many thousands of these creatures  residing in the british  dominions  to live and die the slaves of ignorance and superstition  how  can they expect the blessing of heaven on the riches flowing from their  foreign plantations  when they are at no pains to introduce those objects  of their care to the knowledge of the true god  and to make them  partakers of the benefits and hopes of christianity     the advantages of religion  like the other gifts of heaven  ought to be  free and common as the air we breathe to every human creature  capable of  making a proper use and improvement of them  to the honour of the society  for the propagation of the gospel it must indeed be acknowledged  that  they have made some efforts for the conversion and instruction of those  heathens  not many years ago they had no less than twelve missionaries in  carolina  who had instructions to give all the assistance in their power  for this laudable purpose  and to each of whom they allowed fifty pounds  a year  over and above their provincial salaries  but it is well known   that the fruit of their labours has been very small and inconsiderable   such feeble exertions were no ways equal to the extent of the work  required  nor to the greatness of the end proposed  whether their small  success ought to be ascribed to the rude and untractable dispositions of  the negroes  to the discouragements and obstructions thrown in the way by  their owners  or to the negligence and indolence of the missionaries  themselves we cannot pretend to determine  perhaps we may venture to  assert  that it has been more or less owing to all these different  causes  one thing is very certain  that the negroes of that country  a  few only excepted  are to this day as great strangers to christianity   and as much under the influence of pagan darkness  idolatry and  superstition  as they were at their first arrival from africa     but  though neglected by the british nation  they are entitled to a share  of the common privileges of humanity and christianity  from their  provincial owners  it is their duty and interest to use slaves with  tenderness and compassion  and render them as happy and contented as  their situation will admit  were they to allow them certain portions of  time from their labours of body for the improvement of their mind  and  open the way for  and provide the means of instruction  would not kind  usage be productive of many beneficial effects  the loss of labour none  but avaricious wretches would grudge  and the day of rest allotted for  man and beast since the beginning of the world  and properly improved for  that purpose  might of itself be attended with good consequences   whereas  to encourage them to labour on that day for themselves  is not  only robbing them of the opportunities of instruction  but abusing the  sunday  by making it to them the most laborious day of the week  it would  strike a stranger with astonishment and indignation  to hear the excuses  planters make for this criminal neglect  some will tell you they are  beings of an inferior rank  and little exalted above brute creatures   that they have no souls  and therefore no concern need be taken about  their salvation  others affirm  that they would become more expert in  vice by being taught  and greater knaves by being made christians  but  such advocates for heathen ignorance and barbarism merit no serious  notice  being enemies to all improvements in human nature  and all the  benefits resulting to society from civilization and christianity  certain  it is  the inhabitants of africa have the same faculties with those of  europe  their minds are equally capable of cultivation  equally  susceptible of the impressions of religion  ridiculous is it to imagine   that the black tincture of their skin  or the barbarous state in which  they were there found  can make any material alteration  though fortune  has put the former under the power of the latter  and assigned them the  portion of perpetual labour to procure the mere luxuries of life for  other men  yet  if such a traffic be reasonable and just  there is no  crime negroes can commit that may not be defended and justified upon the  same principles  if europe  to obtain sugar  rum  rice  and tobacco  has  a right to enslave africa  surely africa  if she had the power  has a  much better right to rob europe of those commodities  the fruits of her  children s labour  every argument that can be brought in support of the  institution of slavery  tends to the subversion of justice and morality  in the world  the best treatment possible from the colonists cannot  compensate for so great a loss  freedom  in its meanest circumstances  is  infinitely preferable to slavery  though it were in golden fetters  and  accompanied with the greatest splendour  ease  and abundance     if then the greatest advantages are not a sufficient compensation for the  loss of liberty  what shall we think of those who deny them the smallest   but one would imagine that  exclusive of every other motive  personal  safety would even induce the colonists to provide for them those  advantages which would render them as easy and contented as possible with  their condition  were they duly impressed with a sense of their duty to  god and man  were they taught the common rules of honesty  justice  and  truth  were their dispositions to humility  submission  and obedience   cultivated and improved  would not such advantages place them more on a  level with hired servants  who pay a ready and cheerful obedience to  their masters  were they favoured with the privileges of christianity   would they not be more faithful and diligent  and better reconciled to  their servile condition  besides  christianity has a tendency to tame  fierce and wild tempers  it is not an easy thing to display the great and  extensive influence which the fear of god  and the expectation of a  future account  would have upon their minds  christianity enforces the  obligations of morality  and produces a more regular and uniform  obedience to its laws  a due sense of the divine presence  the hopes of  his approbation  and the fears of his displeasure  are motives that  operate powerfully with the human mind  and in fact would prove stronger  barriers against trespasses  murders  plots  and conspiracies  than any  number of stripes from the hands of men  or even the terrors of certain  death  whereas  to keep the minds of human creatures under clouds of  darkness  neither disciplined by reason  nor regulated by religion  is a  reproach to the name of protestants  especially in a land of christian  light and liberty  sundays and holidays are indeed allowed the negroes in  carolina  the former cannot consistent with the laws be denied them  the  latter  as they are commonly spent are nuisances to the province   holidays there are days of idleness  riot  wantonness and excess  in  which the slaves assemble together in alarming crowds  for the purposes  of dancing  feasting and merriment  at such seasons the inhabitants have  the greatest reason to dread mischief from them  when let loose from  their usual employments  they have fair opportunities of hatching plots  and conspiracies  and of executing them with greater facility  from the  intemperance of their owners and overseers     after all  it must be confessed  that the freemen of carolina themselves  were for many years in a destitute condition with respect to religious  instruction  partly owing to their own poverty and the unhealthiness of  the climate  and partly owing to troubles and divisions subsisting among  them during the proprietary government  at that time the first object of  their concern would no doubt be to provide for themselves and their  children  but since the province has been taken under the royal care   their circumstances in every respect have changed for the better   insomuch that they are not only able to provide instruction for  themselves and families  but also to extend the benefit to those living  in a state of servitude among them  now they are arrived to such an easy  and flourishing situation  as renders their neglect entirely without  excuse  the instruction of negroes would no doubt be a difficult  but by  no means an impracticable undertaking  and the more difficult the end   the more praise and merit would be due to those who should effectually  accomplish it  even the catholics of spain pitied the miserable condition  of negroes living among the protestant colonies  and to induce them to  revolt  proffered them the advantages of liberty and religion at  augustine  is it not a shame to a protestant nation to keep such a number  of human creatures so long among them  beings of the same nature   subjects of the same government  who have souls to be saved  and capable  of being eternally happy or miserable in a future world  not only in a  miserable state of slavery  but also of pagan darkness and superstition   what could be expected from creatures thus doomed to endless labour  and  deprived of the natural rights of humanity and the privileges of  christianity  but that they should snatch at the least glimmering hopes  and prospects of a better state  and give their task masters reason to  dread  that they would lay hold of some opportunity of forcing their way  to it  this inexcusable negligence with respect to them may be considered  of itself as no small source of danger to the colonists  as the hazard is  greater from savage and ferocious  than mild and civilized dispositions   and  as the restraints of terror and temporal punishments are less  constant and powerful than those of conscience and religion  the  political and commercial connection subsisting between the mother country  and the colonies  makes the charge of negroes  in reason and justice  to  fall equally upon both  and whatever other men may think  we are of  opinion  that an institution for their instruction was an object of the  highest consequence  and that  by all the laws of god and man  that  nation which brought this unfortunate race into such a situation  was  bound to consult both their temporal and eternal felicity          sidenote  james glen governor     about this time james glen received a commission from his majesty   investing him with the government of south carolina  and at the same time  was appointed colonel of a new regiment of foot to be raised in the  province  he was a man of considerable knowledge  courteous  and polite   exceedingly fond of military parade and ostentation  which commonly have  great force on ordinary minds  and by these means he maintained his  dignity and importance in the eyes of the people  all governors invested  with extensive powers ought to be well acquainted with the common and  civil laws of their country  and every wise prince will guard against  nominating weak or wicked persons to an high office  which affords them  many opportunities of exercising their power to the prejudice of the  people  when men are promoted to the government of provinces on account  of their abilities and merit  and not through the interest of friends   then we may expect to see public affairs wisely managed  authority  revered  and every man sitting secure under his vine  and enjoying the  fruits of his industry with contentment and satisfaction  but when such  offices are bestowed on ignorant or needy persons  because they happen to  be favourites of some powerful and clamorous lord at court  without any  view to the interest and happiness of the people  then avarice and  oppression commonly prevail on one hand  and murmur and discontent on the  other  the appointment of governor glen was so far proper  as he  possessed those qualifications which rendered his government respectable   and the people living under it for several years happy and contented  his  council  consisting of twelve men  were appointed also by the king  under  his sign manual  the assembly of representatives consisted of forty four  members  and were elected every third year by the freeholders of sixteen  parishes  the court of chancery was composed of the governor and council   to which court belonged a master of chancery and a register  there was a  court of vice admiralty  the judge  register  and marshal of which were  appointed by the lords commissioners of the admiralty in england  the  court of king s bench consisted of a chief justice appointed by the king   who sat with some assistant justices of the province  and the same judges  constituted the court of common pleas  there were likewise an  attorney general  a clerk  and provost marshal  the secretary of the  province  who was also register  the surveyor general of the lands  and  the receiver general of the quit rents  were all appointed by the crown   the comptroller of the customs  and three collectors  at the ports of  charlestown  port royal  and georgetown  were appointed by the  commissioners of the customs in england  the provincial treasurer was  appointed by the general assembly  the clergy were elected by the  freeholders of the parish  all justices of the peace  and officers of the  militia  were appointed by the governor in council  this is the nature of  the provincial government and constitution  and in this way were the  principal officers of each branch appointed or elected  under the royal  establishment          sidenote  ld  carteret s property divided from that of the crown     about the same time john lord carteret  now earl of granville  applied by  petition to his majesty  praying that the eighth part of the lands and  soil granted by king charles  and referred to him by the act of  parliament establishing an agreement with the other seven lords  proprietors for the surrender of their title and interest to his majesty   might be set apart and allotted to him and his heirs for ever  and  proposing to appoint persons to divide the same  at the same time  offering to resign to the king his share of  and interest in the  government  and to convey  release and confirm to his majesty  and his  heirs  the other seven parts of the province  this petition being  referred to the lords commissioners of trade and plantations  they  reported  that it would be for his majesty s service that lord carteret s  property should be separated from that of his majesty  and that the  method proposed by his lordship would be the most proper and effectual  for the purpose  accordingly five commissioners were appointed on the  part of the king  and five on that of lord carteret for separating his  lordship s share  and making it one entire district by itself  the  territory allotted him was divided on the north east by the line which  separated north carolina from virginia  on the east by the atlantic  ocean  on the south by a point on the sea shore  in latitude thirty five  degrees and thirty four minutes  and  agreeable to the charter  westward  from these points on the sea shore it extended  in a line parallel to the  boundary line of virginia  to the pacific ocean  not long afterwards  a  grant of the eighth part of carolina  together with all yearly rents and  profits arising from it  passed the great seal  to john lord carteret and  his heirs  but the power of making laws  calling and holding assemblies   erecting courts of justice  appointing judges and justices  pardoning  criminals  granting titles of honour  making ports and havens  taking  customs or duties on goods  executing the martial law  exercising the  royal rights of a county palatine  or any other prerogatives relating to  the administrations of government  were all excepted out of the grant   lord carteret was to hold this estate upon condition of yielding and  paying to his majesty and his heirs and successors  the annual rent of  one pound thirteen shillings and fourpence  on the feast of all saints   for ever  and also one fourth part of all the gold and silver ore found  within this eighth part of the territory so separated and granted him          sidenote  the country much exposed to invasion     as carolina abounds with navigable rivers  while it enjoys many  advantages for commerce and trade  it is also much exposed to foreign  invasions  the tide on that coast flows from six to ten feet  perpendicular  and makes its way up into the flat country by a variety of  channels  all vessels that draw not above seventeen feet water  may  safely pass over the bar of charlestown  which at spring tides will admit  ships that draw eighteen feet  this bar lies in thirty two degrees and  forty minutes north latitude  and seventy eight degrees and forty five  minutes west longitude from london  its situation is variable  owing to a  sandy foundation and the rapid flux and reflux of the sea  the channel  leading to george town is twelve or thirteen feet deep  and likewise  those of north and south edisto rivers  and will admit all ships that  draw not above ten or eleven feet of water  at stono there is also a  large creek  which admits vessels of the same draught of water  but sewee  and santee rivers  and many others of less note  are for smaller craft  which draw seven  eight  or nine feet  the channel up to port royal  harbour is deep enough for the largest ships that sail on the sea  and  the whole royal navy of england may ride with safety in it  nature has  evidently ordained this place for trade and commerce  by the many  advantages with which she hath favoured it  it lies in thirty two degrees  and five minutes north latitude  and in longitude seventy nine degrees  five minutes  its situation renders it an excellent station for a  squadron of ships in time of war  as the run from it is short to the  windward islands  but especially as it lies so convenient for distressing  the immense trade coming through the gulf of florida  from this harbour  ships may run out to the gulf stream in one day  and return with equal  ease the next  so that it would be very difficult to escape a sufficient  number of cruisers stationed at beaufort  the harbour is also defended by  a small fort  built of tappy  which is a kind of cement composed of  oyster shells beat small  and mixed with lime and water  which when dry  becomes hard and durable  the fort has two demi bastions to the river   and one bastion to the land  with a gate and ditch  mounting sixteen  heavy cannon  and containing barracks for an hundred men     several leagues to the southward of port royal  savanna river empties  itself into the ocean  which is also navigable for ships that draw not  above fourteen feet water  at the southern boundary of georgia the great  river alatamaha falls into the atlantic sea  about sixteen leagues  north east of augustine  which lies in twenty nine degrees fifty minutes   this river admits ships of large burden as far as frederica  a small town  built by general oglethorpe  on an eminence in simon s island  the island  on the west end is washed by a branch of the river alatamaha  before it  empties itself into the sea at jekyl sound  at frederica the river forms  a kind of bay  the fort general oglethorpe erected here for the defence  of georgia had several eighteen pounders mounted on it and commanded the  river both upwards and downwards  it was built of tappy  with four  bastions  surrounded by a quadrangular rampart  and a palisadoed ditch   which included also the king s stores  and two large buildings of brick  and timber  the town was surrounded with a rampart  in the form of a  pentagon  with flankers of the same thickness with that at the fort  and  a dry ditch  on this rampart several pieces of ordnance were also  mounted  in this situation general oglethorpe had pitched his camp  which  was divided into streets  distinguished by the names of the several  captains of his regiment  their little huts were built of wood  and  constructed for holding each four or five men  at some distance from  frederica was the colony of highlanders  situated on the same river  a  wild and intrepid race  living in a state of rural freedom and  independence  their settlement being near the frontiers  afforded them  abundance of scope for the exercise of their warlike temper  and having  received one severe blow from the garrison at augustine  they seemed to  long for an opportunity of revenging the massacre of their beloved  friends          sidenote  the spaniards invade georgia     the time was fast approaching for giving them what they desired  for  although the territory granted by the second charter to the proprietors  at carolina extended far to the south west of the river alatamaha  the  spaniards had never relinquished their pretended claim to the province of  georgia  their ambassador at the british court had even declared that his  catholic majesty would as soon part with madrid as his claim to that  territory  the squadron commanded by admiral vernon had for some time  occupied their attention in the west indies so much  that they could  spare none of their forces to maintain their supposed right  but no  sooner had the greatest part of the british fleet left those seas  and  returned to england  than they immediately turned their eyes to georgia   and began to make preparations for dislodging the english settlers in  that province  finding that threats could not terrify general oglethorpe  to compliance with their demands  an armament was prepared at the havanna  to go against him  and expel him by force of arms from their frontiers   with this view two thousand forces  commanded by don antonio de rodondo   embarked at the havanna  under the convoy of a strong squadron  and  arrived at augustine in may          but before this formidable fleet and armament had reached augustine  they  were observed by captain haymer  of the flamborough man of war  who was  cruising on that coast  and advice was immediately sent to general  oglethorpe of their arrival in florida  georgia now began to tremble in  her turn  the general sent intelligence to governor glen at carolina   requesting him to collect all the forces he could with the greatest  expedition  and send them to his assistance  and at the same time to  dispatch a sloop to the west indies  to acquaint admiral vernon with the  intended invasion     carolina by this time had found great advantage from the settlement of  georgia  which had proved an excellent barrier to that province  against  the incursions of spaniards and spanish indians  the southern parts being  rendered secure by the regiment of general oglethorpe in georgia  the  lands backward of port royal had become much in demand  and risen four  times their former value  but though the carolineans were equally  interested with their neighbours in the defence of georgia  having little  confidence in general oglethorpe s military abilities  since his  unsuccessful expedition against augustine  the planters  struck with  terror  especially those on the southern parts  deserted their  habitations  and flocked to charlestown with their families and effects   the inhabitants of charlestown  many of whom being prejudiced against the  man  declared against sending him any assistance  and determined rather  to fortify their town  and stand upon their own grounds in a posture of  defence  in this resolution  however  it is plain they acted from bad  motives  in leaving that officer to stand alone against such a superior  force  at such an emergency  good policy evidently required the firmest  union  and the utmost exertion of the force of both colonies  for so soon  as general oglethorpe should be crushed  the reduction of georgia would  open to the common enemy an easy access into the bowels of carolina  and  render the force of both provinces  thus divided  unequal to the public  defence     in the mean time general oglethorpe was making all possible preparations  at frederica for a vigorous stand  message after message was sent to his  indian allies  who were greatly attached to him  and crowded to his camp   a company of highlanders joined him on the first notice  and seemed  joyful at the opportunity of retorting spanish vengeance on their own  heads  with his regiment  and a few rangers  highlanders  and indians   the general fixed his head quarters at frederica  never doubting of a  reinforcement from carolina  and expecting their arrival every day  but  in the mean time determined  in case he should be attacked  to sell his  life as dear as possible in defence of the province     about the end of june        the spanish fleet  amounting to thirty two  sail  and carrying above three thousand men  under the command of don  manuel de monteano  came to anchor off simons s bar  here they continued  for some time sounding the channel  and after finding a depth of water  sufficient to admit their ships  they came in with the tide of flood into  jekyl sound  general oglethorpe  who was at simons s fort  fired at them  as they passed the sound  which the spaniards returned from their ships   and proceeded up the river alatamaha  out of the reach of his guns  there  the enemy having hoisted a red flag at the mizen top mast head of the  largest ship  landed their forces upon the island  and erected a battery   with twenty eighteen pounders mounted on it  among their land forces they  had a fine company of artillery  under the command of don antonio de  rodondo  and a regiment of negroes  the negro commanders were clothed in  lace  bore the same rank with white officers  and with equal freedom and  familiarity walked and conversed with their commander and chief  such an  example might justly have alarmed carolina  for should the enemy  penetrate into that province  where there were such numbers of negroes   they would soon have acquired such a force  as must have rendered all  opposition fruitless and ineffectual     general oglethorpe having found that he could not stop the progress of  the enemy up the river  and judging his situation at fort simons too  dangerous  nailed up the guns  burst the bombs and coehorns  destroyed  the stores  and retreated to his head quarters at frederica  so great was  the force of the enemy  that he plainly perceived that nothing remained  for him to achieve  with his handful of men  and therefore resolved to  use his utmost vigilance  and to act only on the defensive  on all sides  he sent out scouting parties to watch the motions of the spaniards  while  the main body were employed in working at the fortifications  making them  as strong as circumstances would admit  day and night he kept his indian  allies ranging through the woods  to harass the outposts of the enemy   who at length brought in five spanish prisoners  who informed him of  their number and force  and that the governor of augustine was commander  in chief of the expedition  the general  still expecting a reinforcement  from carolina  used all his address in planning measures for gaining  time  and preventing the garrison from sinking into despair  for this  purpose he sent out the highland company also to assist the indians  and  obstruct as much as possible the approach of the enemy till he should  obtain assistance and relief  his provisions for the garrison were  neither good nor plentiful  and his great distance from all settlements   together with the enemy keeping the command of the river  cut off  entirely all prospects of a supply  to prolong the defence  however  he  concealed every discouraging circumstance from his little army  which   besides indians  did not amount to more than seven hundred men  and to  animate them to perseverance  exposed himself to the same hardships and  fatigues with the meanest soldier in his garrison          sidenote  a stratagem to get rid of the enemy     while oglethorpe remained in this situation  the enemy made several  attempts to pierce through the woods  with a view to attack the fort  but  met with such opposition from deep morasses  and dark thickets  lined  with fierce indians  and wild highlanders  that they honestly confessed  that the devil himself could not pass through them to frederica  don  manuel de monteano  however  had no other prospect left  and these  difficulties must either be surmounted  or the design dropt  and  therefore one party after another was sent out to explore the thickets   and to take possession of every advantageous post to be found in them  in  two skirmishes with the highlanders and indians  the enemy had one  captain  and two lieutenants killed  with above one hundred men taken  prisoners  after which the spanish commander changed his plan of  operations  and keeping his men under cover of his cannon  proceeded with  some gallies up the river with the tide of flood  to reconnoitre the  fort  and draw the general s attention to another quarter  to this place  oglethorpe sent a party of indians  with orders to lie in ambuscade in  the woods  and endeavour to prevent their landing  about the same time an  english prisoner escaped from the spanish camp  and brought advice to  general oglethorpe of a difference subsisting in it  in so much that the  forces from cuba  and those from augustine encamped in separate places   upon which the general resolved to attempt a surprise on one of the  spanish camps  and taking the advantage of his knowledge of the woods   marched out in the night with three hundred chosen men  the highland  company  and some rangers  having advanced within two miles of the  enemy s camp  he halted  and went forward with a small party to take a  view of the posture of the enemy  but while he wanted above all things to  conceal his approach  a frenchman fired his musket  run off and alarmed  the enemy  upon which oglethorpe finding his design defeated  retreated  to frederica  and being apprehensive that the deserter would discover his  weakness  began to study by what device he might most effectually defeat  the credit of his informations  for this purpose he wrote a letter   addressing it to the deserter  in which he desired him to acquaint the  spaniards with the defenceless state of frederica  and how easy and  practicable it would be to cut him and his small garrison to pieces  he  begged him  as his spy  to bring them forward to the attack  and assure  them of success  but if he could not prevail with them to make that  attempt  to use all his art and influence to persuade them to stay at  least three days more at fort simons  for within that time  according to  the advice he had just received from carolina  he would have a  reinforcement of two thousand land forces  and six british ships of war   with which he doubted not he would be able to give a good account of the  spanish invaders  he intreated the deserter to urge them to stay  and  above all things cautioned him against mentioning a single word of vernon  coming against augustine  assuring him  that for such services he should  be amply rewarded by his britannic majesty  this letter he gave to one of  the spanish prisoners  who for the sake of liberty and a small reward   promised to deliver it to the french deserter  but  instead of that  as  oglethorpe expected  he delivered it to the commander and chief of the  spanish army          sidenote  the spaniards retreat to augustine     various were the speculations and conjectures which this letter  occasioned in the spanish camp  and the commander  among others  was not  a little perplexed what to infer from it  in the first place he ordered  the french deserter to be put in irons  to prevent his escape  and then  called a council of war  to consider what was most proper to be done in  consequence of intelligence  so puzzling and alarming  some officers were  of opinion  that the letter was intended to deceive  and to prevent them  from attacking frederica  others thought that the things mentioned in it  appeared so feasible  that there were good grounds to believe  the  english general wished them to take place  and therefore gave their voice  for consulting the safety of augustine  and dropping a plan of conquest  attended with so many difficulties  and which  in the issue  might  perhaps hazard the loss of both army and fleet  if not of the whole  province of florida  while the spanish leaders were employed in these  deliberations  and much embarrassed  fortunately three ships of force   which the governor of south carolina had sent out  appeared at some  distance on the coast  this corresponding with the letter  convinced the  spanish commander of its real intent  and struck such a panic into the  army  that they immediately set fire to their fort  and in great hurry  and confusion embarked  leaving behind them several cannon  and a  quantity of provisions and military stores  the wind being contrary  the  english ships could not  during that day  beat up to the mouth of the  river  and before next morning the invaders got past them  and escaped to  augustine     in this manner was the province of georgia delivered  when brought to the  very brink of destruction by a formidable enemy  fifteen days had don  manuel de monteano been on the small island on which frederica was  situated  without gaining the smallest advantage over an handful of men   and in different skirmishes lost some of his bravest troops  what number  of men oglethorpe lost we have not been able to learn  but it must have  been very inconsiderable  in this resolute defence of the country he  displayed both military skill and personal courage  and an equal degree  of praise was due to him from the carolineans as from the georgians  it  is not improbable that the spaniards had carolina chiefly in their eye   and had meditated an attack where rich plunder could have been obtained   and where  by an accession of slaves  they might have increased their  force in proportion to their progress  never did the carolineans make so  bad a figure in defence of their country  when union  activity and  dispatch were so requisite  they ingloriously stood at a distance  and  suffering private pique to prevail over public spirit  seemed determined  to risk the safety of their country  rather than general oglethorpe  by  their help  should gain the smallest degree of honour and reputation   money  indeed  they voted for the service  and at length sent some ships   but  by coming so late  they proved useful rather from the fortunate  co operation of an accidental cause  than from the zeal and public spirit  of the people  the georgians with justice blamed their more powerful  neighbours  who  by keeping at a distance in the day of danger  had  almost hazarded the loss of both provinces  had the enemy pursued their  operations with vigour and courage  the province of georgia must have  fallen a prey to the invaders  and carolina had every thing to dread in  consequence of the conquest  upon the return of the spanish troops to the  havanna  the commander was imprisoned  and ordered to take his trial for  his conduct during this expedition  the result of which proved so  shameful and ignominious to the spanish arms  though the enemy threatened  to renew the invasion  yet we do not find that after this repulse they  made any attempts by force of arms to gain possession of georgia          sidenote  ill treatment of general oglethorpe     the carolineans having had little or no share of the glory gained by this  brave defence  were also divided in their opinions with respect to the  conduct of general oglethorpe  while one party acknowledged his signal  services  and poured out the highest encomiums on his wisdom and courage   another shamefully censured his conduct  and meanly detracted from his  merit  none took any notice of his services  except the inhabitants in  and about port royal  who addressed him in the following manner   we the  inhabitants of the southern parts of carolina beg leave to congratulate  your excellency on your late wonderful success over your and our  inveterate enemies the spaniards  who so lately invaded georgia  in such  a numerous and formidable body  to the great terror of his majesty s  subjects in these southern parts  it was very certain  had the spaniards  succeeded in those attempts against your excellency  they would also have  entirely destroyed us  laid our province waste and desolate  and filled  our habitations with blood and slaughter  so that his majesty must have  lost the fine and spacious harbour of port royal  where the largest ships  of the british nation may remain in security on any occasion  we are very  sensible of the great protection and safety we have long enjoyed  by your  excellency being to the southwards of us  and keeping your armed sloops  cruising on the coast  which has secured our trade and fortunes more than  all the ships of war ever stationed at charlestown  but more by your late  resolution in frustrating the attempts of the spaniards  when nothing  could have saved us from utter ruin  next to the providence of almighty  god  but your excellency s singular conduct  and the bravery of the  troops under your command  we think it our duty to pray god to protect  your excellency  and send you success in all your undertakings for his  majesty s service  and we assure your excellency  that there is not a man  of us but would most willingly have ventured his all  in support of your  excellency and your gallant troops  had we been assisted  and put in a  condition to have been of service to you  and that we always looked upon  our interest to be so united to that of the colony of georgia  that had  your excellency been cut off  we must have fallen of course      but while the inhabitants in and about port royal were thus addressing  general oglethorpe  reports were circulating in charlestown to his  prejudice  insomuch that both his honour and honesty were called in  question  such malicious rumours had even reached london  and occasioned  some of his bills to return to america protested  lieutenant colonel  william cook  who owed his preferment to the general s particular  friendship and generosity  and who  on pretence of sickness  had left  georgia before this invasion  had filed no less than nineteen articles of  complaint against him  summoning several officers and soldiers from  georgia to prove the charge  as the general had  in fact  stretched his  credit  exhausted his strength  and risqued his life for the defence of  carolina in its frontier colony  such a recompence must have been equally  provoking  as it was unmerited  we are apt to believe  that such  injurious treatment could not have arisen from the wiser and better part  of the inhabitants  and therefore must be solely ascribed to some envious  and malicious spirits  who are to be found in all communities  envy  cannot bear the blaze of superior virtue  and malice rejoices in the  stains which even falsehood throws on a distinguished character  and such  is the extensive freedom of the british form of government that every  one  even the meanest  may step forth as an enemy to great abilities and  an unblemished reputation  the charges of envy and malice  oglethorpe  might have treated with contempt  but to vindicate himself against the  rude attacks of an inferior officer  he thought himself at this time  bound in honour to return to england          sidenote  his character cleared  and conduct vindicated     soon after his arrival a court martial of general officers was called   who sat two days at the horse guards  examining one by one the various  articles of complaint lodged against him  after the most mature  examination  the board adjudged the charge to be false  malicious  and  groundless  and reported the same to his majesty  in consequence of which  lieutenant colonel cook was dismissed from the service  and declared  incapable of serving his majesty in any military capacity whatever  by  this means the character of general oglethorpe was divested of those dark  stains with which it had been overclouded  and began to appear to the  world in its true and favourable light  carolina owed this benefactor her  friendship and love  georgia was indebted to him for both her existence  and protection  indeed his generous services for both colonies deserved  to be deeply imprinted on the memory of every inhabitant and the benefits  resulting from them to be remembered to the latest age with joy and  gratitude     after this period general oglethorpe never returned to the province of  georgia  but upon all occasions discovered in england an uncommon zeal  for its prosperity and improvement  from its first settlement the colony  had hitherto been under a military government  executed by the general  and such officers as he thought proper to nominate and appoint  but now  the trustees thought proper to establish a kind of civil government  and  committed the charge of it to a president and four assistants  who were  to act agreeable to the instructions they should receive from them  and  to be accountable to that corporation for their public conduct  william  stephens was made chief magistrate  and thomas jones  henry parker  john  fallowfield  and samuel mercer  were appointed assistants  they were  instructed to hold four general courts at savanna every year  for  regulating public affairs  and determining all differences relating to  private property  no public money could be disposed of but by a warrant  under the seal of the president and major part of the assistants in  council assembled  who were enjoined to send monthly accounts to england  of money expended  and of the particular services to which it was  applied  all officers of militia were continued  for the purpose of  holding musters  and keeping the men properly trained for military  services  and oglethorpe s regiment was left in the colony for its  defence     by this time the trustees had transported to georgia  at different times   above one thousand five hundred men  women and children  as the colony  was intended as a barrier to carolina  by their charter the trustees were  at first laid under several restraints with respect to the method of  granting lands  as well as the settlers with respect to the terms of  holding and disposing of them  now it was found expedient to relieve both  the former and latter from those foolish and impolitic restrictions   under the care of general oglethorpe the infant province had surmounted  many difficulties  yet still it promised a poor recompense to britain for  the vast sums of money expended for its protection  the indigent  emigrants  especially those from england  having little acquaintance with  husbandry  and less inclination to labour  made bad settlers  and as  greater privileges were allowed them on the carolina side of the river   they were easily decoyed away to that colony  the highlanders and germans  indeed  being more frugal and industrious  succeeded better  but hitherto  had made very small progress  owing partly to wars with the spaniards   and to severe hardships attending all kinds of culture in such an  unhealthy climate and woody country  the staple commodities intended to  be raised in georgia were silk and wine  which were indeed very  profitable articles  but so small was the improvement made in them  that  they had hitherto turned out to little account  the most industrious and  successful settlers could as yet scarcely provide for their families  and  the unfortunate  the sick  and indolent part  remained in a starved and  miserable condition          sidenote  the carolineans petition for three independent companies     soon after the departure of general oglethorpe  the carolineans  petitioned the king  praying that three independent companies  consisting  each of an hundred men  might be raised in the colonies  paid by great  britain  and stationed in carolina  to be entirely under the command of  the governor and council of that province  this petition was referred to  the lords of his majesty s privy council  and a time appointed for  considering  whether the present state of carolina was such as rendered  this additional charge to the nation proper and necessary  two reasons  were assigned by the colonists for the necessity of this military force   the first was  to preserve peace and security at home  the second  to  protect the colony against foreign invasions  they alledged  that as the  country was overstocked with negroes  such a military force was requisite  to overawe them  and prevent insurrections  and as the coast was so  extensive  and the ports lay exposed to every french and spanish  plunderer that might at any time invade the province  their security  against such attempts was of the highest consequence to the nation  but  though they afterwards obtained some independent companies  those  reasons  at this time  did not appear to the privy council of weight  sufficient to induce them to give their advice for this military  establishment  it was their opinion  that it belonged to the provincial  legislature to make proper laws for limiting the importation of negroes   and regulating and restraining them when imported  rather than put the  mother country to the expence of keeping a standing force in the province  to overawe them  that georgia  and the indians on the apalachian hills   were a barrier against foreign enemies on the western frontiers  that  fort johnson  and the fortifications in charlestown  were a sufficient  protection for that port  besides  that as the entrance over the bar was  so difficult to strangers  before a foreign enemy could land five hundred  men in that town  half the militia in the province might be collected for  its defence  georgetown and port royal indeed were exposed  but the  inhabitants being both few in number and poor  it could not be worth the  pains and risque of a single privateer to look into those harbours  for  which reasons it was judged  that carolina could be in little danger till  a foreign enemy had possession of georgia  and therefore it was agreed to  maintain oglethorpe s regiment in that settlement complete  and give  orders to the commandant to send detachments to the forts in james s  island  port royal  and such other places where their service might be  thought useful and necessary to the provincial safety and defence          sidenote  the colony s advantages from britain     many are the advantages carolina has derived from its political and  commercial connection with britain  its growing and flourishing state the  colony owes almost entirely to the mother country  without the protection  and indulgence of which  the people had little or no encouragement to be  industrious  britain first furnished a number of bold and enterprising  settlers  who carried with them the knowledge  arts  and improvements of  a civilized nation  this may be said to be the chief favour for which  carolina stands indebted to the parent state during the proprietary  government  but since the province has been taken under the royal care   it has been nursed and protected by a rich and powerful nation  its  government has been stable  private property secure  and the privileges  and liberties of the people have been extensive  lands the planters  obtained from the king at a cheap rate  to cultivate them the  mother country furnished them with labourers upon credit  each person had  entire liberty to manage his affairs for his own profit and advantage   and having no tythes  and very trifling taxes to pay  reaped almost the  whole fruits of his industry  the best and most extensive market was  allowed to the commodities he produced  and his staples increased in  value in proportion to the quantity raised  and the demand for them in  europe  all british manufactures he obtained at an easy rate  and  drawbacks were allowed on articles of foreign manufacture  that they  might be brought the cheaper to the american market  in consequence of  which frugal planters  every three or four years  doubled their capital   and their progress towards independence and opulence was rapid  indeed   the colonists had many reasons for gratitude  and none for fear  except  what arose from their immoderate haste to be rich  and from purchasing  such numbers of slaves  as exposed them to danger and destruction     the plan of settling townships  especially as it came accompanied with  the royal bounty  had proved beneficial in many respects  it encouraged  multitudes of poor oppressed people in ireland  holland and germany to  emigrate  by which means the province received a number of frugal and  industrious settlers  as many of them came from manufacturing towns in  europe  it might have been expected that they would naturally have  pursued those occupations to which they had been bred  and in which their  chief skill consisted  but this was by no means the case  for  excepting  a few of them that took up their residence in charlestown  they procured  lands  applied to pasturage and agriculture  and by raising hemp  wheat  and maize in the interior parts of the country  and curing hams  bacon   and beef  they supplied the market with abundance of provision  while at  the same time they found that they had taken the shortest way of arriving  at easy and independent circumstances          sidenote  its advantage and importance to britain     indeed while such vast territories in carolina remained unoccupied  it  was neither for the interest of the province  nor that of the  mother country  to employ any hands in manufactures  so long as labour  bestowed on lands was most profitable  no prudent colonist would direct  his attention or strength to any other employment  especially as the  mother country could supply him with all kinds of manufactures at a much  cheaper rate than he could make them  the surplus part of british  commodities and manufactures for which there was no vent in britain   found in carolina a good market  and in return brought the english  merchant such articles as were in demand at home  by which means the  advantages were mutual and reciprocal  the exclusive privilege of  supplying this market encouraged labour in england  and augmented the  annual income of the nation  from the monopoly of this trade with  america  which was always increasing  britain derived many substantial  advantages  these colonies consumed all her superfluities which lay upon  hand  and enlarged her commerce  which  without such a market  must have  been confined to its ancient narrow channel  in the year       two  hundred and thirty vessels were loaded at the port of charlestown  so  that the national value of the province was not only considerable in  respect of the large quantity of goods it consumed  but also in respect  to the naval strength it promoted  fifteen hundred seamen at least found  employment in the trade of this province  and  besides other advantages   the profits of freight must make a considerable addition to the account  in favour of britain     nor is there the smallest reason to expect that manufactures will be  encouraged in carolina  while landed property can be obtained on such  easy terms  the cooper  the carpenter  the brick layer  the shipbuilder   and every other artificer and tradesman  after having laboured for a few  years at their respective employments  and purchased a few negroes   commonly retreat to the country  and settle tracts of uncultivated land   while they labour at their trades  they find themselves dependent on  their employers  this is one reason for their wishing at least to be  their own masters  and though the wages allowed them are high  yet the  means of subsistence in towns are also dear  and therefore they long to  be in the same situation with their neighbours  who derive an easy  subsistence from a plantation  which they cultivate at pleasure  and are  answerable to no master for their conduct  even the merchant becomes  weary of attending the store  and risking his flock on the stormy seas   or in the hands of men where it is often exposed to equal hazards  and  therefore collects it as soon as possible  and settles a plantation  upon  this plantation he sets himself down  and being both landlord and farmer   immediately finds himself an independent man  having his capital in lands  and negroes around him  and his affairs collected within a narrow circle   he can manage and improve them as he thinks fit  he soon obtains plenty  of the necessaries of life from his plantation  nor need he want any of  its conveniencies and luxuries  the greatest difficulties he has to  surmount arise from the marshy soil  and unhealthy climate  which often  cut men off in the midst of their days  indeed in this respect carolina  is the reverse of most countries in europe  where the rural life  when  compared with that of the town  is commonly healthy and delightful           chap  ix            sidenote  all commotions and oppressions in europe favourable to      america     the war between england and france still raged in europe  and being  carried on under many disadvantages on the side of the allied army  was  almost as unsuccessful as their enemies could have desired  the battle of  fontenoy was obstinate and bloody  and many thousands were left on the  field on the side of the vanquished  the victorious army had little  reason for boasting  having likewise bought their victory very dear   though bad success attended the british arms on the continent at this  time  yet that evil being considered as remote  the people seemed only to  feel it as affecting the honour of the nation  which by some fortunate  change might retrieve the glory of its arms  but a plot of a more  interesting nature was discovered  which added greatly to the national  perplexity and distress  a civil war broke out within the bowels of the  kingdom  the object of which was nothing less than the recovery of the  british crown from the house of brunswick  charles edward stuart  the  young pretender  stimulated by the fire of youth  encouraged by the  deceitful promises of france  and invited by a discontented party of the  scotch nation  had landed in north britain to head the rash enterprise   multitudes of bold and deluded highlanders  and several lowlanders  who  owed their misfortunes to their firm adherence to that family  joined his  army  he became formidable both by the numbers that followed him  and the  success that at first attended his arms  but at length  after having  struck a terror into the nation  he was routed at culloden field  and his  party were either dispersed  or made prisoners of war     what to make of the prisoners of war became a matter of public  deliberation  to punish all  without distinction  would have been  unjustifiable cruelty in any government  especially where so many were  young  ignorant  and misled  to pardon all  on the other hand  would  discover unreasonable weakness  and dangerous lenity  the prisoners had  nothing to plead but the clemency of the king  and the tenderness of the  british constitution  examples of justice were necessary to deter men  from the like attempts  but it was agreed to temper justice with mercy   in order to convince the nation of the gentleness of that constitution   which made not only a distinction between the innocent and guilty  but  even among the guilty themselves  between those who were more  and those  who were less criminal  the king ordered a general pardon to pass the  great seal  in which he extended mercy to the ignorant  and misled among  the rebels  which pardon comprehended nineteen out of twenty  who drew  lots for this purpose  were exempted from trial  and transported to the  british plantations  among other settlements in america  the southern  provinces had a share of these bold and hardy caledonians  who afterwards  proved excellent and industrious settlers     as every family of labourers is an acquisition to a growing colony  such  as carolina  where lands are plenty  and hands only wanted to improve  them  to encourage emigration  a door was opened there to protestants of  every nation  the poor and distressed subjects of the british dominions   and those of germany and holland  were easily induced to leave  oppression  and transport themselves and families to that province  lands  free of quit rents  for the first ten years  were allotted to men  women   and children  utensils for cultivation  and hogs and cows to begin their  stock  they purchased with their bounty money  the like bounty was  allowed to all servants after the expiration of the term of their  servitude  from this period carolina was found to be an excellent refuge  to the poor  the unfortunate  and oppressed  the population and  prosperity of her colonies engrossed the attention of the mother country   his majesty s bounty served to alleviate the hardships inseparable from  the first years of cultivation  and landed property animated the poor  emigrants to industry and perseverance  the different townships yearly  increased in numbers  every one upon his arrival obtained his grant of  land  and sat down on his freehold with no taxes  or very trifling ones   no tythes  no poor rates  with full liberty of hunting and fishing  and  many other advantages and privileges he never knew in europe  it is true  the unhealthiness of the climate was a great bar to his progress  and  proved fatal to many of these first settlers  but to such as surmounted  this obstacle  every year brought new profits  and opened more  advantageous prospects  all who escaped the dangers of the climate  if  they could not be called rich during their own life  by improving their  little freeholds  they commonly left their children in easy or opulent  circumstances  even in the first age being free  contented  and  accountable to man for their labour and management  their condition in  many respects was preferable to that of the poorest class of labourers in  europe  in all improved countries  where commerce and manufactures have  been long established  and luxury prevails  the poorest ranks of citizens  are always oppressed and miserable  indeed this must necessarily be the  case  otherwise trade and manufactures  which flourish principally by the  low price of labour and provisions  must decay  in carolina  though  exposed to more troubles and hardships for a few years  such industrious  people had better opportunities than in europe for advancing to an easy  and independent state  hence it happened that few emigrants ever returned  to their native country  on the contrary  the success and prosperity of  the most fortunate  brought many adventurers and relations after them   their love to their former friends  and their natural partiality for  their countrymen  induced the old planters to receive the new settlers  joyfully  and even to assist and relieve them  having each his own  property and possession  this independence produced mutual respect and  beneficence  and such general harmony and industry reigned among them   that those townships  formerly a desolate wilderness  now stocked with  diligent labourers  promised soon to become fruitful fields          sidenote  cultivation attended with salutary effects     it has been observed  that in proportion as the lands have been cleared  and improved  and scope given for a more free circulation of air  the  climate has likewise become more salubrious and pleasant  this change was  more remarkable in the heart of the country than in the maritime parts   where the best plantations of rice are  and where water is carefully  preserved to overflow the fields  yet even in those places cultivation  has been attended with salutary effects  time and experience had now  taught the planters  that  during the autumnal months  their living among  the low rice plantations subjected them to many disorders  from which the  inhabitants of the capital were entirely exempted  this induced the  richer part to retreat to town during this unhealthy season  those who  were less able to bear the expences of this retreat  and had learned to  guard against the inconveniencies of the climate  sometimes escaped  but  laborious strangers suffered much during these autumnal months   accustomed as they were in europe to toil through the heat of the day   and expose themselves in all weathers  they followed the same practices  in carolina  where the climate would by no means admit of such liberties   apprehensive of no ill consequences from such exposure  they began their  improvement with vigour and resolution  and persevered until the hot  climate and heavy toil exhausted their spirits  and brought home to them  the unwelcome intimations of danger          sidenote  mean heat in carolina     in the months of july  august  and september  the heat in the shaded air   from noon to three o clock  is often between ninety and an hundred  degrees  and as such extreme heat is of short duration  being commonly  productive of thunder showers  it becomes on that account the more  dangerous  i have seen the mercury in fahrenheit s thermometer arise in  the shade to ninety six in the hottest  and fall to sixteen in the  coolest season of the year  others have observed it as high as an  hundred  and as low as ten  which range between the extreme heat of  summer and cold in winter is prodigious  and must have a great effect  upon the constitution of all  even of those who are best guarded against  the climate  what then must be the situation of such as are exposed to  the open air and burning sky in all seasons  the mean diurnal heat of the  different seasons has been  upon the most careful observation  fixed at  sixty four in spring  seventy nine in summer  seventy two in autumn  and  fifty two in winter  and the mean nocturnal heat in those seasons at  fifty six degrees in spring  seventy five in summer  sixty eight in  autumn  and forty six in winter          sidenote  the diseases of the country     as this climate differs so much from that of britain  ireland  and  germany  and every where has great influence on the human constitution   no wonder that many of these settlers should sicken and die by the  change  during the first state of colonization  in the hot season the  human body is relaxed by perpetual perspiration  and becomes feeble and  sickly  especially during the dog days  when the air is one while  suffocating and sultry  and another moist and foggy  exhausted of fluids   it is perhaps not at all  or very improperly  supplied  hence  intermittent  nervous  putrid and bilious fevers  are common in the  country  and prove fatal to many of its inhabitants  young children are  very subject to the worm fever  which cuts off multitudes of them  the  dry belly ache  which is a dreadful disorder  is no stranger to the  climate  an irruption  commonly called the prickly heat  often breaks out  during the summer  which is attended with troublesome itching and  stinging pains  but this disease being common  and not dangerous  is  little regarded  and if proper caution be used to prevent it from  striking suddenly inward  is thought to be attended even with salutary  effects  in the spring and winter pleurisies and peripneumonies are  common  often obstinate  and frequently fatal diseases  so changeable is  the weather  that the spirits in the thermometer will often rise or fall  twenty  twenty five  and thirty degrees  in the space of twenty four  hours  which must make havock of the human constitution  in autumn there  is sometimes a difference of twenty degrees between the heat of the day  and that of the night  and in winter a greater difference between the  heat of the morning and that of noon day  we leave it to physicians more  particularly to describe the various disorders incident to this climate   together with the causes of them  but if violent heat and continual  perspiration in summer  noxious vapours and sudden changes in autumn   piercing cold nights  and hot noon days in winter  affect the human  constitution  the inhabitants of carolina  especially in the maritime  parts  have all these and many more changes and hardships during the year  to undergo  not only man  but every animal  is strongly affected by the  sultry heat of summer  horses and cows retire to the shade  and there   though harassed with insects  they stand and profusely sweat through the  violence of the day  hogs and dogs are also much distressed with it   poultry and wild fowls droop their wings  hang out their tongues  and   with open throats  pant for breath  the planter who consults his health  is not only cautious in his dress and diet  but rises early for the  business of the field  and transacts it before ten o clock  and then  retreats to the house or shade during the melting heat of the day  until  the coolness of the evening again invites him to the field  such is his  feebleness of body and languor of spirit at noon  that the greatest  pleasure of life consists in being entirely at rest  even during the  night he is often restless and depressed  insomuch that refreshing sleep  is kept a stranger to his eyes  if unfortunately the poor labourer is  taken sick in such weather  perhaps far removed from  or unable to  employ  a physician  how great must be his hazard  in towns this heat is  still rendered more intolerable by the glowing reflection from houses   and the burning sand in the streets  but how it is possible for cooks   blacksmiths  and other tradesmen  to work at the side of a fire  as many  in the province do during such a season  we must leave to the world to  judge          sidenote  climate favourable to the culture of indigo     this hot weather  however  has been found favourable to the culture of  indigo  which at this time was introduced into carolina  and has since  proved one of its chief articles of commerce  about the year      a  fortunate discovery was made  that this plant grew spontaneously in the  province  and was found almost every where among the wild weeds of the  forest  as the soil naturally yielded a weed which furnished the world  with so useful and valuable a dye  it loudly called for cultivation and  improvement  for this purpose some indigo seed was imported from the  french west indies  where it had been cultivated with great success  and  yielded the planters immense profit  at first the seed was planted by way  of experiment  and it was found to answer the most sanguine expectations   in consequence of which several planters turned their attention to the  culture of indigo and studied the art of extracting the dye from it   every trial brought them fresh encouragement  in the year      a  considerable quantity of it was sent to england  which induced the  merchants trading to carolina to petition parliament for a bounty on  carolina indigo  the parliament  upon examination  found that it was one  of the most beneficial articles of french commerce  that their west india  islands supplied all the markets of europe  and that britain alone  consumed annually six hundred thousand weight of french indigo  which  at  five shillings a pound  cost the nation the prodigious sum of one hundred  and fifty thousand pounds sterling  it was demonstrated by the merchants   that this vast expence might be saved  by encouraging the cultivation of  indigo in carolina  and commonly believed that in time the colony might  bring it to such perfection  as to rival the french at the markets of  europe  this petition of the merchants was soon followed by another from  the planters and inhabitants of carolina  and others to the same effect  from the clothiers  dyers  and traders of different towns in britain  it  was proved  that the demand for indigo annually increased  and it could  never he expected that the planters in the west indies would turn their  hands to it  while the culture of sugar canes proved more profitable   accordingly  an act of parliament passed  about the beginning of the year        for allowing a bounty of sixpence  per  pound on all indigo raised  in the british american plantations  and imported directly into britain  from the place of its growth  in consequence of which act the planters  applied themselves with double vigour and spirit to that article  and  seemed to vie with each other who should bring the best kind and greatest  quantity of it to the market  some years indeed elapsed before they  learned the nice art of making it as well as the french  whom long  practice and experience had taught it to perfection  but every year they  acquired greater skill and knowledge in preparing it  and received  incredible profit as the reward of their labours  while many of them  doubled their capital every three or four years by planting indigo  they  in process of time brought it to such a degree of perfection  as not only  to supply the mother country  but also to undersel the french at several  european markets          sidenote  the manner of cultivating and making indigo     here it may not be improper to give the reader some account of the manner  in which the people of carolina cultivate this plant  and extract the dye  from it  as we pretend to little knowledge of this matter ourselves  we  shall give the following rules and directions of an ingenious person  who  practised them for several years with great success   as both the  quantity and quality of indigo greatly depend on the cultivation of the  plant  it is proper to observe  that it seems to thrive best in a rich   light soil  unmixed with clay or sand  the ground to be planted should be  plowed  or turned up with hoes  some time in december  that the frost may  render it rich and mellow  it must also be well harrowed  and cleansed  from all grass  roots  and stumps of trees  to facilitate the hoeing  after the weed appears above ground  the next thing to be considered is  the choice of the seed  in which the planters should be very nice  there  is great variety of it  and from every sort good indigo may be made  but  none answers so well in this colony as the true guatimala  which if good  is a small oblong black seed  very bright and full  and when rubbed in  the hand will appear as if finely polished      in carolina we generally begin to plant about the beginning of april  in  the following manner  the ground being well prepared  furrows are made  with a drill plow  or hoe  two inches deep  and eighteen inches distant  from each other  to receive the seed  which is sown regularly  and not  very thick  after which it is lightly covered with earth  a bushel of  seed will sow four english acres  if the weather proves warm and serene   the plant will appear above ground in ten or four teen days  after the  plant appears  the ground  though not grassy  should be hoed to loosen  the earth about it  which otherwise would much hinder its growth  in good  seasons it grows very fast  and must all the while be kept perfectly  clean of weeds  whenever the plant is in full bloom it must be cut down   without paying any regard to its height  as its leaves are then thick and  full of juice  and this commonly happens in about four months after  planting  but  previous to the season for cutting  a complete set of vats  of the following dimensions  for every twenty acres of weed  must be  provided  and kept in good order  the steeper or vat in which the weed is  first put to ferment  must be sixteen feet square in the clear  and two  and a half feet deep  the second vat or battery twelve feet long  ten  feet wide  and four and a half feet deep from the top of the plate  these  vats should be made of the best cypress or yellow pine plank  two and a  half inches thick  well fastened to the joints and studs with seven inch  spikes  and then caulked  to prevent their leaking  vats thus made will  last in carolina  notwithstanding the excessive heat  at least seven  years  when every thing is ready  the weed must be cut and laid regularly  in the steeper with the stalk upward  which will hasten the fermentation   then long rails must be laid the length of the vat  at eighteen inches  distance from one another  and wedged down to the weed  to prevent its  buoying up when the water is pumped into the steeper  for this purpose  the softest water answers best  and the quantity of it necessary must be  just sufficient to cover all the weed  in this situation it is left to  ferment  which will begin sooner or later in proportion to the heat of  the weather  and the ripeness of the plant  but for the most part takes  twelve or fifteen hours  after the water is loaded with the salts and  substance of the weed  it must be let out of the steeper into the  battery  there to be beat  in order to perform which operation  many  different machines have been invented  but for this purpose any  instrument that will agitate the water with great violence may be used   when the water has been violently agitated for fifteen or twenty minutes  in the battery  by taking a little of the liquor up in a plate it will  appear full of small grain or curdled  then you are to let in a quantity  of lime water kept in a vat for the purpose  to augment and precipitate  the faeculae  still continuing to stir and beat vehemently the indigo  water  till it becomes of a strong purple colour  and the grain hardly  perceptible  then it must be left to settle  which it will do in eight or  ten hours  after which the water must be gently drawn out of the battery  through plug holes contrived for that purpose  so that the faeculae may  remain at the bottom of the vat  it must then be taken up  and carefully  strained through a horse hair sieve  to render the indigo perfectly  clean  and put into bags made of osnaburghs  eighteen inches long  and  twelve wide  and suspended for six hours  to drain the water out of it   after which the mouths of these bags being well fastened  it must be put  into a press to be entirely freed from any remains of water  which would  otherwise greatly hurt the quality of the indigo  the press commonly used  for this purpose is a box of five feet in length  two and a half wide   and two deep  with holes at one end to let out the water  in this box the  bags must be laid  one upon another  until it is full  upon which a plank  must be laid  fitted to go within the box  and upon all a sufficient  number of weights to squeeze out the water entirely by a constant and  gradual pressure  so that the indigo may become a fine stiff paste  which  is then taken out and cut into small pieces  each about two inches  square  and laid out to dry  a house made of logs must be prepared on  purpose for drying it  and so constructed that it may receive all the  advantages of an open and free air  without being exposed to the sun   which is very pernicious to the dye  for here indigo placed in the sun   in a few hours will be burnt up to a perfect cinder  while the indigo  remains in the drying house  it must be carefully turned three or four  times in a day  to prevent its rotting  flies should likewise be  carefully kept from it  which at this season of the year are hatched in  millions  and infest an indigo plantation like a plague  after all  great  care must also be taken  that the indigo be sufficiently dry before it is  packed  lest after it is headed up in barrels it should sweat  which will  certainly spoil and rot it      in this manner indigo is cultivated and prepared in carolina  and the  richest land in the heart of the country is found to answer best for it   the maritime islands  however  which are commonly sandy  are not  unfavourable for this production  especially those that contain spots of  land covered with oak  and hickory trees  it is one of those rank weeds  which in a few years will exhaust the strength and fertility of the best  lands in the world  it is commonly cut in the west indies six and seven  times in the year  but in carolina no more than two or three times before  the frost begins  our planters have been blamed by the english merchants  for paying too much attention to the quantity  and too little to the  quality of their indigo  hence the west india indigo brings an higher  price at the market  he that prefers the quality to the quantity  is very  careful to cut the plant at the proper season  that is  when the weed  begins to bloom  for the more luxuriant and tender the plant  the more  beautiful the indigo  while it is curing  indigo has an offensive and  disagreeable smell  and as the dregs of the weed are full of salts  and  make excellent manure  therefore they should be immediately buried under  ground when brought out of the steeper  it is commonly observed  that all  creatures about an indigo plantation are starved  whereas  about a rice  one  which abounds with provisions for man and beast  they thrive and  flourish  the season for making indigo in carolina ends with the first  frosty weather  which puts a stop to fermentation  and then double labour  is not only requisite for beating it  but when prepared it is commonly  good for nothing          sidenote  the common methods of judging of its quality     the planters bring their indigo to market about the end of the year  and  frequently earlier  the merchant judges of its quality by breaking it   and observing the closeness of its grain  and its brilliant copper  or  violet blue colour  the weight in some measure proves its quality  for  heavy indigo of every colour is always bad  good indigo almost entirely  consumes away in the fire  the bad leaves a quantity of ashes  in water  also pure and fine indigo entirely melts and dissolves  but the  heterogeneous and solid parts of the bad sink to the bottom like sand   from this period it became a staple to carolina  and proved equally  profitable as the mines of mexico or peru  to the mother country it was  no less beneficial  in excluding the french indigo entirely from her  market  and promoting her manufactures  and trade  i shall afterwards  take notice of the rapid progress made in the cultivation of this  article  particularly with respect to the quantity produced and yearly  shipped to britain  to supply the markets in europe          sidenote  nova scotia settled     the great bounty and indulgence of britain towards her american colonies  increased with their progress in cultivation  and favour after favour was  extended to them  filled with the prospect of opening an excellent market  for her manufactures  and enlarging her commerce and navigation  in which  her strength in a great measure consisted  these colonies were become the  chief objects of her care  and new ones were planted for the protection  of the old  at this time the peace of aix la chapelle left a number of  brave sailors and soldiers without employment  good policy required that  they should be rendered useful to the nation  and at the same time  furnished with employment for their own subsistence  acadia  which was  ceded to britain by the treaty of peace  changed its name to nova scotia   and was capable of producing every species of naval stores  the sea there  abounded with excellent fish  which might furnish employment for a number  of sailors  and be made an useful and advantageous branch of trade  but  the excellent natural harbours which the country afforded  of all other  things proved the greatest inducement for establishing a colony in it   the possession of which would not only promote trade in the time of  peace  but also prove a safe station for british fleets in time of war   besides  for the sake of commercial advantage  it was judged proper to  confine the settlements in america as much as possible to the sea coast   the parliament therefore determined to send out a colony to nova scotia   and  to forward the settlement  voted forty thousand pounds  the  following advantageous terms were held forth to the people by government   and a number of adventurers agreed to accept them  fifty acres of land  were to be allowed to every soldier and sailor  two hundred to every  ensign  three hundred to every lieutenant  four hundred and sixty to  every captain  and six hundred to all officers of higher rank  together  with thirty for every servant they should carry along with them  no  quit rents were to be demanded for the first ten years  they were also to  be furnished with instruments for fishing and agriculture  to have their  passage free  and provisions found them for the first year after their  arrival  three thousand seven hundred and sixty adventurers embarked for  america on these favourable terms  and settled at halifax  which place  was fixed on as the seat of government  and fortified  the acadians  the  former inhabitants of the country  were allowed peaceably to remain in  it  and having sworn never to bear arms against their countrymen   submitted to the english government  and passed under the denomination of  french neutrals  the greatest difficulty which the new settlers of nova  scotia had to surmount at this time arose from the micmac indians  who  held that territory from nature  and for some time obstinately defended  their right to their ancient possessions  and it was not without  considerable loss that the british subjects at length  by force of arms   drove them away from those territories          sidenote  the great care of britain for these colonies     nor did this new settlement engross the whole attention and liberality of  the parent state  the province of georgia also every year shared  plentifully from the same hands  indeed the bounty of the mother country  was extensive as her dominions  and  like the sun  cherished and  invigorated every object on which it shone  all the colonies might have  been sensible of her constant attention to their safety and prosperity   and had great reason to acknowledge themselves under the strongest  obligations to her goodness  if she expected a future recompense by the  channel of commerce  which is for the most part mutually advantageous  it  was no more than she had justly merited  the colonists  we allow  carried  with them the rights and liberties of the subjects of britain  and they  owed in return the duties of obedience to her laws and subjection to her  government  the privileges and duties of subjects in all states have been  reciprocal  and as the mother country had incurred great expence for the  establishment and support of these foreign settlements  as she had  multiplied her burdens for their defence and improvement  surely such  protection and kindness laid a foundation for the firmest union  and the  most dutiful returns of allegiance and gratitude          sidenote  low state of georgia     however  the province of georgia  notwithstanding all that britain had  done for its population and improvement  still remained in a poor and  languishing condition  its settlers consisted of two sorts of people   first  of indigent subjects and foreigners  whom the trustees transported  and maintained  secondly  of men of some substance  whom flattering  descriptions of the province had induced voluntarily to emigrate to it   after the peace oglethorpe s regiment being disbanded  a number of  soldiers accepted the encouragement offered them by government  and took  up their residence in georgia  all those adventurers who had brought some  substance along with them  having by this time exhausted their small  stock in fruitless experiments  were reduced to indigence  so that  emigrants from britain  foreigners  and soldiers  were all on a level in  point of poverty  from the impolitic restrictions of the trustees  these  settlers had no prospects during life but those of hardship and poverty   and of consequence  at their decease  of bequeathing a number of orphans  to the care of providence  nor was the trade of the province in a better  situation than its agriculture  the want of credit was an unsurmountable  obstacle to its progress in every respect  formerly the inhabitants in  and about savanna had transmitted to the trustees a representation of  their grievous circumstances  and obtained from them some partial relief   but now  chagrined with disappointments  and dispirited by the severities  of the climate  they could view the design of the trustees in no other  light than that of having decoyed them into misery  even though they had  been favoured with credit  and had proved successful  which was far from  being their case  as the tenure of their freehold was restricted to heirs  male  their eldest son could only reap the benefit of their toil  and the  rest must depend on his bounty  or be left wholly to the charge of that  being who feeds the fowls of the air  they considered their younger  children and daughters as equally entitled to paternal regard  and could  not brook their holding lands under such a tenure  as excluded them from  the rights and privileges of other colonists  they saw numbers daily  leaving the province through mere necessity  and frankly told the  trustees  that nothing could prevent it from being totally deserted  but  the same encouragements with their more fortunate neighbours in carolina      sidenote  complaint of the people      that the trustees might have a just view of their condition  the  georgians stated before them their grievances  and renewed their  application for redress  they judged that the british constitution   zealous for the rights and liberties of mankind  could not permit  subjects who had voluntarily risked their lives  and spent their  substance on the public faith  to effect a settlement in the most  dangerous frontiers of the british empire  to be deprived of the common  privileges of all colonists  they complained that the land holders in  georgia were prohibited from selling or leasing their possessions  that a  tract containing fifty acres of the best lands was too small an allowance  for the maintenance of a family  and much more so when they were refused  the freedom to chuse it  that a much higher quit rent was exacted from  them than was paid for the best lands in america  that the importation of  negroes was prohibited  and white people were utterly unequal to the  labours requisite  that the public money granted yearly by parliament   for the relief of settlers and the improvement of the province  was  misapplied  and therefore the wise purposes for which it was granted were  by no means answered  that these inconveniencies and hardships kept them  in a state of poverty and misery  and that the chief cause of all their  calamities was the strict adherence of the trustees to their chimerical  and impracticable scheme of settlement  by which the people were refused  the obvious means of subsistence  and cut off from all prospects of  success     we have already observed  that the laws and regulations even of the  wisest men  founded on principles of speculation  have often proved to be  foreign and impracticable  the trustees had an example of this in the  fundamental constitutions of john locke  instead of prescribing narrower  limits to the industry and ambition of the georgians  they ought to have  learned wisdom from the case of the proprietors of carolina  and enlarged  their plan with respect to both liberty and property  by such indulgence  alone they could encourage emigrations  and animate the inhabitants to  diligence and perseverance  the lands in georgia  especially such as were  first occupied  were sandy and barren  the hardships of clearing and  cultivating them were great  the climate was unfavourable for labourers   and dangerous to european constitutions  the greater the difficulties  were with which the settlers had to struggle  the more encouragement was  requisite to surmount them  the plan of settlement ought to have arisen  from the nature of the climate  country  and soil  and the circumstances  of the settlers  and been the result of experience and not of  speculation     hitherto georgia had not only made small improvement in agriculture and  trade  but her government was feeble and contemptible  at this time  by  the avarice and ambition of a single family  the whole colony was brought  to the very brink of destruction  as the concerns of these settlements  are closely connected and interwoven with the affairs of indian nations   it is impossible to attain proper views of the circumstances and  situation of the people  without frequently taking notice of the relation  in which they stood to their savage neighbours  a considerable branch of  provincial commerce  as well as the safety of the colonists  depended on  their friendship with indians  and  to avoid all danger from their savage  temper  no small share of prudence and courage was often requisite  this  will appear more obvious from the following occurrence  which  because it  is somewhat remarkable  we shall the more circumstantially relate          sidenote  troubles excited by thomas bosomworth     i have already observed  that during the time general oglethorpe had the  direction of public affairs in georgia  he had  from maxims of policy   treated an indian woman  called mary  with particular kindness and  generosity  finding that she had great influence among the creeks  and  understood their language  he made use of her as an interpreter  in order  the more easily to form treaties of alliance with them  allowing her for  her services an hundred pounds sterling a year  this woman thomas  bosomworth  who was chaplain to oglethorpe s regiment  had married  and  among the rest had accepted a track of land from the crown  and settled  in the province  finding that his wife laid claim to some islands on the  sea coast  which  by treaty  had been allotted the indians as part of  their hunting lands  to stock them he had purchased cattle from the  planters of carolina  from whom he obtained credit to a considerable  amount  however  this plan not proving so successful as the proud and  ambitious clergyman expected  he took to audacious methods of supporting  his credit  and acquiring a fortune  his wife pretended to be descended  in a maternal line from an indian king  who held from nature the  territories of the creeks  and bosomworth now persuaded her to assert her  right to them  as superior not only to that of the trustees  but also to  that of the king  accordingly mary immediately assumed the title of an  independent empress  disavowing all subjection or allegiance to the king  of great britain  otherwise than by way of treaty and alliance  such as  one independent sovereign might make with another  a meeting of all the  creeks was summoned  to whom mary made a speech  setting forth the  justice of her claim  and the great injury done to her and them by taking  possession of their ancient territories  and stirring them up to defend  their property by force of arms  the indians immediately took fire  and  to a man declared they would stand by her to the last drop of their blood  in defence of their lands  in consequence of which mary  with a large  body of savages at her back  set out for savanna  to demand a formal  surrender of them from the president of the province  a messenger was  despatched before hand  to acquaint him that mary had assumed her right  of sovereignty over the whole territories of the upper and lower creeks   and to demand that all lands belonging to them be instantly relinquished   for as she was the hereditary and rightful queen of both nations  and  could command every man of them to follow her  in case of refusal  she  had determined to extirpate the settlement     the president and council  alarmed at her high pretensions and bold  threats  and sensible of her great power and influence with the savages   were not a little embarrassed what steps to take for the public safety   they determined to use soft and healing measures until an opportunity  might offer of privately laying hold of her  and shipping her off to  england  but  in the mean time  orders were sent to all the captains of  the militia  to hold themselves in readiness to march to savanna at an  hour s warning  the town was put in the best posture of defence  but the  whole militia in it amounted to no more than one hundred and seventy men   able to bear arms  a messenger was sent to mary at the head of the  creeks  while several miles distant from town  to know whether she was  serious in such wild pretensions  and to try to persuade her to dismiss  her followers  and drop her audacious design  but finding her inflexible  and resolute  the president resolved to put on a bold countenance  and  receive the savages with firmness and resolution  the militia was ordered  under arms  to overawe them as much as possible  and as the indians  entered the town  captain jones  at the head of his company of horse   stopped them  and demanded whether they came with hostile or friendly  intentions  but receiving no satisfactory answer  he told them they must  there ground their arms  for he had orders not to suffer a man of them  armed to set his foot within the town  the savages with great reluctance  submitted  and accordingly thomas bosomworth  in his canonical robes   with his queen by his side  followed by the various chiefs according to  their rank  marched into town  making a formidable appearance  all the  inhabitants were struck with terror at the sight of the fierce and mighty  host  when they advanced to the parade  they found the militia drawn up  under arms to receive them  who saluted them with fifteen cannon  and  conducted them to the president s house  there thomas and adam bosomworth  being ordered to withdraw  the indian chiefs  in a friendly manner  were  called upon to declare their intention of visiting the town in so large a  body  without being sent for by any person in lawful authority  the  warriors  as they had been previously instructed  answered  that mary was  to speak for them  and that they would abide by her words  they had  heard  they said  that she was to be sent like a captive over the great  waters  and they were come to know on what account they were to lose  their queen  they assured the president they intended no harm  and begged  their arms might be restored  and  after consulting with bosomworth and  his wife  they would return and settle all public affairs  to please them  their muskets were accordingly given back  but strict orders were issued  to allow them no ammunition  until the council should see more clearly  into their dark designs     on the day following  the indians having had some private conferences  with their queen  began to be very surly  and to run in a mad and  tumultuous manner up and down the streets  seemingly bent on some  mischief  all the men being obliged to mount guard  the women were  terrified to remain by themselves in their houses  expecting every moment  to be murdered or scalped  during this confusion  a false rumour was  spread  that they had cut off the president s head with a tomahawk  which  so exasperated the inhabitants  that it was with difficulty the officers  could prevent them from firing on the savages  to save a town from  destruction  never was greater prudence requisite  orders were given to  the militia to lay hold of bosomworth  and carry him out of the way into  close confinement  upon which mary became outrageous and frantic  and  insolently threatened vengeance against the magistrates and whole colony   she ordered every man of them to depart from her territories  and at  their peril to refuse  she cursed general oglethorpe and his fraudulent  treaties  and  furiously stamping with her feet upon the ground  swore by  her maker that the whole earth on which she trode was her own  to prevent  bribery  which she knew to have great weight with her warriors  she kept  the leading men constantly in her eye  and would not suffer them to speak  a word respecting public affairs but in her presence     the president finding that no peaceable agreement could be made with the  indians while under the baleful eye and influence of their pretended  queen privately laid hold of her  and put her under confinement with her  husband  this step was necessary  before any terms of negotiation could  be proposed  having secured the chief promoters of the conspiracy  he  then employed men acquainted with the indian tongue to entertain the  warriors in the most friendly and hospitable manner  and explain to them  the wicked designs of bosomworth and his wife  accordingly a feast was  prepared for all the chief leaders  at which they were informed  that mr   bosomworth had involved himself in debt  and wanted not only their lands   but also a large share of the royal bounty  to satisfy his creditors in  carolina  that the king s presents were only intended for indians  on  account of their useful services and firm attachment to him during the  former wars  that the lands adjoining the town were reserved for them to  encamp upon  when they should come to visit their beloved friends at  savanna  and the three maritime islands to hunt upon  when they should  come to bathe in the salt waters  that neither mary nor her husband had  any right to those lands  which were the common property of the creek  nations  that the great king had ordered the president to defend their  right to them  and expected that all his subjects  both white and red   would live together like brethren  in short that he would suffer no man  or woman to molest or injure them  and had ordered these words to be left  on record  that their children might know them when they were dead and  gone     such policy produced the desired effect  and many of the chieftains being  convinced that bosomworth had deceived them  declared they would trust  him no more  even malatchee  the leader of the lower creeks  and a  relation to their pretended empress  seemed satisfied  and was not a  little pleased to hear  that the great king had sent them some valuable  present  being asked why he acknowledged mary as the empress of the great  nation of creeks  and resigned his power and possessions to a despicable  old woman  while all georgia owned him as a chief of the nation  and the  president and council were now to give him many rich clothes and medals  for his services  he replied  that the whole nation acknowledged her as  their queen  and none could distribute the royal presents but one of her  family  the president by this answer perceiving more clearly the design  of the family of bosomworth  to lessen their influence  and shew the  indians that he had power to divide the royal bounty among the chiefs   determined to do it immediately  and dismiss them  and the hardships the  inhabitants underwent  in keeping guard night and day for the defence of  the town     in the mean time malatchee  whom the indians compared to the wind   because of his fickle and variable temper  having  at his own request   obtained access to bosomworth and his wife  was again seduced and drawn  over to support their chimerical claim  while the indians were gathered  together to receive their respective shares of the royal bounty  he stood  up in the midst of them  and with a frowning countenance  and in violent  agitation of spirit  delivered a speech fraught with the most dangerous  insinuations  he protested  that mary possessed that country before  general oglethorpe  and that all the lands belonged to her as queen  and  head of the creeks  that it was by her permission englishmen were at  first allowed to set their foot on them  that they still held them of her  as the original proprietor  that her words were the voice of the whole  nation  consisting of above three thousand warriors  and at her command  every one of them would take up the hatchet in defence of her right  and  then pulling out a paper out of his pocket  he delivered it to the  president in confirmation of what he had said  this was evidently the  production of bosomworth  and served to discover in the plainest manner   his ambitious views and wicked intrigues  the preamble was filled with  the names of indians  called kings  of all the towns of the upper and  lower creeks  none of whom  however  were present  excepting two  the  substance of it corresponded with malatchee s speech  styling mary the  rightful princess and chief of their nation  descended in a maternal line  from the emperor  and invested with full power and authority from them to  settle and finally determine all public affairs and causes  relating to  lands and other things  with king george and his beloved men on both  sides of the sea  and whatever should be said or done by her  they would  abide by  as if said or done by themselves     after reading this paper in council  the whole board were struck with  astonishment  and malatchee  perceiving their uneasiness  begged to have  it again  declaring he did not know it to be a bad talk  and promising he  would return it immediately to the person from whom he had received it   to remove all impression made on the minds of the indians by malatchee s  speech  and convince them of the deceitful and dangerous tendency of this  confederacy into which bosomworth and his wife had betrayed them  had now  become a matter of the highest consequence  happy was it for the province  this was a thing neither difficult nor impracticable  for as ignorant  savages are easily misled on the one hand  so  on the other  it was  equally easy to convince them of their error  accordingly  having  gathered the indians together for this purpose  the president addressed  them to the following effect   friends and brothers  when mr  oglethorpe  and his people first arrived in georgia  they found mary  then the wife  of john musgrove  living in a small hut at yamacraw  having a licence  from the governor of south carolina to trade with indians  she then  appeared to be in a poor ragged condition  and was neglected and despised  by the creeks  but mr  oglethorpe finding that she could speak both the  english and creek languages  employed her as an interpreter  richly  clothed her  and made her the woman of the consequence she now appears   the people of georgia always respected her until she married thomas  bosomworth  but from that time she has proved a liar and a deceiver  in  fact  she was no relation of malatchee  but the daughter of an indian  woman of no note  by a white man  general oglethorpe did not treat with  her for the lands of georgia  she having none of her own  but with the  old and wise leaders of the creek nation  who voluntarily surrendered  their territories to the king  the indians at that time having much waste  land  that was useless to themselves  parted with a share of it to their  friends  and were glad that white people had settled among them to supply  their wants  he told them that the present bad humour of the creeks had  been artfully infused into them by mary  at the instigation of her  husband  who owed four hundred pounds sterling in carolina for cattle   that he demanded a third part of the royal bounty  in order to rob the  naked indians of their right  that he had quarrelled with the president  and council of georgia for refusing to answer his exorbitant demands  and  therefore had filled the heads of indians with wild fancies and  groundless jealousies  in order to breed mischief  and induce them to  break their alliances with their best friends  who alone were able to  supply their wants  and defend them against all their enemies   here the  indians desired him to stop  and put an end to the contest  declaring  that their eyes were now opened  and they saw through his insidious  design  but though he intended to break the chain of friendship  they  were determined to hold it fast  and therefore begged that all might  immediatly smoke the pipe of peace  accordingly pipes and rum were  brought  and the whole congress  joining hand in hand  drank and smoked  together in friendship  every one wishing that their hearts might be  united in like manner as their hands  then all the royal presents  except  ammunition  with which is was judged imprudent to trust them until they  were at some distance from town  were brought and distributed among them   the most disaffected were purchased with the largest presents  even  malatchee himself seemed fully contented with his share  and the savages  in general perceiving the poverty and insignificance of the family of  bosomworth  and their total inability to supply their wants  determined  to break off all connection with them for ever     while the president and council flattered themselves that all differences  were amicably compromised  and were rejoicing in the re establishment of  their former friendly intercourse with the creeks  mary  drunk with  liquor  and disappointed in her views  came rushing in among them like a  fury  and told the president that these were her people  that he had no  business with them  and he should soon be convinced of it to his cost   the president calmly advised her to keep to her lodgings  and forbear to  poison the minds of indians  otherwise he would order her again into  close confinement  upon which turning about to malatchee in great rage   she told him what the president had said  who instantly started from his  seat  laid hold of his arms  and then calling upon the rest to follow his  example  dared any man to touch his queen  the whole house was filled in  a moment with tumult and uproar  every indian having his tomahawk in his  hand  the president and council expected nothing but instant death   during this confusion captain jones  who commanded the guard  very  seasonably interposed  and ordered the indians immediately to deliver up  their arms  such courage was not only necessary to overawe them  but at  the same time great prudence was also requisite  to avoid coming to  extremities with them  with reluctance the indians submitted  and mary  was conveyed to a private room  where a guard was set over her  and all  further intercourse with savages denied her during their stay in savanna   then her husband was sent for  in order to reason with him and convince  him of the folly of his chimerical pretensions  and of the dangerous  consequences that might result from persisting in them  but no sooner did  he appear before the president and council  than he began to abuse them  to their face  in spite of every argument used to persuade him to  submission  he remained obstinate and contumacious  and protested he  would stand forth in vindication of his wife s right to the last  extremity  and that the province of georgia should soon feel the weight  of her vengeance  finding that fair means were fruitless and ineffectual   the council then determined to remove him also out of the way of the  savages  and to humble him by force  after having secured the two  leaders  it only then remained to persuade the indians peaceably to leave  the town  and return to their settlements  captain ellick  a young  warrior  who had distinguished himself in discovering to his tribe the  base intrigues of bosomworth  being afraid to accompany malatchee and his  followers  thought fit to set out among the first  the rest followed him  in different parties  and the inhabitants  wearied out with constant  watching  and harassed with frequent alarms  were at length happily  relieved          sidenote  with difficulty settled     by this time adam bosomworth  another brother of the family  who was  agent for indian affairs in carolina  had arrived from that province  and  being made acquainted with what had passed in georgia  was filled with  shame and indignation  he found his ambitious brother  not contented with  the common allowance of land granted by the crown  aspiring after  sovereignty  and attempting to obtain by force one of the largest landed  estates in the world  his plot was artfully contrived  and had it been  executed with equal courage  fatal must the consequence have been  had he  taken possession of the provincial magazine on his arrival at savanna   and supplied the creeks with ammunition  the militia must soon have been  overpowered  and every family must of course have fallen a sacrifice to  the indiscriminate vengeance of savages  happily  by the interposition of  his brother  all differences were peaceably compromised  thomas  bosomworth at length having returned to sober reflection  began to repent  of his folly  and to ask pardon of the magistrates and people  he wrote  to the president  acquainting him that he was now deeply sensible of his  duty as a subject  and of the respect he owed to civil authority  and  could no longer justify the conduct of his wife  but hoped that her  present remorse  and past services to the province  would entirely blot  out the remembrance of her unguarded expressions and rash design  he  appealed to the letters of general oglethorpe for her former  irreproachable conduct  and steady friendship to the settlement  and  hoped her good behaviour for the future would atone for her past  offences  and reinstate her in the public favour  for his own part  he  acknowledged her title to be groundless  and for ever relinquished all  claim to the lands of the province  the colonists generously forgave and  forgot all that had past  and public tranquillity being re established   new settlers applied for lands as usual  without meeting any more  obstacles from the idle claims of indian queens and chieftains          sidenote  the  charter surrendered to the king     the trustees of georgia finding that the province languished under their  care  and weary of the complaints of the people  in the year       surrendered their charter to the king  and it was made a royal  government  in consequence of which his majesty appointed john reynolds   an officer of the navy  governor of the province  and a legislature  similar to that of the other royal governments in america was established  in it  great had been the expence which the mother country had already  incurred  besides private benefactions  for supporting this colony  and  small had been the returns yet made by it  the vestiges of cultivation  were scarcely perceptible in the forest  and in england all commerce with  it was neglected and despised  at this time the whole annual exports of  georgia did not amount to ten thousand pounds sterling  though the people  were now favoured with the same liberties and privileges enjoyed by their  neighbours under the royal care  yet several years more elapsed before  the value of the lands in georgia was known  and that spirit of industry  broke out in it which afterwards diffused its happy influence over the  country          sidenote  george whitfield s settlement     in the annals of georgia the famous george whitfield may not be unworthy  of some notice  especially as the world through which he wandered has  heard so much of his orphan house built in that province  actuated by  religious motives  this wanderer several times passed the atlantic to  convert the americans  whom he addressed in such a manner as if they had  been all equal strangers to the privileges and benefits of religion with  the original inhabitants of the forest  however  his zeal never led him  beyond the maritime parts of america  through which he travelled   spreading what he called the true evangelical faith among the most  populous towns and villages  one would have imagined that the heathens   or at least those who were most destitute of the means of instruction   would have been the primary and most proper objects of his zeal and  compassion  but this was far from being the case  however  wherever he  went in america  as in britain  he had multitudes of followers  when he  first visited charlestown  alexander garden  a man of some sense and  erudition  who was the episcopal clergyman of that place  to put the  people upon their guard  took occasion to point out to them the  pernicious tendency of whitfield s wild doctrines and irregular manner of  life  he represented him as a religious impostor or quack  who had an  excellent knack of setting off to advantage his poisonous tenets  on the  other hand  whitfield  who had been accustomed to bear reproach and face  opposition  recriminated with double acrimony and greater success  while  alexander garden  to keep his flock from straying after this strange  pastor  expatiated on the words of scripture   those that have turned the  world upside down are come hither also   whitfield  with all the force of  comic humour and wit for which he was so much distinguished  by way of  reply  enlarged on these words   alexander the coppersmith hath done me  much evil  the lord reward him according to his works   in short  the  pulpit was perverted by both into the mean purposes of spite and  malevolence  and every one catching a share of the infection  spoke of  the clergymen as they were differently affected          sidenote  whitfield s orphan house     in georgia whitfield having obtained a track of land from the trustees   erected a wooden house two stories high  the dimensions of which were  seventy feet by forty  upon a sandy beach nigh the sea shore  this house   which he called the orphan house  he began to build about the year        and afterwards finished it at a great expense  it was intended to be a  lodging for poor children  where they were to be clothed and fed by  charitable contributions  and and trained up in the knowledge and  practice of the christian religion  the design  beyond doubt  was humane  and laudable  but  perhaps  had he travelled over the whole earth  he  could scarcely have found out a spot of ground upon it more improper for  the purpose  the whole province of georgia could not furnish him with a  track of land of the same extent more barren and unprofitable  to this  house poor children were to be sent from at least a healthy country  to  be supported partly by charity  and partly by the produce of this land  cultivated by negroes  nor was the climate better suited to the purpose  than the soil  for it is certain  before the unwholesome marshes around  the house were fertilized  the influences of both air and water must have  conspired to the children s destruction     however  whitfield having formed his chimerical project  determined to  accomplish it  and  instead of bring discouraged by obstacles and  difficulties  gloried in despising them  he wandered through the british  empire  persuaded the ignorant and credulous part of the world of the  excellence of his design  and obtained from them money  clothes  and  books  to forward his undertaking  and supply his poor orphans in  georgia  about thirty years after this wooden house was finished it was  burned to the ground  during which time  if i am well informed  few or  none of the children educated in it have proved either useful members of  society  or exemplary in respect to religion  some say the fire was  occasioned by a foul chimney  and others by a flash of lightning  but  whatever was the cause  it burnt with such violence that little of either  the furniture or library escaped the flames  when i saw the ruins of this  fabric  i could not help reflecting on that great abuse of the fruits of  charity too prevalent in the world  that money which was sunk here had  been collected chiefly from the poorest class of mankind  most of those  bibles which were here burnt had been extorted from indigent and  credulous persons  who perhaps had not money to purchase more for  themselves  happy was it for the zealous founder of this institution   that he did not live to see the ruin of his works  after his death he was  brought from new england  above eight hundred miles  and buried at this  orphan house  in his last will he left lady huntingdon sole executrix   who has now converted the lands and negroes belonging to the poor  benefactors of great britain and her dominions  to the support of  clergymen of the same irregular stamp with the deceased  but void of his  shining talents  and it is become a seminary of dissension and sedition          sidenote  sketch of his character     as george whitfield appeared in such different lights in the successive  stages of life  it is no easy matter to delineate his character without  an uncommon mixture and vast variety of colours  he was in the british  empire not unlike one of those strange and erratic meteors which appear  now and then in the system of nature  in his youth  as he often confessed  and lamented  he was gay  giddy and profligate  so fondly attached to the  stage  that he joined a company of strolling actors and vagabonds  and  spent a part of his life in that capacity  at this period it is probable  he learned that grimace  buffoonery and gesticulation which he afterwards  displayed from the pulpit  from an abandoned and licentious course of  life he was converted  and  what is no uncommon thing  from one extreme  he run into the other  and became a most zealous and indefatigable  teacher of religion  having studied some time at oxford  he received  ordination in the church of england  yet he submitted to none of the  regulations of that or any other church  but became a preacher in  churches  meeting houses  halls  fields  in all places  and to all  denominations  without exception  though little distinguished for genius  or learning  yet he possessed a lively imagination  much humour  and had  acquired considerable knowledge of human nature and the manners of the  world  his pretensions to humanity and benevolence were great  yet he  would swell with venom  like a snake  against opposition and  contradiction  his reading was inconsiderable  and mankind being the  object of his study  he could  when he pleased  raise the passions  and  touch the tone of the human heart to great perfection  by this affecting  eloquence and address he impressed on the minds of many  especially of  the more soft and delicate sex  such a strong sense of sin and guilt as  often plunged them into dejection and despair  as his custom was to  frequent those larger cities and towns  that are commonly best supplied  with the means of instruction  it would appear that the love of fame and  popular applause was his leading passion  yet in candour it must be  acknowledged  that he always discovered a warm zeal for the honour of god  and the happiness of men  while he was almost worshipped by the vulgar   men of superior rank and erudition found him the polite gentleman  and  the facetious and jocular companion  though he loved good cheer  and  frequented the houses of the rich or more hospitable people of america   yet he was an enemy to all manner of excess and intemperance  while his  vagrant temper led him from place to place  his natural discernment  enabled him to form no bad judgment of the characters and manners of men  wherever he went  though he appeared a friend to no established church   yet good policy winked at all his irregularities  as he every where  proved a steady friend to monarchy and the civil constitution  he knew  well how to keep up the curiosity of the multitude  and his roving manner  stamped a kind of novelty on his instructions  when exposed to the taunts  of the scoffer  and the ridicule of the flagitious  he remained firm to  his purpose  and could even retort these weapons with astonishing ease  and dexterity  and render vice abashed under the lash of his satire and  wit  sometimes  indeed  he made little scruple of consigning over to  damnation such as differed from him or despised him  yet he was not  entirely devoid of liberality of sentiment  to habitual sinners his  address was for the most part applicable and powerful  and with equal  ease could alarm the secure  and confirm the unsteady  though  in prayer   he commonly addressed the second person of the trinity in a familiar and  fulsome style  and in his sermons used many ridiculous forms of speech   and told many of his own wonderful works  yet these seemed only shades to  set off to greater advantage the lustre of his good qualities  in short   though it is acknowledged he had many oddities and failings  and was too  much the slave of party and vain glory  yet in justice it cannot be  denied  that religion in america owed not a little to the zeal   diligence  and oratory  of this extraordinary man     having said so much with respect to the character which mr  whitfield  bore in america  if we view the effects of his example and manner of life  in that country  he will appear to us in a less favourable light  his  great ambition was to be the founder of a new sect  regulated entirely by  popular fancy and caprice  depending on the gifts of nature  regardless  of the improvements of education and all ecclesiastical laws and  institutions  accordingly  after him a servile race of ignorant and  despicable imitators sprung up  and wandered from place to place   spreading doctrines subversive of all public order and peace  we  acknowledge the propriety and justice of allowing every reasonable  indulgence to men in matters of religion  the laws of toleration being  part of our happy constitution  it lies with men to learn their duty from  them  and claim protection under them  but after a church has been  erected and established by the most skilful architects  and for ages  received the approbation of the wisest and best men  it serves only to  create endless confusion to be making alterations and additions to  gratify the fancy of every gothic pretender to that art  though whitfield  was in fact a friend to civil government  yet his followers on that  continent have been distinguished for the contrary character  and have  for the most part discovered an aversion to our constitution both of  church and state  toleration to men who remain peaceable subjects to the  state is reasonable  but dissention  when it grows lawless and  headstrong  is dangerous  and summons men in general to take shelter  under the constitution  that the salutary laws of our country may be  executed by its united strength  no man ought to claim any lordship over  the conscience  but when the consciences of obstinate sectaries become  civil nuisances  and destructive of public tranquillity  they ought to be  restrained by legal authority  for certainly human laws  if they have not  the primary  have  or ought to have  a secondary power to restrain the  irregular and wild excesses of men in religious as well as in civil  matters          sidenote  a congress with creeks     about the year      the flames of war broke out among some indian  nations  which threatened to involve the province of carolina in the  calamity  the creeks having quarrelled with their neighbours for  permitting some indians to pass through their country to wage war against  them  by way of revenge had killed some cherokees nigh the gates of  charlestown  a british trader to the chickesaw nation had likewise been  scalped by a party of warriors belonging to the same nation  governor  glen  in order to demand satisfaction for these outrages  sent a  messenger to the creeks  requesting a conference at charlestown with  their leading men  the creeks returned for answer  that they were willing  to meet him  but as the path had not been open and safe for some time   they could not enter the settlement without a guard to escort them  upon  which the governor sent fifty horsemen  who met them at the confines of  their territories  and convoyed malatchee  with above an hundred of his  warriors  to charlestown          sidenote  the governor s speech to them     as they arrived on sunday the governor did not summon his council until  the day following  to hold a congress with them  at this meeting a number  of gentlemen were present  whom curiosity had drawn together to see the  warriors and hear their speeches  when they entered the council chamber  the governor arose and took them by the hand  signifying that he was glad  to see them  and then addressed them to the following effect   being tied  together by the most solemn treaties  i call you by the beloved names of  friends and brothers  in the name of the great king george i have sent  for you  on business of the greatest consequence to your nation  i would  have received you yesterday on your arrival  but it was a beloved day   dedicated to repose and the concerns of a future life  i am sorry to hear  that you have taken up the hatchet  which i flattered myself had been for  ever buried  it is my desire to have the chain brightened and renewed   not only between you and the english  but also between you and other  indian nations  you are all our friends  and i could wish that all  indians in friendship with us were also friends one with another  you  have complained to me of the cherokees permitting the northern indians to  come through their country to war against you  and supplying them with  provisions and ammunition for that purpose  the cherokees  on the other  hand  alledge  that it is not in their power to prevent them  and  declare  that while their people happen to be out hunting those northern  indians come in to their towns well armed  and in such numbers that they  are not able to resist them      i propose that a treaty of friendship and peace be concluded first with  the english  and then with the cherokees  in such a manner as may render  it durable  some of your people have from smaller crimes proceeded to  greater  first  they waylaid the cherokees  and killed one of them in the  midst of our settlements  then they came to charlestown  where some  cherokees at the same time happened to be  and though i cautioned them   and they promised to do no mischief  yet the next day they assaulted and  murdered several of them nigh the gates of this town  for these outrages  i have sent for you  to demand satisfaction  and also for the murder  committed in one of your towns  for which satisfaction was made by the  death of another person  and not of the murderer  for the future  i  acquaint you  that nothing will be deemed as satisfaction for the lives  of our people  but the lives of these persons themselves who shall be  guilty of the murder  the english never make treaties of friendship but  with the greatest deliberation  and when made observe them with the  strictest punctuality  they are  at the same time vigilant  and will not  suffer other nations to infringe the smallest article of such treaties   it would tend to the happiness of your people were you equally careful to  watch against the beginnings of evil  for sometimes a small spark  if not  attended to  may kindle a great fire  and a slight sore  if suffered to  spread  may endanger the whole body  therefore  i have sent for you to  prevent farther mischief  and i hope you come disposed to give  satisfaction for the outrages already committed  and to promise and agree  to maintain peace and friendship with your neighbours for the future       sidenote  malatchee s answer   this speech delivered to the indians was  interpreted by lachlan mcgilvray  an indian trader  who understood their  language  after which malatchee  the king of the lower creek nation   stood forth  and with a solemnity and dignity of manner that astonished  all present  in answer  addressed the governor to the following effect    i never had the honour to see the great king george  nor to hear his  talk  but you are in his place  i have heard yours  and i like it  well  your sentiments are agreeable to my own  the great king wisely  judged  that the best way of maintaining friendship between white and red  people was by trade and commerce    he knew we are poor  and want many  things  and that skins are all we have to give in exchange for what we  want  i have ordered my people to bring you some as a present  and  in  the name of our nation  i lay them at your excellency s feet  you have  sent for us  we are come to hear what you have to say  but i did not  expect to hear our whole nation accused for the faults of a few private  men  our head men neither knew nor approved of the mischief done  we  imagined our young men had gone a hunting as usual  when we heard what  had happened at charlestown  i knew you would send and demand  satisfaction  when your agent came and told me what satisfaction you  required  i owned the justice of it  but it was not adviseable for me  alone to grant it  it was prudent to consult with our beloved men  and  have their advice in a matter of such importance  we met  we found that  the behaviour of some of our people had been bad  we found that blood had  been spilt at your gates  we thought it just that satisfaction should he  made  we turned our thoughts to find out the chief persons concerned    for a man will sometimes employ another to commit a crime he does not  chuse to be guilty of himself    we found the acorn whistler was the  chief contriver and promoter of the mischief  we agreed that he was the  man that ought to suffer  some of his relations  who are here present   then said he deserved death  and voted for it  accordingly he was put to  death  he was a very great warrior  and had many friends and relations in  different parts of the country  we thought it prudent to conceal for some  time the true reason of his death  which was known only to the head men  that concerted it  we did this for fear some of his friends in the heat  of fury would take revenge on some of your traders  at a general meeting  all matters were explained  the reasons of his death were made known  his  relations approved of all that was done   satisfaction being made  i say  no more about that matter  i hope our friendship with the english will  continue as heretofore      as to the injuries done to the cherokees  which you spoke of  we are  sorry for them  we acknowledge our young men do many things they ought  not to do  and very often act like madmen  but it is well known i and the  other head warriors did all we could to oblige them to make  restitution  i rode from town to town with mr  bosomworth and his wife to  assist them in this matter  most of the things taken have been  restored  when this was over  another accident happened which created  fresh troubles  a chickesaw who lived in our nation  in a drunken fit  shot a white man  i knew you would demand satisfaction  i thought it best  to give it before it was asked  the murder was committed at a great  distance from me  i mounted my horse and rode through the towns with your  agent  i took the head men of every town along with me  we went to the  place and demanded satisfaction  it was given  the blood of the indian  was spilt for the blood of a white man  the uncle of the murderer  purchased his life  and voluntarily killed himself in his stead  now i  have done  i am glad to see you face to face to settle those matters  it  is good to renew treaties of friendship  i shall always be glad to call  you friends and brothers      this speech throws no small light on the judicial proceedings of  barbarous nations  and shews that human nature in its rudest state  possesses a strong sense of right and wrong  although indians have little  property  yet here we behold their chief magistrate protecting what they  have  and  in cases of robbery  acknowledging the necessity of making  restitution  they indeed chiefly injure one another in their persons or  reputations  and in all cases of murder the guilty are brought to trial  and condemned to death by the general consent of the nation  even the  friends and relations of the murderer here voted for his death  but what  is more remarkable  they give us an instance of an atonement made  and  justice satisfied  by the substitution of an innocent man in place of the  guilty  an uncle voluntarily and generously offers to die in the place of  his nephew  the savages accept of the offer  and in consequence of his  death declare that satisfaction is made  next to personal defence  the  indian guards his character and reputation  for as it is only from the  general opinion his nation entertains of his wisdom  justice and valour   that he can expect to arrive at rank and distinction  he is exceedingly  watchful against doing any thing for which he may incur public blame or  disgrace  in this answer to governor glen  malatchee discovers  considerable talents as a public speaker  and appears to be insensible  neither to his own dignity and freedom  not to the honour and  independence of his nation  genius and liberty are the gifts of heaven   the former is universal as that space over which it has scope to range   the latter inspires confidence  and gives a natural confidence to our  words and actions     during the months of june  july  and august        the weather in  carolina was warmer than any of the inhabitants then alive had ever felt  it  and the mercury in the shade often arose above the nintieth  and at  one time was observed at the hundred and first degree of the thermometer   and  at the same time  when exposed to the sun  and suspended at the  distance of five feet from the ground  it arose above the hundred and  twentieth division  by this excessive heat the air becomes greatly  rarified  and a violent hurricane commonly comes and restores the balance  in the atmosphere  in such a case the wind usually proceeds from the  north east  directly opposite to the point from which it had long blown  before  those storms indeed seldom happen except in seasons when there  has been little thunder  when the weather has been long exceeding dry and  intolerably hot  and though they occasion damages to some individuals   there is reason to believe that they are wisely ordered  and productive  upon the whole of good and salutary effects  among the close and dark  recesses of the woods the air stagnates  and requires some violent storm  to clear it of putrid effluvia  and render it fit for respiration  at the  same time the earth emits vapours which in a few days causes the finest  polished metals to rust  to penetrate through the thick forest  and  restore the air to a salubrious state  hurricanes may be useful and  necessary  and as such storms have been observed to be productive of good  effects  the want of them for many years together may be deemed a great  misfortune by the inhabitants  especially such as are exposed to the  noon day heat  to the heavy fogs that fall every morning and evening  and  all the severities of the climate     it is not improbable that the maritime parts of carolina have been  forsaken by the sea  though you dig ever so deep in those places you find  no stones or rocks  but every where sand or beds of shells  as a small  decrease of water will leave so flat a country entirely bare  so a small  increase will again cover it  the coast is not only very level  but the  dangerous hurricanes commonly proceed from the north east  and as the  stream of the gulf of florida flows rapidly towards the same point  this  large body of water  when obstructed by the tempest  recurs upon the  shore  and overflows the country          sidenote  a hurricane at charlestown     in the month of september        a dreadful hurricane happened at  charlestown  in the night before  it was observed by the inhabitants that  the wind at north east began to blow hard  and continued increasing in  violence till next morning  then the sky appeared wild and cloudy  and it  began to drizzle and rain  about nine o clock the flood came rolling in  with great impetuosity  and in a little time rose ten feet above high  water mark at the highest tides  as usual in such cases  the town was  overflown  and the streets were covered with boats  boards  and wrecks of  houses and ships  before eleven all the ships in the harbour were driven  ashore  and sloops and schooners were dashing against the houses of  bay street  in which great quantities of goods were damaged and  destroyed  except the hornet man of war  which by cutting away her masts   rode out the storm  no vessel escaped being damaged or wrecked  the  tremor and consternation which seized the inhabitants may be more easily  conceived than expressed  finding themselves in the midst of a  tempestuous sea  and expecting the tide to flow till one o clock  its  usual hour  at eleven they retired to the upper stories of their houses   and there remained despairing of life  at this critical time providence  however mercifully interposed  and surprised them with a sudden and  unexpected deliverance  soon after eleven the wind shifted  in  consequence of which the waters fell five feet in the space of ten  minutes  by this happy change the gulf stream  stemmed by the violent  blast  had freedom to run in its usual course  and the town was saved  from imminent danger and destruction  had the water continued to rise   and the tide to flow until its usual hour  every inhabitant of  charlestown must have perished  almost all the tiled and slated houses  were uncovered  several persons were hurt  and some were drowned  the  fortifications and wharfs were almost entirely demolished  the provisions  in the field  in the maritime parts  were destroyed  and numbers of  cattle and hogs perished in the waters  the pest house in sullivan s  island  built of wood  with fifteen persons in it  was carried several  miles up cooper river  and nine out of the fifteen were drowned  in  short  such is the low situation of charlestown  that it is subject to be  destroyed at any time by such an inundation  and the frequent warnings  the people have had may justly fill them with a deep sense of their  dependent condition  and with constant gratitude to providence for their  preservation          sidenote  the advantages of poor settlers in the province     we have seen the hardships under which the carolineans laboured from the  hot climate and low situation of the province  it may not be improper to  take a view of those advantages afforded them which served to animate  them amidst such difficulties to industry and perseverance  in that  growing colony  where there are vast quantities of land unoccupied  the  poorest class of people have many opportunities and advantages  from  which they are entirely excluded in countries fully peopled and highly  improved  during the first years of occupancy they are indeed exposed to  many dangers in providing for themselves and families an habitation for a  shelter against the rigours of the climate  and in clearing fields for  raising the necessaries of life  but when they have the good fortune to  surmount the hardships of the first years of cultivation  the  inconveniencies gradually decrease in proportion to their improvements   the merchants being favoured with credit from britain  are enabled to  extend it to the swarm of labourers in the country  the planters having  established their characters for honesty and industry  obtain hands to  assist them in the harder tasks of clearing and cultivation  their wealth  consists in the increase of their slaves  stock and improvements  having  abundance of waste land  they can extend their culture in proportion to  their capital  they live almost entirely on the produce of their estates   and consequently spend but a small part of their annual income  the  surplus is yearly added to the capital  and they enlarge their prospects  in proportion to their wealth and strength  at market if there be a great  demand for the commodities they raise  this is an additional advantage   and renders their progress rapid beyond their most sanguine expectations   they labour  and they receive more and more encouragement to persevere   until they advance to an easy and comfortable state  it has been  observed  on the other hand  that few or none of those emigrants that  brought much property along with them have ever succeeded in that  country          sidenote  the advantages of money lenders     or  if the poor emigrant be an artificer  and chuses to follow his trade   the high price of labour is no less encouraging  by the indulgence of the  merchants  or by the security of a friend  he obtains credit for a few  negroes  he learns them his trade  and a few good tradesmen  well  employed  are equal to a small estate  having got some hands  instead of  a labourer he becomes an undertaker  and enters into contract with his  employer  to erect his house  to build his ship  to furnish his  plantations with shoes  or the capital with bricks  in a little time he  acquires some money  and  like several others in the city whose yearly  gain exceeds what is requisite for the support of themselves and  families  lays it out on interest  ten and eight  per cent   being given  for money  proved a great temptation  and induced many  who were averse  from the trouble of settling plantations  or were unable to bestow that  attention to them which they demanded  to take this method of increasing  their fortune  if the moneylender followed his employment in the capital   or reserved in his hands a sufficiency for family use  and allowed the  interest to be added yearly to the capital stock  his fortune increased  fast  and soon became considerable  several persons preferred this method  of accumulating riches to that of cultivation  especially those whom age  or infirmity had rendered unfit for action and fatigue     notwithstanding the extensive credit commonly allowed the planting  interest by the merchants  the number of borrowers always exceeded that  of the lenders of money  having vast extent of territory  the planters  were eager to obtain numbers of labourers  which raised the demand for  money  and kept up the high rate of interest  the interest of money in  every country is for the most part according to the demand  and the  demand according to the profits made by the use of it  the profits must  always be great where men can afford to take money at the rate of eight  and ten  per cent   and allow it to remain in their hands upon compound  interest  in carolina labourers on good lands cleared their first cost  and charges in a few years  and therefore great was the demand for money  in order to procure them          sidenote  and of the borrowers     let us next take a view of those advantages in favour of the borrower of  money  his landed estate he obtained from the crown  the quit rents and  taxes were trifling and inconsiderable  being both landlord and farmer he  had perfect liberty to manage and improve his plantation as he pleased   and was accountable to none but himself for any of the fruits of his  industry  his estate furnished him with game and fish  which he had  freedom to kill and use at pleasure  in the woods his cattle  hogs and  horses grazed at their ease  attended perhaps only by a negro boy  if his  sheep did not thrive well  he had calves  hogs and poultry in abundance  for the use of his family  all his able labourers he could turn to the  field  and exert his strength in railing his staple commodity  the low  country being every where interspersed with navigable rivers and creeks   the expence of conveying his rice to the market  which otherwise would  have been intolerable  was thereby rendered easy  having provisions from  his estate to support his family and labourers  he applies his whole  staple commodities for the purposes of answering the demands of the  merchant and moneylender  he expects that his annual produce will not  only answer those demands against him  but also bring an addition to his  capital  and enable him to extend his hand still farther in the way of  improvement  hence it happened  that in proportion as the merchants  extended credit to the planters  and supplied them with labourers for  their lands  the profits returned to the capital yearly according to the  increased number of hands employed in cultivation     it is no easy thing to enumerate all the advantages of water carriage to  a fruitful and commercial province  the lands are rendered more valuable  by being situated on navigable creeks and rivers  the planters who live  fifty miles from the capital  are at little more expence in sending their  provisions and produce to its market  than those who live within five  miles of it  the town is supplied with plenty of provisions  and its  neighbourhood prevented from enjoying a monopoly of its market  by this  general and unlimited competition the price of provisions is kept low   and while the money arising from them circulates equally and universally  through the country  it contributes  in return  to its improvement  the  planters have not only water carriage to the market far their staple  commodities  but on their arrival the merchant again commits them to the  general tide of commerce  and receives in return what the world affords  profitable to himself  and useful to the country in which he lives  hence  it happened  that no town was better supplied than charlestown with all  the necessaries  conveniencies  and luxuries of life          sidenote  great benefits enjoyed by colonists     besides these advantages arising from good lands given them by the crown   the carolineans received protection to trade  a ready market  drawbacks  and bounties  by their political and commercial connection with the  mother country  the duties laid on many articles of foreign manufacture  on their importation into britain were drawn back  sometimes the whole   almost always a great part  on their exportation to the colonies  these  drawbacks were always in favour of the consumers  and supplied the  provincial markets with foreign goods at a rate equally cheap as if they  had been immediately imported from the place where they were  manufactured  hence the colonists were exempted from those heavy duties  which their fellow subjects in britain were obliged to pay  on most  articles of foreign manufacture which they consumed  besides  upon the  arrival of such goods in the country  the planters commonly had twelve  months credit from the provincial merchant  who was satisfied with  payment once in the year from all his customers  so that to the consumers  in carolina  east india goods  german manufactures  spanish  portugal   madeira and fyal wines came cheaper than to those in great britain  we  have known coals  salt  and other articles brought by way of ballast   sold cheaper in charlestown than in london     but the colonists had not only those drawbacks on foreign goods imported   but they were also allowed bounties on several articles of produce  exported  for the encouragement of her colonies great britain laid high  duties on several articles imported from foreign countries  and gave the  colonists premiums and bounties on the same commodities  the planting  tobacco was prohibited in england  in order to encourage it in america   the bounties on naval stores  indigo  hemp  and raw silk  while they  proved an encouragement to industry  all terminated in favour of the  plantations  nor ought the carolineans to forget the perfect freedom they  enjoyed with respect to their trade with the west indies  where they  found a convenient and most excellent market for their indian corn  rice   lumber  and salt provisions  and in return had rum  unclayed sugar   coffee and molasses much cheaper than their fellow subjects in britain  i  mention these things because many of the colonists are ignorant of the  privileges and advantages they enjoy  for  upon a general view of their  circumstances  and a comparison of their case with that of their  fellow subjects in britain and ireland  they must find they had much  ground for contentment  and none for complaint     another circumstance we may mention to which few have paid sufficient  attention  it is true  great britain had laid the colonists under some  restraints with respect to their domestic manufactures and their trade to  foreign ports  but however much such a system of policy might affect the  more northern colonies  it was at this time rather serviceable than  prejudicial to carolina  it served to direct the views of the people to  the culture of lands  which was both more profitable to themselves and  beneficial to the mother country  though they had plenty of beaver skins   and a few hats were manufactured from them  yet the price of labour was  so high  that the merchant could send the skins to england  import hats  made of them  and undersell the manufacturers of carolina  the province  also furnished some wool and cotton  but before they could be made into  cloth  they cost the consumer more money than the merchant demanded for  the same goods imported  the province afforded leather  but before it  could be prepared and made into shoes  the price was equally high  and  often higher  than that of shoes imported from britain  in like manner   with respect to many other articles  it would be for the advantage of the  province as well as mother country to export the raw materials and import  the goods manufactured  for while the inhabitants of carolina can employ  their hands to more advantage in cultivating waste land  it will be their  interest never to wear a woollen or linen rag of their own manufacture   to drive a nail of their own forging  nor use any sort of plate  iron   brass or stationary wares of their own making  until the province shall  grow more populous  cultivation is the most profitable employment  and  the labourer injures himself and family by preferring the less to the  more profitable branch of industry     few also are the restrictions upon trade  which  in effect  could be  deemed hurtful  for  excepting the vessels which traded to the southward  of cape finisterre  and were obliged to return to england to cancel their  bond before they sailed for carolina  every other restraint may be said  to be ultimately in favour of the province  it was the interest of such a  flourishing colony to be always in debt to great britain  for the more  labourers that were sent to it  the more rapidly it advanced in riches   suppose the planters this year stand much indebted to the merchants  and   by reason of an unfavourable season  are rendered unable to answer the  demands against them  the merchants  instead of ruining them  indulged  them for another year  and perhaps intrusted them with double the sum for  which they stood indebted  this has frequently been found the most  certain method of obtaining payment  in like manner the merchants must  have indulgence from england  the primary source of credit  if the  province could not obtain such indulgence from any part of the world as  from the mother country  it must be for its interest to support its  credit with those generous friends who were both able and disposed to  give it  to lodge the yearly produce of the province in the hands of  those english creditors as soon as possible  is the surest means of  supporting this credit  besides  the london merchants being the best  judges of the markets of europe  can of course sell the staple  commodities to the best advantage  the centrical situation of that city  was favourable for intelligence  her merchants are famous over the world  for their extensive knowledge in trade  they well knew the ports where  there was the greatest demand for the commodity  all which were  manifestly in favour of the province in which it was raised  were the  planters to have the choice of their market  it is very doubtful whether  such liberty would be for their interest  were they to export their  produce on their own bottom  they would certainly be great losers  some  who have made the attempt have honestly confessed the truth  while it  divided their attention  it engaged them in affairs to which they were in  general very great strangers  even the provincial merchants themselves  are not always perfect judges of the markets in europe  nor could they  have obtained such unlimited credit in any other channel than that  circumscribed by the laws of their country  here is a co operation of a  number of persons united for promoting the interest and advantage of one  another  and placed in circumstances and situations well adapted for that  purpose  so that  in fact  it is not for the interest of carolina  in its  present advancing state  to be free from debt  far less of its planters  to engage in trade  or its inhabitants in manufactures          sidenote  progress of the province     to form a right judgment of the progress of the province  and the mutual  advantages resulting from its political and commercial connection with  britain  we need only attend to its annual imports and exports  we cannot  exactly say what its imports amounted to at this time  but if they  amounted to above one hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling in the  year       as we have already seen  they must have arisen at least to two  hundred thousand pounds sterling in       the quantities of rice exported  this year were         barrels  of indigo          pounds weight  which   together with naval stores  provisions  skins  lumber    c   amounted in  value to two hundred and forty two thousand  five hundred and twenty nine  pounds sterling  this shews the great value and importance of the  province to britain  and while she depends on the mother country for all  the manufactures she uses  and applies her attention to such branches of  business as are most profitable to herself and most beneficial to  britain  carolina must in the nature of things prosper  without this  dependence  and mutual exchange of good offices  the colony might have  subsisted  but could never have thrived and flourished in so rapid a  manner           chap  x            sidenote  a dispute about the limits of british and french      territories     although the peace of aix la chapelle extended to the subjects of both  britain and france residing in america  yet the boundaries of the  respective territories claimed by those rival states were by no means  fixed in so clear and precise a manner as to preclude all grounds of  future dispute  the limits of nova scotia in particular  and those of the  extensive back settlements of virginia and pennsylvania  were neither  clearly understood nor accurately marked  in consequence of which  as the  colonists extended their culture backwards encroachments were made  or  supposed to be made  which created jealousies and differences between the  british and french subjects on that continent  some merchants trading to  virginia and pennsylvania having formed a project for a settlement on the  ohio  obtained a grant of six hundred thousand acres of land from the  king  together with an exclusive privilege of trafficking with indian  nations nigh that river  to these territories the french claimed a right   and  to keep possession  as well as to engross the indian trade  built a  fort on the banks of the ohio river  which they called fort duquesne   this situation was very convenient for preserving the friendship of  indian nations  an object of the utmost importance to the french  as the  subjects of britain in america were at that time vastly more numerous and  powerful than those of france     tobacco being a plant which quickly exhausts the richest lands  the  planters of virginia were accustomed gradually to stretch backward  and  occupy such fresh spots of ground as promised them the greatest returns   some had even crossed the allegany mountains  where they found rich  vallies lying waste  upon which they settled plantations  and though the  land carriage of such a heavy and bulky commodity was expensive  yet they  found that the superiority of their crops made them some compensation  to  this territory beyond the mountains  as well as the other marked and  measured out for the ohio company  the french laid claim  and sent a  considerable garrison from montreal to fort duquesne  to defend their  pretended right  the commander in chief of canada wrote a letter to the  governor of virginia  complaining of encroachments made on his most  christian majesty s territories  and demanding that such british planters  and traders as had settled on those lands should withdraw  otherwise he  would be obliged to seize both their properties and persons  no regard  being paid to his complaints  the commandant of fort duquesne seized by  force three british traders  and goods to a large amount  and carried  them to montreal  upon which the governor of virginia determined to  resent the injury  and immediately began to concert measures for the  protection of the frontiers  he raised a body of militia  and sent them  met the mountains to watch the motions of their troublesome neighbours   and obtained reinforcements from north and south carolina to assist them  against the french garrison  this detachment  under the command of major  washington  encamped near fort duquesne  between whom and the french  garrison hostilities commenced in america  and the flame of war  afterwards spreading  involved europe in the quarrel          sidenote  a chain of forts raised by the french     from this period the great object which the french kept in view was to  strengthen their frontiers  and make all possible preparations for  defending themselves against the storm which they foresaw gathering in  america  though they seemed averse from an open declaration of war  yet  they continued pouring troops into the continent  and raising a line of  forts to secure a communication between their colony at the mouth of the  mississippi and their great settlement in canada  they amused the british  administration with fruitless negotiations about the limits of nova  scotia  while they were busily employed in the execution of this great  plan  their design  however  was no secret to the more discerning part of  the americans  who plainly perceived from such preparations that  hostilities were approaching  in acadia they erected a fort at chinecto   to confine the british subjects of nova scotia within the peninsula  at  crown point another was raised  on lands claimed by the king of great  britain  well situated for harassing the back settlements of new york and  connecticut  another was built at niagara  on land belonging to the six  nations in alliance with britain  while the canadians were falling down  the ohio river  and raising strong holds  the forces at pensacola and new  orleans were also forcing their way up the mississippi  and establishing  garrisons on the most advantageous posts  on purpose to meet their  friends from canada  and confine the british settlements to the space  between the mountains and the atlantic sea  the more easily to accomplish  this great design  it was necessary to secure by all possible means the  interest of the savage nations  for this purpose missionaries were sent  among the different tribes  who conformed to the dress  manners and  customs of the savages  and represented the british heretics in the most  odious light  making the indians believe that their safety and happiness  depended on the total extirpation of such men from america  though some  tribes rejected their friendship  yet it is certain that many were won  over by their insinuating arts and intrigues  and entered into alliances  with them  when a general congress was held at albany fewer indians than  usual at such meetings attended  which afforded grounds of suspicion  and  obliged the governors of the british colonies to double their diligence  for watching the motions of their enterprising neighbours          sidenote  the distracted state of the british colonies     at the same time the situation of some of the british colonies proved  favourable to the hostile preparations and attempts of their enemies   their clashing interests had bred jealousies and animosities among them   insomuch that it was no easy matter to bring them firmly to unite  in  order to oppose a common enemy with vigour and spirit  they believed  themselves unable to withstand the militia of canada supported by some  regiments of regular troops from france  and therefore in the most humble  manner implored the protection of britain  they were filled with terrible  apprehensions of the french power  declaring that their vanity and  ambition had nothing less in view at this period than to divide the  western world with spain  and make all its riches center in the house of  bourbon  but whether they had such a view or not  one thing is plain   that the reduction of the british empire in america would facilitate the  accomplishment of such a design  as the portuguese dominions must  afterwards fall an easy prey to those two powerful potentates     though great britain was sensible of the danger which threatened her  colonies  yet as the number of british settlers on the continent exceeded  that of the french  being not less than twenty to one  she expected that  they would unite among themselves  and raise a fund for the common  defence  hitherto she had nursed and protected them  and many of the  colonies had arrived at a considerable degree of opulence and strength   they had the easiest taxes of any civilized people upon earth  they had  enjoyed many civil privileges  and commercial advantages  from their  connection with the mother country  as their resources were considerable   it was hoped their zeal would not be wanting for their own defence  to  give a check to any encroachments of the french in that quarter  great  britain was more remotely  america herself more immediately  concerned   instructions were therefore sent to the governors of the different  provinces  to recommend unanimity to the people  and the necessity of an  association for their mutual defence  but when the raising of men and  money was proposed to the assemblies they fell into disputes among  themselves  which became more violent in proportion as the enemy  approached their habitations  some pleaded extraordinary privileges from  their charters  others started frivolous and absurd objections  insisting  on punctilios as pretences for delay  in short  so different were their  constitutions and forms of government  so divided were they in their  views and interests  that it was found impossible to unite them together   in order to give their force its due weight  the frontiers were naked and  extensive  the inhabitants upon them were thin and scattered  and utterly  unequal to the service requisite without the assistance of their  neighbours  the flames of war had broke out on some of them  and the  neighbouring provinces could no otherwise be safe than by stretching  forth their hands in helping to extinguish them  thus  while the french  were acting in concert under one commander and chief  the british  colonists were spending that time in barren deliberations and private  disputes which they ought to have employed in fortifying their borders  and checking the progress of their enemy  what was in fact the business  of every man seemed to engage the attention of none  and all kept their  eyes fixed on the mother country for protection  regarding themselves as  disinterested in the general safety of the empire  and very unequal to  their own defence          sidenote  general braddock s defeat in virginia     while thus one province refused help to another  great britain   notwithstanding the extensive dominions she had to guard in different  quarters of the globe  generously undertook the protection of america  as  the greatest dangers seemed to hang over the province of virginia   general braddock was sent out with a considerable body of men to assist  the virginians in driving the french from their frontiers  this haughty  and rash leader  being possessed of considerable skill in the european  arts of war  entertained a sovereign contempt for an american enemy  and  advanced against fort duquesne without even the smallest doubt of  success  however  the french had intelligence of his approach  and were  prepared to receive him  having collected a large body of indians  they  had taken possession of an advantageous ground  and placed the regulars  on a rising hill in front  and the savages in the dark woods on each  side  general braddock  instead of keeping small parties before the main  body  to scour the woods as he advanced  and explore every dangerous  pass  marched his men  according to the custom in europe  in a close  compacted body  and unfortunately fell into the snare which his enemies  had laid for him  the french regulars in the front began the attack from  behind a breast work  while the indians kept up an irregular and  scattered fire from the dark thickets on each side  which surprized and  confounded the british soldiers  who were utter strangers to such methods  of attack  almost every shot took effect  and the brave men observing  their neighbours falling by their side  were put into confusion and fled   refusing to return to the charge against invisible assailants   notwithstanding every effort used by the officers for that purpose   braddock with many brave officers and men fell in this field  and the  remainder retreated with precipitation to philadelphia  leaving these  frontiers in a worse condition than they were in before          sidenote  colonel johnston s success at lake george     colonel johnston  who marched with about three thousand men against crown  point  was indeed more successful than this rash commander in virginia   being better acquainted with the woods  and the various methods of  attack  he could both avail himself of the advantages  and guard against  the dangers arising from the nature of the country  with cautious steps  he advanced against the enemy  until he reached lake george  where a  party of his advanced guard being attacked retreated to the main body   the french pursued them  and a bloody battle ensued between the two  armies  equally skilled in bush fighting  which terminated much to the  honour of the british officer  the enemy was repulsed with considerable  loss  leaving baron de diescau wounded in the field  who  with many  others  fell into johnston s hands  and were made prisoners of war  this  finall advantage gained over the french served in some measure to revive  the drooping spirits of the colonists  yet still they entertained the  most discouraging apprehensions of the french power in the woods  and  seemed ardently to long for the relief and assistance of the mother  country     while these hostilities were openly carrying on in the northern parts of  america  it was judged prudent to consult the safety of the provinces to  the south  and put them in the best posture of defence  to prevent the  fatal influence of french emissaries among the indian tribes  it was  thought necessary to build some small forts in the heart of their  country  the indians on the ohio river  from the success which attended  their arms at fort duquesne  entertained the highest ideas of french  courage and conduct  and were trying to seduce the cherokees  who were at  this time the firmest allies of britain  a message was sent to governor  glen from the chief warrior of the over hill settlements  acquainting him  that some frenchmen and their allies were among their people   endeavouring to poison their minds  and that it would be necessary to  hold a general congress with the nation  and renew their former treaties  of friendship  he assured the governor  that though he had been wounded  in his younger years  and was now old  yet he would meet him half way for  this purpose  if he should even be carried on the backs of his people   accordingly  governor glen appointed a place for holding a congress  and  agreed to meet the warrior  for as the clouds were gathering every where  on the american horizon  the friendship of the cherokees at such a time  was an object of too much importance to carolina to be overlooked or  neglected     it may be remarked  that the cherokees differ in some respects from other  indian nations that have wandered often from place to place  and fixed  their habitations on separate districts  from time immemorial they have  had possession of the same territory which at present they occupy  they  affirm  that their forefathers sprung from that ground  or descended from  the clouds upon those hills  these lands of their ancestors they value  above all things in the world  they venerate the places where their bones  lie interred  and esteem it disgraceful in the highest degree to  relinquish these sacred repositories  the man that would refuse to take  the field in defence of these hereditary possessions  is regarded by them  as a coward  and treated as an outcast from their nation  to the  over hill villages the french had an easy access by means of rivers that  emptied themselves into the ohio and mississippi  their middle  settlements and towns in the valley lay more convenient for trading with  the carolineans  hitherto they despised the french  whom they called  light as a feather  fickle as the wind  and deceitful as serpents  and   being naturally of a very grave cast  they considered the levity of that  people as an unpardonable insult  they looked upon themselves as a great  and powerful nation  and though their number was much diminished  yet  they could bring from their different towns about three thousand men to  the field  at this time they had neither arms nor ammunition to defend  themselves against their enemy  and the governor of carolina wanted  liberty to build two forts on their lands  in order to secure their  friendship and trade  as the french were tampering with them  and had  shewn a keenness more than common to gain some footing with them  it  behoved the province to exert itself  in order to prevent if possible any  alliance with its enemies          sidenote  governor glen holds a congress with the cherokees     accordingly  in       governor glen met the cherokee warriors in their  own country  with a view to purchase some lands from them  and  after the  usual ceremonies previous to such solemn treaties were over  the governor  sat down under a spreading tree  and chulochcullah being chosen speaker  for the cherokee nation  came and took his seat beside him  the other  warriors  about five hundred in number  stood around them in solemn  silence and deep attention  then the governor arose  and made a speech in  name of his king  representing his great power  wealth and goodness  and  his particular regard for his children the cherokees  he reminded them of  the happiness they had long enjoyed by living under his protection  and  added  that he had many presents to make them  and expected they would  surrender a share of their territories in return for them  he acquainted  them of the great poverty and wicked designs of the french  and hoped  they would permit none of them to enter their towns  he demanded lands to  build two forts in their country  to protect them against their enemies   and to be a retreat to their friends and allies  who furnished them with  arms  ammunition  hatchets  clothes  and every thing that they wanted     when the governor had finished his speech  chulochcullah arose  and  holding his bow in one hand  his shaft of arrows and other symbols used  by them on such occasions in the other  in answer spoke to the following  effect   what i now speak our father the great king should hear  we are  brothers to the people of carolina  one house covers us all   then taking  a boy by the hand he presented him to the governor  saying   we  our  wives and our children  are all children of the great king george  i have  brought this child  that when he grows up he may remember our agreement  on this day  and tell it to the next generation  that it may be known for  ever   then opening his bag of earth  and laying the same at the  governor s feet  he said   we freely surrender a part of our lands to the  great king  the french want our possessions  but we will defend them  while one of our nation shall remain alive   then shewing his bows and  arrow  he added   these are all the arms we can make for our defence  we  hope the king will pity his children the cherokees  and send us guns and  ammunition  we fear not the french  give us arms and we will go to war  against the enemies of the great king   then delivering the governor a  string of wampum in confirmation of what he had said  he added   my  speech is at an end  it is the voice of the cherokee nation  i hope the  governor will send it to the king  that it may be kept for ever           sidenote  and purchases a large tract of land from them     at this congress a territory of prodigious extent was ceded and  surrendered to the king  deeds of conveyance were drawn up  and formally  executed by their head men in name of the whole people  it contained not  only much rich land  but there the air was more serene  and the climate  more healthy  than in the maritime parts  it exhibited many pleasant and  romantic scenes  formed by an intermixture of beautiful hills  fruitful  vallies  rugged rocks  clear streams  and gentle water falls  the hills  were of a stiff and tenacious clay  but the vallies of a deep  fat mould   and were covered with perpetual verdure  the acquisition at that time was  so far of importance to carolina  as it removed the savages at a greater  distance from the settlements  and allowed the inhabitants liberty to  extend backwards  in proportion as their number increased          sidenote  forts built in defence of carolina     soon after the cession of these lands  governor glen built a fort about  three hundred miles from charlestown  afterwards called fort prince  george  which was situated on the banks of the river savanna  and within  gun shot of an indian town called keowee  this fort was made in the form  of a square  and had an earthen rampart about six feet high  on which  stockades were fixed  with a ditch  a natural glacis on two sides  and  bastions at the angles  on each of which four small cannon were mounted   it contained barracks for an hundred men  and was designed for a defence  to the western frontiers of the province  about an hundred and seventy  miles further down there was another strong hold  called fort moore  in a  beautiful commanding situation on the banks of the same river  in the  year following another fort was erected  called fort loudon  among the  upper cherokees  situated on tenassee river upwards of five hundred miles  distant from charlestown  to which place it was very difficult at all  times  but  in case of a war with the cherokees  utterly impracticable to  convey necessary supplies  these strong holds  together with those of  frederica and augusta in georgia  were garrisoned by his majesty s  independent companies of foot  stationed there for the protection of the  two provinces     after having fortified these frontiers  the settlers of carolina began to  stretch backward  and occupied lands above an hundred and fifty miles  from the shore  new emigrants from ireland  germany and the northern  colonies obtained grants in these interior parts  and introduced the  cultivation of wheat  hemp  flax and tobacco  for which the soil answered  better there than in the low lands nearer the sea  the cattle  sheep   hogs and horses multiplied fast  and having a country of vast extent to  range over  they found plenty of provisions in it through the whole year   from different parts new settlers were invited to those hilly and more  healthy parts of carolina  where they laboured with greater safety than  among the swamps  and success crowned their industry  by degrees public  roads were made  and they conveyed their produce in waggons to the  capital  where they found an excellent market for all their productions   but especially the provisions which they raised          sidenote  its excellent fruits and plants     although the soil and climate of the province suited the finest fruits  and vegetable productions  yet the garden had long been neglected  and  the orchard had engaged the attention only of a few  the people of  bermuda  not many years ago  carried to the market in charlestown  cabbages raised on that island  and the northern colonies their apples  and irish potatoes  but now the carolineans found  by chusing a spot of  land with judgment for the garden  that it would furnish them with all  necessaries of this kind  every spring and autumn brought them a crop of  european peas and beans  musk and water melons thrive exceedingly well  even on the sandy maritime islands  and arrive at a degree of perfection  unknown in many parts of europe  all kinds of sallad  such as lettuce   endive  cresses  parsley  radishes  onions  will grow there in all  seasons of the year  excepting one  and as nature has denied the people  this kind of nourishment during the summer months  it is probable it must  on that account be unwholesome  the garden also yielded abundance of  cabbages  brocoli  cauliflower  turnips  spinage  cucumbers  squashes   artichokes  pompions  asparagus    c   in great perfection  the climate  indeed refuses the people of carolina currants and gooseberries  as every  attempt to raise them has failed  but they have oranges  figs  peaches   apricots  nectarines and strawberries in plenty  which are exceedingly  agreeable and refreshing in the summer season  olives  grapes  cherries   citrons and plumbs will grow  though not cultivated in common  but  apples  pears  pomegranates  chesnuts and walnuts are  or at least may  be  raised in abundance  many physical roots and herbs  such as  china root  snake root  sassafras  are the spontaneous growth of the  woods  and sage  balm and rosemary thrive well in the gardens  the  planters distil brandy of an inferior quality from peaches  and gather  berries from the myrtle bushes of which they make excellent candles  the  woods will also supply them with a variety of cherries  mulberries  wild  grapes and nuts  in short  nature hath denied the diligent and skilful  planter few of the most useful vegetables  and many delicious fruits grow  to a degree of perfection exceeded by no country in europe     ar the same time it must be acknowledged  that some disadvantages attend  the climate with respect to the vegetable kingdom  european grapes have  been transplanted  and several attempts made to raise wine in carolina   but so overshaded are the vines planted in the woods  and so foggy is the  season of the year when they begin to ripen  that they seldom come to  maturity  but as excellent grapes have been raised in gardens where they  are exposed to the sun  we are apt to believe that proper methods have  not been taken for encouraging that branch of agriculture  considering  its great importance in a national view  some tolerable wine has been  made from the native vines  which do not ripen so early in the season as  those transplanted from europe  and perhaps in some future day  when the  planters have acquired greater skill  and made trials of different soils  and situations  the vineyard culture may succeed better than it has yet  done  and turn to some national account  like other profitable articles  of american husbandry     in some seasons the cold blast from the north west proves very  destructive to the orange  the olive and peach trees  in mild winters the  trees blossom early  sometimes by the beginning of february  often before  the middle of it  after the juices begin to rise  should the north west  wind bring a cold frosty night  it commonly kills every tender shoot   governor glen makes mention of a frost which happened on the  th of  february        which killed almost all the orange trees in the country   the trees being ready to blossom about the time the frost came  it burst  all their vessels  insomuch that not only the bark  but even the bodies  of many of them were split  and all on the side next the sun  such blasts  are incredibly sharp and piercing  the governor says he found several  birds frozen to death near his house  we cannot vouch for the truth of  this assertion  but we know no climate where the cold is more severely  felt by the human body          sidenote  its minerals undiscovered     with respect to the mineral kingdom we may say  who can tell what rich  mines lie hid in carolina  when no person has sought for them  if it be  true that mountainous countries are favorable to mines  it may be  presumed that this province  in which there are many extensive and high  mountains  is not without its hidden treasures  no more than the other  parts of the continent  pennsylvania hath already exhibited to the world  some useful minerals  and carolina in time will probably do the same  but  while the surface of the earth yields abundance of vegetable productions  for the use of the inhabitants  and a plentiful livelihood can be  obtained by easier means than that of digging into its bowels  it can  scarcely be expected that they will apply themselves to deep and  uncertain researches  it remains for a more populous and improved state   when ingenious men will probably attempt to explore those subterranean  riches  which as yet lie neglected  mineral water has been found in  several parts  and such springs will help both to lead men to the  important discovery  and animate them with the hopes of success     the province of georgia  with respect to improvement  still remained  little better than a wilderness  and the vast expence it had cost the  mother country might perhaps have been laid out to greater advantage in  other parts of the continent  in the government of that colony john  ellis  a fellow of the royal society  succeeded captain john reynolds   the rich swamps on the sides of the rivers lay uncultivated  and the  planters had not yet found their way into the interior parts of the  country  where the lands not only exceeded those in the maritime parts in  fertility  but where the climate was also more healthy and pleasant   excepting vagabonds and fraudulent debtors  who fled to them from  carolina  few of the georgians had any negroes to assist them in  cultivation  so that  in       the whole exports of the country were       barrels of rice       lb  of indigo      lib  of raw silk  which   together with skins  furs  lumber and provisions amounted only to         pounds sterling     although the hostilities which had commenced between great britain and  france still continued  yet both potentates remained averse from an open  declaration of war  william lyttleton  now lord westcot  being appointed  governor of south carolina  in his way through the bay of biscay  was  intercepted by a french squadron under the command of count de guay  and  carried into france  but an order from the french court came to release  the ship  and permit the governor to return to england  the british  commanders at sea indeed had orders to seize all french ships and bring  them into port  yet as some hopes of an accommodation still remained  the  crews were only confined  and the cargoes remained entire  but so soon as  the news of the bare faced invasions of our dominions in the  mediterranean  joined with the many encroachments in america  had reached  the british court  all prospects of an accommodation vanished at once   and war was publicly declared against france on the   th of may           before the end of that year william pitt  who had long been distinguished  in the house of commons for a bold and powerful orator  was called to the  helm  and to his uncommon popularity added the whole influence of  administration  after his preferment such bold plans of operation were  introduced to the council  as were calculated at once to rouze the  british nation and to alarm her enemies  the city of london  having the  greatest confidence in the spirit and abilities of the minister  poured  in its treasures to his assistance  and so great were his resources  that  his schemes  however vast  never failed for want of money  from this  period vigour and decision attended almost every warlike enterprize  a  martial spirit pervaded the navy and army  and every officer seemed  emulous of distinction and glory in the service of his country  this new  minister gave the enemy so much employment  that for the future they had  scarce time to breathe  and extended the powerful arm of britain from the  centre to the extremities of the empire     in america john earl of london had been appointed commander in chief  but  such was the state of affairs on that continent  that all he could do was  not sufficient to prevent the encroachments of the enemy  so disunited  were the provincials  and so different were their principles  views and  interests  that each colony seemed concerned only for its own defence   and determined to act independent of its neighbour  while the french were  firmly united under one commander in chief  the governor of canada  lord  loudon plainly saw that nothing remained for him to achieve  and  therefore pitched his camp at albany  and there determined to continue  with his little army on the defensive  until a reinforcement should  arrive from britain  the french still wore the laurel  and triumphed in  the forest  having every possible advantage their heart could desire from  the divided state of british america     but although the campaign under lord loudon was opened under many  disadvantages  this gallant officer was not idle during the year  having  made himself master of the state of affairs on the continent  he  perceived that the french  though united and strong  were nevertheless  vulnerable  and drew up a plan of operations for the ensuing campaign   which he transmitted to the minister in britain  immediately preparations  were made for carrying it into execution  it had been proposed to raise  some regiments in america  but the levies went on slowly  as many of the  colonists fit for service were foreigners  and only understood their  native language  it was thought proper to allow them foreign officers to  command them upon their taking the oaths to government  which contributed  not a little to the more speedy completion of the royal american  regiments      sidenote  the british forces augmented      early in the year following a considerable reinforcement from britain  arrived at new york  the indians in alliance with us were furnished with  arms  and encouraged to join the army  among the british forces sent out  there was a regiment of highlanders  who were in many respects well  qualified for the service  it is impossible to describe how much the  savages were delighted with the dress  manners and music of this  regiment  their sprightly manner of dancing  their dexterity in the use  of arms  and natural vivacity and intrepidity  the savages greatly  admired  and expressed a strong inclination for attending the scotch  warriors to the field  to prevent them from joining the enemy it was not  only necessity to employ those warriors  but it was thought they might be  rendered useful for scouring the dark thickets before the regular army   lieutenant kennedy  to encourage them  entered into their humour  and  in  order to head them  dressed and painted himself like an indian  they gave  him a squaw  and the nation to which she belonged having made him a king   no small service was expected from the new alliance          sidenote  their first success in america     when general abercrombie succeded lord loudon as commander in chief in  america  the british force being considerably augmented  bolder  enterprises were undertaken  it was agreed to attack the

canada  fort frontenac  next surrendered to colonel bradstreet  in which were found vast  quantities of provision and ammunition  that had been designed for the  french forces on the ohio  the great loss sustained by the enemy at this  place facilitated the reduction of fort duquesne  against which general  forbes was advancing with great vigilance and considerable force  this  fortress the enemy  after a few skirmishes  determined to abandon  and  having burnt their houses  and destroyed their works  fell down the ohio  river in boats to their strong holds erected beyond the cherokee  mountains  no sooner was the british flag erected on fort duquesne  than  the numerous tribes of indians came in and made their submission  and   from a conviction of the superior valour and strength of the british  army  joined the conquerors  although the enemy lost few men at this  place  yet their power in america received a heavy stroke by the division  of their force which the loss of it occasioned  all communication between  their settlements on the south parts and those of canada being cut off   they could no longer act in concert  and their future exertions were  rendered more

only from one place to  another  and the baleful influence of those active and enterprising  enemies soon appeared among the upper tribes of cherokees  an unfortunate  quarrel with the virginians helped to forward their designs  by opening  to them an easier access into the towns of the savages  in the different  expeditions against fort duquesne  the cherokees  agreeable to treaty   had sent considerable parties of warriors to the assistance of the  british army  as the horses in those parts run wild in the woods  it was  customary  both among indians and white people on the frontiers  to lay  hold on them and appropriate them to their own purposes  while the  savages were returning home through the back parts of virginia  many of  them having lost their horses  laid hold of such as came in their way   never imagining that they belonged to any individual in the province  the  virginians however  instead of asserting their right in a legal way   resented the injury by force of arms  and killed twelve or fourteen of  the unsuspicious warriors  and took several more prisoners  the  cherokees  with reason  were highly provoked at such ungrateful usage  from allies  whose frontiers they had helped to change from a field of  blood into peaceful habitations  and when they came home told what had  happened to their nation  the flame soon spread through the upper towns   and those who had lost their friends and relations were implacable  and  breathed nothing but fury and vengeance against such perfidious friends   in vain did the chieftains interpose their authority  nothing could  restrain the furious spirits of the young men  who were determined to  take satisfaction for the loss of their relations  the emissaries of  france among them added fuel to the flame  by telling them that the  english intended to kill every man of them  and make slaves of their  wives and children  they instigated them to bloodshed  and for that  purpose furnished them with arms and ammunition  the scattered families  on the frontiers of carolina lay much exposed to scalping parties of  these savages  who commonly make no distinction of age or sex  but pour  their vengeance indiscriminately on the innocent and guilty     the garrison of fort loudon  consisting of about two hundred men  under  the command of captains demere and stuart  first discovered the ill  humour in which the cherokee warriors returned from the northern  expedition  the soldiers  as usual  making excursions into the woods  to  hunt for fresh provisions  were attacked by them  and some of them were  killed  from this time such dangers threatened the garrison  that every  one was confined within the small boundaries of the fort  all  communication with the distant settlement from which they received  supplies being cut off  and the soldiers being but poorly provided  had  no other prospects left but those of famine or death  parties of young  indians took the field  and  rushing down

having received intelligence  of those acts of hostility  dispatched a messenger to charlestown to  inform governor lyttleton that the cherokees were gone to war  and that  it would be necessary speedily to warn the people of their danger  in  consequence of which orders were given to the commanders of the militia  immediately to collect their men  and stand in a posture of defence   while the governor was making preparations in charlestown for marching  against them  in order to give a speedy check to their progress  parties  of the independent companies were brought to charlestown for this  purpoise  the militia of the country had orders to rendezvous at  congarees  where the governor  with such a force as he could procure from  the lower parts  resolved to join them  and march to

chiefs set out for that place  in  order to settle all differences  and prevent if possible a war with the  carolineans  for although they could not restrain some of their young men  from acts of violence  yet the nation in general was still inclined to  friendship and peace  as they arrived at charlestown before the governor  had set out on the intended expedition  a council was called  and the  chiefs being sent for  mr  lyttleton  among other things  told them    that he was well acquainted with all the acts of hostility of which  their people had been guilty  and likewise those they intended against  the english  and enumerated some of them  then he added  that he would  soon be in their country  where he would let them know his demands  and  the satisfaction he required  which he would certainly take if they  refused it  as they had come to charlestown to treat with him as friends   they should go home in safety  and not a hair of their head should be  touched  but as he had many warriors in arms in different parts of the  province  he could not be answerable for what might happen to them unless  they marched along with his army   after this speech occonostota  who was  distinguished by the name of the great warrior of the cherokee nation   began to speak by way of reply  but the governor being determined that  nothing should prevent his military expedition  declared  he would hear  no talk he had to make  neither in vindication of his nation  nor any  proposals with regard to peace  lieutenant governor bull  who was better  acquainted with the manners of indians  and the dangers to which the  province would be exposed from a war with them  urged the necessity of  hearing the great warrior  and the happy consequences of an agreement  before more blood was spilt  but mr  lyttleton remained inflexible  and  put an end to the conference  with which behaviour the chiefs  however   were not a little displeased  for as they had travelled so far to obtain  peace  and  after all  to be not only denied liberty to speak  but also  to be disappointed with respect to the chief end of their journey   chagrined them much  and created many uneasy fears and suspicions          sidenote  governor lyttleton marches against the cherokees     a few days after holding this conference with the chieftains the governor  set out for congarees  the place of general rendezvous for the militia   and about one hundred and forty miles distant from charlestown  where he  mustered in all about one thousand four hundred men  to this place the  cherokees marched along with the army  and were to appearance contented   but in reality burning with fury and resentment  when the army moved from  the congarees  the chieftains  very unexpectedly  were all made  prisoners  and  to prevent their escape to the nation  a captain s guard  was mounted over them  and in this manner they were obliged to march to  fort prince george  being not only deprived of their liberty  which an  indian values above all things  but also compelled to accompany an enemy  going against their families and friends  they could now no longer  conceal their resentment  they turned exceedingly sullen  and shewed that  they were stung to the heart by such base treatment  the breach of  promise an indian holds an atrocious crime  to requite good intended with  real evil  they with reason deemed an unpardonable injury  but what  compleated the ill usage  the thirty two indians  upon the arrival of the  army at fort prince george  were all shut up in a hut scarcely sufficient

warrior hastened to his camp from an excursion  against the french  in which he had taken some prisoners  one of whom he  presented to the governor  mr lyttleton knew  that  for obtaining a  re establishment of peace  there was not a man in the whole nation better  disposed to assist him than this old warrior  though it was observed that  he cautiously avoided making any offer of satisfaction  but so small was  his influence among the cherokees at this time  that they considered him  as no better than an old woman on account of his attachment to their  english enemies  and his aversion from going to war against them          sidenote  his speech to attakullakulla     about the   th of december        the governor held a congress with this  warrior  and by an interpreter spoke to him to the following effect   you  told me yesterday that you had a good talk to make  and expected the same  from me  you know it is the will of the great king that his subjects and  your people should live together in friendship  and you have said you  desire not to break the chain thereof  it is a chain which our most  gracious sovereign holds at one end  and you hold at the other  you know  that  in order to keep this chain from contracting rust  and hinder it  from being broken  it was necessary certain conditions should be made   and as all acts of the great king are kept till time shall be no more  so  i now have in my hand those very conditions made with you and your  people  it was agreed  that if an indian should kill an englishman  he  shall be delivered up to be punished as the law requires  this was the  ancient talk of our fathers and your fathers  and when king george took  your nation under his protection he so ordered it for the future  this  treaty has been since renewed by several of our king s governors of this  province from time to time  it was the mercy of the great king that this  way of restitution should be established  to prevent a war which might  destroy your nation  whereas  at any time  by delivering up of the guilty  person  the innocent might escape  and your people be suffered to live in  friendship with ours      in the month of november        six deputies from your nation came to  charlestown  to make up all differences between our people and yours   they did then engage to observe the words of the treaty i have here  and  which you know are the same with those formerly made by the great king   they received a large quantity of goods as a full compensation for the  injuries done them by white people  and did solemnly promise to continue  in strict friendship with all the king s subjects  notwithstanding which  they went to statiquo under moytoy and killed many white men  though no  provocation had been given them  thereupon i demanded satisfaction   according to the words of the great king  but they have given me none  as  king gorge loves mercy better than war  i was willing to wait  and while  our people lay quietly in their houses  the indians came  killed and  scalped them  last of all they put to death three men in the upper  nation  and drove our people  who lived in their towns to furnish them  with goods  into the forts  as you know that your people have been guilty  of all these crimes  and many more  i expected you would not only come  down with a good talk  but also would have offered satisfaction for them   i am now come here with a great number of warriors  to take that  satisfaction i have more than once demanded  perhaps some of you thought   that  as our people put up with such injuries  they were apprehensive of  your power  but you shall now see that this was owing to their patience   and not to their want of resolution  you know well the strength of our  province  and that one third part of it is sufficient to destroy your  nation  besides  the white people in all the provinces are brothers  and  linked together  we come not alone against you because we have suffered   for the virginians and north carolineans are prepared to march against  you  unless satisfaction be given me  my brother the governor of georgia  will also prevent any ammunition from coming to you  some time ago you  sent to virginia  offering to trade with that province  and goods were on  their way to you which i have stopt and they shall not proceed hither  until i send directions for them  it is not necessary for me to say more  to you  until you make satisfaction for killing the white people      attakullakulla  you have been in england  and seen the power of the  great king  and the number of his warriors  you also know  that  during  these five years and more  we have been at war with the french  who were  once numerous over all parts of america  you know i disdain to tell you a  falsehood  and i will now inform you what success our army has had  some  of the last ships that arrived at charlestown brought me a good deal of  news  our fleet has taken many ships of war belonging to the french  a  messenger has arrived with an account that the great city of quebec is  reduced  as also  that the warriors of the great king have taken all the  forts on the lakes and upon the ohio  and beat down all things in their  way  as a hurricane would have done in its passage  the indians in those  parts  fearing his power  have made their peace with the great king  the  delawares  shawanese  and all of them that live near fort duquesne  have  desired to be in friendship with us  the choctaws also beg to be received  under the king s protection by his beloved man mr  aitken  upon which a  great number of traders are gone into their country with all sorts of  goods  if you will not believe what i say  and imagine that the french  are able to supply you with the necessaries which you want  you will be  deceived  for they themselves are starving  and so much undone that they  cannot furnish a blanket or a gun to the choctaws  much less to you  who  are removed at so great a distance from them      these things i have mentioned to show you that the great king will not  suffer his people to be destroyed without satisfaction  and to let you  know the people of this province are determined to have it  what i say is  with a merciful intention  if i make war with you  you will suffer for  your rashness  your men will be destroyed  and your women and children  carried into captivity  what few necessaries you now have will soon be  done  and you will get no more  but if you give the satisfaction i shall  ask  the trade will be again opened with you  and all things go right  i  have twice given you a list of the murderers  i will now tell you there  are twenty four men of your nation whom i demand to be delivered up to  me  to be put to death  or otherwise disposed of as i shall think fit   your people have killed that number of ours and more  therefore it is the  least i will accept of  i shall give you till to morrow morning to  consider of it  and then i shall expect your answer  you know best the  indians concerned  several gangs at different times have been out  and i  expect the twenty four you shall deliver up will be those who have  committed the murders           sidenote  attakullakulla s answer     to this long speech attakullakulla replied in words to the following  effect   that he remembered the treaties mentioned  as he had a share in  making them  he owned the kindness of the province of south carolina  but  complained much of the bad treatment his countrymen had received in  virginia  which  he said  was the immediate cause of our present  misunderstanding  that he had always been the firm friend of the english   of which he hoped his late fatiguing march against their enemies the  french was a sufficient proof  that he would ever continue such  and  would use all the influence he had to persuade his countrymen to give the  governor the satisfaction he demanded  though he believed it neither  would nor could be complied with  as they had no coercive authority one  over another  he desired the governor to release some of the head men  then confined in the fort to assist him  and added  that he was pleased  to hear of the successes of his brothers the english  but could not help  mentioning  that they shewed more resentment against the cherokees than  they had used to other nations that had disobliged them  that he  remembered some years ago several white people belonging to carolina were  killed by the choctaws  for whom no satisfaction had either been given or  demanded           sidenote  a treaty concluded with six chiefs     agreeable to the request of attakullakulla  the governor released  occonostota  fiftoe the chief man of keowee town  and the head warrior of  estaloe  who next day delivered up two indians  whom mr  lyttleton  ordered to be put in irons  after which all the cherokees present  who  knew their connections to be weak  being alarmed  fled out of the way  so  that it was impossible to complete the number demanded  attakullakulla   being then convinced that peace could not be obtained on such terms as  the governor required  resolved to go home and patiently wait the event   but no sooner was mr  lyttleton made acquainted with his departure  than  he dispatched a messenger after him to bring him back to his camp  and  being desirous of finishing the campaign with as much credit as possible   immediately on his return began to treat of peace  accordingly a treaty  was drawn up and signed by the governor and six of the head men  in which  it was agreed  that those twenty two chieftains of the cherokees should  be kept as hostages confined in the fort  until the same number of  indians guilty of murder be delivered up to the commander in chief of the  province  that trade should be opened and carried on as usual  that the  cherokees should kill  or take every frenchman prisoner  who should  presume to come into their nation during the continuance of the war  and  that they should hold no intercourse with the enemies of great britain   but should apprehend every person  white or red  found among them  that  may be endeavouring to set the english and cherokees at variance  and  interrupt the friendship and peace established between them     after having concluded this treaty with the cherokees  the governor  resolved to return to charlestown  but whether the indians who put their  mark to it understood the articles of agreement or not  we cannot pretend  to affirm  one thing is certain  that few or none of the nation afterward  paid the smallest regard to it  the treacherous act of confining their  chiefs  against whom no charge could be brought  and who had travelled  several hundred miles in order to obtain peace for their nation  had made  a strong impression on their minds  but particularly on that of  occonostota  who breathed nothing but fury and vengeance against such  false friends  instead of permitting them to return home without hurting  a hair of their head  as the governor promised in charlestown  they were  close confined in a miserable hut  having permission neither to see their  friends nor even the light of day  it was said they were kept only as  hostages  until the number of criminals he demanded was completed by  their nation  but if they were robbed of their liberty  it was of little  consequence to them under what denomination they were confined  it was  said to be done by the consent of the nation  as six of its chiefs had  signed the articles of peace  but in whatever light we view the act  it  appears to be one of those base and unjustifiable advantages which policy  and craft commonly take of the weakness and simplicity of more  unfortunate neighbours  and nothing less could have been expected  than  that these wild and independent warriors would resent such base and  unmerited usage on the first opportunity that offered          sidenote  the governor returns to charlestown     scarcely had governor lyttleton concluded the treaty of fort prince  george when the small pox  which was raging in an adjacent indian town   broke out in his camp  as few of his little army had ever gone through  that distemper  and as the surgeons were totally unprovided for such an  accident  his men were struck with terror  and in great haste returned to  the settlements  cautiously avoiding all intercourse one with another   and suffering much from hunger and fatigue by the way  the governor  followed them  and arrived in charlestown about the beginning of the year        though not a drop of blood had been spilt during the expedition  he  was received like a conqueror  with the greatest demonstrations of joy   addresses the most flattering were presented to him by the different  societies and professions  and bonefires and illuminations testified the  high sense the inhabitants entertained of his merit and services  and the  happy consequences which they believed would result from his expedition          sidenote  the treaty of peace broken    however  those rejoicings on account of the peace were scarcely over   when the news arrived that fresh hostilities hod been committed  and the  governor was informed that the cherokees had killed fourteen men within a  mile of fort prince george  the indians had contracted an invincible  antipathy to captain coytmore  the officer whom mr  lyttleton had left  commander of that fort  the treatment they had received at charlestown   but especially the imprisonment of their chiefs  had now converted their  former desire of peace into the bitterest rage for war  occonostota  a  chieftain of great influence  had become a most implacable and vindictive  enemy to carolina  and determined to repay treachery with treachery   having gathered a strong party of cherokees  he surrounded fort prince  george  and compelled the garrison to keep within their works  but  finding that he could make no impression on the fort  nor oblige the  commander to surrender  he contrived the following stratagem for the  relief of his countrymen confined in it          sidenote  occonostota s stratagem for killing the officer of the      fort     as that country was every where covered with woods  he placed a party of  savages in a dark thicket by the river side  and then sent an indian  woman  whom he knew to be always welcome at the fort  to inform the  commander that he had something of consequence to communicate to him  and  would be glad to speak with him at the river side  captain coytmore  imprudently consented  and without any suspicions of danger walked down  towards the river  accompanied by lieutenants bell and foster   occonostota appearing on the opposite side  told him he was going to  charlestown to procure a release of the prisoners  and would he glad of a  white man to accompany him as a safeguard  and  the better to cover his  dark design  had a bridle in his hand  and added  he would go and hunt  for a horse to him  the captain replied  that he should have a guard  and  wished he might find a horse  as the journey was very long  upon which  the indian  turning quickly about  swung the bridle thrice round his  head  as a signal to the savages placed in ambush  who instantly fired on  the officers  shot the captain dead on the spot  and wounded the other  two  in consequence of which orders were given to put the hostages in  irons  to prevent any farther danger from them  but while the soldiers  were attempting to execute their orders  the indians stabbed the first  man who had hold of them with a knife  and wounded two more  upon which  the garrison  exasperated to the highest degree  fell on the unfortunate  hostages  and butchered them in a manner too shocking to relate          sidenote  the war becomes general     there were few men in the cherokee nation that did not lose a friend or a  relation by this massacre  and therefore with one voice all immediately  declared for war  the leaders in every town seized the hatchet  telling  their followers that the spirits of murdered brothers were flying around  them  and calling out for vengeance on their enemies  from the different  towns large parties of warriors took the field  painted in the most  formidable manner  and arrayed with all their instruments of death  all  sang the song of war  and burning with impatience to imbrue their hands  in the blood of their enemies  rushed down among innocent and defenceless  families on the frontiers of carolina  where men  women and children   without distinction  fell a sacrifice to their merciless fury  such as  fled to the woods  and escaped the scalping knife  perished with hunger   and those whom they made prisoners were carried into the wilderness   where they suffered inexpressible hardships  every day brought fresh  accounts to the capital of their ravages  murders and desolations  but  while the back settlers impatiently looked to their governor for relief   the small pox raged to such a degree in town  that few of the militia  could be prevailed on to leave their distressed families to serve the  public  in this extremity an express was sent to general amherst  the  commander in chief in america  acquainting him with the deplorable  situation of the province  and imploring his assistance in the most  pressing terms  accordingly a battalion of highlanders  and four  companies of the royal scots  under the command of colonel montgomery   now earl of eglinton  were ordered immediately to embark  and sail for  the relief of carolina     in the mean time william lyttleton being appointed governor of jamaica   the charge of the province devolved on william bull  a man of great  integrity and erudition  application was made to the neighbouring  provinces of north carolina and virginia for relief  and seven troops of  rangers were raised to patrole the frontiers  and prevent the savages  from penetrating farther down among the settlements  a considerable sum  was voted for presents to such of the creeks  chickesaws and catabaws as  should join the province and go to war against the cherokees  provisions  were sent to the families that had escaped to augusta and fort moore  and  the best preparations possible made for chastising their enemy  so soon  as the

monk s corner  great was the joy of the province upon the  arrival of this gallant officer  but as the conquest of canada was the  grand object of this year s campaign in america  he had orders to strike  a sudden blow for the relief of carolina  and return to head quarters at  albany without loss of time  nothing was therefore omitted that was  judged necessary to forward the expedition  several gentlemen of fortune   excited by a laudable zeal for the safety of their country  formed  themselves into a company of volunteers  and joined the army  the whole  force of the province was collected  and ordered to rendezvous at  congarees  waggons  carts and horses were impressed for the service of  his majesty  and the colonists flattered themselves with the hopes that  they would now be able to punish the insolence of their barbarous  enemies          sidenote  and marches against the cherokees     a few weeks after his arrival colonel montgomery marched to the  congarees  where he was joined by the internal strength of the province   and immediately set out for the cherokee country  for a guide he was  provided with an half blooded indian  who was well acquainted with the  roads though the woods  and the passages through the rivers  having  little time allowed him  his march was uncommonly spirited and  expeditious  after reaching a place called twelve mile river  he encamped  on an advantageous ground  and marched with a party of his men in the  night to surprize estatoe  an indian town about twenty miles from his  camp  the first noise he heard by the way was the barking of a dog before  his men  where he was informed there was an indian town called little  keowee  which he ordered the light infantry to surround  and  except  women and children  to put every indian in it to the sword  having done  this piece of service  he proceeded to estatoe  which he found abandoned  by all the savages  excepting a few who had not had time to make their  escape  this town  which consisted of at least two hundred houses  and  was well provided with corn  hogs  poultry  and ammunition  he reduced to  ashes  sugar town  and every other settlement in the lower nation   afterwards shared the same fate  the surprize to every one of them was  nearly equal  for as the army darted upon them like lightning  the  savages could scarcely save themselves  far less any little property that  they had  in these lower towns about sixty indians were killed and forty  made prisoners  and the rest driven to seek for shelter among the  mountains  having finished his business among these lower settlements  with the small loss of three or four men  he then marched to the relief  of fort prince george  which had been for some time invested by savages   insomuch that no soldier durst venture beyond the bounds of the fort  and  where the garrison was in distress  not for the want of provisions  but  of wood to prepare them          sidenote  chastises them near

peace they might obtain it  as  the former friends and allies of britain  at the same time he sent a  messenger to fort loudon  requesting captains demere and stuart  the  commanding officers at that place  to use their best endeavours for  obtaining peace with the cherokees in the upper towns  colonel montgomery  finding that the savages were as yet disposed to listen to no terms of  accommodation  determined to carry the chastisement a little farther   dismal was the wilderness into which he entered  and many were the  hardships and dangers he had to encounter  from dark thickets  rugged  paths  and narrow passes  in which a small body of men  properly posted   might harass and tire out the bravest army that ever took the field   having on all hands suspicious grounds  he found occasion for constant  vigilance and circumspection  while he was piercing through the thick  forest he had numberless difficulties to surmount  particularly from  rivers fordable only at one place  and overlooked by high banks on each  side  where an enemy might attack him with advantage  and retreat with  safety  when he had advanced within five miles of etchoe  the nearest  town in the middle settlements  he found there a low valley  covered so  thick with bushes that the soldiers could scarcely see three yards before  them  and in the middle of which there was a muddy river  with steep clay  banks  through this dark place  where it was impossible for any number of  men to act together  the army must necessarily march  and therefore  captain morison  who commanded a company of rangers  well acquainted with  the woods  had orders to advance and scour the thicket  he had scarcely  entered it  when a number of savages sprung from their lurking den  and  firing on them  killed the captain and wounded several of his party  upon  which the light infantry and grenadiers were ordered to advance and  charge the invisible enemy  which they did with great courage and  alacrity  a heavy fire then began on both sides  and during some time the  soldiers could only discover the places where the savages were hid by the  report of their guns  colonel montgomery finding that the number of  indians that guarded this place was great  and that they were determined  obstinately to dispute it  ordered the royal scots  who were in the rear   to advance between the savages and a rising ground on the right  while  the highlanders marched towards the left to sustain the light infantry  and grenadiers  the woods now resounded with horrible shouts and yells   but these  instead of intimidating the troops  seemed rather to inspire  them with double firmness and resolution  at length the savages gave way   and in their retreat falling in with the royal scots  suffered  considerably before they got out of their reach  by this time the royals  being in the front and the highlanders in the rear  the enemy stretched  away and took possession of a hill  seemingly disposed to keep at a  distance  and always retreating as the army advanced  colonel montgomery  perceiving that they kept aloof  gave orders to the line to face about   and march directly for the town of etchoe  the enemy no sooner observed  this movement  than they got behind the hill  and ran to alarm their  wives and children  during the action  which lasted above an hour   colonel montgomery  who made several narrow escapes  had twenty men  killed  and seventy six wounded  what number the enemy lost is uncertain   but some places were discovered into which they had thrown several of  their slain  from which it was conjectured that they must have lost a  great number  as it is a custom among them to carry their dead off the  field  upon viewing the ground  all were astonished to see with what  judgment and skill they had chosen it  scarcely could the most  experienced officer have fixed upon a spot more advantageous for  way laying and attacking an enemy  according to the method of fighting  practised among the indian nations          sidenote  and returns to fort prince george     this action  though it terminated much in favour of the british army  had  nevertheless reduced it to such a situation as made it very imprudent  if  not altogether impracticable  to penetrate farther into those woods  the  repulse was far from being decisive  for the enemy had only retired from  one to another advantageous situation  in order to renew their attack  when the army should again advance  humanity would not suffer the  commander to leave so many wounded men exposed to the vengeance of  savages  without any strong hold in which he might lodge them  or some  detachment  which he could not spare  to protect them  should he proceed  farther  he saw plainly that he must expect frequent skirmishes  which  would increase the number  and the burning of so many indian towns would  be a poor compensation for the great risque and perhaps wanton sacrifice  of so many valuable lives  to furnish horses for the men already wounded  obliged him to throw so many bags of flour into the river  and what  remained was no more than sufficient for his army during their return to  fort prince george  orders were therefore given for a retreat  which was  made with great regularity  although the enemy continued hovering around  them  and annoying them to the utmost of their power  a large train of  wounded men was brought above sixty miles through a hazardous country in  safety  for which no small share of honour and praise was due to the  officer that conducted the retreat  never did men endure greater  hardships and fatigues with fewer complaints than this little army during  the expedition  such confidence did they repose in their leader  that  they seemed to despise all difficulties and dangers which he shared along  with them in the service of their king and country          sidenote  the consternation of the inhabitants from indians     after colonel montgomery had returned to the settlements  and was  preparing to embark for new york  agreeable to his orders from general  amherst  the carolineans were again thrown under the most dreadful  apprehensions from the dangers which hung over the province  this appears  from the following address of the general assembly  presented to  lieutenant governor bull on the   th of july         we  his majesty s  most dutiful and loyal subjects  the commons house of assembly of this  province  return your honour our sincere thanks for the advices you have  been pleased to communicate to us in the morning  and being deeply  affected with the contents of colonel grant s letter  which imports  that  colonel montgomery will soon embark with his majesty s troops under his  command to join general amherst  humbly beg leave to represent to your  honour  that we apprehend the province to be in a much more dangerous  situation at this juncture  than it was at the time when the said troops  arrived here  as the upper creek indians have since murdered several  english traders in their towns  and made no offer to give up the  murderers  or make any other satisfaction whatever  whence we have the  greatest reason to believe they will soon break out into open war  and by  what is mentioned in colonel grant s letter  we fear that our implacable  enemies the french have already spirited up and prevailed with the  choctaws to assist the cherokees against us  and notwithstanding the  present rupture with the cherokees has cost the province  in less than  nine months  near        pounds sterling  yet all our endeavours to raise  a number of forces capable of preventing the cherokees from ravaging the  back settlements have proved ineffectual  this being the situation of the  province when we had only the cherokees to contend with  how deplorable  then must our case be  should colonel montgomery depart with the king s  troops under his command  and we have the united attacks of the  cherokees  creeks and choctaws   the three most powerful nations of  indians on the continent   to repel  can be better imagined than  described  being truely sensible of your honour s good inclinations to  render every service in your power to this province  we unanimously  intreat your honour to use the most pressing instances with colonel  montgomery not to depart with the king s troops  as it may be attended  with the most pernicious consequences   accordingly the  lieutenant governor having given the colonel the fullest view of those  extensive dangers to which the province after his departure would be  exposed  prevailed with him to leave four companies of the royal  regiment  under the command of major frederick hamilton  for covering the  frontiers  while he embarked with the battalion of highlanders  and  sailed for new york          sidenote  great distress of the garrison at fort loudon        sidenote  the terms obtained for the garrison     in the mean time the distant garrison of fort loudon  consisting of two  hundred men  was reduced to the dreadful alternative of perishing by  hunger or submitting to the mercy of the enraged cherokees  the governor  having information that the virginians had undertaken to relieve it  for  a while seemed satisfied  and anxiously waited to hear the news of that  happy event  but the virginians were equally ill qualified with their  neighbours of carolina to send them any assistance  so remote was the  fort from every settlement  and so difficult was it to march an army  through the barren wilderness  where the various thickets were lined with  enemies  and to carry at the same time sufficient supplies along with  them  that the virginians had dropped all thoughts of the attempt   provisions being entirely exhausted at fort loudon  the garrison was  reduced to the most deplorable situation  for a whole month they had no  other subsistence but the flesh of lean horses and dogs  and a small  supply of indian beans  which some friendly cherokee women procured for  them by stealth  long had the officers endeavoured to animate and  encourage the men with the hopes of relief  but now being blockaded night  and day by the enemy  and having no resource left  they threatened to  leave the fort  and die at once by the hands of savages  rather than  perish slowly by famine  in this extremity the commander was obliged to  call a council of war  to consider what was proper to be done  when the  officers were all of opinion that it was impossible to hold out any  longer  and therefore agreed to surrender the fort to the cherokees on  the best terms that could be obtained from them  for this purpose captain  stuart  an officer of great sagacity and address  and much beloved by all  the indians that remained in the british interest  procured leave to go  to chote  one of the principal towns in the neighbourhood  where he  obtained the following terms of capitulation  which were signed by the  commanding officer and two of the cherokee chiefs   that the garrison of  fort loudon march out with their arms and drums  each soldier having as  much powder and ball as their officer shall think necessary for their  march  and all the baggage they may chuse to carry  that the garrison be  permitted to march to virginia  or fort prince george  as the commanding  officer shall think proper  unmolested  and that a number of indians be  appointed to escort them  and hunt for provisions during their march   that such soldiers as are lame  or by sickness disabled from marching  be  received into the indian towns  and kindly used until they recover  and  then be allowed to return to fort prince george  that the indians do  provide for the garrison as many horses as they conveniently can for  their march  agreeing with the officers and soldiers for payment  that  the fort great guns  powder  ball  and spare arms  be delivered to the  indians without fraud or further delay  on the day appointed for the  march of the troops           sidenote  treacherously broken by the savages     agreeable to those terms stipulated  the garrison delivered up the fort   and marched out with their arms  accompanied by occonostota  judd s  friend  the prince of chote  and several other indians  and that day went  fifteen miles on their way to fort prince george  at night they encamped  on a plain about two miles from taliquo  an indian town  when all their  attendants  upon one pretence or another  left them  which the officers  considered as no good sign  and therefore placed a strict guard round  their camp  during the night they remained unmolested  but next morning  about break of day a soldier from an out post came running in  and  informed them that he saw a vast number of indians  armed  and painted in  the most dreadful manner  creeping among the bushes  and advancing in  order to surround them  scarcely had the officer time to order his men to  stand to their arms  when the savages poured in upon them a heavy fire  from different quarters  accompanied with the most hideous yells  which  struck a panic into the soldiers  who were so much enfeebled and  dispirited that they were incapable of making any effectual resistance   captain demere  with three other officers  and about twenty five private  men  fell at the first onset  some fled into the woods  and were  afterwards taken prisoners and confined among the towns in the valley   captain stuart  and those that remained  were seized  pinioned  and  brought back to fort loudon  no sooner had attakullakulla heard that his  friend mr  stuart had escaped  than he hastened to the fort  and  purchased him from the indian that took him  giving him his rifle   clothes  and all he could command  by way of ransom  he then took  possession of captain demere s house  where he kept his prisoner as one  of his family  and freely shared with him the little provisions his table  afforded  until a fair opportunity should offer for rescuing him from  their hands  but the poor soldiers were kept in a miserable state of  captivity for some time  and then redeemed by the province at a great  expence          sidenote  a proposal for attacking fort prince george     during the time these prisoners were confined at fort loudon  occonostota  formed a design of attacking fort prince george  and for this purpose  dispatched a messenger to the settlements in the valley  requesting all  the warriors there to join him at stickoey old town  by accident a  discovery was made of ten bags of powder  and ball in proportion  which  the officers had secretly buried in the fort  to prevent their falling  into the enemy s hands  this discovery had nearly proved fatal to captain  stuart  and would certainly have cost him his life  had not the  interpreter had so much presence of mind as to assure the enemy that  these warlike stores had been concealed without his knowledge or consent   the indians having now abundance of ammunition for the siege  a council  was called at chote  to which the captain was brought  and put in mind of  the obligations he lay under to them for sparing his life  and as they  had resolved to carry six cannon and two cohorns with them against fort  prince george  to be managed by men under his command  they told him he  must go and write such letters to the commandant as they should dictate  to him  they informed him at the same time  that if that officer should  refuse to surrender  they were determined to burn the prisoners one after  another before his face  and try if he could be so obstinate as to hold  out while he saw his friends expiring in the flames  captain stuart was  much alarmed at his situation  and from that moment resolved to make his  escape or perish in the attempt  his design he privately communicated to  attakullakulla  and told him how uneasy he was at the thoughts of being  compelled to bear arms against his countrymen  he acknowledged that he  had always been a brother  and hoped he would assist him to get out of  his present perilous circumstances  the old warrior  taking him by the  hand  told him he was his friend  he had already given one proof of his  regard  and intended to give another so soon as his brother should return  and help him to concert the measure  he said he was well apprized of the  ill designs of his countrymen  and should he go and persuade the garrison  of fort prince george to do as he had done  what could he expect but that  they should share the same dismal fate  strong and uncultivated minds  carry their friendship  as well as their enmity  to an astonishing pitch   among savages family friendship is a national virtue  and civilized  mortals may blush when they consider how much barbarians have often  surpassed them in the practice of it  the instance i am going to relate  is as singular and memorable as many that have been recorded in the  annals of past ages          sidenote  captain stuart escapes to virginia     attakullakulla claimed captain stuart as his prisoner  and had resolved  to deliver him from danger and for this purpose there was no time to be  lost  accordingly he gave out among his countrymen that he intended to go  a hunting for a few days  and carry his prisoner along with him to eat  venison  of which he declared he was exceedingly fond  at the same time  the captain went through among his soldiers  telling them that they could  never expect to be ransomed by the province  if they gave the smallest  assistance to the indians against fort prince george  having settled all  matters  they set out on their journey  accompanied by the warrior s  wife  his brother  and two soldiers  who were the only persons in the  garrison that knew how to convey great guns through the woods  for  provisions they depended on what they might kill by the way  the distance  to the frontier settlements was great  and the utmost expedition  necessary to prevent any surprize from indians pursuing them  nine days  and nights did they travel through a dreary wilderness  shaping their  course by the light of the sun and moon for virginia  and traversing many  hills  valleys and paths that had never been crossed before but by  savages and wild beasts  on the tenth they arrived at the banks of  holston s river  where they fortunately fell in with a party of three  hundred men  sent out by colonel bird for the relief of such soldiers as  might make their escape that way from fort loudon  on the fourteenth day  the captain reached colonel bird s camp on the frontiers of virginia   where having loaded his faithful friend with presents and provisions  he  sent him back to protect the unhappy prisoners till they should be  ransomed  and to exert his influence among the cherokees for the  restoration of peace     no sooner had captain stuart made his escape from the hands of the  savages  than he immediately began to concert ways and means for the  relief of his garrison  an express was dispatched to lieutenant governor  bull  informing him of the sad disaster that had happened to the garrison  of fort loudon  and of the designs of the enemy against fort prince  george  in consequence of which orders were given to major thomson  who  commanded the militia on the frontiers  to throw in provisions for ten  weeks into that fort  and warn the commanding officer of his danger  at  the same time a messenger was sent to attakullakulla desiring him to  inform the cherokees that fort george was impregnable  having vast  quantities of powder buried under ground every where around it  to blow  up all enemies that should attempt to come near it  presents of  considerable value were sent to redeem the prisoners at fort loudon  a  few of whom had by this time made their escape  and afterwards not only  those that were confined among the towns in the valley  but also all that  had survived the hardships of hunger  disease and captivity in the upper  towns were released  and delivered up to the commanding officer at fort  prince george          sidenote  the war continues     it might now have been expected that the vindictive spirit of the savages  would be satisfied  and that they would he disposed to listen to some  terms of accommodation  this treacherous conduct to the soldiers at fort  loudon  they intended as a satisfaction for the harsh treatment their  relations had met with at fort prince george  and dearly had the province  paid for the base imprisonment and horrid massacre of the chiefs at that  place  still  however  a great majority of the nation spurned at every  offer of peace  the lower towns had all been destroyed by colonel  montgomery  the warriors in the middle settlements had lost many friends  and relations  and several frenchmen had crept in among the uppertowns   and helped to foment their ill humour against carolina  lewis latinac  a  french officer  was among them  and proved an indefatigable instigator to  mischief  he persuaded the indians that the english had nothing less in  view than to exterminate them from the face of the earth  and  furnishing  them with arms and ammunition  urged them on to war  at a great meeting  of the nation he pulled out his hatchet  and  striking it into a log of  wood  called out  who is the man that will take this up for the king of  france  saloue  the young warrior of estatoe  instantly laid hold of it   and cried out   i am for war  the spirits of our brothers who have been  slain still call upon us to avenge their death  he is no better than a  woman that refuses to follow me   many others seized the tomahawk  yet  dyed in british blood  and burnt with impatience for the field          sidenote  the highlanders return to carolina     under the flattering appearance of a calm were those clouds again  gathering  however  lieutenant governor bull  who knew well how little  indians were to be trusted on any occasion  kept the royal scots and  militia on the frontiers in a posture of defence  but finding the  province still under the most dreadful apprehensions from their savage  neighbours  who continued insolent and vindictive  and ready to renew  their ravages and murders  he made application a second time to general  amherst for assistance  canada being now reduced  the commander in chief  could the more easily spare a force adequate to the purpose intended  the  brave colonel montgomery  who conducted the former expedition  having by  this time embarked for england  the command of the highlanders devolved  on lieutenant colonel james grant  who received orders to return to the  relief of carolina  early in the year      he landed at charlestown   where he took up his winter quarters  until the proper season should  approach for taking the field  unfortunately during this time many of the  soldiers  by drinking brackish water  were taken sick  which afforded the  inhabitants an opportunity of showing their kindness and humanity  they  considered themselves  and with reason  under the strongest obligations  to treat men with tenderness  who came to protect them against their  enemies  and therefore they brought the sick soldiers into their houses   and nursed them with the greatest care and attention     in this campaign the province determined to exert itself to the utmost   that  in conjunction with the regular forces  a severe correction might  be given to those troublesome savages  for this purpose a provincial  regiment was raised  and the command of it given to colonel middleton   presents were provided for the indian allies  and several of the  chickesaws and catabaws engaged to assist them against the cherokees  but  the creeks  whose help was also strongly solicited  played an artful game  between the english and the french  and gave the one or the other  encouragement  according to the advantages they reaped from them  all  possible preparations were made for supplying the army with provisions at  different stages  and with such carts and horses as were thought  necessary to the expedition  great had been the expence which this  quarrel with the cherokees had already occasioned  now they flattered  themselves that by one resolute exertion more they would tire the savages  of war  and oblige them to accept of such terms of peace as they thought  proper to dictate     as all white men in the province  of the military age  were soldiers as  well as citizens  and trained in some measure to the use of arms  it was  no difficult matter to complete the provincial regiment  their names  being registered in the list of militia  on every emergency they were  obliged to be ready for defence  not only against the incursions of  indians  but also against the insurrection of negroes  and although the  same prompt obedience to orders could not be expected from them that is  necessary in a regular army  yet the provincials had other advantages  which compensated for that defect  they were better acquainted than  strangers with the woods  and the nature of that country in which their  military service was required  they were seasoned to the climate  and had  learned from experience what clothes  meat and drink were most proper to  enable them to do their duty  in common occasions  when the militia was  called out  the men received no pay  but when employed  as in this  cherokee war  for the public defence  they were allowed the same pay with  the king s forces          sidenote  colonel grant marches against the cherokees     so soon as the highlanders had recovered from their sickness  and were in  a condition to take the field  colonel grant began his march for the  cherokee territories  after being joined by the provincial regiment and  indian allies  he mustered in all about two thousand six hundred men   having served some years in america  and been in several engagements with  indians  he was now no stranger to their methods of making war  he was  sensible how ready they were to take all advantages  by surprize   stratagem  or otherwise  that the nature of their country afforded them   caution and vigilance were not only necessary on his part  but  to  prepare an army for such services  the dress  the arms  and discipline   should all be adapted to the nature of the country  in order to give the  men every advantage  according to the indian manner of attack  the eye  should be habituated to perpetual watchfulness  the body should be  clothed in green  the prevailing colour of the woods  that it may be  difficult to distinguish it  and equipped in such light armour as is  easiest managed in a thicket  the feet and legs should be fortified  against prickly briers and bushes  and those men who have been accustomed  to hunt in the woods  being quick sighted  are best qualified for  scouring the dark thickets  and for guards to the main body  europeans   who are strangers to such things  are ill prepared for military services  in america  many brave officers have suffered by inattention to them  and  being ignorant of the peculiar circumstances of the country  have fallen  a sacrifice to their own rashness  or the numberless snares to which they  are exposed in it     on the   th of may        colonel grant arrived at fort prince george   and attakullakulla  having got information that he was advancing against  his nation with a formidable army  hastened to his camp  to signify his  earnest desire of peace  he told the colonel that he always had been  and  ever would continue to be  a firm friend to the english  that the  outrages of his countrymen covered him with shame  and filled his heart  with grief  yet nevertheless he would gladly interpose in their behalf   in order to bring about an accommodation  often  he said  had he been  called an old woman by the mad young men of his nation  who delighted in  war and despised his counsels  often had he endeavoured to get the  hatchet buried  and the former good correspondence with the carolineans  established  now he was determined to set out for the cherokee towns  to  persuade them to consult their safety  and speedily agree to terms of  peace  and again and again begged the colonel to proceed no farther until  he returned          sidenote  engages and defeats them        sidenote  defeats them and destroys their towns       colonel grant  however  gave him no encouragement to expect that his  request could be granted  but  on the  th of june  began his march from  fort prince george  carrying with him provisions to the army for thirty  days  a party of ninety indians  and thirty woodmen painted like indians   under the command of captain quintine kennedy  had orders to march in  front and scour the woods  after them the light infantry and about fifty  rangers  consisting in all of about two hundred men  followed  by whose  vigilance and activity the commander imagined that the main body of the  army might be kept tolerably quiet and secure  for three days he made  forced marches  in order to get over two narrow and dangerous defiles   which he accomplished without a shot from the enemy  but which might have  cost him dear  had they been properly guarded and warmly disputed  on the  day following he found suspicious ground on all hands  and therefore  orders were given for the first time to load and prepare for action  and  the guards to march slowly forward  doubling their vigilance and  circumspection  as they frequently spied indians around them  all were  convinced that they should that day have an engagement  at length  having  advanced near to the place where colonel montgomery was attacked the year  before  the indian allies in the van guard  about eight in the morning   observed a large body of cherokees posted upon a hill on the right flank  of the army  and gave the alarm  immediately the savages  rushing down   began to fire on the advanced guard  which being supported  the enemy  were repulsed  and recovered their heights  under this hill the line was  obliged to march a considerable way  on the left there was a river  from  the opposite banks of which a large party of indians fired briskly on the  troops as they advanced  colonel grant ordered a party to march up the  hill and drive the enemy from the heights  while the line faced about and  gave their whole charge to the indians that annoyed them from the side of  the river  the engagement became general  and the savages seemed  determined obstinately to dispute the lower grounds  while those on the  hill were dislodged only to return with redoubled ardour to the charge   the situation of the troops was in several respects deplorable  fatigued  by a tedious march  in rainy weather  surrounded with woods  so that they  could not discern the enemy  galled by the scattered fire of savages  who  when pressed always kept aloof  but rallied again and again  and returned  to the ground  no sooner did the army gain an advantage over them in one  quarter  than they appeared in another  while the attention of the  commander was occupied in driving the enemy from their lurking place on  the river s side  the rear was attacked  and so vigorous an effort made  for the flour and cattle  that he was obliged to order a party back to  the relief of the rear guard  from eight o clock in the morning until  eleven the savages continued to keep up an irregular and incessant fire   sometimes from one place and sometimes from another  while the woods  resounded with hideous shouts and yells  to intimidate the troops  at  length the cherokees gave way  and  being pursued for some time  popping  shots continued till two o clock  when they disappeared  what loss the  enemy sustained in this action we have not been able to learn  but of  colonel grant s army there were between fifty and sixty men killed and  wounded  and it is probable the loss of the savages could not be much  greater  and perhaps not so great  owing to their manner of fighting   orders were given not to bury the slain  but to sink them in the river   to prevent their being dug up from their graves and scalped  to provide  horses for those that were wounded  several bags of flour were thrown  into the river  after which the army proceeded to etchoe  a pretty large  indian town  which they reached about midnight  and next day reduced to  ashes  every other town in the middle settlements  fourteen in number   shared the same fate  their magazines and corn fields were likewise  destroyed  and those miserable savages  with their families  were driven  to seek for shelter and provisions among the barren mountains     it would be no easy matter to describe the various hardships which this  little army endured in the wilderness  from heat  thirst  watching   danger and fatigue  thirty days did colonel grant continue in the heart  of the cherokee territories  and  upon his return to fort prince george   the feet and legs of many of his army were so mangled  and their strength  and spirits so much exhausted  that they were utterly unable to march  farther  he resolved therefore to encamp at that place for a while  both  to refresh his men and wait the resolutions of the cherokees  in  consequence of the heavy chastisement which they had received  besides  the numberless advantages their country afforded for defence  it was  supposed that some french officers had been among them  and given them  all the assistance in their power  it is true the savages supported their  attack for some hours with considerable spirit  but being driven from  their advantageous posts and thickets they were wholly disconcerted  and  though the repulse was far from being decisive  yet after this engagement  they returned no more to the charge  but remained the tame spectators of  their towns in flames  and their country laid desolate     such engagements in europe would be considered as trifling skirmishes   scarcely worthy of relation  but in america a great deal is often  determined by them  it is no easy matter to describe the distress to  which the savages were reduced by this severe correction  even in time of  peace they are destitute of that foresight  in a great measure  which  provides for future events  but in time of war  when their villages are  destroyed and their fields laid desolate  they are reduced to extreme  want  being driven to the barren mountains  the hunters furnished with  ammunition might indeed make some small provision for themselves  but  women  children  and old men  must perish  being deprived of the means of  subsistence          sidenote  peace with the cherokees    a few days after colonel grant s arrival at fort prince george   attakullakulla  attended by several chieftains  came to his camp  and  expressed a desire of peace  severely had they suffered for breaking  their alliance with britain  and giving ear to the deceitful promises of  france  convinced at last of the weakness and perfidy of the french  who  were neither able to assist them in time of war  nor supply their wants  in time of peace  they resolved to renounce all connection with them for  ever  accordingly terms of peace were drawn up and proposed  which were  no less honourable to colonel grant than advantageous to the province   the different articles being read and interpreted  attakullakulla agreed  to them all excepting one  by which it was demanded  that four cherokee  indians be delivered up to colonel grant at fort prince george  to be put  to death in the front of his camp  or four green scalps be brought to him  in the space of twelve nights  the warrior having no authority from his  nation  declared he could not agree to this article  and therefore the  colonel sent him to charlestown  to see whether the lieutenant governor  would consent to mitigate the rigour of it     accordingly attakullakulla and the other chieftains  being furnished with  a safeguard  set out for charlestown to hold a conference with mr  bull   who  on their arrival  called a council to meet at ashley ferry  and then  spoke to the following effect   attakullakulla  i am glad to see you  and  as i have always heard of your good behaviour  that you have been a good  friend to the english  i take you by the hand  and not only you but all  those with you also  as a pledge for their security whilst under my  protection  colonel grant acquaints me that you have applied for peace   now that you are come  i have met with my beloved men to hear what you  have to say  and my ears are open for that purpose   then a fire was  kindled  the pipe of peace was lighted  and all smoked together for some  time in great silence and solemnity     then attakullakulla arose  and addressed the lieutenant governor and  council to the following effect   it is a great while since i last saw  your honour  now i am glad to see you  and all the beloved men present  i  am come to you as a messenger from the whole nation  i have now seen you   smoked with you  and hope we shall live together as brothers   when i  came to keowee  colonel grant sent me to you  you live at the water side   and are in light  we are in darkness  but hope all will be yet clear with  us   i have been constantly going about doing good  and though i am  tired  yet i am come to see what can be done for my people  who are in  great distress   here he produced the strings of wampum he had received  from the different towns  denoting their earnest desire of peace  and  then added   as to what has happened  i believe it has been ordered by  our father above   we are of a different colour from the white  people  they are superior to us  but one god is father of all  and we  hope what is past will be forgotten   god almighty made all people  there  is not a day but some are coming into  and others are going out of  the  world   the great king told me the path should never be crooked  but open  for every one to pass and repass   as we all live in one land  i hope we  shall all live as one people   after which peace was formally ratified  and confirmed by both parties  and their former friendship being renewed   all hoped that it would last as long as the sun shall shine and the  rivers run          sidenote  a quarrel between the commanding officers     thus ended the cherokee war  which was among the last humbling strokes  given to the expiring power of france in north america  and colonel grant  returned to charlestown to wait further orders  but no sooner was peace  concluded  and the province secured against external enemies  than an  unhappy difference broke out between the two principal commanders of the  regular and provincial forces  colonel grant  a native of scotland  was  naturally of an high spirit  to which he added that pride of rank which  he held among those british soldiers who had carried their arms  triumphant through the continent  during this expedition it is probable  that he scorned to ask the advice of a provincial officer  whom he deemed  an improper judge of military operations  and claimed the chief glory of  having restored peace to the province  colonel middleton was equally warm  and proud  and considering such neglect as an affront  resented it  and  while some reflections were cast upon the provincial troops  being the  chief in command  he thought himself bound to stand forth as a champion  for the honour of the province  this ill humour  which appeared between  the officers on their return to charlestown  was encouraged and fomented  by persons delighting in broils  who  by malicious surmises and false  reports  helped to widen the difference  the dispute became serious  and  was carried on for some time in the public papers by mutual charges of  misconduct  and at length terminated in a duel  mr  middleton called out  colonel grant to the single combat  after they had both given the best  proof of their courage against the common enemy  the duel  however   happily terminated without bloodshed  and not a little to the credit of  the scots officer  though his antagonist shewed no less spirit in the  field of honour  falsely so called  than in defence of his country  the  citizens of charlestown seemed interested in the dispute  and each spoke  of the conduct of the two officers as they were differently affected   indeed  however much we may applaud the brave man who is first in the  field in defence of his country  with justice we with hold our praises  from him that is first at the single combat with a private friend   colonel grant  with great reason  considered such treatment  after having  brought the enemies of the colony to the most advantageous terms of  peace  as a base recompence for his services  from this period a  party spirit appeared in carolina  all the malicious aspersions and  inflammatory accusations against the inhabitants of north britain  which  were at this time wantonly and wickedly published in england  were  greedily swallowed by one party in the province  and industriously  propagated  prejudices were contracted  cherished  and unhappily gained  ground among the people  terms of reproach and abuse were collected from  those factious publications in london  and poured indiscriminately upon  all the natives of scotland  who were by no means backward in retorting  the abuse  in a growing province  where the utmost harmony and liberality  of sentiment ought to have been cherished by all  as the most certain  means of promoting the public strength and prosperity  such a  party spirit was attended  as might have been expected  with the most  pernicious consequence          sidenote  a whirlwind at charlestown     i have already observed  that the province is subject to whirlwinds   especially among the hills in the back country  but this year one of  those  which was indeed the most violent and dreadful that had ever been  known  passed charlestown in the month of may  it appeared at first to  the west of the town  like a large column of smoke  approaching fast in  an irregular direction  the vapour of which it was composed resembled  clouds rolling one over another in violent tumult and agitation  assuming  at one time a dark  at another a bright flaming colour  its motion was  exceedingly swift and crooked  as it approached the inhabitants were  alarmed with an uncommon sound  like the continual roaring of distant  thunder  or the noise made by a stormy sea beating upon the shore  which  brought numbers of people to witness the dreadful phenomenon  while it  passed down ashley river  such was its incredible velocity and force   that it plowed the waters to the bottom  and laid the channel bare  the  town narrowly and providentially escaped  but it threatened destruction  to a fleet consisting of no less than forty sail of loaded ships  lying  at anchor in rebellion road  about four miles below the town  and waiting  a fair wind to sail for england  when it reached the fleet  five vessels  were sunk in an instant by it  and his majesty s ship the dolphin  with  eleven others  were dismasted  such was the situation of the fleet  and  so rapid was the motion of the whirlwind  that though the seaman observed  it approaching  it was impossible to provide against it  in its oblique  course it struck only a part of the fleet  and the damage  though  computed at l         sterling  was by no means so great as might have  been expected  nor were many lives lost  for the channel of the river not  being very deep  while the ships sat down in the mud and were covered by  the waves  the sailors saved themselves by running up the shrouds  the  whirlwind passed the town a little before three o clock  and before four  the sky was so clear and serene  that we could scarcely have believed  such a dreadful scene had been exhibited  had it not left many striking  proofs behind it  its route was not only marked in the woods  having  levelled the loftiest trees  or swept them away before it like chaff  but  its effects were visible in the fleet  by the number of vessels sunk and  dismasted     it has been also remarked  that the province is subject to violent storms  of lightning and thunder throughout the year  but from the end of april  until october they are very frequent and terrible  there are few nights  during the summer in which lighting is not visible in some part of the  horizon  sometimes indeed those storms are of short duration   particularly when they come attended with brisk gales of wind  but when  that is not the case  they will often last for four or five hours  while  the clouds are gathering  it is surprising how quickly the atmosphere   which was formerly serene  will be covered with darkness  to the  inhabitants  accustomed to view such appearances  the thunder shower is  rather welcome than alarming  as it cools the air and earth  and enables  them to live comfortably during the remainder of the day  but to every  stranger it is exceedingly grand and awful  as the flashes of lightning  from the clouds commonly strike the highest objects  and the whole  country is covered with woods  the fury of the storm for the most part  falls upon them  and its amazing effects are visible from the vast number  of blasted trees every where appearing throughout the forest  the country  being as yet but thinly peopled  the inhabitants do not suffer so  severely as might be expected  considering the violence of these storms   yet few years pass without some accidents from lightning  i never knew  more than five houses in the town  but others have observed nine  two  churches and five ships struck with lightning during one thunder shower   such storms often occasion considerable damage  particularly to the ships  in the harbour  and sometimes they are attended with showers of hail  or  rather solid pieces of ice  which fall with such force as to beat down  the corn in the fields  to break glass windows  and occasion danger to  children exposed to them  but since the inhabitants have found out the  method of erecting iron rods on their houses  less damage has been done  to them  and fewer lives have been lost by lightning in this province          sidenote  of the heat at savanna     the climate of georgia  like that of carolina  is more mild and pleasant  in the inland than maritime parts  governor ellis has left us the  following account of the heat of the summer at savanna  in the  th of  july  while he was writing in his piazza  which was open at each end  he  says the mercury in fahrenheit s thermometer stood at     in the shade   twice had it risen to that height during the summer  several times to       and for many days together to     and in the night did not sink  below     he thought it highly probable  that the inhabitants of savanna  breathed a hotter air than any other people upon earth  the town being  situated on a sandy eminence  the reflection from the dry sand  when  there is little or no agitation in the air  greatly increases the heat   for by walking an hundred yards from his house upon the sand  under his  umbrella  with the thermometer suspended by a thread to the height of his  nostrils  the mercury rose to      the same thermometer he had with him  in the equatorial parts of africa  in jamaica  and in the leeward  islands  yet by his journals he found that it had never in any of these  places risen so high  its general station was between    and     he  acknowledges  however  that he felt those degrees of heat in a moist air  more disagreeable than at savanna  when the thermometer stood at    in  his cellar  at     in the storey above it  and in the upper storey of his  house at      on the   th of december the mercury was up at     on then    th down as low as     on the same instrument  such sudden and violent  changes  especially when they happen frequently  must make havock of the  human constitution  yet he asserts that few people die at savanna out of  the ordinary course  though many were working in the open air  exposed to  the sun during this extreme heat   as this governor was a man of sense  and erudition  and no doubt made his observations with great accuracy  we  shall not presume to call in question the facts he relates  but we must  say  we never saw the mercury rise so high in the shade at charlestown   and believe it very seldom happens to do so in georgia  we may add  that  such is the situation of savanna  surrounded with low and marshy lands   and so sudden and great are the changes in the weather there  as well as  in carolina  that the maritime parts of both provinces must be ranked  among the most unhealthy climates in the world           chap  xi            sidenote  a peace  and its happy effects respecting america     the peace of paris  though condemned by many in england as inadequate to  the amazing success that attended the british arms during the bloody war   and below the expectation of the british nation  unquestionably placed  america in the most advantageous situation  as the flames of war first  kindled in that continent  by a contest about the limits of the british  and french territories  to prevent all disputes of this kind for the  future was made one of the first objects of attention in framing a treaty  of peace  by the seventh article of this treaty it was agreed   that  for  the future  the confines between the dominions of his britannic majesty  and those of his most christian majesty in that part of the world should  be fixed irrevocably  by a line drawn along the middle of the river  mississippi  from its source to the river iberville  and from thence by a  line drawn along the middle of the river and the lakes maurepas and  pontchartrain to the sea   by the twentieth article   his catholic  majesty ceded and guarantied in full right to his britannic majesty   florida  with fort augustine and the bay of pensacola  as well as all  that spain possessed on the continent of north america to the east or  south east of the river mississippi  and in general every thing depending  on the said countries and lands  with the sovereignty  property   possession  and all rights acquired by treaties or otherwise  which the  catholic king and the crown of spain have had till now over the said  countries  lands  places  and other inhabitants   by these articles the  southern provinces were rendered perfectly secure  and  considering the  nature of the country  no frontiers could be more distinctly defined     but as the french colonies in the northern district had been the chief  seat of war  the conquest of which had occasioned such an immense waste  of blood and treasure to britain  it was also judged proper to guard  against the return of any danger on that side  experience had shewn the  nation  that while france possesses a single stronghold on that  continent  the british subjects could never enjoy perfect repose  but  must be in danger of being again plunged into those calamities from which  they had been with so much difficulty delivered  therefore it was  determined to remove this ambitious and enterprising enemy entirely from  the neighbourhood of these colonies  and secure them beyond a possibility  of future molestation  accordingly  by the fourth article of the treaty    his most christian majesty renounced all pretensions which he had  heretofore formed  or might form  to nova scotia  or acadia  in all its  parts  and guarantied the whole of it  with all its dependencies  to the  king of great britain  as also canada  with all its dependencies  cape  breton  and all the other islands and coasts in the gulf of st  laurence   and every thing that depends on these countries  islands  lands  places  and coasts  and their inhabitants  so that the most christian king ceded  and made over the whole to the said king and crown of great britain  and  that in the most ample manner and form  without restriction  and without  any liberty to depart from said cession and guaranty under any pretence   or to disturb great britain in the possessions above mentioned  reserving  only the island of new orleans  and liberty of fishing in the gulf of st   laurence  which was granted  upon condition that the subjects of france  do not execute the said fishery but at the distance of three leagues from  all the coasts belonging to great britain  as well those of the continent  as those of the islands situated in the gulf of st  laurence      we do not pretend to pass any judgment on the value of these conquests in  america  which were preferred to those of the west india islands at the  peace  by giving up a little of the sugar trade  it was thought the  nation lost only a luxury  and could be sufficiently supplied with all  the sugar and rum she wanted from the islands which she possessed before  the war  and therefore the precious conquests in the west indies were  sacrificed to the security of america  the vast territory to the east and  south east of the great river mississippi formed the british empire on  the continent  which  for variety of climate as well as of soil was  exceeded by no empire upon earth  as the trade of the mother country had  uniformly increased with the population of her colonies  it was hoped  that by freeing them from all molestation  they must increase in a still  more rapid manner than they had hitherto done  to the great advantage of  britain  for while the colonists had liberty to extend their culture to  the remotest desert  the trade of the mother country would be increased   her debt diminished  and at the same time the demand for manufactures  would be so great  that all the hands she employed would scarcely be able  to furnish the supply  these were thought to be the probable consequences  which would flow from the security of our american colonies at the peace          sidenote  boundaries of east and west florida     with respect to the new acquisitions  great pains were taken to acquire  an exact knowledge of them  not only to establish proper regulations  but  also to render them as useful and flourishing as possible  they were  divided into three separate independent governments  which were given to  officers who had distinguished themselves during the war  the government  of east florida was bounded to the westward by the gulf of mexico and the  river apalachicola  to the north by a line drawn from that part of the  above mentioned river where the catabouchee and flint rivers meet  to the  source of st  mary s river  and by the course of the same river to the  atlantic ocean  and to the east and south by the atlantic ocean  and the  gulf of florida  including all islands within six leagues of the sea  coast  the government of west florida was bounded to the southward by the  gulf of mexico  including all islands within six leagues of the sea  coast  from the river apalachicola to lake pontchartrain  to the westward  by the said lake  the lake maurepas  and the river mississippi  to the  north by a line drawn due east from that part of the river mississippi  which lies in thirty one degrees of north latitude  to the river  apalachicola  or catabouchee  and to the east by the said river  all the  lands lying between the rivers alatamaha and st  mary s were annexed to  the province of georgia          sidenote  the southern provinces left secure     the possession of these two provinces of east and west florida  though of  themselves little better than an immense waste  was of great importance  to the neighbouring provinces of georgia and carolina  it robbed the  spaniards of a strong hold from which they could send out an armed force  and harass these provinces  and of an easy avenue through which they had  often invaded them  it removed troublesome neighbours out of their way   who had often instigated the savages against them  and made augustine an  asylum for fugitive slaves  it opened some convenient ports for trade  with britain and the west indies  and for annoying french and spanish  ships coming through the gulf of florida  in case of any future rupture   it formed a strong frontier to the british dominions in that quarter  and  furnished an immense track of improveable land for reduced officers   soldiers  and others  to settle and cultivate          sidenote  encouragement given to reduced officers and soldiers     to testify the high sense his majesty had of the conduct and bravery of  his officers and soldiers during the late war  and to encourage the  settlement of the colonies  tracks of land were offered them as the  rewards of their services  orders were given to the governors on the  continent  to grant  without fee or reward  five thousand acres to every  field officer who had served in america  three thousand to every captain   two thousand to every subaltern  two hundred to every non commissioned  officer  and fifty to every private man  free of quit rents for ten  years  but subject  at the expiration of that term  to the same moderate  quit rents as the lands in the other provinces  and to the same  conditions of cultivation and improvement  in the new colonies  for the  encouragement of the people  they were to be allowed civil  establishments  similar to those of the other royal governments on the  continent  so soon as their circumstances would admit  and the same  provision was made for the security of their lives  liberties and  properties under the new as under the old governments          sidenote  georgia begins to flourish     no province on the continent felt the happy effects of this public  security sooner than the province of georgia  which had long struggled  under many difficulties  arising from the want of credit from friends   and the frequent molestations of enemies  during the late war the  government had been given to james wright  who wanted neither wisdom to  discern  nor resolution to pursue  the most effectual means for its  improvement  while he proved a father to the people and governed the  province with justice and equity  he discovered at the same time the  excellence of its low lands and river swamps  by the proper management  and diligent cultivation of which he acquired in a few years a plentiful  fortune  his example and success gave vigour to industry  and promoted a  spirit of emulation among the planters for improvement  the rich lands  were sought for with that zeal  and cleared with that ardour  which the  prospect of riches naturally inspired  the british merchants observing  the province safe  and advancing to a hopeful and flourishing state  were  no longer backward in extending credit to it  but supplied it with  negroes  and goods of british manufacture  with equal freedom as the  other provinces on that continent  the planters no sooner got the  strength of africa to assist them than they laboured with success  and  the lands every year yielded greater and greater increase  the trade of  the province kept pace with its progress in cultivation  the rich swamps  attracted the attention not only of strangers  but even of the planters  of carolina  who had been accustomed to treat their poor neighbours with  the utmost contempt  several of whom sold their estates in that colony   and moved with their families and effects to georgia  many settlements  were made by carolineans about sunbury  and upon the great river  alatamaha  the price of produce at savanna arose as the quantity  increased  a circumstance which contributed much to the improvement of  the country  the planters situated on the opposite side of savanna river  found in the capital of georgia a convenient and excellent market for  their staple commodities  in short  from this period the rice  indigo and  naval stores of georgia arrived at the markets in europe in equal  excellence and perfection  and  in proportion to its strength  in equal  quantities with those of its more powerful and opulent neighbours in  carolina  to form a judgment of the progress of the colony  we need only  attend to its exports  in the year       the exports of georgia consisted  of      barrels of rice       libs  of indigo       bushels of indian  corn  which  together with deer and beaver skins  naval stores   provisions  timber    c   amounted to no more than l         sterling   but afterwards the colony thrived and increased in a manner so rapid   that  in the year       it exported staple commodities to the value of l           sterling          sidenote  a plan adopted for encouraging emigrations to carolina     no less favourable and happy were the blessings of peace and security to  their neighbours of carolina  for never did any country flourish and  prosper in a more astonishing degree than this province has done since  the conclusion of the late war  the government had been given to thomas  boone  who was not only a native of the province  but had a considerable  estate in it  which naturally rendered him deeply interested in its  prosperity  the french and spaniards being removed out of the way  its  progress was no more retarded by any molestation from them  the assembly  appropriated a large fund for bounties to foreign protestants  and such  industrious poor people of britain and ireland as should resort to the  province within three years  and settle on the inland parts  two  townships  each containing        acres  were laid out  one on the river  savanna  called mecklenburgh  and the other on the waters of santee at  long canes  called londonderry  to be divided among emigrants  allowing  one hundred acres for every man  and fifty for every woman and child   that should come and settle in the back woods  the face of the country in  those interior parts is variable and beautiful  and being composed of  hills and vallies  rocks and rivers  there is not that stagnation in the  air  which is so exceedingly hurtful to the human constitution in the  flat marshy parts of the province  the hills occasion an agitation in the  atmosphere  and by collecting the air in streams  these run along the  earth in pleasant breezes  and mitigate the rigour of the hot season  the  climate in those inland parts is not only more mild and wholesome  but  the soil  particularly in the vallies  which are covered with lofty trees  and luxuriant bushes  is exceedingly fertile  and promised in the amplest  manner to reward the industrious labourer  in consequence of this  encouragement offered  it was hoped that multitudes would resort to  carolina  and settle those extensive and fruitful territories in the back  woods  by which means the frontiers of the province would be  strengthened  its produce increased  and its trade enlarged          sidenote  a number of palatines seduced into england     not long after this a remarkable affair happened in germany  by which  carolina received a great acquisition  one stumpel  who had been an  officer in the king of prussia s service  being reduced at the peace   applied to the british ministry for a tract of land in america  and  having got some encouragement returned to germany  where  by deceitful  promises  he seduced between five and six hundred ignorant people from  their native country  when these poor palatines arrived in england  the  officer finding himself unable to perform his promises  fled  leaving  them in a strange land  without money  without friends  exposed in the  open fields  and ready to perish through want  while they were in this  starving condition  and knew no person to whom they could apply for  relief  a humane clergyman  who came from the same country  took  compassion on them  and published their deplorable case in the  news papers  he pleaded for the mercy and protection of government to  them  until an opportunity might offer of transporting them to some of  the british colonies  where he hoped they would prove useful subjects   and in time give their benefactors ample proofs of their gratitude and  affection  no sooner did their unhappy situation reach the ears of a  great personage  than he immediately set an example to his subjects   which served both to warm their hearts and open their hands for the  relief of their distressed fellow creatures  a bounty of three hundred  pounds was allowed them  tents were ordered from the tower for the  accommodation of such as had paid their passage and been permitted to  come ashore  money was sent for the relief of those that were confined on  board  the public spirited citizens of london  famous for acts of  beneficence and charity  associated  and chose a committee on purpose to  raise money for the relief of these poor palatines  a physician  a  surgeon  and man midwife  generously undertook to attend the sick gratis   from different quarters benefactions were sent to the committee  and in a  few days those unfortunate strangers  from the depth of indigence and  distress  were raised to comfortable circumstances  the committee finding  the money received more than sufficient to relieve their present  distress  applied to his majesty to know his royal pleasure with respect  to the future disposal of the german protestants  his majesty  sensible  that his colony of south carolina had not its proportion of white  inhabitants  and having expressed a particular attachment to it   signified his desire of transporting them to that province  another  motive for sending them to carolina was the bounty allowed to foreign  protestants by the provincial assembly  so that when their source of  relief from england should be exhausted  another would open after their  arrival in that province  which would help them to surmount the  difficulties attending the first state of cultivation          sidenote  sent into carolina     accordingly preparations were made for sending the germans to south  carolina  when the news was communicated to them they rejoiced  not only  because they were to go to one of the most fertile and flourishing  provinces on the continent  but also because many of them had friends and  countrymen before them  two ships  of two hundred tons each  were  provided for their accommodation  and provisions of all kinds laid in for  the voyage  an hundred and fifty stand of arms were ordered from the  tower  and given them by his majesty for their defence after their  arrival in america  all which deserve to be recorded for the honour of  the british nation  which has at different times set before the world  many noble examples of benevolence  every thing being ready for their  embarkation  the palatines broke up their camp in the fields behind  white chapel  and proceeded to the ships attended by several of their  benefactors  of whom they took their leave with songs of praise to god in  their mouths  and tears of gratitude in their eyes          sidenote  and settled at londonderry     in the month of april        they arrived at charlestown  and presented a  letter from the lords commissioners for trade and plantations to governor  boone  acquainting him that his majesty had been pleased to take the poor  palatines under his royal care and protection  and as many of them were  versed in the culture of silks and vines  had ordered that a settlement  be provided for them in carolina  in a situation most proper for these  purposes  though their settlement met with some obstructions from a  dispute subsisting at that time between the governor and assembly about  certain privileges of the house  yet the latter could not help  considering themselves as laid under the strongest obligations to make  provision for so many useful settlers  accordingly  in imitation of the  noble example set before them in london  they voted five hundred pounds  sterling to be distributed among the palatines  according to the  directions of the lieutenant governor  and their necessities  that they  might be settled in a body  one of the two townships  called londonderry   was allotted for them  and divided in the most equitable manner into  small tracts  for the accommodation of each family  captain calhoun  with  a detachment of the rangers  had orders to meet them by the way  and  conduct them to the place where their town was to be built  and all  possible assistance was given towards promoting their speedy and  comfortable settlement          sidenote  some emigrate from britain  and multitudes from ireland     besides foreign protestants  several persons from england and scotland  resorted to carolina after the peace  but of all other countries none has  furnished the province with so many inhabitants as ireland  in the  northern counties of that kingdom the spirit of emigration seized the  people to such a degree  that it threatened almost a total depopulation   such multitudes of husbandmen  labourers and manufacturers flocked over  the atlantic  that the landlords began to be alarmed  and to concert ways  and means for preventing the growing evil  scarce a ship sailed for any  of the plantations that was not crowded with men  women and children  but  the bounty allowed new settlers in carolina proved a great encouragement   and induced numbers of these people  notwithstanding the severity of the  climate  to resort to that province  the merchants finding this bounty  equivalent to the expenses of the passage  from avaricious motives  persuaded the people to embark for carolina  and often crammed such  numbers of them into their ships that they were in danger of being  stifled during the passage  and sometimes were landed in such a starved  and sickly condition  that numbers of them died before they left  charlestown  many causes may be assigned for this spirit of emigration  that prevailed so much in ireland  some  no doubt  emigrated from a  natural restlessness of temper  and a desire of roving abroad  without  any fixed object in view  others were enticed over by flattering promises  from their friends and relations  who had gone before them  but of all  other causes of emigration oppression at home was the most powerful and  prevalent  most men have a natural fondness and partiality for their  native country  and leave it with reluctance while they are able to earn  a comfortable livelihood in it  that spot where they first drew the  breath of life  that society in which they spent the gay season of youth   the religion  the manners and customs of those among whom they were  educated  all conspire to affect the heart  and endear their native  country to them  but poverty and oppression will break through every  natural tie and endearment  and compel men to rove abroad in search of  some asylum against domestic hardship  hence it happened that many poor  people forsook their native land  and preferred the burning sky and  unwholesome climate of carolina  to the temperate and mild air of their  mother country  the success that attended some friends who had gone  before them being also industriously published in ireland  and with all  the exaggerations of travellers  gave vigour to the spirit of adventure   and induced multitudes to follow their countrymen  and run all hazards  abroad  rather than starve at home  government winked at those  emigrations  and every year brought fresh strength to carolina  insomuch  that the lands in ireland were in danger of lying waste for want of  labourers  and the manufacturers of dwindling into nothing          sidenote  and from the northern colonies  resort to carolina     nor were these the only sources from which carolina  at this time   derived strength and an increase of population  for  notwithstanding the  vast extent of territory which the provinces of virginia and pennsylvania  contained  yet such was the nature of the country  that a scarcity of  improveable lands began to be felt in these colonies  and poor people  could not find spots in them unoccupied equal to their expectations  most  of the richest vallies in these more populous provinces lying to the east  of the alleganny mountains were either under patent or occupied  and  by  the royal proclamation at the peace  no settlements were allowed to  extend beyond the sources of the rivers which empty themselves into the  atlantic  in carolina the case was different  for there large tracks of  the best lands as yet lay waste  which proved a great temptation to the  northern colonists to migrate to the south  accordingly  about this time  above a thousand families  with their effects  in the space of one year  resorted to carolina  driving their cattle  hogs and horses over land  before them  lands were allotted them on the frontiers  and most of them  being only entitled to small tracks  such as one  two or three hundred  acres  the back settlements by this means soon became the most populous  parts of the province  the frontiers were not only strengthened and  secured by new settlers  but the old ones on the maritime parts began  also to stretch backward and spread their branches  in consequence of  which the demand for lands in the interior parts every year increased   the governor and council met once a month for the purpose of granting  lands and signing patents  and it is incredible what numbers of people  attended those meetings in order to obtain them  so that  from the time  in which america was secured by the peace  carolina made rapid progress  in population  wealth and trade  which will farther appear when we come  particularly to consider its advanced state and annual exports          sidenote  regulations for securing the provinces against indians     in proportion as the province increased in the number of white  inhabitants  its danger from the savage tribes grew less alarming  but to  prevent any molestation from indians  and establish the peace of the  colonies on the most lasting foundation  his majesty  by his royal  proclamations after the peace  took care to fix the boundaries of their  hunting lands  in as clear a manner as the nature of the country would  admit  no settlements were allowed to extend any farther backward upon  the indian territories  than the sources of those great rivers which fall  into the atlantic ocean  and all british subjects who had settled beyond  these limits were ordered to remove  in this restriction his majesty  evidently made a distinction between the rights of sovereignty and those  of property  having excluded his governors from all manner of  jurisdiction over those lands which were not specified within the limits  of their respective provinces  all private subjects were prohibited from  purchasing lands from indians  but if the latter should at any time be  inclined to dispose of their property  it must for the future be done to  the king  by the general consent of their nation  and at a public  assembly held by british governors for that purpose  all traders were  obliged to take out licences from their respective governors for carrying  on commerce with indian nations          sidenote  john stuart made superintendant for indian affairs     such regulations were in many respects useful and necessary  for the  french and spaniards being excluded  it only remained to guard the  provinces against the danger arising from indians  and as they were  liable to much abuse and oppression from private traders  it was thought  necessary that the office of a superintendant should be continued for the  southern as well as the northern district of america  accordingly this  office was given to captain john stuart  who was in every respect well  qualified for the trust  attakullakulla had signified to the governor and  council  after the cherokee war  that the province would receive no  molestation from indians were this officer appointed to reside among  them  and to advise and direct them  the assembly had not only thanked  him for his good conduct and great perseverance at fort loudon  and  rewarded him with fifteen hundred pounds currency  but also recommended  him to the governor as a person worthy of preferment in the service of  the province  after his commission arrived from the king  the carolineans  rejoiced  and promised themselves for the future great tranquillity and  happiness  plans of lenity were likewise adopted by government with  respect to those indian tribes  and every possible precaution was taken  to guard them against oppression  and prevent any rupture with them   experience had shewn that rigorous measures  such as humbling them by  force of arms  were not only very expensive and bloody  but disagreeable  to a humane and generous nation  and seldom accompanied with any good  effects  such ill treatment rendered the savages cruel  suspicious and  distrustful  and prepared them for renewing hostilities  by keeping alive  their ferocious and warlike spirit  their extirpation  even though it  could easily be compleated  would be a cruel act  and all the while the  growth and prosperity of the settlements would be much retarded by the  attempt  whereas  by treating indians with gentleness and humanity  it  was thought they would by degrees lose their savage spirit  and become  more harmless and civilized  it was hoped that by establishing a fair and  free trade with them  their rude temper would in time be softened  their  manners altered  and their wants increased  and instead of implacable  enemies  ever bent on destruction  they might he rendered good allies   both useful and beneficial to the trade of the nation          sidenote  decrease of indians  and the causes of it     it has been remarked  that those indians on the continent of america  who  were at the time of its discovery a numerous and formidable people  have  since that period been constantly decreasing  and melting away like snow  upon the mountains  for this rapid depopulation many reasons have been  assigned  it is well known that population every where keeps pace with  the means of subsistence  even vegetables spring and grow in proportion  to the richness of the soil in which they are planted  and to the  supplies they receive from the nourishing rains and dews of heaven   animals flourish or decay according as the means of subsistence abound or  fail  and as all mankind partake of the nature of both  they also  multiply or decrease as they are fed  or have provision in plenty  luxury  excluded  the indians being driven from their possessions near the sea as  the settlements multiplied  were robbed of many necessaries of life   particularly of oysters  crabs  and fish  with which the maritime parts  furnished them in great abundance  and on which they must have  considerably subsisted  as is apparent from a view of their camps  still  remaining near the sea shore  the women are not only much disregarded and  despised  but also naturally less prolific among rude than polished  nations  the men being often abroad  at hunting or war  agriculture   which is the chief means of subsistence among a civilized people  is  entirely neglected by them  and looked upon as an occupation worthy only  of women or slaves  that abstinence and fatigue which the men endure in  their distant excursions  and that gluttony and voraciousness in which  they indulge themselves in the times of plenty  are equally hurtful to  the constitution  and productive of diseases of different kinds  now that  their territories are circumscribed by narrower bounds  the means of  subsistence derived even from game is less plentiful  indeed scanty and  limited are the provisions they raise by planting  even in the best  seasons  but in case of a failure of their crops  or of their fields  being destroyed by enemies  they perish in numbers by famine  their  natural passion for war the first european settlers soon discovered  and  therefore turned the fury of one tribe against another  with a view to  save themselves  when engaged in hostilities  they always fought not so  much to humble and conquer  as to exterminate and destroy  the british   the french and spanish nations  having planted colonies in their  neighbourhood  a rivalship for power over them took place  and each  nation having its allies among the savages was zealous and indefatigable  in instigating them against the allies of its neighbour  hence a series  of bloody and destructive wars has been carried on among these rude  tribes  with all the rage and rancour of implacable enemies     but famine and war  however destructive  were not the only causes of  their rapid decay  the smallpox having broke out among them  proved  exceedingly fatal  both on account of the contageous nature of the  distemper  and their harsh and injudicious attempts to cure it by  plunging themselves into cold rivers during the most violent stages of  the disorder  the pestilence broke out among some nations  particularly  among the pemblicos in north carolina  and almost swept away the whole  tribe  the practice of entrapping them  which was encouraged by the first  settlers in carolina  and selling them for slaves to the west india  planters  helped greatly to thin their nations  but  of all other causes   the introduction of spirituous liquors among them  for which they  discovered an amazing fondness  has proved the most destructive  excess  and intemperance not only undermined their constitution  but also created  many quarrels  and subjected them to a numerous list of fatal diseases   to which in former times they were entire strangers  besides those  europeans engaged in commercial business with them  generally speaking   have been so far from reforming them  by examples of virtue and purity of  manners  that they rather served to corrupt their morals  and render them  more treacherous  distrustful  base and debauched than they were before  this intercourse commenced  in short  european avarice and ambition have  not only debased the original nature and stern virtue of that savage  race  so that these few indians that now remain have lost in a great  measure their primitive character  but european vice and european  diseases  the consequences of vice  have exterminated this people   insomuch that many nations formerly populous are totally extinct  and  their names entirely forgotten          sidenote  present state of indian nations in the southern district     the principal tribes around carolina that now remain are  the cherokees   the catabaws  the creeks  the chickesaws  and choctaws  and a few others  that scarcely deserve to be mentioned  in      the cherokees  who inhabit  the mountains to the north of charlestown  could scarcely bring two  thousand men to the field  the catabaws have fifteen miles square  allotted them for hunting lands  about two hundred miles north of  charlestown  with british settlements all around them  but they are so  much reduced by a long war with the five nations  that they could not  muster one hundred and fifty warriors  the creeks inhabit a fine country  on the south west  between four and five hundred miles distant from  charlestown  and the number of both the upper and lower nations does not  exceed two thousand gun men  the chickesaw towns lie about six hundred  miles due west from charlestown  but the nation cannot send three hundred  warriors to the field  owing to the incessant wars which they have  carried on against the french  by which their number has been greatly  diminished  the choctaws are at least seven hundred miles west south west  from charlestown  and have between three and four thousand gun men  and  as their settlements border on west florida  the greatest part of them  till the late peace remained allies of france  but as these artful and  insinuating rivals were removed out of the way  and the british  government had adopted prudent plans of civilizing and managing those  barbarous nations  the colonies for the future were in a great measure  freed from all apprehensions of danger from them  i shall therefore  conclude my observations respecting indians with a speech of mr  stuart  the superintendant  delivered at a general congress held in mobile  at  which governor johnstone and many british officers and soldiers attended   for as he was so well acquainted with the humours  tempers and characters  of these tribes  this speech  in which is exhibited a good specimen of  the language and manner proper for addressing barbarous nations  may not  be unworthy of the reader s attention          sidenote  mr  stuart s first speech to the indians at mobile      friends and brothers  the supreme being who made the world and all its  inhabitants  has been pleased to permit many great warriors of the  british and indian nations to meet together in peace  the great king  who  is the father of all white people in great britain and america  and  defends them from danger  this day stretches out his arms to receive his  red children into favour  he has been pleased to appoint me  superintendent of the affairs of all indian nations to the southward of  virginia  in his name i speak to you  and as the words you hear are his  words  i hope you will listen to them with attention  and allow them to  remain deeply impressed on your minds  they are calculated to promote not  only your happiness  but that of your children and childrens children for  ever      when the great kings of britain and france were at variance  the storms  of war raged through this great forest  the indian nations were divided   brothers against brothers  and your country was stained with blood   malice and revenge went forth  all paths were made crooked  and your land  was covered with darkness  now that it has pleased the author of life to  restore the blessings of light and peace  it is our duty to make a proper  use and improvement of them  as fogs gathered in the night are dispersed  by the rising sun  so words dictated by the rage of war should be  forgotten in the time of peace  the great king  full of wisdom and  magnanimity  knows the frailty of his red children  and forgives their  disobedience and rebellion  he extends his love to them all  even to  those that lifted up the hatchet against him  to render them secure  he  has resolved that the english and french shall be for ever separated by  the great river mississippi  and that all nations on this side of it  shall have him for their common father  he commands all strife and enmity  between his white and red children to cease  and expects that the allies  of britain will take those indians  the former allies of france  by the  hand  and live together like brethren of one family  that his white and  red children may be near one other  and mutually supply each other s  wants  he has ordered some of his good subjects to come over the great  waters  and live on the fruits of this land  which the supreme being made  for the use of mankind in general  to open this friendly intercourse  i  have invited you all to meet me at this place  and i rejoice that so many  brothers are come to accept of the royal favour and protection      ye chickesaw warriors  i speak first to you  and i know your ears are  open to my words  the great king regards you as children brought up in  their father s house  who from their infancy have been dutiful and  obedient  and by that means merited what you have always enjoyed  his  particular care and affection  while darkness surrounded you on every  side  he has defended you from all those snares and dangers to which you  were exposed  now the day is clear and unclouded  your father continues  to love you  the paths from your towns to all nations shall be made  straight and plain  and nothing shall be permitted to hurt your feet   your children shall rejoice and grow up in safety  and your houses shall  be filled with abundance of corn and venison  i am come to tell you the  good news  and to see that justice be done you in all commercial  dealings      in the next place i speak to you  ye warriors of the great party of the  choctaw notion  you were like sons separated from their father  and  removed at a great distance from his protection  but by persisting in  obedience you were entitled to his love  the great king always  acknowledged you  but now he receives you into his family  and offers you  all the favours and privileges of sons  while you continue dutiful and  obedient  the eye of your father shall be upon you  and his hand shall be  open to relieve your wants  under his care you shall enjoy all the  blessings of peace and safety  you shall receive no injuries from  friends  nor be exposed to any dangers from enemies  your arms shall be  kept bright  your hunting lands no man shall be permitted to take from  you  and there shall be abundance of corn about your village      but as for you  ye choctaw warriors of the six villages  you were like  children early lost  while you were wandering out of the way  without  knowing your brothers you blindly struck them  you found a father   indeed  who adopted you  and you have long served him with zeal  and  shewn many proofs of your courage  you have received from your french  father such poor rewards for your services as he could bestow  but all  the while you remained under his care you were hungry  naked and  miserable  he gave you many fair words and promises  and having long  deceived you  at last is obliged to leave you in your present forlorn and  wretched condition  now your true father has found you  and this day  stretches forth his arms to receive you under his protection  he has  forgotten all your past offences  he knows your weakness  and forgives  your errors  he knows your wants  and is disposed to relieve them  i have  but one tongue  and always speak the truth  and as i bring you good news   i hope my words shall not be blown away by the wind  the great king is  wise  generous and merciful  and i flatter myself with the hopes that you  will never forget your obligations to his goodness      it is my duty to watch over indians  and protect them against all manner  of danger and oppression  for this purpose my ears shall be always open  to your complaints  and it shall be my study to redress your grievances   i must warn you to beware of all quarrels and outrages  by which you will  certainly forfeit the royal favour  and plunge yourselves again into  misery  i hope you will always observe my advice  and conduct yourselves  accordingly  that i may be able to transmit good accounts of your  behaviour to england  it is only by the permission of the great king that  your wants can be supplied  and that traders can come into your villages  with guns  powder  balls  knives  hatchets  flints  hoes  clothes and  other necessaries  these things you cannot make for yourselves  and no  other nation will be allowed to furnish you with them  therefore the  great king has a right to expect your gratitude and obedience  for all he  requires is with a view to your own tranquillity and happiness      as you are all received into the family of the great king  it is  expected that indians will not only live in friendship and peace with  white men  but also with one another  in imitation of his majesty s good  example  you must forget all injuries and offences  and throw aside all  national jealousies and antipathies  the king expects that the great  chieftains  to whom he has given medals and gorgets  will consider them  not merely as ornaments  but as emblems of the high offices they bear   and the great trust reposed in them  all presents made you are in  consideration of the good services expected from you  therefore  ye wise  and great leaders  i expect you will use your authority like fathers  and  restrain your young men from all acts of violence and injustice  and  teach them that the only way to merit honour and preferment is to be  just  honest and peaceable  and that disgrace and punishment will be the  consequences of disorderly practices  such as robbing plantations  and  beating or abusing white people      ye warriors who have no commissions  i speak to you also in name of the  king  and i hope you will reverence his authority and love your brethren   listen at all times to your wise rulers  and be careful to follow their  advice and example  by their wisdom and justice they have arrived at an  high pitch of preferment  and stand distinguished by great and small  medals  if  like them  you wish to be great  like them  you must first be  good  you must respect them as children do their father  yielding  submission to their authority  and obedience to their commands  without  the favour of your chiefs  you will neither get your wants supplied nor  reach the station of honour  an armourer will be sent into your nation to  clean and repair your rifles  but he will have instructions to mend arms  to none but such as shall be recommended by their chiefs  it being proper  that such leaders should have it in their power to distinguish those that  are peaceable and obedient from the obstinate and perverse      i am to inform you all  that i will send a beloved man into your towns   who will be vested with authority to hear and determine all differences  between you and the traders  to deliver all messages from me to you  and  all talks from you to me  and as he will come to promote your welfare and  tranquillity  i hope you will receive him kindly  protect him against all  insults  and assist him in the execution of his office      when the french governor took his leave of you  he advised you to look  upon yourselves as the children of the king of great britain  the advice  was good  i hope you will remember it for ever  the great king has  warriors numerous as the trees of the forest  and stands in no need of  your assistance  but he desires your friendship and alliance to render  you happy  he loves peace and justice  but he will punish all murders and  rebellion  be careful  therefore  to keep your feet far from the crooked  and bloody path  shun all communication with indian tribes who lift the  hatchet against their white brethren  their talks  their calamets  their  belts of wampum  and their tobacco are all poisonous  if you receive them  into your towns  be assured you will be infected with their madness  and  be in danger of rushing into destruction   be cautious  above all things   of permitting great quantities of rum to be brought into your villages   it poisons your body  enervates your mind  and  from respectable  warriors  turns you into furious madmen  who treat friends and enemies  alike  mark those persons  whether they be white or red  that bring rum  among you  for bad men  who violate the laws  and have nothing else in  view but to cheat  and render you despicable and wretched      lastly  i inform you that it is the king s order to all his governors  and subjects  to treat indians with justice and humanity  and to forbear  all encroachments on the territories allotted for them  accordingly  all  individuals are prohibited from purchasing any of your lands  but as you  know that your white brethren cannot feed you when you visit them unless  you give them grounds to plant  it is expected that you will cede lands  to the king for that purpose  but whenever you shall be pleased to  surrender any of your territories to his majesty  it must be done for the  future at a public meeting of your nation  when the governors of the  provinces  or the superintendent shall be present  and obtain the consent  of all your people  the boundaries of your hunting grounds will be  accurately fixed  and no settlement permitted to be made upon them  as  you may be assured that all treaties with you will be faithfully kept  so  it is expected that you also will be careful strictly to observe them  i  have now done  and i hope you will remember the words i have spoken  time  will soon discover to you the generosity  justice and goodness of the  british nation  by the bounty of the king  and a well ordered trade with  his subjects  your houses shall be filled with plenty  and your hearts  with joy  you will see your men and women well clothed and fed  and your  children growing up to honour you  and add strength to your nation  your  peace and prosperity shall be established  and continue from generation  to generation      having now endeavoured to give some account of the rise and progress of  this colony for the first century after its settlement  or rather from  the time the proprietors received their second charter in      to the  year       we shall add a general view of its present state and  condition  i have purposely delayed speaking of several things   particularly of the temper  manners and character of the people  until  this period  when they come more immediately under my own notice  and  such observations as i have made shall now be submitted to the public  view for the use of strangers  leaving all men acquainted with provincial  affairs to judge for themselves  according to the different lights in  which matters may have occurred to them          sidenote  a description of charlestown     with respect to the towns in carolina  none of them  excepting one  merit  the smallest notice  beaufort  purisburgh  jacksonburgh  dorchester   camden  and george town  are all inconsiderable villages  having in each  no more than twenty  thirty  or  at most  forty dwelling houses   but  charlestown  the capital of the province  may be ranked with the first  cities of british america  and yearly advances in size  riches and  population  it is situated upon a neck of land at the continence of  ashley and cooper rivers  which are large and navigable  and wash at  least two third parts of the town  these rivers mingle their streams  immediately below the town  and  running six or seven miles farther   empty themselves at sullivan s island into the atlantic ocean  by means  of such broad rivers the sea is laid open from east to southeast  and the  town fanned by gentle breezes from the ocean  which are very refreshing  to the inhabitants during the summer months  the tide flows a great way  above the town  and occasions an agitation in the air which is also  productive of salutary effects  so low and level is the ground upon which  charlestown is built  that the inhabitants are obliged to raise banks of  earth  as barriers  to defend themselves against the higher floods of the  sea  the streets from east to west extend from river to river  and   running in a straight line  not only open a beautiful prospect  but also  afford excellent opportunities  by means of subterranean drains  for  removing all nuisances  and keeping the town clean and healthy  these  streets are intersected by others  nearly at right angles  and throw the  town into a number of squares  with dwelling houses on the front  and  office houses and little gardens behind them  some of the streets are  broad  which in such a climate is a necessary and wise regulation  for  where narrow lanes and alleys have been tolerated  they prove by their  confined situation a fruitful nursery for diseases of different kinds   the town  which was at first entirely built of wood  as might be  expected  has often suffered from fire  but such calamities  though they  fell heavy on individuals  have given the inhabitants frequent  opportunities of making considerable improvements in it  now most houses  are built of brick  three storeys high  some of them elegant  and all  neat habitations  within they are genteelly furnished  and without  exposed as much as possible to the refreshing breezes from the sea  many  of them are indeed encumbered with balconies and piazzas  but these are  found convenient and even necessary during the hot season  into which the  inhabitants retreat for enjoying the benefit of fresh air  which is  commonly occasioned  and always increased  by the flux and reflux of the  sea  almost every family have their pump wells  but the water in them  being at no great distance from the salt river  and filtered only through  sand  is brackish  and commonly occasions severe griping and purging to  every person not accustomed to it  the town consisted at this time of  at  least  twelve hundred dwelling houses  and was in at advancing state  the  public buildings are  an exchange  a state house  an armoury  two  churches for episcopalians  one for presbyterians  two for french and  dutch protestants  to which may be added  meeting houses for anabaptists   independents  quakers and jews  upon the sides of the rivers wharfs are  built  to which all ships that come over the bar may lie close  and  having stores and ware houses erected upon them  are exceedingly  convenient for importing and exporting all kinds of merchandise     the harbour is also tolerably well fortified  the king having at  different times presented the province with great guns for that purpose   towards cooper river the town is defended by a number of batteries   insomuch that no ships of an enemy can approach it without considerable  hazard  besides these  the passage up to it is secured by fort johnson   built on james s island  about two miles below the town  this fort stands  in a commanding situation  within point blank shot of the channel   through which every ship  in their way to and from charlestown  must  pass  the commander of fort johnson is commissioned by the king  and has  authority to stop every ship coming in until the master or mate shall  make oath that there is no malignant distemper on board  it has barracks  for fifty men  but  in case of emergency  it obtains assistance from the  militia of the island  during the late cherokee war a plan was also  formed for fortifying the town towards the land  with a horn work built  of tappy  flanked with batteries and redoubts at proper distances  and  extending from river to river  but  after having spent a great sum of  money on this work  peace being restored  the design was dropt          sidenote  the number of its inhabitants     in      the number of white inhabitants in charlestown amounted to  between five and fix thousand  and the number of negroes to between seven  and eight thousand  with respect to the number of white inhabitants in  the province we cannot be certain  but we may form some conjecture from  the militia roll  for as all male persons from sixteen to sixty are  obliged by law to bear arms and muster in the regiments  and as the whole  militia formed a body of between seven and eight thousand  reckoning the  fifth person fit for military duty  the whole inhabitants in the province  might amount to near forty thousand  but the number of negroes was not  less than eighty or ninety thousand  as no exact register of the births  and funerals has been kept at charlestown for several years  we cannot  ascertain the proportion between them  formerly  when bills of mortality  were annually printed  the common computation was  that  while no  contagious disorder prevailed in town  one out of thirty five died  yearly  or one out of each family in the space of seven years  however   the list of deaths is often increased by the sailors and transient  persons that die in the town  and by malignant distempers imported into  it  it is generally believed  that the number of births among the settled  inhabitants exceeds that of funerals  but we shall affirm nothing with  respect to this matter without better authority than common observation  and conjecture          sidenote  a general view of the manners   c   of the people     with respect to temper and character  the inhabitants of carolina differ  little from those of great britain and ireland  i mean  such as derived  their origin from those islands  for the descendents of other nations  still retain something of the complexion  manners and customs of those  countries from whence they came  in stature  the natives of carolina are  about the middle size  for in europe we meet with men both taller and  shorter  they are  generally speaking  more forward and quick in growth  than the natives of cold climates  indeed we may say  there are no boys  or girls in the province  for from childhood they are introduced into  company  and assume the air and behaviour of men and women  many of them  have an happy and natural quickness of apprehension  especially in the  common affairs of life  and manage business with ease and discretion  but  want that steadiness  application and perseverance necessary to the  highest improvements in the arts and sciences  several natives who have  had their education in britain  have distinguished themselves by their  knowledge in the laws and constitution of their country  but those who  have been bred in the province  having their ideas confined to a narrower  sphere  have as yet made little figure as men of genius or learning   agriculture being more lucrative than any other employment  all who  possess lands and negroes apply their chief attention to the improvement  of their fortune  regardless of the higher walks of science  they  commonly marry early in life  and of course are involved in domestic  cares and concerns before their minds have had time to ripen in knowledge  and judgment  in the progress of society they have not advanced beyond  that period in which men are distinguished more by their external than  internal accomplishments  hence it happens  that beauty  figure  agility  and strength form the principal distinctions among them  especially in  the country  among english people they are chiefly known by the number of  their slaves  the value of their annual produce  or the extent of their  landed estate  for the most part they are lively and gay  adapting their  dress to the nature of the climate in which they live  and discover no  small taste and neatness in their outward appearance  their intercourse  and communication with britain being easy and frequent  all novelties in  fashion  dress and ornament are quickly introduced  and even the spirit  of luxury and extravagance  too common in england  was beginning to creep  into carolina  almost every family kept their chaises for a single horse   and some of the principal planters of late years have imported fine  horses and splendid carriages from britain  they discover no bad taste  for the polite arts  such as music  drawing  fencing and dancing  and it  is acknowledged by all  but especially by strangers  that the ladies in  the province considerably outshine the men  they are not only sensible   discreet and virtuous  but also adorned with most of those polite and  elegant accomplishments becoming their sex  the carolineans in general  are affable and easy in their manners  and exceedingly kind and  hospitable to all strangers  there are few old men or women to be found  in the province  which is a sure sign of the unhealthiness of the  climate  we cannot say that there are many in the country that arrive at  their sixtieth year  and several at thirty bear the wrinkles  bald head  and grey hairs of old age  as every person by diligence and application  may earn a comfortable livelihood  there are few poor people in the  province  except the idle or unfortunate  nor is the number of rich  people great  most of them being in what we call easy and independent  circumstances  it has been remarked  that there are more persons  possessed of between five and ten thousand pounds sterling in the  province  than are to be found any where among the same number of people   in respect of rank  all men regarded their neighbour as their equal  and  a noble spirit of benevolence pervaded the society  in point of industry  the town was like a bee hive  and there were none that reaped not  advantages more or less from the flourishing state of trade and commerce   pride and ambition had not as yet crept into this community  but the  province was fast advancing to that state of power and opulence  when  some distinctions among men necessarily take place          sidenote  and of their way of living     with respect to the manner of living in charlestown  it is nearly the  same as in england  and many circumstances concur to render it neither  very difficult nor expensive to furnish plentiful tables  they have tea  from england  and coffee  chocolate and sugar from the west indies  in  plenty  butter is good  especially at that season when the fields are  cleared of rice  and the cows are admitted into them  and it is so  plentiful that they export a good deal of it to the leeward islands  the  province produces some flour for bread  but it being of an inferior  quality  the inhabitants chiefly make use of that imported from new york  and philadelphia  in the market there is plenty of beef  pork  veal   poultry and venison  and a great variety of wild fowls and salt water  fish  the mutton from the low lands is not so good as that from the hills  in the interior parts  but as the back country is now well settled  it is  hoped that the market in time will be likewise well supplied with mutton  from it  they have also a variety of the finest fruits and vegetables in  their season  their principal drink is punch  or grog  which is composed  of rum well diluted with water  with respect to wine  madeira is not only  best suited to the climate  in which it improves by heat and age  but  also most commonly used by the people in general  though french  spanish  and portuguese wines are likewise presented at the tables of the most  opulent citizens  besides these  they have porter and beer from england   and cyder and perry from the northern colonies  where rum is cheap   excess in the use of it will not be uncommon  especially among the lower  class of people  but the gentlemen in general are sober  industrious and  temperate  in short  the people are not only blessed with plenty  but  with a disposition to share it among friends and neighbours  and many  will bear me witness  when i say  that travellers could scarcely go into  any city where they could meet with a society of people more agreeable   intelligent and hospitable than that at charlestown          sidenote  the arts and sciences only of late encouraged     though the arts and sciences had been long neglected  and have as yet  made no great progress in the province  yet of late years they have met  with great encouragement  the people in general stand not only much  indebted to an ingenious bookseller  who introduced many of the most  distinguished authors among them  but several of the most respectable  citizens also united and formed a society for the promotion of  literature  having obtained a charter of incorporation for that purpose   all the new publications in london  and many of the most valuable books   both ancient and modern  have been imported for the use of this society  the members of which were ambitious of proving themselves the worthy  descendants of british ancestors  by transporting not only their inferior  arts of industry and agriculture  but also their higher improvements in  philosophy and jurisprudence  their design was not confined to the  present generation  but extended to posterity  having the institution of  a college in view  so soon as the funds of the society should admit of  it  news papers were also printed  for supplying the province with the  freshest and most useful intelligence of all that passed in the political  and commercial world  for amusement the inhabitants of charlestown had  not only books and public papers  but also assemblies  balls  concerts  and plays  which were attended by companies almost equally brilliant as  those of any town in europe of the same size          sidenote  the militia and internal strength of the province     charlestown had its armoury  magazine  and militia  and every citizen   like those of ancient sparta  joined the military to the civil character   the officers of the militia are appointed by the governor  who commonly  nominates such men from among the inhabitants to command the rest as are  most distinguished for their courage and capacity  all men of the  military age being registered in the militia roll  each person knows the  company to which he belongs  the captain who commands it  and is  obligated to keep his arms in order  and to appear properly equipped in  case of any alarm or other emergency  we cannot say that the militia in  general made a good appearance  or seemed expert at the use of arms  but  the companies of grenadiers  light infantry  and artillery  were  extravagantly gay  and tolerably well disciplined  as most of the men  were equally independent as their officers  that prompt obedience to  orders  necessary in a regular army  could not be expected from them  but  being conscious that union of strength was necessary to the common  safety  on all emergencies they appeared under arms with alacrity and  expedition  by the militia law the merchants and tradesmen of the city  were subjected to some temporary inconveniencies and interruptions of  business  but as agriculture was chiefly carried on by slaves  and nature  brought the fruits of the earth to maturity  the planters in the country  had abundance of time to spare for military exercises  their rural life   and the constant use of arms  promoted a kind of martial spirit among  them  and the great dangers to which they were always exposed  habituated  them to face an enemy with resolution  fortunately a natural antipathy  subsisted between indians and negroes  and prevented the two from uniting  and conspiring the destruction of the colony  therefore  while indians  remained quiet and peaceable  it was not the interest of the province to  have them removed at a great distance  for had they been driven over the  mississippi  or extirpated  their place would probably have been supplied  by fugitive slaves  who  by taking shelter in the mountains  would have  proved an enemy equally  if not more  cruel and formidable to carolina  than the indians themselves  or had the savage nations given  encouragement to slaves to fly to them for liberty and protection  fatal  must the consequences have been to the settlement          sidenote  of its societies formed for mutual support and relief     thus exposed to barbarians  the members of this little community knew  that union of strength was not only requisite to the common safety  but  both interest and duty naturally led them to establish societies with a  particular view of raising funds for relieving each others wants  though  every person was obliged by law to contribute  in proportion to his  estate  for the relief of the poor of the province  yet  besides this   there were several societies formed and incorporated for the particular  purpose of assisting such families belonging to them as might happen to  be unfortunate in trade  or in any other way reduced to an indigent  state  among these there is one called the south carolina society  which  merits particular notice  at first it consisted not of the most opulent  citizens  though many of these afterwards joined it  but of persons in  moderate stations  who held it an essential duty to relieve one another  in such a manner as their circumstances would admit  accordingly they  united  elected officers  and  by trifling weekly contributions   donations and legacies  together with good management  in process of time  accumulated a considerable stock  a common seal was provided  with the  device of a hand planting a vine  and the motto  posteritati   the  heavens smile on humane and generous designs  many observing the great  usefulness of this society  petitioned for admission into it  and as its  numbers increased its stock enlarged  in       their capital amounted to  no more than l         s   but  in       it had arisen to a sum not less  than l                 current money  all the while their works of  charity have likewise been conspicuous and extensive  many unfortunate  and sinking families have been supported by them in a decent and  respectable manner  many helpless orphans have been educated  and  prepared for being useful members of society  several other societies in  charlestown have been founded upon the same plan  and on many occasions  the inhabitants in general   it may be mentioned to their honour   have  discovered a benevolent and charitable spirit  not only to poor people in  the province  but also to unfortunate strangers          sidenote  of its merchants and trade     the merchants in carolina are a respectable body of men  industrious and  indefatigable in business  free  open and generous in their manner of  conducting it  the whole warehouses in charlestown were like one common  store  to which every trader had access for supplying his customers with  those kinds of goods and manufactures which they wanted  the merchants of  england  especially since the late peace  observing the colonies  perfectly secure  and depending on the strength of the british navy for  the protection of trade  vied with each other for customers in america   and stretched their credit to its utmost extent for supplying the  provinces  hence every one of them were well furnished with all kinds of  merchandise  but as the staples of carolina were valuable  and in much  demand  credit was extended to that province almost without limitation   and vast multitudes of negroes  and goods of all kinds  were yearly sent  to it  in proportion as the merchants of charlestown received credit from  england  they were enabled to extend it to the planters in the country   who purchased slaves with great eagerness  and enlarged their culture   though the number of planters had of late years much increased  yet they  bore no proportion to the vast extent of territory  and lands were still  easily procured  either by patent or by purchase  according to the number  of hands employed in labour  agriculture prospered and trade was  enlarged  an uncommon circumstance also attended this rapid progress   which was favourable to the planting interest  and proved an additional  incentive to industry  the price of staple commodities arose as the  quantity brought to market increased  in      rice sold at forty  shillings per barrel  and indigo at two shillings per lib   but in       in so flourishing a state was the commerce of this country  that rice  brought at market three pounds ten shillings per barrel  and indigo three  shillings per lib  at the same time the quantity increased so much  that  the exports of carolina amounted  upon an average of three years after  the peace  to l                  but  in       the exports in that year  alone arose to a sum not less than l          sterling  how great then  must the imports have been  when the province  notwithstanding this  amazing increase  still remained in debt to the mother country          sidenote  of its planters and agriculture     to this advanced state had carolina arrived in point of improvement   agriculture  beyond doubt  is of such importance to every country  that   next to public security and the distribution of justice and equity  it is  the interest of every government to encourage it  nothing could more  manifestly promote industry and agriculture  than that fair and equitable  division of lands among the people which took place in this province   immense tracts of ground in possession of one man  without hands to  cultivate and improve them  are only unprofitable deserts  but when lands  are judiciously parcelled out among the people  industry is thereby  encouraged  population increased  and trade promoted  the lands first  yield abundance for the inhabitants  and then more than they can consume   when this is the case  the overplus can be spared for procuring foreign  articles of exchange  and the province is thereby furnished with the  conveniencies and luxuries of another climate and country  then the  planter s views are turned to the advantages of trade  and the  merchant s  in return  to the success of husbandry  from which time a  mutual dependence subsists between them  and it is the interest of the  one to encourage the other  for when the merchants receive nothing from  the province  it is impossible they can afford to import anything into  it  without cultivation commerce must always languish  being deprived of  its chief supplies  the fruits of the earth  without credit from the  merchant there would have been little encouragement to emigrate to  carolina  a single arm could make little impression on the forest  a poor  family  depending for support on the labour of one man  would have long  remained in a starving condition  and scarcely ten of an hundred  emigrants  obliged to work in such a climate  would have survived the  tenth year after their arrival  to what causes then shall we ascribe the  prosperity of the province  the answer is plain  under the royal care the  people  being favoured with every advantage resulting from public  security  an indulgent government  abundance of land  large credit   liberty to labour and to reap the whole fruits of it  protection to  trade  and an excellent market for every staple  laboured with success   these were powerful motives to emigrate  strong incentives to industry   and the principal causes of its rapid advances towards maturity  no  colony that ever was planted can boast of greater advantages  few have   in the space of an hundred years  improved and flourished in an equal  degree     notwithstanding the favourable situation for agriculture in which the  carolineans stood  they remained slovenly husbandmen  and every stranger  was astonished at the negligent manner in which all estates in the  province were managed  those planters who had arrived at easy or affluent  circumstances employed overseers  and having little to do but to ride  round their fields now and then  to see that their affairs were not  neglected  or their slaves abused  indulge themselves in rural  amusements  such as racing  mustering  hunting  fishing  or social  entertainments  for the gun and dog the country affords some game  such  as small partridges  woodcocks  rabbits    c   but few of the planters  are fond of that kind of diversion  to chace the fox or the deer is their  favourite amusement  and they are forward and bold riders  and make their  way through the woods and thickets with astonishing speed  the horses of  the country  though hardy and serviceable animals  make little figure   and therefore  to improve the breed  many have been of late years  imported from england  the planters being fond of fine horses  have been  at great pains to raise them  so that they now have plenty of an  excellent kind  both for the carriage and the turf     in every plantation great care is taken in making dams to preserve water   for overflowing the rice fields in summer  without which they will yield  no crops  in a few years after this pond is made  the planters find it  stocked with a variety of fishes  but in what manner they breed  or  whence they come  they cannot tell  and therefore leave that matter to  philosophical inquirers to determine  some think that the spawn of fishes  is exhaled from the large lakes of fresh water in the continent  and  being brought in thunder clouds  falls with the drops of rain into these  reservoirs of water  others imagine that it must have remained every  where among the sand since that time the sea left these maritime parts of  the continent  others are of opinion  that young fish are brought by  water fowls  which are very numerous  from one pond to another  and there  dropt  by which means the new made pools receive their supply  but be the  cause what it will  the effect is visible and notorious all over the  country  when the ponds are stocked with fishes  it becomes an agreeable  amusement to catch them  by hawling a sene    through the pool  parties  of pleasure are formed for this purpose  so that the young planters  like  gentlemen of fortune  being often abroad at these rural sports and social  entertainments  their domestic affairs by such means are much neglected   and their plantations carelessly managed      transcriber s note  the word  sene  appears thus in the original  might  be an uncommon misprint of  sieve       but even among the most diligent and attentive planters we see not that  nice arrangement and order in their fields observable in most places of  europe  probably owing to the plenty and cheapness of land  in every  country where landed estates are easily procured  they engross not that  care and attention requisite for making them yield the greatest returns   the freeholds in carolina are not only easily obtained by patent or  purchase  but also all alienable at pleasure  so that few of the present  generation of planters regulate their system of husbandry upon any  established principles or plans  much less with any views to posterity   in no country have the finest improvements been found in the first ages  of cultivation  this remains for a future day  and when lands shall be  more scarce and valuable  and the country better peopled  then  it is  probable  carolina will cover  like other countries  the effects of the  nice art and careful management of the husbandman     at present the common method of cultivation is as follows  after the  planter has obtained his tract of land  and built a house upon it  he  then begins to clear his field of that load of wood with which the land  is covered  nature points out to him where to begin his labours  for the  soil  however various  is every where easily distinguished  by the  different kinds of trees which grow upon it  having cleared his field  he  next surrounds it with a wooden fence  to exclude all hogs  sheep and  cattle from it  this field he plants with rice or indigo  year after  year  until the lands are exhausted or yield not a crop sufficient to  answer his expectations  then it is forsaken  and a fresh spot of land is  cleared and planted  which is also treated in like manner  and in  succession forsaken and neglected  although there are vast numbers of  cattle bred in the province  yet no manure is provided for improving the  soil  no trials of a different grain are made  no grass seeds are sown in  the old fields for enriching the pastures  so that either shrubs and  bushes again spring up in them  or they are overgrown with a kind of  coarse grass  grateful or nourishing to no animal  like farmers often  moving from place to place  the principal study with the planters is the  art of making the largest profit for the present time  and if this end is  obtained  it gives them little concern how much the land may be  exhausted  the emulation that takes place among the present generation   is not who shall put his estate in the most beautiful order  who shall  manage it with most skill and judgment for posterity  but who shall bring  the largest crop to the market  let their children provide for  themselves  they will endeavour to leave them plenty of labourers  and  they know they can easily obtain abundance of lands  vain and absurd   therefore  would it be to bestow much pains and time in preparing this or  that landed estate for them  and laying it out in fine order  which they  are certain will be deserted so soon as the lands are exhausted     such is the present method of carrying on agriculture in carolina  and it  may do for some time  but every one must clearly see that it will be  productive of bad effects  the richness of the soil  and the vast  quantity of lands  have deceived many  even those men who had been bred  farmers in england  and made them turn out as careless husbandmen as the  natives themselves  wherever you go in this province  you may discover  the ignorance of the people with respect to agriculture  and the small  degree of perfection to which they have yet attained in this useful art   this will not be the case much longer  for lands will become scarce  and  time and experience  by unfolding the nature of the soil  and discovering  to the planters their errors  will teach them  as circumstances change   to alter also their present rules  and careless manner of cultivation  in  every country improvements are gradual and progressive  in such a  province as carolina  where the lands are good  new staples will be  introduced  new sources of wealth will open  and  if we may judge from  what is past  we may conclude  that  if no misunderstandings or quarrels  shall interrupt its future progress  it certainly promises to be one of  the most flourishing settlements in the world  we have seen that its  exports are already very great  even while the lands are negligently  cultivated and ill managed  but how much greater will they be when the  art of agriculture shall hare arrived at the same degree of perfection in  that province as in england          sidenote  an interruption of the harmony between britain and her      colonies  and the causes of it     such  at this period  was the happy situation of the people and province  of south carolina  safe under the royal care and protection  and  advancing to an opulent state by the unlimited credit and great  indulgence granted by britain  however  if we proceed a little farther   we shall see the face of things gradually changing  we shall behold the  mother country  as the wealth of her colonies increased  attempting some  alteration in their political and commercial system  and the different  provinces  infected with pride and ambition  aspiring after independence   let us take a slight view of the causes of that unhappy quarrel which at  this time began between them  and afterwards proceeded to such a degree  of violence as to threaten a total dissolution of all political union and  commercial intercourse     it might have been expected that those colonies would not soon forget  their obligations to the mother country  by which they had been so long  cherished and defended  as all the colonies were in themselves so many  independent societies  and as in every state protection and allegiance  are reciprocal and inseparable duties  one would have thought that  subjects would yield obedience to the laws  and submission to the  authority of that government under which they claimed protection  such  was the constitution of the provinces  that each  by its own legislature   could only regulate the internal police within the bounds of its  territory  thus far  and no farther  did its authority extend  not one of  them could either make or execute regulations binding upon another  they  had no common council  empowered by the constitution  to act for and to  bind all  though perhaps good policy now required the establishment of  such a council  for the purpose of raising a revenue from them  every  member of the vast empire might perceive  that some common tax  regularly  and impartially imposed  in proportion to the strength of each division   was necessary to the future defence and protection of the whole  in  particular  the people of great britain  when they looked forward to the  possible contingency of a new war  and considered the burdens under which  they groaned  had a melancholy and dreadful prospect before them  and the  parliament considered it as their indispensible duty to relieve them as  much as possible  and provide for the safety of the state by a  proportionable charge on all its subjects  for as the exemption of one  part from this equal charge was unreasonable and unjust  so it might tend  to alienate the hearts of these subjects residing in one corner of the  empire from those in another  and destroy that union and harmony in which  the strength of the whole consisted     such were probably the views and designs of the parliament of great  britain at this juncture  with respect to america  at the same time  if  we consider the genius  temper and circumstances of the americans  we  will find them jealous of their liberties  proud of their strength  and  sensible of their importance to britain  they had hitherto obeyed the  laws of the british parliament  but their great distance  their vast  extent of territory  their numerous ports and conveniencies for trade   their increasing numbers  their various productions  and consequently  their growing power  had now prepared and enabled them for resisting such  laws as they deemed inconsistent with their interest  or dangerous to  their liberty  some of these colonists even inherited a natural aversion  to monarchy from their forefathers  and on all occasions discovered a  strong tendency towards a republican form of government  both in church  and state  so that  before the parliament began to exert its authority  for raising a revenue from them  they were prepared to shew their  importance  and well disposed for resisting that supreme power  and  loosening by degrees their connection with the parent state     america was not only sensible of her growing strength and importance  but  also of the weakness of the mother country  reduced by a tedious and  expensive war  and groaning under an immense load of national debt  the  colonies boasted of the assistance they had given during the war  and  great britain  sensible of their services  was generous enough to  reimburse them part of the expences which they had incurred  after this  they began to over rate their importance  to rise in their demands  and  to think so highly of their trade and alliance  as to deem it impossible  for britain to support her credit without them  in vain did the mother  country rely upon their gratitude for past favours  so as to expect  relief with respect to her present burdens  we allow  that the first  generation of emigrants retained some affection for britain during their  lives  and gloried in calling her their home and their mother country   but this natural impression wears away from the second  and is entirely  obliterated in the third  among the planters in all the colonies this was  manifestly the case  the sons of englishmen in america by degrees lost  their affection for england  and it was remarkable  that the most violent  enemies to scotland were the descendants of scotchmen     but among merchants  the attachment to any particular country is still  sooner lost  men whose great object is money  and whose business is to  gather it as fast as possible  in fact retain a predilection for any  country no longer than it affords them the greatest advantages  they are  citizens of the world at large  and provided they gain money  it is a  matter of indifference to them to what country they trade  and from what  quarter of the globe it comes  england is the best country for them  so  long as it allows them to reap the greatest profits in the way of  traffic  and when that is not the case  a trade with france  spain  or  holland will answer better  if the laws of great britain interfere with  their favourite views and interests  merchants will endeavour to elude  them  and smuggle in spite of legal authority  of late years  although  the trade of the colonies with the mother country had increased beyond  the hopes of the most sanguine politicians  yet the american merchants  could not be confined to it  but carried on a contraband trade with the  colonies of france and spain  in defiance of all the british laws of  trade and navigation  this illicit trade the people had found very  advantageous  having their returns in specie for their provisions and  goods  and the vast number of creeks and rivers in america proved  favourable to such smugglers  during the late war this trade had been  made a treasonable practice  as it served to supply those islands which  britain wanted to reduce  but  after the conclusion of the war  it  returned to its former channel  and increased beyond example in any past  period          sidenote  the new regulations made in the trade of the colonies give      great offence     to prevent this illicit commerce  it was found necessary  soon after the  peace  to establish some new regulations in the trade of the colonies   for this purpose some armed sloops and cutters were stationed on the  coasts of america  whose commanders had authority to act as revenue  officers  and to seize all ships employed in that contraband trade   whether belonging to foreigners or fellow subjects  and to render these  commercial regulations the more effectual  courts of admiralty were  erected  and invested with a jurisdiction more extensive than usual  in  consequence of the restrictions laid on this trade  which the smugglers  found so advantageous  it suffered much  and  notwithstanding the number  of creeks and rivers  was almost annihilated  this occasioned some very  spirited representations to be sent across the atlantic by merchants  who  declared that the americans bought annually to the amount of three  millions of british commodities  that their trade with the french and  spanish colonies took off such goods as remained an encumbrance on their  hands  and made returns in specie  to the mutual advantage of both  parties concerned in it  they complained  that the british ships of war  were converted into guarda costas  and their commanders into custom house  officers  an employment utterly unworthy of the exalted character of the  british navy  that naval officers were very unfit for this business in  which they were employed  being naturally imperious in their tempers  and  little acquainted with the various cases in which ships were liable to  penalties  or in which they were exempted from detention  that that  branch of trade was thereby ruined  by which alone they were furnished  with gold and silver for making remittances to england  and that though  the loss fell first upon them  it would ultimately fall on the commerce  and revenue of great britain          sidenote  a vote passed for charging stamp duties on the americans     soon after this an act of parliament was passed  which  while it in some  respects rendered this commercial intercourse with the foreign  settlements legal  at the same time loaded a great part of the trade with  duties  and ordered the money arising from them to be paid in specie to  the british exchequer  instead of giving the colonists any relief  this  occasioned greater murmurs and complaints among them  as it manifestly  tended to drain the provinces of their gold and silver  at the same time  another act was passed  for preventing such paper bills of credit as  might afterwards be issued for the conveniency of their internal  commerce  from being made a legal tender in the payment of debts  this  served to multiply their grievances  and aggravate their distress  but  that the provinces might he supplied with money for their internal trade   all gold and silver arising from these duties were to be reserved  and  applied to the particular purpose of paying troops stationed in the  colonies for their defence  several new regulations for encouraging their  trade with great britain were also established  in consequence of a  petition for opening more ports for the rice trade  leave was granted to  the provinces of south carolina and georgia to carry their rice for a  limited time into foreign parts  on its paying british duties at the  place of exportation  a bounty was given on hemp and undressed flax  imported into britain from the american colonies  and a bill was passed  for encouraging the whale fishery on the coasts of america  which  advantages  it was thought  would amply compensate for any loss the  colonies might sustain by the duties laid on their foreign trade  but the  colonists  especially those in new england  who had advanced to such a  degree of strength as rendered troops unnecessary for their defence  were  too much soured in their tempers  to allow that great britain had any  other than self interested views in her whole conduct towards them  they  murmured and complained  and resolved on a plan of retrenchment with  respect to the purchasing of british manufactures  but still they  presumed not openly to call in question the authority of the british  legislature over them  but the time was at hand when their affection to  the mother country  which was already considerably weaned  should undergo  a greater trial  and when their real dispositions with respect to the  obedience due to the british parliament would no longer be concealed  a  vote passed in the house of commons  and very unanimously   that  towards  the farther defraying of the necessary expences of protecting the  colonies  it may he proper to charge certain stamp duties upon them           sidenote  upon which the people of new england discover their      disaffection to government     when the news of this determination reached america  all the colonies  were in some degree uneasy at the thoughts of paying taxes  but the  colonists of new england  as if ripe for some commotion  were alarmed  with the most terrible apprehensions and suspicions  openly affirming   that the king  lords and commons had formed a design for enslaving them   and had now begun deliberately to put it in execution  immediately they  entered into associations for distressing the mother country  from a  principle of resentment  as some thought  agreeing to purchase as few  clothes and goods from her as possible  and to encourage manufactures of  all kinds within themselves  they pretended that they were driven to such  measures by necessity  but in reality they had nothing less in view than  their favourite plan of independence  for the accomplishment of which it  required time to secure the union and help of the other colonies  without  which they plainly perceived all attempts of their own would be vain and  fruitless  accordingly they established a correspondence with some  leading men in each colony  representing the conduct of great britain in  the most odious light  and declaring that nothing could prevent them and  their posterity from being made slaves but the firmest union and most  vigorous opposition of every colony  to all laws made in great britain on  purpose to raise a revenue in the plantations  a few discontented  persons  who are commonly to be found in every legislature  joined the  disaffected colonists of new england  and though at this time the party  was inconsiderable  yet being more firmly cemented together by the  prospect of a stamp act  which equally affected the interest of all  it  by degrees gained strength  and at length became formidable          sidenote  an opportunity given the colonies to offer a compensation      for the stamp duty     such measures  however  did not intimidate the british ministers  who  imagined that an association entered into from a principle of resentment  would be of short duration  and that the colonies in general would be  averse from any serious quarrel with the mother country  upon which they  depended for safety and protection  and although they were well apprised  of this sullen and obstinate disposition of the colonists before the bill  was introduced  yet they took no measures for preventing that opposition   which they had reason to believe would be made to the execution of their  law  on the contrary  time was imprudently given to sound the temper of  the colonies with respect to it  and to give them an opportunity of  offering a compensation for it in their own way  in case they were  dissatisfied with that method of raising a revenue for their defence  the  minister even signified to the agents of the colonies his readiness to  receive proposals from them for any other tax that might be equivalent to  the stamp duty  this he did although he thought that the parliament not  only had a right to tax them  but also that it was expedient and proper  to exercise that right  for as the colonies had no common council  empowered by their constitution to bind all  their taxing themselves  equally and impartially would be a matter of great difficulty  even  although they should be disposed to agree to it  but the colonies   instead of making any proposal for raising a revenue by a stamp duty or  any other way  sent home petitions to be presented to king  lords  and  commons  questioning  in the most direct and positive terms  the  jurisdiction of parliament over their properties          sidenote  the stamp act passes in parliament     in this situation of affairs  the parliament  sensible of the heavy  burden which already lay on the people of great britain  and of the  addition to it which another war must occasion  thought it their  indispensable duty to exert that authority  which before this time had  never been called in question  for relieving this oppressed part of the  nation  and providing for the common safety  by a charge impartially laid  upon all subjects  in proportion to their abilities  the tender  indulgence exercised by a parent over her children in their infant state   was now considered as both unreasonable and unnecessary in that state of  maturity to which the colonies had advanced  all were obliged to confess   that the people of america were favoured with the same privileges and  advantages with their fellow subjects of britain  and justice required  that they should contribute to the necessary expences of that government  under which they lived  and by which they were protected  a revenue was  necessary to the future security of america  and on whom should it be  raised  but those colonists who were to enjoy the benefit of such  protection  therefore the bill for laying a stamp duty upon the colonies  was brought into parliament  which  after much debate  and many strong  arguments urged on both sides  passed through both houses  and received  the royal assent by commission  on the   d of march        at the same  time  to compensate for the operations of the stamp act  another was made  to encourage the importation of all kinds of timber from the colonies  into britain  and as the estimated produce of the stamp act amounted only  to l          per annum   and timber was so plentiful over all the  plantations  it was thought that the great advantage which the colonies  must reap from the latter act  would be an ample recompense for the loss  they might sustain from the former          sidenote   violent measures taken to prevent its execution     in the mean time the inhabitants of new england were industrious in  spreading an alarm of danger over all the continent  and making all  possible preparations for resistance  they had turned a jealous eye  towards the mother country  where they had many friends employed to watch  her conduct  who failed not to give them the earliest intelligence of  what was doing in parliament  while they received the news that the  stamp act had passed  they at the same time had intelligence of that  violent opposition it had met with from a strong faction in the house of  commons  and if their friends in britain had the boldness to call in  question both the right of the british legislature to impose taxes on the  colonies  and the expediency of exercising that right  they thought that  they had much better reason to do so  and that none deserved the blessing  of liberty who had not courage to assert their right to it  accordingly   no means were neglected that could inflame and exasperate the populace   bold and seditious speeches were made to stir up the people to  resistance  by representing the act in the most odious light  and  affirming that it would be attended with consequences subversive of all  their invaluable rights and privileges  they declared that silence was a  crime at such a critical time  and that a tame submission to the  stamp act would leave their liberties and properties entirely at the  disposal of a british parliament  having obtained a copy of the act  they  publicly burnt it  the ships in the harbours hung out their colours  half mast high  in token of the deepest mourning  the bells in the  churches were muffled  and set a ringing  to communicate the melancholy  news from one parish to another  these flames  kindled in new england   soon spread through all the capital towns along the coast  so that there  was scarcely a sea port town in america in which combinations were not  framed for opposing the introduction of stamp paper     when the vessels arrived which carried those stamp papers to america  the  captains were obliged to take shelter under the stern of some ships of  war  or to surrender their cargoes into the hands of the enraged  populace  the gentlemen appointed to superintend the distribution of  stamps  were met by the mob at their landing  and compelled to resign  their office  all men suspected of having any desire of complying with  the act  or of favouring the introduction of stamps into america  were  insulted and abused  the governors of the provinces had no military force  to support civil authority  the magistrates connived at these irregular  and riotous proceedings of the people  the assemblies adopted the  arguments of the minority in parliament  and took encouragement from them  to resist the authority of the supreme legislature  though each colony in  respect of another was a separate and independent society  without any  political connection  or any supreme head to call the representatives of  the people together  to act in concert for the common good  yet in this  case almost all  of their own authority  sent deputies to meet in  congress at new york  who drew up and signed one general declaration of  their rights  and of the grievances under which they laboured  and  transmitted a petition to the king  lords and commons  imploring relief          sidenote  the assembly of carolina study ways and means of eluding      the act     among the rest a party in south carolina  which province at this time   from inclination  duty and interest  was very firmly attached to the  mother country  entered warmly into the general opposition   lieutenant governor bull  a native of the province  manifested a desire  of complying with the act  and supporting the legal and constitutional  dependency of the colony on the crown and parliament of great britain   but wanted power sufficient for maintaining the dignity and authority of  his government  and carrying that act into execution  several old and  wise men joined him  and declared that they had formerly taken an active  part in bringing the province under his majesty s care  but would now be  very cautious of resisting the authority of parliament  and robbing it of  that protection which it had so long and so happily enjoyed  the members  of assembly  finding the lieutenant governor determined to transact no  public business but in compliance with the act of parliament  began to  deliberate how they might best elude it  for this purpose they addressed  him  begging to be informed whether the stamp act  said to be passed in  parliament  had been transmitted to him by the secretary of state  the  lords of trade  or any other authentic channel  since he considered  himself as under obligations to enforce it  he replied  that he had  received it from thomas boone  the governor of the province  the assembly  declared  that they could consider mr  boone  while out of the bounds of  his government  in no other light than that of a private gentleman  and  that his receiving it in such a channel was not authority sufficient to  oblige him to execute so grievous an act  but mr  bull and his council  were of opinion  that the channel in which he had received it was equally  authentic with that in which he had formerly received many laws  to which  they had quietly submitted  upon which the assembly came to the following  resolutions  which were signed by peter manigault their speaker  and  ordered to be printed  that they might be transmitted to posterity  in  order to shew the sense of that house with respect to the obedience due  by america to the british parliament          sidenote  their resolutions respecting the obedience due to the      british parliament      resolved  that his majesty s subjects in carolina owe the same  allegiance to the crown of great britain that is due from its subjects  born there  that his majesty s liege subjects of this province are  entitled to all the inherent rights and liberties of his natural born  subjects within the kingdom of great britain  that the inhabitants of  this province appear also to be confirmed in all the rights  aforementioned  not only by their character  but by an act of parliament     th george ii  that it is inseparably essential to the freedom of a  people  and the undoubted right of englishmen  that no taxes be imposed  on them but with their own consent  that the people of this province are  not  and from their local circumstances cannot be represented in the  house of commons in great britain  and farther  that  in the opinion of  this house  the several powers of legislation in america were constituted  in some measure upon the apprehension of this impracticability  that the  only representatives of the people of this province are persons chosen  therein by themselves  and that no taxes ever have been  or can be   constitutionally imposed on them but by the legislature of this province   that all supplies to the crown being free gifts of the people  it is  unreasonable and inconsistent with the principles and spirit of the  british constitution for the people of great britain to grant to his  majesty the property of the people of this province  that trial by jury  is the inherent and invaluable right of every british subject in this  province  that the act of parliament  entitled  an act for granting and  applying certain stamp duties and other duties on the british colonies  and plantations in america    c   by imposing taxes on the inhabitants of  this province  and the said act and several other acts  by extending the  jurisdiction of the courts of admiralty beyond its ancient limits  have a  manifest tendency to subvert the rights and liberties of this province   that the duties imposed by several late acts of parliament on the people  of this province will be extremely burdensome and grievous  and  from the  scarcity of gold and silver  the payment of them absolutely  impracticable  that as the profits of the trade of the people of this  province ultimately center in great britain  to pay for the manufactures  which they are obliged to take from thence  they eventually contribute  very largely to all the supplies granted to the crown  and besides  as  every individual in this province is as advantageous at least to great  britain as if he were in great britain  as they pay their full proportion  of taxes for the support of his majesty s government here   which taxes  are equal  or more  in proportion to our estates  than those paid by our  fellow subjects in great britain upon theirs   it is unreasonable for  them to be called upon to pay any further part of the charges of  government there  that the assemblies of this province have from time to  time  whenever requisitions have been made to them by his majesty  for  carrying on military operations  either for the defence of themselves or  america in general  most cheerfully and liberally contributed their full  proportion of men and money for these services  that though the  representatives of the people of this province had equal assurances and  reasons with those of the other provinces  to expect a proportional  reimbursement of those immense charges they had been at for his majesty s  service in the late war  out of the several parliamentary grants for the  use of america  yet they have obtained only their proportion of the first  of those grants  and the small sum of l      sterling received since   that  notwithstanding  whenever his majesty s service shall for the  future require the aids of the inhabitants of this province  and they  shall be called upon for this purpose in a constitutional way  it shall  be their indispensable duty most cheerfully and liberally to grant to his  majesty their proportion  according to their ability  of men and money   for the defence  security  and other public services of the british  american colonies  that the restrictions on the trade of the people of  this province  together with the late duties and taxes imposed on them by  act of parliament  must necessarily greatly lessen the consumption of  british manufactures amongst them  that the increase  prosperity and  happiness of the people of this province  depend on the full and free  enjoyment of their rights and liberties  and on an affectionate  intercourse with great britain  that the readiness of the colonies to  comply with his majesty s requisitions  as well as their inability to  bear any additional taxes beyond what is laid on them by their respective  legislatures  is apparent from several grants of parliament  to reimburse  them part of the heavy expences they were at in the late war in america   that it is the right of the british subjects of this province to petition  the king  or either house of parliament  ordered  that these votes be  printed and made public  that a just sense of the liberty  and the firm  sentiments of loyalty of the representatives of the people of this  province  may be known to their constituents  and transmitted to  posterity           sidenote  the people become more violent in opposition to      government     notwithstanding these resolutions  few of the inhabitants of carolina   even the most sanguine  entertained the smallest hopes of a repeal  but  expected  after all their struggles  that they would be obliged to  submit   indeed a very small force in the province at that time would  have been sufficient to quell the tumults and insurrections of the  people  and enforce obedience to legal authority  but to the imprudence  of ministers  the faction in parliament  and the weakness of the civil  power in america  the resistance of the colonies may be ascribed  had the  stamp duty been laid on them without any previous notice of the  resolution of parliament  it is not improbable that they would have  received it as they had done other acts of the british legislature  or  had the parliament been unanimous in passing the act  and taken proper  measures for carrying it into execution  there is little doubt but the  colonies would have submitted to it  for however generally the people  might be indisposed for admitting of that or any other tax  yet a great  majority of them at this time were averse from calling in question the  supreme authority of the british parliament  but a small flame  which at  first is easily extinguished  when permitted to spread  has often been  productive of great conflagrations  the riotous and turbulent party   encouraged by the minority in england  set the feeble power of government  in america at defiance  the better sort of people mingled with the  rioters  and made use of the arguments of their friends in england to  inflame and exasperate them  at length  they not only agreed to adhere to  their former illegal combinations for distressing and starving the  english manufactures  but also to with hold from british merchants their  just debts  this they imagined would raise such commotions in britain as  could not fail to overturn the ministry  or intimidate the parliament          sidenote  the merchants and manufacturers in england join in      petitioning for relief     in consequence of these disturbances and combinations in america  great  evils began to be felt in england  and still greater to be feared  the  temporary interruption of commercial intercourse between the mother  country and the colonies was very prejudicial to both  that large body of  people engaged in preparing  purchasing and sending out goods to the  continent were deprived of employment  and consequently of the means of  subsistence  than which nothing could be conceived more likely to excite  commotions in england  the revenue suffered by the want of the export and  import duties  petitions flowed into parliament from all quarters  not  only from the colonies in america  but also from the trading and  manufacturing towns in great britain  praying for such relief as to that  house might seem expedient  at a juncture so alarming  the ministers  having neglected to take the proper measures to enforce their law  while  the matter was easy and practicable  were now obliged to yield to the  rising current  and resign their places  by the interposition of the duke  of cumberland  such a change in the administration took place as promised  an alteration of measures with respect to america  mr  pitt  who highly  disapproved of the scheme for raising a revenue from the colonies  having  long been detained by indisposition from parliament  had now so much  recovered as to be able to attend the house   the history of what follows  is disgraceful to great britain  being entirely composed of lenient  concessions in favour of a rising usurpation  and of such shameful  weakness and timidity in the ministry  as afterwards rendered the  authority of the british parliament in america feeble and contemptible          sidenote   the stamp act repealed     no sooner had this change in administration taken place  than all papers  and petitions relative to the stamp act  both from great britain and  america  were ordered to be laid before the house of commons  the house  resolved itself into a committee  to consider of those papers  about the  beginning of the year       leave was given to bring in a bill for  repealing an act of last session of parliament  entitled  an act for  granting and applying certain stamp duties and other duties  in the  british colonies and plantations in america  towards defraying the  expenses of protecting and securing the same  when this bill came into  parliament a warm debate ensued  and mr  pitt with several more members  strongly urged the necessity of a repeal  he made a distinction between  external and internal taxes  and denied not only the right of parliament  to impose the latter on the colonies  but also the justice  equity   policy and expediency of exercising that right  accordingly  while it was  declared that the king  by and with the consent of the lords spiritual  and temporal  and commons of great britain in parliament assembled  had   have  and of right ought to have  full power and authority to make laws  and statutes of sufficient force and validity to bind the colonies and  people of america  subjects of the crown of great britain  in all cases  whatsoever  the stamp act was repealed  because it appeared that the  continuance of it would be attended with many inconveniences  and might  be productive of consequences detrimental to the commercial interest of  these kingdoms          sidenote  which proves fatal to the jurisdiction of the british      parliament in america     this concession in favour of the rising usurpation  instead of proving  favourable to the commercial interests of the nation  had rather the  contrary effect  and served to set the colonies in some measure free from  the legislative authority of britain  it gave such importance to the  licentious party in america  and such superiority over the good and loyal  subjects as had a manifest tendency to throw the colonies into a state of  anarchy and confusion  it served to promote a doctrine among them  subversive of all good government  which plainly implied  that the  obedience of subjects was no longer due to the laws of the supreme  legislature  than they in their private judgments might think them  agreeable to their interest  or the particular notions which they may  have framed of a free constitution  while it gave countenance and  encouragement to the riotous and turbulent subjects in america  who at  that time were neither an opulent nor respectable party in the colonies   it exposed the real friends of government to popular prejudice  and  rendered their affections more cool  and their future endeavours in  support of government more feeble and ineffectual  for after repealing  the stamp act  without any previous submission on the part of the  colonies  how could it be expected that any gentleman would risque his  domestic peace  his fortune  or his life  in favour of a distant  government ready to desert him  and leave him subjected to all the  insults and outrages of future insurgents  how could it be imagined that  these colonies  that had set the power of great britain at defiance  and  obtained what they aimed at by tumults and insurrections  would  afterwards remain quiet  as they had opposed the stamp act  assigning for  reason that they were not represented in parliament  was it not evident  that the same reason would extend to all other laws which the parliament  might enact to bind them in times to come  or had enacted to bind them in  times past  the repeal of the stamp act upon such a principle  and in  such circumstances of tumult  unquestionably served to encourage the  colonies in disobedience  and to prepare their minds for asserting their  independence          sidenote  and gives occasion of triumph to the colonies     when the news of the repeal of this act reached america  it afforded the  colonists  as might have been expected  matter of great triumph  the most  extravagant demonstrations of joy  by bonfires  illuminations and ringing  of bells  were exhibited in every capital  the carolineans sent to  england for a marble statue of mr  pitt  and erected it in the middle of  charlestown  in grateful remembrance of the noble stand he had made in  defence of their rights and liberties  addresses were sent home to the  king  acknowledging the wisdom and justice of his government in the  repeal of the grievous act  and expressing their happiness that their  former harmony and commercial intercourse  so beneficial to both  countries  were restored  but soon after it appeared that the power of  great britain in america had received a fatal blow  such as she would  never be able to recover without the severest struggles and boldest  exertions  for whatever fair professions of friendship some colonies  might make  the strongest of them retained their natural aversion to  monarchy  and were well disposed for undermining the civil  establishments  and paving the way for their entire subversion  the  british government  formerly so much revered  was now deemed oppressive  and tyrannical  the little island  they said  had become jealous of their  dawning power and splendour  and it behoved every one to watch her  conduct with a sharp eye  and carefully guard their civil and religious  liberties  accordingly  for the future  we will find  that the more great  britain seemed to avoid  the more the colonies seemed to seek for   grounds of quarrel  and the more the former studied to unite  by the ties  of common interest  the more the latter strove to dissolve every  political and commercial connection  their minds and affections being  alienated from the mother country  they next discovered an uneasiness  under the restraints of legal authority  they quarrelled almost with  every governor  found fault with all instructions from england which  clashed with their leading passions and interests  and made use of every  art for weakening the hands of civil government  their friends in britain  had gloried that they had resisted  and now subjection of every kind was  called slavery  and the spirit of disorder and disobedience which had  broke out continued and prevailed  at length  even the navigation act was  deemed a yoke  which they wished to shake off  and throw their commerce  open to the whole world  several writers appeared in america in defence  of what they were pleased to call their natural rights  who had a lucky  talent of seasoning their compositions to the palate of the bulk of the  people  hence the seeds of disaffection which had sprung up in new  england spread through the other colonies  insomuch that multitudes  became infected with republican principles  and aspired after  independence   but here we shall stop for the present time  and leave the  account of their farther struggles towards the accomplishment of this  favourite plan to some future opportunity               at being discovered reading it  drawing his wife s hand through  his own  he led her back to her couch  folded the soft shawls about her   and  sitting in a low chair beside her  said in a cheerful tone  though  his eyes betrayed some hidden care   my love  that book is a history of  our family for centuries  and that old prophecy has never yet been  fulfilled  except the  heir and heiress  line  i am the last trevlyn   and as the time draws near when my child shall be born  i naturally  think of his future  and hope he will enjoy his heritage in peace       god grant it   softly echoed lady trevlyn  adding  with a look askance  at the old book   i read that history once  and fancied it must be a  romance  such dreadful things are recorded in it  is it all true   richard       yes  dear  i wish it was not  ours has been a wild  unhappy race till  the last generation or two  the stormy nature came in with old sir  ralph  the fierce norman knight  who killed his only son in a fit of  wrath  by a blow with his steel gauntlet  because the boy s strong will  would not yield to his       yes  i remember  and his daughter clotilde held the castle during a  siege  and married her cousin  count hugo   tis a warlike race  and i  like it in spite of the mad deeds       married her cousin  that has been the bane of our family in times past   being too proud to mate elsewhere  we have kept to ourselves till idiots  and lunatics began to appear  my father was the first who broke the law  among us  and i followed his example  choosing the freshest  sturdiest  flower i could find to transplant into our exhausted soil       i hope it will do you honor by blossoming bravely  i never forget that  you took me from a very humble home  and have made me the happiest wife  in england       and i never forget that you  a girl of eighteen  consented to leave  your hills and come to cheer the long deserted house of an old man like  me   returned her husband fondly      nay  don t call yourself old  richard  you are only forty five  the  boldest  handsomest man in warwickshire  but lately you look worried   what is it  tell me  and let me advise or comfort you       it is nothing  alice  except my natural anxiety for you  well   kingston  what do you want      trevlyn s tender tones grew sharp as he addressed the entering servant   and the smile on his lips vanished  leaving them dry and white as he  glanced at the card he handed him  an instant he stood staring at it   then asked   is the man here       in the library  sir       i ll come      flinging the card into the fire  he watched it turn to ashes before he  spoke  with averted eyes   only some annoying business  love  i shall  soon be with you again  lie and rest till i come      with a hasty caress he left her  but as he passed a mirror  his wife saw  an expression of intense excitement in his face  she said nothing  and  lay motionless for several minutes evidently struggling with some strong  impulse      he is ill and anxious  but hides it from me  i have a right to know   and he ll forgive me when i prove that it does no harm      as she spoke to herself she rose  glided noiselessly through the hall   entered a small closet built in the thickness of the wall  and  bending  to the keyhole of a narrow door  listened with a half smile on her lips  at the trespass she was committing  a murmur of voices met her ear  her  husband spoke oftenest  and suddenly some word of his dashed the smile  from her face as if with a blow  she started  shrank  and shivered   bending lower with set teeth  white cheeks  and panic stricken heart   paler and paler grew her lips  wilder and wilder her eyes  fainter and  fainter her breath  till  with a long sigh  a vain effort to save  herself  she sank prone upon the threshold of the door  as if struck  down by death      mercy on us  my lady  are you ill   cried hester  the maid  as her  mistress glided into the room looking like a ghost  half an hour later      i am faint and cold  help me to my bed  but do not disturb sir  richard      a shiver crept over her as she spoke  and  casting a wild  woeful look  about her  she laid her head upon the pillow like one who never cared to  lift it up again  hester  a sharp eyed  middle aged woman  watched the  pale creature for a moment  then left the room muttering   something is  wrong  and sir richard must know it  that black bearded man came for no  good  i ll warrant      at the door of the library she paused  no sound of voices came from  within  a stifled groan was all she heard  and without waiting to knock  she went in  fearing she knew not what  sir richard sat at his writing  table pen in hand  but his face was hidden on his arm  and his whole  attitude betrayed the presence of some overwhelming despair      please  sir  my lady is ill  shall i send for anyone      no answer  hester repeated her words  but sir richard never stirred   much alarmed  the woman raised his head  saw that he was unconscious   and rang for help  but richard trevlyn was past help  though he lingered  for some hours  he spoke but once  murmuring faintly   will alice come  to say good bye       bring her if she can come   said the physician     hester went  found her mistress lying as she left her  like a figure  carved in stone  when she gave the message  lady trevlyn answered  sternly   tell him i will not come   and turned her face to the wall   with an expression which daunted the woman too much for another word     hester whispered the hard answer to the physician  fearing to utter it  aloud  but sir richard heard it  and died with a despairing prayer for  pardon on his lips     when day dawned sir richard lay in his shroud and his little daughter in  her cradle  the one unwept  the other unwelcomed by the wife and mother   who  twelve hours before  had called herself the happiest woman in  england  they thought her dying  and at her own command gave her the  sealed letter bearing her address which her husband left behind him  she  read it  laid it in her bosom  and  waking from the trance which seemed  to have so strongly chilled and changed her  besought those about her  with passionate earnestness to save her life     for two days she hovered on the brink of the grave  and nothing but the  indomitable will to live saved her  the doctors said  on the third day  she rallied wonderfully  and some purpose seemed to gift her with  unnatural strength  evening came  and the house was very still  for all  the sad bustle of preparation for sir richard s funeral was over  and he  lay for the last night under his own roof  hester sat in the darkened  chamber of her mistress  and no sound broke the hush but the low lullaby  the nurse was singing to the fatherless baby in the adjoining room  lady  trevlyn seemed to sleep  but suddenly put back the curtain  saying  abruptly   where does he lie       in the state chamber  my lady   replied hester  anxiously watching the  feverish glitter of her mistress s eye  the flush on her cheek  and the  unnatural calmness of her manner      help me to go there  i must see him       it would be your death  my lady  i beseech you  don t think of it    began the woman  but lady trevlyn seemed not to hear her  and something  in the stern pallor of her face awed the woman into submission     wrapping the slight form of her mistress in a warm cloak  hester  half led  half carried her to the state room  and left her on the  threshold      i must go in alone  fear nothing  but wait for me here   she said  and  closed the door behind her     five minutes had not elapsed when she reappeared with no sign of grief  on her rigid face      take me to my bed and bring my jewel box   she said  with a shuddering  sigh  as the faithful servant received her with an exclamation of  thankfulness     when her orders had been obeyed  she drew from her bosom the portrait of  sir richard which she always wore  and  removing the ivory oval from the  gold case  she locked the former in a tiny drawer of the casket   replaced the empty locket in her breast  and bade hester give the jewels  to watson  her lawyer  who would see them put in a safe place till the  child was grown      dear heart  my lady  you ll wear them yet  for you re too young to  grieve all your days  even for so good a man as my blessed master  take  comfort  and cheer up  for the dear child s sake if no more       i shall never wear them again  was all the answer as lady trevlyn drew  the curtains  as if to shut out hope     sir richard was buried and  the nine days  gossip over  the mystery of  his death died for want of food  for the only person who could have  explained it was in a state which forbade all allusion to that tragic  day     for a year lady trevlyn s reason was in danger  a long fever left her so  weak in mind and body that there was little hope of recovery  and her  days were passed in a state of apathy sad to witness  she seemed to have  forgotten everything  even the shock which had so sorely stricken her   the sight of her child failed to rouse her  and month after month  slipped by  leaving no trace of their passage on her mind  and but  slightly renovating her feeble body     who the stranger was  what his aim in coming  or why he never  reappeared  no one discovered  the contents of the letter left by sir  richard were unknown  for the paper had been destroyed by lady trevlyn  and no clue could be got from her  sir richard had died of heart  disease  the physicians said  though he might have lived years had no  sudden shock assailed him  there were few relatives to make  investigations  and friends soon forgot the sad young widow  so the  years rolled on  and lillian the heiress grew from infancy to childhood  in the shadow of this mystery           chapter ii    paul       come  child  the dew is falling  and it is time we went in       no  no  mamma is not rested yet  so i may run down to the spring if i  like   and lillian  as willful as winsome  vanished among the tall ferns  where deer couched and rabbits hid     hester leisurely followed  looking as unchanged as if a day instead of  twelve years had passed since her arms received the little mistress  who  now ruled her like a tyrant  she had taken but a few steps when the  child came flying back  exclaiming in an excited tone   oh  come quick   there s a man there  a dead man  i saw him and i m frightened       nonsense  child  it s one of the keepers asleep  or some stroller who  has no business here  take my hand and we ll see who it is      somewhat reassured  lillian led her nurse to one of the old oaks beside  the path  and pointed to a figure lying half hidden in the fern  a  slender  swarthy boy of sixteen  with curly black hair  dark brows  and  thick lashes  a singularly stern mouth  and a general expression of  strength and pride  which added character to his boyish face and  dignified his poverty  his dress betrayed that  being dusty and  threadbare  his shoes much worn  and his possessions contained in the  little bundle on which he pillowed his head  he was sleeping like one  quite spent with weariness  and never stirred  though hester bent away  the ferns and examined him closely      he s not dead  my deary  he s asleep  poor lad  worn out with his day s  tramp  i dare say    i m glad he s alive  and i wish he d wake up  he s  a pretty boy  isn t he  see what nice hands he s got  and his hair is  more curly than mine  make him open his eyes  hester   commanded the  little lady  whose fear had given place to interest      hush  he s stirring  i wonder how he got in  and what he wants    whispered hester      i ll ask him   and before her nurse could arrest her  lillian drew a  tall fern softly over the sleeper s face  laughing aloud as she did so     the boy woke at the sound  and without stirring lay looking up at the  lovely little face bent over him  as if still in a dream       bella cara    he said  in a musical voice  then  as the child drew  back abashed at the glance of his large  bright eyes  he seemed to wake  entirely and  springing to his feet  looked at hester with a quick   searching glance  something in his face and air caused the woman to  soften her tone a little  as she said gravely   did you wish to see any  one at the hall       yes  is lady trevlyn here   was the boy s answer  as he stood cap in  hand  with the smile fading already from his face      she is  but unless your business is very urgent you had better see  parks  the keeper  we don t trouble my lady with trifles       i ve a note for her from colonel daventry  and as it is  not  a trifle   i ll deliver it myself  if you please      hester hesitated an instant  but lillian cried out   mamma is close by   come and see her   and led the way  beckoning as she ran     the lad followed with a composed air  and hester brought up the rear   taking notes as she went with a woman s keen eye     lady trevlyn  a beautiful  pale woman  delicate in health and melancholy  in spirit  sat on a rustic seat with a book in her hand  not reading   but musing with an absent mind  as the child approached  she held out  her hand to welcome her  but neither smiled nor spoke      mamma  here is a  a person to see you   cried lillian  rather at a loss  how to designate the stranger  whose height and gravity now awed her      a note from colonel daventry  my lady   and with a bow the boy  delivered the missive     scarcely glancing at him  she opened it and read      my dear friend       the bearer of this  paul jex  has been with me some months and has  served me well  i brought him from paris  but he is english born  and   though friendless  prefers to remain here  even after we leave  as we do  in a week  when i last saw you you mentioned wanting a lad to help in  the garden  paul is accustomed to that employment  though my wife used  him as a sort of page in the house  hoping you may be able to give him  shelter  i venture to send him  he is honest  capable  and trustworthy  in all respects  pray try him  and oblige       yours sincerely       j  r  daventry      the place is still vacant  and i shall be very glad to give it to you   if you incline to take it   said lady trevlyn  lifting her eyes from the  note and scanning the boy s face      i do  madam   he answered respectfully      the colonel says you are english   added the lady  in a tone of  surprise     the boy smiled  showing a faultless set of teeth  as he replied   i am   my lady  though just now i may not look it  being much tanned and very  dusty  my father was an englishman  but i ve lived abroad a good deal  since he died  and got foreign ways  perhaps      as he spoke without any accent  and looked full in her face with a pair  of honest blue eyes under the dark lashes  lady trevlyn s momentary  doubt vanished      your age  paul       sixteen  my lady       you understand gardening       yes  my lady       and what else       i can break horses  serve at table  do errands  read aloud  ride after  a young lady as groom  illuminate on parchment  train flowers  and make  myself useful in any way      the tone  half modest  half eager  in which the boy spoke  as well as  the odd list of his accomplishments  brought a smile to lady trevlyn s  lips  and the general air of the lad prepossessed her      i want lillian to ride soon  and roger is rather old for an escort to  such a little horsewoman  don t you think we might try paul   she said   turning to hester     the woman gravely eyed the lad from head to foot  and shook her head   but an imploring little gesture and a glance of the handsome eyes  softened her heart in spite of herself      yes  my lady  if he does well about the place  and parks thinks he s  steady enough  we might try it by and by      lillian clapped her hands and  drawing nearer  exclaimed confidingly  as  she looked up at her new groom   i know he ll do  mamma  i like him very  much  and i hope you ll let him train my pony for me  will you  paul       yes      as he spoke very low and hastily  the boy looked away from the eager  little face before him  and a sudden flush of color crossed his dark  cheek     hester saw it and said within herself   that boy has good blood in his  veins  he s no clodhopper s son  i can tell by his hands and feet  his  air and walk  poor lad  it s hard for him  i ll warrant  but he s not  too proud for honest work  and i like that       you may stay  paul  and we will try you for a month  hester  take him  to parks and see that he is made comfortable  tomorrow we will see what  he can do  come  darling  i am rested now      as she spoke  lady trevlyn dismissed the boy with a gracious gesture and  led her little daughter away  paul stood watching her  as if forgetful  of his companion  till she said  rather tartly   young man  you d better  have thanked my lady while she was here than stare after her now it s  too late  if you want to see parks  you d best come  for i m going       is that the family tomb yonder  where you found me asleep   was the  unexpected reply to her speech  as the boy quietly followed her  not at  all daunted by her manner      yes  and that reminds me to ask how you got in  and why you were  napping there  instead of doing your errand properly       i leaped the fence and stopped to rest before presenting myself  miss  hester  was the cool answer  accompanied by a short laugh as he  confessed his trespass      you look as if you d had a long walk  where are you from       london       bless the boy  it s fifty miles away       so my shoes show  but it s a pleasant trip in summer time       but why did you walk  child  had you no money       plenty  but not for wasting on coaches  when my own stout legs could  carry me  i took a two days  holiday and saved my money for better  things       i like that   said hester  with an approving nod   you ll get on  my  lad  if that s your way  and i ll lend a hand  for laziness is my  abomination  and one sees plenty nowadays       thank you  that s friendly  and i ll prove that i am grateful  please  tell me  is my lady ill       always delicate since sir richard died       how long ago was that       ten years or more       are there no young gentlemen in the family       no  miss lillian is an only child  and a sweet one  bless her       a proud little lady  i should say       and well she may be  for there s no better blood in england than the  trevlyns  and she s heiress to a noble fortune       is that the trevlyn coat of arms   asked the boy abruptly  pointing to  a stone falcon with the motto me and mine carved over the gate through  which they were passing      yes  why do you ask       mere curiosity  i know something of heraldry and often paint these  things for my own pleasure  one learns odd amusements abroad   he added   seeing an expression of surprise on the woman s face      you ll have little time for such matters here  come in and report  yourself to the keeper  and if you ll take my advice ask no questions of  him  for you ll get no answers       i seldom ask questions of men  as they are not fond of gossip   and the  boy nodded with a smile of mischievous significance as he entered the  keeper s lodge     a sharp lad and a saucy  if he likes  i ll keep my eye on him  for my  lady takes no more thought of such things than a child  and lillian  cares for nothing but her own will  he has a taking way with him   though  and knows how to flatter  it s well he does  poor lad  for  life s a hard matter to a friendless soul like him     as she thought these thoughts hester went on to the house  leaving paul  to win the good graces of the keeper  which he speedily did by assuming  an utterly different manner from that he had worn with the woman     that night  when the boy was alone in his own room  he wrote a long  letter in italian describing the events of the day  enclosed a sketch of  the falcon and motto  directed it to  father cosmo carmela  genoa   and  lay down to sleep  muttering  with a grim look and a heavy sigh   so far  so well  i ll not let my heart be softened by pity  or my purpose change  till my promise is kept  pretty child  i wish i had never seen her            chapter iii    secret service      in a week paul was a favorite with the household  even prudent hester  felt the charm of his presence  and owned that lillian was happier for a  young companion in her walks  hitherto the child had led a solitary  life  with no playmates of her own age  such being the will of my lady   therefore she welcomed paul as a new and delightful amusement   considering him her private property and soon transferring his duties  from the garden to the house  satisfied of his merits  my lady yielded  to lillian s demands  and paul was installed as page to the young lady   always respectful and obedient  he never forgot his place  yet seemed  unconsciously to influence all who approached him  and win the goodwill  of everyone     my lady showed unusual interest in the lad  and lillian openly displayed  her admiration for his accomplishments and her affection for her devoted  young servitor  hester was much flattered by the confidence he reposed  in her  for to her alone did he tell his story  and of her alone asked  advice and comfort in his various small straits  it was as she  suspected  paul was a gentleman s son  but misfortune had robbed him of  home  friends  and parents  and thrown him upon the world to shift for  himself  this sad story touched the woman s heart  and the boy s manly  spirit won respect  she had lost a son years ago  and her empty heart  yearned over the motherless lad  ashamed to confess the tender feeling   she wore her usual severe manner to him in public  but in private  softened wonderfully and enjoyed the boy s regard heartily      paul  come in  i want to speak with you a moment   said my lady  from  the long window of the library to the boy who was training vines  outside     dropping his tools and pulling off his hat  paul obeyed  looking a  little anxious  for the month of trial expired that day  lady trevlyn  saw and answered the look with a gracious smile      have no fears  you are to stay if you will  for lillian is happy and i  am satisfied with you       thank you  my lady   and an odd glance of mingled pride and pain shone  in the boy s downcast eyes      that is settled  then  now let me say what i called you in for  you  spoke of being able to illuminate on parchment  can you restore this old  book for me      she put into his hand the ancient volume sir richard had been reading  the day he died  it had lain neglected in a damp nook for years till my  lady discovered it  and  sad as were the associations connected with it   she desired to preserve it for the sake of the weird prophecy if nothing  else  paul examined it  and as he turned it to and fro in his hands it  opened at the page oftenest read by its late master  his eye kindled as  he looked  and with a quick gesture he turned as if toward the light  in  truth to hide the flash of triumph that passed across his face   carefully controlling his voice  he answered in a moment  as he looked  up  quite composed   yes  my lady  i can retouch the faded colors on  these margins and darken the pale ink of the old english text  i like  the work  and will gladly do it if you like       do it  then  but be very careful of the book while in your hands   provide what is needful  and name your own price for the work   said his  mistress      nay  my lady  i am already paid        how so   she asked  surprised     paul had spoken hastily  and for an instant looked embarrassed  but  answered with a sudden flush on his dark cheeks   you have been kind to  me  and i am glad to show my  gratitude in any way  my lady       let that pass  my boy  do this little service for me and we will see  about the recompense afterward   and with a smile lady trevlyn left him  to begin his work     the moment the door closed behind her a total change passed over paul   he shook his clenched hand after her with a gesture of menace  then  tossed up the old book and caught it with an exclamation of delight  as  he reopened it at the worn page and reread the inexplicable verse      another proof  another proof  the work goes bravely on  father cosmo   and boy as i am  i ll keep my word in spite of everything   he muttered      what is that you ll keep  lad   said a voice behind him      i ll keep my word to my lady  and do my best to restore this book  mrs   hester   he answered  quickly recovering himself      ah  that s the last book poor master read  i hid it away  but my lady  found it in spite of me   said hester  with a doleful sigh      did he die suddenly  then   asked the boy      dear heart  yes  i found him dying in this room with the ink scarce dry  on the letter he left for my lady  a mysterious business and a sad one       tell me about it  i like sad stories  and i already feel as if i  belonged to the family  a loyal retainer as in the old times  while you  dust the books and i rub the mold off this old cover  tell me the tale   please  mrs  hester      she shook her head  but yielded to the persuasive look and tone of the  boy  telling the story more fully than she intended  for she loved  talking and had come to regard paul as her own  almost      and the letter  what was in it   asked the boy  as she paused at the  catastrophe      no one ever knew but my lady       she destroyed it  then       i thought so  till a long time afterward  one of the lawyers came  pestering me with questions  and made me ask her  she was ill at the  time  but answered with a look i shall never forget   no  it s not  burnt  but no one shall ever see it   i dared ask no more  but i fancy  she has it safe somewhere and if it s ever needed she ll bring it out   it was only some private matters  i fancy       and the stranger       oh  he vanished as oddly as he came  and has never been found  a  strange story  lad  keep silent  and let it rest       no fear of my tattling   and the boy smiled curiously to himself as he  bent over the book  polishing the brassbound cover      what are you doing with that pretty white wax   asked lillian the next  day  as she came upon paul in a quiet corner of the garden and found him  absorbed in some mysterious occupation     with a quick gesture he destroyed his work  and  banishing a momentary  expression of annoyance  he answered in his accustomed tone as he began  to work anew   i am molding a little deer for you  miss lillian  see   here is a rabbit already done  and i ll soon have a stag also       it s very pretty  how many nice things you can do  and how kind you are  to think of my liking something new  was this wax what you went to get  this morning when you rode away so early   asked the child      yes  miss lillian  i was ordered to exercise your pony and i made him  useful as well  would you like to try this  it s very easy      lillian was charmed  and for several days wax modeling was her favorite  play  then she tired of it  and paul invented a new amusement  smiling  his inexplicable smile as he threw away the broken toys of wax      you are getting pale and thin  keeping such late hours  paul  go to  bed  boy  go to bed  and get your sleep early   said hester a week  afterward  with a motherly air  as paul passed her one morning      and how do you know i don t go to bed   he asked  wheeling about      my lady has been restless lately  and i sit up with her till she  sleeps  as i go to my room  i see your lamp burning  and last night i  got as far as your door  meaning to speak to you  but didn t  thinking  you d take it amiss  but really you are the worse for late hours   child       i shall soon finish restoring the book  and then i ll sleep  i hope i  don t disturb you  i have to grind my colors  and often make more noise  than i mean to      paul fixed his eyes sharply on the woman as he spoke  but she seemed  unconscious of it  and turned to go on  saying indifferently   oh   that s the odd sound  is it  no  it doesn t trouble me  so grind away   and make an end of it as soon as may be      an anxious fold in the boy s forehead smoothed itself away as he left  her  saying to himself with a sigh of relief   a narrow escape  it s  well i keep the door locked      the boy s light burned no more after that  and hester was content till a  new worry came to trouble her  on her way to her room late one night   she saw a tall shadow flit down one of the side corridors that branched  from the main one  for a moment she was startled  but  being a woman of  courage  she followed noiselessly  till the shadow seemed to vanish in  the gloom of the great hall      if the house ever owned a ghost i d say that s it  but it never did  so  i suspect some deviltry  i ll step to paul  he s not asleep  i dare say   he s a brave and a sensible lad  and with him i ll quietly search the  house      away she went  more nervous than she would own  and tapped at the boy s  door  no one answered  and  seeing that it was ajar  hester whisked in  so hurriedly that her candle went out  with an impatient exclamation at  her carelessness she glided to the bed  drew the curtain  and put forth  her hand to touch the sleeper  the bed was empty  a disagreeable thrill  shot through her  as she assured herself of the fact by groping along  the narrow bed  standing in the shadow of the curtain  she stared about  the dusky room  in which objects were visible by the light of a new  moon      lord bless me  what is the boy about  i do believe it was him i saw in  the    she got no further in her mental exclamation for the sound of  light approaching footsteps neared her  slipping around the bed she  waited in the shadow  and a moment after paul appeared  looking pale and  ghostly  with dark  disheveled hair  wide open eyes  and a cloak thrown  over his shoulders  without a pause he flung it off  laid himself in  bed  and seemed to sleep at once      paul  paul   whispered hester  shaking him  after a pause of  astonishment at the whole proceeding      hey  what is it   and he sat up  looking drowsily about him      come  come  no tricks  boy  what are you doing  trailing about the  house at this hour and in such trim       why  hester  is it you   he exclaimed with a laugh  as he shook off her  grip and looked up at her in surprise      yes  and well it is me  if it had been any of those silly girls  the  house would have been roused by this time  what mischief is afoot that  you leave your bed and play ghost in this wild fashion       leave my bed  why  my good soul  i haven t stirred  but have been  dreaming with all my might these two hours  what do you mean  hester      she told him as she relit her lamp  and stood eyeing him sharply the  while  when she finished he was silent a minute  then said  looking half  vexed and half ashamed   i see how it is  and i m glad you alone have  found me out  i walk in my sleep sometimes  hester  that s the truth  i  thought i d got over it  but it s come back  you see  and i m sorry for  it  don t be troubled  i never do any mischief or come to any harm  i  just take a quiet promenade and march back to bed again  did i frighten  you       just a trifle  but it s nothing  poor lad  you ll have to have a  bedfellow or be locked up  it s dangerous to go roaming about in this  way   said hester anxiously      it won t last long  for i ll get more tired and then i shall sleep  sounder  don t tell anyone  please  else they ll laugh at me  and that s  not pleasant  i don t mind your knowing for you seem almost like a  mother  and i thank you for it with all my heart      he held out his hand with the look that was irresistible to hester   remembering only that he was a motherless boy  she stroked the curly  hair off his forehead  and kissed him  with the thought of her own son  warm at her heart      good night  dear  i ll say nothing  but give you something that will  ensure quiet sleep hereafter      with that she left him  but would have been annoyed could she have seen  the convulsion of boyish merriment which took possession of him when  alone  for he laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks           chapter iv    vanished      he s a handsome lad  and one any woman might be proud to call her son    said hester to bedford  the stately butler  as they lingered at the hall  door one autumn morning to watch their young lady s departure on her  daily ride      you are right  mrs  hester  he s a fine lad  and yet he seems above his  place  though he does look the very picture of a lady s groom   replied  bedford approvingly     so he did  as he stood holding the white pony of his little mistress   for the boy gave an air to whatever he wore and looked like a gentleman  even in his livery  the dark blue coat with silver buttons  the silver  band about his hat  his white topped boots and bright spurs  spotless  gloves  and tightly drawn belt were all in perfect order  all becoming   and his handsome  dark face caused many a susceptible maid to blush and  simper as they passed him   gentleman paul   as the servants called him   was rather lofty and reserved among his mates  but they liked him  nonetheless  for hester had dropped hints of his story and quite a  little romance had sprung up about him  he stood leaning against the  docile creature  sunk in thought  and quite unconscious of the watchers  and whisperers close by  but as lillian appeared he woke up  attended to  his duties like a well trained groom  and lingered over his task as if  he liked it  down the avenue he rode behind her  but as they turned into  a shady lane lillian beckoned  saying  in the imperious tone habitual to  her   ride near me  i wish to talk      paul obeyed  and amused her with the chat she liked till they reached a  hazel copse  here he drew rein  and  leaping down  gathered a handful of  ripe nuts for her      how nice  let us rest a minute here  and while i eat a few  please pull  some of those flowers for mamma  she likes a wild nosegay better than  any i can bring her from the garden      lillian ate her nuts till paul came to her with a hatful of late flowers  and  standing by her  held the impromptu basket while she made up a  bouquet to suit her taste      you shall have a posy  too  i like you to wear one in your buttonhole  as the ladies  grooms do in the park   said the child  settling a  scarlet poppy in the blue coat      thanks  miss lillian  i ll wear your colors with all my heart   especially today  for it is my birthday   and paul looked up at the  blooming little face with unusual softness in his keen blue eyes      is it  why  then  you re seventeen  almost a man  aren t you       yes  thank heaven   muttered the boy  half to himself      i wish i was as old  i shan t be in my teens till autumn  i must give  you something  paul  because i like you very much  and you are always  doing kind things for me  what shall it be   and the child held out her  hand with a cordial look and gesture that touched the boy     with one of the foreign fashions which sometimes appeared when he forgot  himself  he kissed the small hand  saying impulsively   my dear little  mistress  i want nothing but your goodwill  and your forgiveness   he  added  under his breath      you have that already  paul  and i shall find something to add to it   but what is that   and she laid hold of a little locket which had  slipped into sight as paul bent forward in his salute     he thrust it back  coloring so deeply that the child observed it  and  exclaimed  with a mischievous laugh   it is your sweetheart  paul  i  heard bessy  my maid  tell hester she was sure you had one because you  took no notice of them  let me see it  is she pretty       very pretty   answered the boy  without showing the picture      do you like her very much   questioned lillian  getting interested in  the little romance      very much   and paul s black eyelashes fell      would you die for her  as they say in the old songs   asked the girl   melodramatically      yes  miss lillian  or live for her  which is harder       dear me  how very nice it must be to have anyone care for one so much    said the child innocently   i wonder if anybody ever will for me          love comes to all soon or late       and maketh gay or sad     for every bird will find its mate       and every lass a lad       sang paul  quoting one of hester s songs  and looking relieved that  lillian s thoughts had strayed from him  but he was mistaken      shall you marry this sweetheart of yours someday   asked lillian   turning to him with a curious yet wistful look      perhaps       you look as if there was no  perhaps  about it   said the child  quick  to read the kindling of the eye and the change in the voice that  accompanied the boy s reply      she is very young and i must wait  and while i wait many things may  happen to part us       is she a lady       yes  a wellborn  lovely little lady  and i ll marry her if i live    paul spoke with a look of decision  and a proud lift of the head that  contrasted curiously with the badge of servitude he wore     lillian felt this  and asked  with a sudden shyness coming over her    but you are a gentleman  and so no one will mind even if you are not  rich       how do you know what i am   he asked quickly      i heard hester tell the housekeeper that you were not what you seemed   and one day she hoped you d get your right place again  i asked mamma  about it  and she said she would not let me be with you so much if you  were not a fit companion for me  i was not to speak of it  but she means  to be your friend and help you by and by       does she      and the boy laughed an odd  short laugh that jarred on lillian s ear and  made her say reprovingly   you are proud  i know  but you ll let us help  you because we like to do it  and i have no brother to share my money  with       would you like one  or a sister   asked paul  looking straight into her  face with his piercing eyes      yes  indeed  i long for someone to be with me and love me  as mamma  can t       would you be willing to share everything with another person  perhaps  have to give them a great many things you like and now have all to  yourself       i think i should  i m selfish  i know  because everyone pets and spoils  me  but if i loved a person dearly i d give up anything to them  indeed  i would  paul  pray believe me      she spoke earnestly  and leaned on his shoulder as if to enforce her  words  the boy s arm stole around the little figure in the saddle  and a  beautiful bright smile broke over his face as he answered warmly   i do  believe it  dear  and it makes me happy to hear you say so  don t be  afraid  i m your equal  but i ll not forget that you are my little  mistress till i can change from groom to gentleman      he added the last sentence as he withdrew his arm  for lillian had  shrunk a little and blushed with surprise  not anger  at this first  breach of respect on the part of her companion  both were silent for a  moment  paul looking down and lillian busy with her nosegay  she spoke  first  assuming an air of satisfaction as she surveyed her work      that will please mamma  i m sure  and make her quite forget my naughty  prank of yesterday  do you know i offended her dreadfully by peeping  into the gold case she wears on her neck  she was asleep and i was  sitting by her  in her sleep she pulled it out and said something about  a letter and papa  i wanted to see papa s face  for i never did  because  the big picture of him is gone from the gallery where the others are  so  i peeped into the case when she let it drop and was so disappointed to  find nothing but a key       a key  what sort of a key   cried paul in an eager tone      oh  a little silver one like the key of my piano  or the black cabinet   she woke and was very angry to find me meddling       what did it belong to   asked paul      her treasure box  she said  but i don t know where or what that is  and  i dare not ask any more  for she forbade my speaking to her about it   poor mamma  i m always troubling her in some way or other      with a penitent sigh  lillian tied up her flowers and handed them to  paul to carry  as she did so  the change in his face struck her      how grim and old you look   she exclaimed   have i said anything that  troubles you       no  miss lillian  i m only thinking       then i wish you wouldn t think  for you get a great wrinkle in your  forehead  your eyes grow almost black  and your mouth looks fierce  you  are a very odd person  paul  one minute as gay as any boy  and the next  as grave and stern as a man with a deal of work to do       i  have  got a deal of work to do  so no wonder i look old and grim       what work  paul       to make my fortune and win my lady      when paul spoke in that tone and wore that look  lillian felt as if they  had changed places  and he was the master and she the servant  she  wondered over this in her childish mind  but proud and willful as she  was  she liked it  and obeyed him with unusual meekness when he  suggested that it was time to return  as he rode silently beside her   she stole covert glances at him from under her wide hat brim  and  studied his unconscious face as she had never done before  his lips  moved now and then but uttered no audible sound  his black brows were  knit  and once his hand went to his breast as if he thought of the  little sweetheart whose picture lay there     he s got a trouble  i wish he d tell me and let me help him if i can   i ll make him show me that miniature someday  for i m interested in that  girl  thought lillian with a pensive sigh     as he held his hand for her little foot in dismounting her at the hall  door  paul seemed to have shaken off his grave mood  for he looked up  and smiled at her with his blithest expression  but lillian appeared to  be the thoughtful one now and with an air of dignity  very pretty and  becoming  thanked her young squire in a stately manner and swept into  the house  looking tall and womanly in her flowing skirts     paul laughed as he glanced after her and  flinging himself onto his  horse  rode away to the stables at a reckless pace  as if to work off  some emotion for which he could find no other vent      here s a letter for you  lad  all the way from some place in italy  who  do you know there   said bedford  as the boy came back     with a hasty  thank you   paul caught the letter and darted away to his  own room  there to tear it open and  after reading a single line  to  drop into a chair as if he had received a sudden blow  growing paler and  paler he read on  and when the letter fell from his hands he exclaimed   in a tone of despair   how could he die at such a time      for an hour the boy sat thinking intently  with locked door  curtained  window  and several papers strewn before him  letters  memoranda  plans   drawings  and bits of parchment  all of which he took from a small  locked portfolio always worn about him  over these he pored with a face  in which hope  despondency  resolve  and regret alternated rapidly   taking the locket out he examined a ring which lay in one side  and the  childish face which smiled on him from the other  his eyes filled as he  locked and put it by  saying tenderly   dear little heart  i ll not  forget or desert her whatever happens  time must help me  and to time i  must leave my work  one more attempt and then i m off                                                   i ll go to bed now  hester  but while you get my things ready i ll take  a turn in the corridor  the air will refresh me      as she spoke  lady trevlyn drew her wrapper about her and paced softly  down the long hall lighted only by fitful gleams of moonlight and the  ruddy glow of the fire  at the far end was the state chamber  never used  now  and never visited except by hester  who occasionally went in to  dust and air it  and my lady  who always passed the anniversary of sir  richard s death alone there  the gallery was very dark  and she seldom  went farther than the last window in her restless walks  but as she now  approached she was startled to see a streak of yellow light under the  door  she kept the key herself and neither she nor hester had been there  that day  a cold shiver passed over her for  as she looked  the shadow  of a foot darkened the light for a moment and vanished as if someone had  noiselessly passed  obeying a sudden impulse  my lady sprang forward and  tried to open the door  it was locked  but as her hand turned the silver  knob a sound as if a drawer softly closed met her ear  she stooped to  the keyhole but it was dark  a key evidently being in the lock  she drew  back and flew to her room  snatched the key from her dressing table   and  bidding hester follow  returned to the hall      what is it  my lady   cried the woman  alarmed at the agitation of her  mistress      a light  a sound  a shadow in the state chamber  come quick   cried  lady trevlyn  adding  as she pointed to the door   there  there  the  light shines underneath  do you see it       no  my lady  it s dark   returned hester     it was  but never pausing my lady thrust in the key  and to her surprise  it turned  the door flew open  and the dim  still room was before them   hester boldly entered  and while her mistress slowly followed  she  searched the room  looking behind the tall screen by the hearth  up the  wide chimney  in the great wardrobe  and under the ebony cabinet  where  all the relics of sir richard were kept  nothing appeared  not even a  mouse  and hester turned to my lady with an air of relief  but her  mistress pointed to the bed shrouded in dark velvet hangings  and  whispered breathlessly   you forgot to look there      hester had not forgotten  but in spite of her courage and good sense she  shrank a little from looking at the spot where she had last seen her  master s dead face  she believed the light and sound to be phantoms of  my lady s distempered fancy  and searched merely to satisfy her  the  mystery of sir richard s death still haunted the minds of all who  remembered it  and even hester felt a superstitious dread of that room   with a nervous laugh she looked under the bed and  drawing back the  heavy curtains  said soothingly   you see  my lady  there s nothing  there      but the words died on her lips  for  as the pale glimmer of the candle  pierced the gloom of that funeral couch  both saw a face upon the  pillow  a pale face framed in dark hair and beard  with closed eyes and  the stony look the dead wear  a loud  long shriek that roused the house  broke from lady trevlyn as she fell senseless at the bedside  and  dropping both curtain and candle hester caught up her mistress and fled  from the haunted room  locking the door behind her     in a moment a dozen servants were about them  and into their astonished  ears hester poured her story while vainly trying to restore her lady   great was the dismay and intense the unwillingness of anyone to obey  when hester ordered the men to search the room again  for she was the  first to regain her self possession      where s paul  he s the heart of a man  boy though he is   she said  angrily as the men hung back      he s not here  lord  maybe it was him a playing tricks  though it ain t  like him   cried bessy  lillian s little maid      no  it can t be him  for i locked him in myself  he walks in his sleep  sometimes  and i was afraid he d startle my lady  let him sleep  this  would only excite him and set him to marching again  follow me  bedford  and james  i m not afraid of ghosts or rogues      with a face that belied her words hester led the way to the awful room   and flinging back the curtain resolutely looked in  the bed was empty   but on the pillow was plainly visible the mark of a head and a single  scarlet stain  as of blood  at that sight hester turned pale and caught  the butler s arm  whispering with a shudder   do you remember the night  we put him in his coffin  the drop of blood that fell from his white  lips  sir richard has been here       good lord  ma am  don t say that  we can never rest in our beds if such  things are to happen   gasped bedford  backing to the door      it s no use to look  we ve found all we shall find so go your ways and  tell no one of this   said the woman in a gloomy tone  and  having  assured herself that the windows were fast  hester locked the room and  ordered everyone but bedford and the housekeeper to bed   do you sit  outside my lady s door till morning   she said to the butler   and you   mrs  price  help me to tend my poor lady  for if i m not mistaken this  night s work will bring on the old trouble      morning came  and with it a new alarm  for  though his door was fast  locked and no foothold for even a sparrow outside the window  paul s  room was empty  and the boy nowhere to be found           chapter v    a hero      four years had passed  and lillian was fast blooming into a lovely  woman  proud and willful as ever  but very charming  and already a belle  in the little world where she still reigned a queen  owing to her  mother s ill health  she was allowed more freedom than is usually  permitted to an english girl of her age  and  during the season  often  went into company with a friend of lady trevlyn s who was chaperoning  two young daughters of her own  to the world lillian seemed a gay   free hearted girl  and no one  not even her mother  knew how well she  remembered and how much she missed the lost paul  no tidings of him had  ever come  and no trace of him was found after his flight  nothing was  missed  he went without his wages  and no reason could be divined for  his departure except the foreign letter  bedford remembered it  but  forgot what postmark it bore  for he had only been able to decipher   italy   my lady made many inquiries and often spoke of him  but when  month after month passed and no news came  she gave him up  and on  lillian s account feigned to forget him  contrary to hester s fear  she  did not seem the worse for the nocturnal fright  but evidently connected  the strange visitor with paul  or  after a day or two of nervous  exhaustion  returned to her usual state of health  hester had her own  misgivings  but  being forbidden to allude to the subject  she held her  peace  after emphatically declaring that paul would yet appear to set  her mind at rest      lillian  lillian  i ve such news for you  come and hear a charming  little romance  and prepare to see the hero of it   cried maud  churchill  rushing into her friend s pretty boudoir one day in the  height of the season     lillian lay on a couch  rather languid after a ball  and listlessly  begged maud to tell her story  for she was dying to be amused      well my  dear  just listen and you ll be as enthusiastic as i am    cried maud  and throwing her bonnet on one chair  her parasol on  another  and her gloves anywhere  she settled herself on the couch and  began   you remember reading in the papers  some time ago  that fine  account of the young man who took part in the italian revolution and did  that heroic thing with the bombshell       yes  what of him   asked lillian  sitting up      he is my hero  and we are to see him tonight       go on  go on  tell all  and tell it quickly   she cried      you know the officers were sitting somewhere  holding a council  while  the city  i forget the name  was being bombarded  and how a shell came  into the midst of them  how they sat paralyzed  expecting it to burst   and how this young man caught it up and ran out with it  risking his own  life to save theirs       yes  yes  i remember   and lillian s listless face kindled at the  recollection      well  an englishman who was there was so charmed by the act that   finding the young man was poor and an orphan  he adopted him  mr  talbot  was old  and lonely  and rich  and when he died  a year after  he left  his name and fortune to this paolo       i m glad  i m glad   cried lillian  clapping her hands with a joyful  face   how romantic and charming it is       isn t it  but  my dear creature  the most romantic part is to come   young talbot served in the war  and then came to england to take  possession of his property  it s somewhere down in kent  a fine place  and good income  all his  and he deserves it  mamma heard a deal about  him from mrs  langdon  who knew old talbot and has seen the young man   of course all the girls are wild to behold him  for he is very handsome  and accomplished  and a gentleman by birth  but the dreadful part is  that he is already betrothed to a lovely greek girl  who came over at  the same time  and is living in london with a companion  quite  elegantly  mrs  langdon says  for she called and was charmed   this girl has been seen by some of our gentlemen friends  and they  already rave about the  fair helene   for that s her name      here maud was forced to stop for breath  and lillian had a chance to  question her      how old is she       about eighteen or nineteen  they say       very pretty       ravishing  regularly greek and divine  fred raleigh says       when is she to be married       don t know  when talbot gets settled  i fancy       and he  is he as charming as she       quite  i m told  he s just of age  and is  in appearance as in  everything else  a hero of romance       how came your mother to secure him for tonight       mrs  langdon is dying to make a lion of him  and begged to bring him   he is very indifferent on such things and seems intent on his own  affairs  is grave and old for his years  and doesn t seem to care much  for pleasure and admiration  as most men would after a youth like his   for he has had a hard time  i believe  for a wonder  he consented to  come when mrs  langdon asked him  and i flew off at once to tell you and  secure you for tonight       a thousand thanks  i meant to rest  for mamma frets about my being so  gay  but she won t object to a quiet evening with you  what shall we  wear   and here the conversation branched off on the all absorbing topic  of dress     when lillian joined her friend that evening  the hero had already  arrived  and  stepping into a recess  she waited to catch a glimpse of  him  maud was called away  and she was alone when the crowd about the  inner room thinned and permitted young talbot to be seen  well for  lillian that no one observed her at that moment  for she grew pale and  sank into a chair  exclaiming below her breath   it is paul   my  paul      she recognized him instantly  in spite of increased height  a dark  moustache  and martial bearing  it was paul  older  graver  handsomer   but still  her paul   as she called him  with a flush of pride and  delight as she watched him  and felt that of all there she knew him best  and loved him most  for the childish affection still existed  and this  discovery added a tinge of romance that made it doubly dangerous as well  as doubly pleasant     will he know me  she thought  glancing at a mirror which reflected a  slender figure with bright hair  white arms  and brilliant eyes  a  graceful little head  proudly carried  and a sweet mouth  just then very  charming  as it smiled till pearly teeth shone between the ruddy lips     i m glad i m not ugly  and i hope he ll like me  she thought  as she  smoothed the golden ripples on her forehead  settled her sash  and shook  out the folds of her airy dress in a flutter of girlish excitement    i ll pretend not to know him  when we meet  and see what he will do    she said  with a wicked sense of power  for being forewarned she was  forearmed  and  fearing no betrayal of surprise on her own part  was  eager to enjoy any of which he might be guilty     leaving her nook  she joined a group of young friends and held herself  prepared for the meeting  presently she saw maud and mrs  langdon  approaching  evidently intent on presenting the hero to the heiress      mr  talbot  miss trevlyn   said the lady  and looking up with a  well assumed air of indifference  lillian returned the gentleman s bow  with her eyes fixed full upon his face     not a feature of that face changed  and so severely unconscious of any  recognition was it that the girl was bewildered  for a moment she  fancied she had been mistaken in his identity  and a pang of  disappointment troubled her  but as he moved a chair for maud  she saw  on the one ungloved hand a little scar which she remembered well  for he  received it in saving her from a dangerous fall  at the sight all the  happy past rose before her  and if her telltale eyes had not been  averted they would have betrayed her  a sudden flush of maidenly shame  dyed her cheek as she remembered that last ride  and the childish  confidences then interchanged  this helen was the little sweetheart  whose picture he wore  and now  in spite of all obstacles  he had won  both fortune and ladylove  the sound of his voice recalled her thoughts   and glancing up she met the deep eyes fixed on her with the same steady  look they used to wear  he had addressed her  but what he said she knew  not  beyond a vague idea that it was some slight allusion to the music  going on in the next room  with a smile which would serve for an answer  to almost any remark  she hastily plunged into conversation with a  composure that did her credit in the eyes of her friends  who stood in  awe of the young hero  for all were but just out      mr  talbot hardly needs an introduction here  for his name is  well known among us  though this is perhaps his first visit to england    she said  flattering herself that this artful speech would entrap him  into the reply she wanted     with a slight frown  as if the allusion to his adventure rather annoyed  him  and a smile that puzzled all but lillian  he answered very simply    it is not my first visit to this hospitable island  i was here a few  years ago  for a short time  and left with regret       then you have old friends here   and lillian watched him as she spoke      i had  they had doubtless forgotten me now   he said  with a sudden  shadow marring the tranquillity of his face      why doubt them  if they were true friends  they will not forget      the words were uttered impulsively  almost warmly  but talbot made no  response  except a polite inclination and an abrupt change in the  conversation      that remains to be proved  do you sing  miss trevlyn       a little   and lillian s tone was both cold and proud      a great deal  and very charmingly   added maud  who took pride in her  friend s gifts both of voice and beauty   come  dear  there are so few  of us you will sing  i know  mamma desired me to ask you when edith had  done      to her surprise lillian complied  and allowed talbot to lead her to the  instrument  still hoping to win some sign of recognition from him  the  girl chose an air he taught her and sang it with a spirit and skill that  surprised the listeners who possessed no key to her mood  at the last  verse her voice suddenly faltered  but talbot took up the song and  carried her safely through it with his well tuned voice      you know the air then   she said in a low tone  as a hum of  commendation followed the music      all italians sing it  though few do it like yourself   he answered  quietly  restoring the fan he had held while standing beside her     provoking boy  why won t he know me  thought lillian  and her tone was  almost petulant as she refused to sing again     talbot offered his arm and led her to a seat  behind which stood a  little statuette of a child holding a fawn by a daisy chain      pretty  isn t it   she said  as he paused to look at it instead of  taking the chair before her   i used to enjoy modeling tiny deer and  hinds in wax  as well as making daisy chains  is sculpture among the  many accomplishments which rumor tells us you possess       no  those who  like me  have their own fortunes to mold find time for  little else   he answered gravely  still examining the marble group     lillian broke her fan with an angry flirt  for she was tired of her  trial  and wished she had openly greeted him at the beginning  feeling  now how pleasant it would have been to sit chatting of old times  while  her friends dared hardly address him at all  she was on the point of  calling him by his former name  when the remembrance of what he had been  arrested the words on her lips  he was proud  would he not dread to have  it known that  in his days of adversity  he had been a servant  for if  she betrayed her knowledge of his past  she would be forced to tell  where and how that knowledge was gained  no  better wait till they met  alone  she thought  he would thank her for her delicacy  and she could  easily explain her motive  he evidently wished to seem a stranger  for  once she caught a gleam of the old  mirthful mischief in his eye  as she  glanced up unexpectedly  he did remember her  she was sure  yet was  trying her  perhaps  as she tried him  well  she would stand the test  and enjoy the joke by and by  with this fancy in her head she assumed a  gracious air and chatted away in her most charming style  feeling both  gay and excited  so anxious was she to please  and so glad to recover  her early friend  a naughty whim seized her as her eye fell on a  portfolio of classical engravings which someone had left in disorder on  a table near her  tossing them over she asked his opinion of several   and then handed him one in which helen of troy was represented as giving  her hand to the irresistible paris      do you think her worth so much bloodshed  and deserving so much  praise   she asked  vainly trying to conceal the significant smile that  would break loose on her lips and sparkle in her eyes     talbot laughed the short  boyish laugh so familiar to her ears  as he  glanced from the picture to the arch questioner  and answered in a tone  that made her heart beat with a nameless pain and pleasure  so full of  suppressed ardor was it      yes   all for love or the world well lost  is a saying i heartily agree  to  la belle helene is my favorite heroine  and i regard paris as the  most enviable of men       i should like to see her      the wish broke from lillian involuntarily  and she was too much confused  to turn it off by any general expression of interest in the classical  lady      you may sometime   answered talbot  with an air of amusement  adding   as if to relieve her   i have a poetical belief that all the lovely  women of history or romance will meet  and know  and love each other in  some charming hereafter       but i m no heroine and no beauty  so i shall never enter your poetical  paradise   said lillian  with a pretty affectation of regret      some women are beauties without knowing it  and the heroines of  romances never given to the world  i think you and helen will yet meet   miss trevlyn      as he spoke  mrs  langdon beckoned  and he left her pondering over his  last words  and conscious of a secret satisfaction in his implied  promise that she should see his betrothed      how do you like him   whispered maud  slipping into the empty chair      very well   was the composed reply  for lillian enjoyed her little  mystery too much to spoil it yet      what did you say to him  i longed to hear  for you seemed to enjoy  yourselves very much  but i didn t like to be a marplot      lillian repeated a part of the conversation  and maud professed to be  consumed with jealousy at the impression her friend had evidently made      it is folly to try to win the hero  for he is already won  you know    answered lillian  shutting the cover on the pictured helen with a sudden  motion as if glad to extinguish her      oh dear  no  mrs  langdon just told mamma that she was mistaken about  their being engaged  for she asked him and he shook his head  saying  helen was his ward       but that is absurd  for he s only a boy himself  it s very odd  isn t  it  never mind  i shall soon know all about it       how   cried maud  amazed at lillian s assured manner      wait a day or two and  i ll tell you a romance in return for yours   your mother beckons to me  so i know hester has come  good night  i ve  had a charming time      and with this tantalizing adieu  lillian slipped away  hester was  waiting in the carriage  but as lillian appeared  talbot put aside the  footman and handed her in  saying very low  in the well remembered tone      good night  my little mistress            chapter vi    fair helen      to no one but her mother and hester did lillian confide the discovery  she had made  none of the former servants but old bedford remained with  them  and till paul chose to renew the old friendship it was best to  remain silent  great was the surprise and delight of our lady and hester  at the good fortune of their protege  and many the conjectures as to how  he would explain his hasty flight      you will go and see him  won t you  mamma  or at least inquire about  him   said lillian  eager to assure the wanderer of a welcome  for those  few words of his had satisfied her entirely      no  dear  it is for him to seek us  and till he does  i shall make no  sign  he knows where we are  and if he chooses he can renew the  acquaintance so strangely broken off  be patient  and above all things  remember  lillian  that you are no longer a child   replied my lady   rather disturbed by her daughter s enthusiastic praises of paul      i wish i was  for then i might act as i feel  and not be afraid of  shocking the proprieties   and lillian went to bed to dream of her hero     for three days she stayed at home  expecting paul  but he did not come   and she went out for her usual ride in the park  hoping to meet him  an  elderly groom now rode behind her  and she surveyed him with extreme  disgust  as she remembered the handsome lad who had once filled that  place  nowhere did paul appear  but in the ladies  mile she passed an  elegant brougham in which sat a very lovely girl and a mild old lady      that is talbot s fiancee   said maud churchill  who had joined her    isn t she beautiful       not at all  yes  very   was lillian s somewhat peculiar reply  for  jealousy and truth had a conflict just then   he s so perfectly absorbed  and devoted that i am sure that story is true  so adieu to our hopes    laughed maud      did you have any  good bye  i must go   and lillian rode home at a pace  which caused the stout groom great distress      mamma  i ve seen paul s betrothed   she cried  running into her  mother s boudoir      and i have seen paul himself   replied my lady  with a warning look   for there he stood  with half extended hand  as if waiting to be  acknowledged     lillian forgot her embarrassment in her pleasure  and made him an  elaborate curtsy  saying  with a half merry  half reproachful glance    mr  talbot is welcome in whatever guise he appears       i choose to appear as paul  then  and offer you a seat  miss lillian    he said  assuming as much of his boyish manner as he could     lillian took it and tried to feel at ease  but the difference between  the lad she remembered and the man she now saw was too great to be  forgotten      now tell us your adventures  and why you vanished away so mysteriously  four years ago   she said  with a touch of the childish imperiousness in  her voice  though her frank eyes fell before his      i was about to do so when you appeared with news concerning my cousin    he began      your cousin   exclaimed lillian      yes  helen s mother and my own were sisters  both married englishmen   both died young  leaving us to care for each other  we were like a  brother and sister  and always together till i left her to serve colonel  daventry  the death of the old priest to whom i entrusted her recalled  me to genoa  for i was then her only guardian  i meant to have taken  leave of you  my lady  properly  but the consequences of that foolish  trick of mine frightened me away in the most unmannerly fashion       ah  it was you  then  in the state chamber  i always thought so   and  lady trevlyn drew a long breath of relief      yes  i heard it whispered among the servants that the room was haunted   and i felt a wish to prove the truth of the story and my own courage   hester locked me in  for fear of my sleepwalking  but i lowered myself  by a rope and then climbed in at the closet window of the state chamber   when you came  my lady  i thought it was hester  and slipped into the  bed  meaning to give her a fright in return for her turning the key on  me  but when your cry showed me what i had done  i was filled with  remorse  and escaped as quickly and quietly as possible  i should have  asked pardon before  i do now  most humbly  my lady  for it was  sacrilege to play pranks  there       during the first part of his story paul s manner had been frank and  composed  but in telling the latter part  his demeanor underwent a  curious change  he fixed his eyes on the ground and spoke as if  repeating a lesson  while his color varied  and a half proud   half submissive expression replaced the former candid one  lillian  observed this  and it disturbed her  but my lady took it for shame at  his boyish freak and received his confession kindly  granting a free  pardon and expressing sincere pleasure at his amended fortunes  as he  listened  lillian saw him clench his hand hard and knit his brows   assuming the grim look she had often seen  as if trying to steel himself  against some importunate emotion or rebellious thought      yes  half my work is done  and i have a home  thanks to my generous  benefactor  and i hope to enjoy it well and wisely   he said in a grave  tone  as if the fortune had not yet brought him his heart s desire      and when is the other half of the work to be accomplished  paul  that  depends on your cousin  perhaps   and lady trevlyn regarded him with a  gleam of womanly curiosity in her melancholy eyes      it does  but not in the way you fancy  my lady  whatever helen may be   she is not my fiancee yet  miss lillian   and the shadow lifted as he  laughed  looking at the young lady  who was decidedly abashed  in spite  of a sense of relief caused by his words      i merely accepted the world s report   she said  affecting a nonchalant  air      the world is a liar  as you will find in time  was his abrupt reply      i hope to see this beautiful cousin  paul  will she receive us as old  friends of yours       thanks  not yet  my lady  she is still too much a stranger here to  enjoy new faces  even kind ones  i have promised perfect rest and  freedom for a time  but you shall be the first whom she receives      again lillian detected the secret disquiet which possessed him  and her  curiosity was roused  it piqued her that this helen felt no desire to  meet her and chose to seclude herself  as if regardless of the interest  and admiration she excited   i  will  see her in spite of her refusal   for i only caught a glimpse in the park  something is wrong  and i ll  discover it  for it evidently worries paul  and perhaps i can help him      as this purpose sprang up in the warm but willful heart of the girl  she  regained her spirits and was her most charming self while the young man  stayed  they talked of many things in a pleasant  confidential manner   though when lillian recalled that hour  she was surprised to find how  little paul had really told them of his past life or future plans  it  was agreed among them to say nothing of their former relations  except  to old bedford  who was discretion itself  but to appear to the world as  new made friends  thus avoiding unpleasant and unnecessary explanations  which would only excite gossip  my lady asked him to dine  but he had  business out of town and declined  taking his leave with a lingering  look  which made lillian steal away to study her face in the mirror and  wonder if she looked her best  for in paul s eyes she had read  undisguised admiration     lady trevlyn went to her room to rest  leaving the girl free to ride   drive  or amuse herself as she liked  as if fearing her courage would  fail if she delayed  lillian ordered the carriage  and  bidding hester  mount guard over her  she drove away to st  john s wood      now  hester  don t lecture or be prim when i tell you that we are going  on a frolic   she began  after getting the old woman into an amiable  mood by every winning wile she could devise   i think you ll like it   and if it s found out i ll take the blame  there is some mystery about  paul s cousin  and i m going to find it out       bless you  child  how       she lives alone here  is seldom seen  and won t go anywhere or receive  anyone  that s not natural in a pretty girl  paul won t talk about her   and  though he s fond of her  he always looks grave and grim when i ask  questions  that s provoking  and i won t hear it  maud is engaged to  raleigh  you know  well  he confided to her that he and a friend had  found out where helen was  had gone to the next villa  which is empty   and under pretense of looking at it got a peep at the girl in her  garden  i m going to do the same       and what am  i  to do   asked hester  secretly relishing the prank   for she was dying with curiosity to behold paul s cousin      you are to do the talking with the old woman  and give me a chance to  look  now say you will  and i ll behave myself like an angel in return      hester yielded  after a few discreet scruples  and when they reached  laburnum lodge played her part so well that lillian soon managed to  stray away into one of the upper rooms which overlooked the neighboring  garden  helen was there  and with eager eyes the girl scrutinized her   she was very beautiful  in the classical style  as fair and finely  molded as a statue  with magnificent dark hair and eyes  and possessed  of that perfect grace which is as effective as beauty  she was alone   and when first seen was bending over a flower which she caressed and  seemed to examine with great interest as she stood a long time  motionless before it  then she began to pace slowly around and around  the little grass plot  her hands hanging loosely clasped before her  and  her eyes fixed on vacancy as if absorbed in thought  but as the first  effect of her beauty passed away  lillian found something peculiar about  her  it was not the somewhat foreign dress and ornaments she wore  it  was in her face  her movements  and the tone of her voice  for as she  walked she sang a low  monotonous song  as if unconsciously  lillian  watched her keenly  marking the aimless motions of the little hands  the  apathy of the lovely face  and the mirthless accent of the voice  but  most of all the vacant fixture of the great dark eyes  around and around  she went  with an elastic step and a mechanical regularity wearisome to  witness     what is the matter with her  thought lillian anxiously  as this painful  impression increased with every scrutiny of the unconscious girl  so  abashed was she that hester s call was unheard  and hester was unseen as  she came and stood beside her  both looked a moment  and as they looked  an old lady came from the house and led helen in  still murmuring her  monotonous song and moving her hands as if to catch and hold the  sunshine      poor dear  poor dear  no wonder paul turns sad and won t talk of her   and that she don t see anyone   sighed hester pitifully      what is it  i see  but don t understand   whispered lillian      she s an innocent  deary  an idiot  though that s a hard word for a  pretty creature like her       how terrible  come away  hester  and never breathe to anyone what we  have seen   and with a shudder and sense of pain and pity lying heavy at  her heart  she hurried away  feeling doubly guilty in the discovery of  this affliction  the thought of it haunted her continually  the memory  of the lonely girl gave her no peace  and a consciousness of deceit  burdened her unspeakably  especially in paul s presence  this lasted for  a week  then lillian resolved to confess  hoping that when he found she  knew the truth he would let her share his cross and help to lighten it   waiting her opportunity  she seized a moment when her mother was absent   and with her usual frankness spoke out impetuously      paul  i ve done wrong  and i can have no peace till i am pardoned  i  have seen helen       where  when  and how   he asked  looking disturbed and yet relieved     she told him rapidly  and as she ended she looked up at him with her  sweet face  so full of pity  shame  and grief it would have been  impossible to deny her anything      can you forgive me for discovering this affliction       i think i could forgive you a far greater fault  lillian   he answered   in a tone that said many things      but deceit is so mean  so dishonorable and contemptible  how can you so  easily pardon it in me   she asked  quite overcome by this forgiveness   granted without any reproach      then you would find it hard to pardon such a thing in another   he  said  with the expression that always puzzled her      yes  it would be hard  but in those i loved  i could forgive much for  love s sake      with a sudden gesture he took her hand saying  impulsively   how little  changed you are  do you remember that last ride of ours nearly five  years ago       yes  paul   she answered  with averted eyes      and what we talked of       a part of that childish gossip i remember well       which part       the pretty little romance you told me   and lillian looked up now   longing to ask if helen s childhood had been blighted like her youth     paul dropped her hand as if he  read her thoughts  and his own hand went  involuntarily toward his breast  betraying that the locket still hung  there      what did i say   he asked  smiling at her sudden shyness      you vowed you d win and wed your fair little lady love if you lived       and so i will   he cried  with sudden fire in his eyes      what  marry her       aye  that i will       oh paul  will you tie yourself for life to a    the word died on her  lips  but a gesture of repugnance finished the speech      a what   he demanded  excitedly      an innocent  one bereft of reason   stammered lillian  entirely  forgetting herself in her interest for him      of whom do you speak   asked paul  looking utterly bewildered      of poor helen       good heavens  who told you that base lie   and his voice deepened with  indignant pain      i saw her  you did not deny her affliction  hester said so  and i  believed it  have i wronged her  paul       yes  cruelly  she is blind  but no idiot  thank god      there was such earnestness in his voice  such reproach in his words  and  such ardor in his eye  that lillian s pride gave way  and with a broken  entreaty for pardon  she covered up her face  weeping the bitterest  tears she ever shed  for in that moment  and the sharp pang it brought  her  she felt how much she loved paul and how hard it was to lose him   the childish affection had blossomed into a woman s passion  and in a  few short weeks had passed through many phases of jealousy  hope   despair  and self delusion  the joy she felt on seeing him again  the  pride she took in him  the disgust helen caused her  the relief she had  not dared to own even to herself  when she fancied fate had put an  insurmountable barrier between paul and his cousin  the despair at  finding it only a fancy  and the anguish of hearing him declare his  unshaken purpose to marry his first love  all these conflicting emotions  had led to this hard moment  and now self control deserted her in her  need  in spite of her efforts the passionate tears would have their way   though paul soothed her with assurances of entire forgiveness  promises  of helen s friendship  and every gentle device he could imagine  she  commanded herself at last by a strong effort  murmuring eagerly as she  shrank from the hand that put back her fallen hair  and the face so full  of tender sympathy bending over her      i am so grieved and ashamed at what i have said and done  i shall never  dare to see helen  forgive me  and forget this folly  i m sad and  heavyhearted just now  it s the anniversary of papa s death  and mamma  always suffers so much at such times that i get nervous       it is your birthday also  i remembered it  and ventured to bring a  little token in return for the one you gave me long ago  this is a  talisman  and tomorrow i will tell you the legend concerning it  wear it  for my sake  and god bless you  dear      the last words were whispered hurriedly  lillian saw the glitter of an  antique ring  felt the touch of bearded lips on her hand  and paul was  gone     but as he left the house he set his teeth  exclaiming low to himself    yes  tomorrow there shall be an end of this  we must risk everything  and abide the consequences now  i ll have no more torment for any of  us            chapter vii    the secret key       is lady trevlyn at home  bedford   asked paul  as he presented himself  at an early hour next day  wearing the keen  stern expression which made  him look ten years older than he was      no  sir  my lady and miss lillian went down to the hall last night       no ill news  i hope   and the young man s eye kindled as if he felt a  crisis at hand      not that i heard  sir  miss lillian took one of her sudden whims and  would have gone alone  if my lady hadn t given in much against her will   this being a time when she is better away from the place       did they leave no message for me       yes  sir  will you step in and read the note at your ease  we are in  sad confusion  but this room is in order      leading the way to lillian s boudoir  the man presented the note and  retired  a few hasty lines from my lady  regretting the necessity of  this abrupt departure  yet giving no reason for it  hoping they might  meet next season  but making no allusion to seeing him at the hall   desiring lillian s thanks and regards  but closing with no hint of  helen  except compliments  paul smiled as he threw it into the fire   saying to himself   poor lady  she thinks she has escaped the danger by  flying  and lillian tries to hide her trouble from me  tender little  heart  i ll comfort it without delay      he sat looking about the dainty room still full of tokens of her  presence  the piano stood open with a song he liked upon the rack  a bit  of embroidery  whose progress he had often watched  lay in her basket  with the little thimble near it  there was a strew of papers on the  writing table  torn notes  scraps of drawing  and ball cards  a  pearl colored glove lay on the floor  and in the grate the faded flowers  he had brought two days before  as his eye roved to and fro  he seemed  to enjoy some happy dream  broken too soon by the sound of servants  shutting up the house  he arose but lingered near the table  as if  longing to search for some forgotten hint of himself      no  there has been enough lock picking and stealthy work  i ll do no  more for her sake  this theft will harm no one and tell no tales   and  snatching up the glove  paul departed      helen  the time has come  are you ready   he asked  entering her room  an hour later      i am ready   and rising  she stretched her hand to him with a proud  expression  contrasting painfully with her helpless gesture      they have gone to the hall  and we must follow  it is useless to wait  longer  we gain nothing by it  and the claim must stand on such proof as  we have  or fall for want of that one link  i am tired of disguise  i  want to be myself and enjoy what i have won  unless i lose it all       paul  whatever happens  remember we cling together and share good or  evil fortune as we always have done  i am a burden  but i cannot live  without you  for you are my world  do not desert me      she groped her way to him and clung to his strong arm as if it was her  only stay  paul drew her close  saying wistfully  as he caressed the  beautiful sightless face leaning on his shoulder    mia cara   would it  break your heart  if at the last hour i gave up all and let the word  remain unspoken  my courage fails me  and in spite of the hard past i  would gladly leave them in peace       no  no  you shall not give it up   cried helen almost fiercely  while  the slumbering fire of her southern nature flashed into her face   you  have waited so long  worked so hard  suffered so much  you must not lose  your reward  you promised  and you must keep the promise       but it is so beautiful  so noble to forgive  and return a blessing for  a curse  let us bury the old feud  and right the old wrong in a new way   those two are so blameless  it is cruel to visit the sins of the dead on  their innocent heads  my lady has suffered enough already  and lillian  is so young  so happy  so unfit to meet a storm like this  oh  helen   mercy is more divine than justice      something moved paul deeply  and helen seemed about to yield  when the  name of lillian wrought a subtle change in her  the color died out of  her face  her black eyes burned with a gloomy fire  and her voice was  relentless as she answered  while her frail hands held him fast   i will  not let you give it up  we are as innocent as they  we have suffered  more  and we deserve our rights  for we have no sin to expiate  go on   paul  and forget the sentimental folly that unmans you      something in her words seemed to sting or wound him  his face darkened   and he put her away  saying briefly   let it be so then  in an hour we  must go      on the evening of the same day  lady trevlyn and her daughter sat  together in the octagon room at the hall  twilight was falling and  candles were not yet brought  but a cheery fire blazed in the wide  chimney  filling the apartment with a ruddy glow  turning lillian s  bright hair to gold and lending a tinge of color to my lady s pallid  cheeks  the girl sat on a low lounging chair before the fire  her head  on her hand  her eyes on the red embers  her thoughts  where  my lady  lay on her couch  a little in the shadow  regarding her daughter with an  anxious air  for over the young face a somber change had passed which  filled her with disquiet      you are out of spirits  love   she said at last  breaking the long  silence  as lillian gave an unconscious sigh and leaned wearily into the  depths of her chair      yes  mamma  a little       what is it  are you ill       no  mamma  i think london gaiety is rather too much for me  i m too  young for it  as you often say  and i ve found it out       then it is only weariness that makes you so pale and grave  and so bent  on coming back here      lillian was the soul of truth  and with a moment s hesitation answered  slowly   not that alone  mamma  i m worried about other things  don t  ask me what  please       but i must ask  tell me  child  what things  have you seen any one  had  letters  or been annoyed in any way about  anything      my lady spoke with sudden energy and rose on her arm  eyeing the girl  with unmistakable suspicion and excitement      no  mamma  it s only a foolish trouble of my own   answered lillian   with a glance of surprise and a shamefaced look as the words reluctantly  left her lips      ah  a love trouble  nothing more  thank god for that   and my lady sank  back as if a load was off her mind   tell me all  my darling  there is  no confidante like a mother       you are very kind  and perhaps you can cure my folly if i tell it  and  yet i am ashamed   murmured the girl  then yielding to an irresistible  impulse to ask help and sympathy  she added  in an almost inaudible  tone   i came away to escape from paul       because he loves you  lillian   asked my lady  with a frown and a half  smile      because he does  not  love me  mamma   and the poor girl hid her  burning cheeks in her hands  as if overwhelmed with maidenly shame at  the implied confession of her own affection      my child  how is this  i cannot but be glad that he does  not  love  you  yet it fills me with grief to see that this pains you  he is not a  mate for you  lillian  remember this  and forget the transient regard  that has sprung up from that early intimacy of yours       he is wellborn  and now my equal in fortune  and oh  so much my  superior in all gifts of mind and heart   sighed the girl  still with  hidden face  for tears were dropping through her slender fingers      it may be  but there is a mystery about him  and i have a vague dislike  to him in spite of all that has passed  but  darling  are you sure he  does not care for you  i fancied i read a different story in his face   and when you begged to leave town so suddenly  i believed that you had  seen this also  and kindly wished to spare him any pain       it was to spare myself  oh  mamma  he loves helen  and will marry her  although she is blind  he told me this  with a look i could not doubt   and so i came away to hide my sorrow   sobbed poor lillian in despair     lady trevlyn went to her and  laying the bright head on her motherly  bosom  said soothingly as she caressed it   my little girl  it is too  soon for you to know these troubles  and i am punished for yielding to  your entreaties for a peep at the gay world  it is now too late to spare  you this  you have had your wish and must pay its price  dear  but   lillian  call pride to aid you  and conquer this fruitless love  it  cannot be very deep as yet  for you have known paul  the man  too short  a time to be hopelessly enamored  remember  there are others  better   braver  more worthy of you  that life is long  and full of pleasure yet  untried       have no fears for me  mamma  i ll not disgrace you or myself by any  sentimental folly  i do love paul  but i can conquer it  and i will   give me a little time  and you shall see me quite myself again      lillian lifted her head with an air of proud resolve that satisfied her  mother  and with a grateful kiss stole away to ease her full heart  alone  as she disappeared lady trevlyn drew a long breath and  clasping  her hands with a gesture of thanksgiving  murmured to herself in an  accent of relief   only a love sorrow  i feared it was some new terror  like the old one  seventeen years of silence  seventeen years of secret  dread and remorse for me   she said  pacing the room with tightly locked  hands and eyes full of unspeakable anguish   oh  richard  richard  i  forgave you long ago  and surely i have expiated my innocent offense by  these years of suffering  for her sake i did it  and for her sake i  still keep dumb  god knows i ask nothing for myself but rest and  oblivion by your side      half an hour later  paul stood at the hall door  it was ajar  for the  family had returned unexpectedly  as was evident from the open doors and  empty halls  entering unseen  he ascended to the room my lady usually  occupied  the fire burned low  lillian s chair was empty  and my lady  lay asleep  as if lulled by the sighing winds without and the deep  silence that reigned within  paul stood regarding her with a great pity  softening his face as he marked the sunken eyes  pallid cheeks  locks  too early gray  and restless lips muttering in dreams      i wish i could spare her this   he sighed  stooping to wake her with a  word  but he did not speak  for  suddenly clutching the chain about her  neck  she seemed to struggle with some invisible foe and beat it off   muttering audibly as she clenched her thin hands on the golden case   paul leaned and listened as if the first word had turned him to stone   till the paroxysm had passed  and with a heavy sigh my lady sank into a  calmer sleep  then  with a quick glance over his shoulder  paul  skillfully opened the locket  drew out the silver key  replaced it with  one from the piano close by  and stole from the house noiselessly as he  had entered it     that night  in the darkest hour before the dawn  a figure went gliding  through the shadowy park to its most solitary corner  here stood the  tomb of the trevlyns  and here the figure paused  a dull spark of light  woke in its hand  there was a clank of bars  the creak of rusty hinges   then light and figure both seemed swallowed up     standing in the tomb where the air was close and heavy  the pale glimmer  of the lantern showed piles of moldering coffins in the niches  and  everywhere lay tokens of decay and death  the man drew his hat lower  over his eyes  pulled the muffler closer about his mouth  and surveyed  the spot with an undaunted aspect  though the beating of his heart was  heard in the deep silence  nearest the door stood a long casket covered  with black velvet and richly decorated with silver ornaments  tarnished  now  the trevlyns had been a stalwart race  and the last sleeper brought  there had evidently been of goodly stature  for the modern coffin was as  ponderous as the great oaken beds where lay the bones of generations   lifting the lantern  the intruder brushed the dust from the  shield shaped plate  read the name richard trevlyn and a date  and  as  if satisfied  placed a key in the lock  half raised the lid  and   averting his head that he might not see the ruin seventeen long years  had made  he laid his hand on the dead breast and from the folded shroud  drew a mildewed paper  one glance sufficed  the casket was relocked  the  door rebarred  the light extinguished  and the man vanished like a ghost  in the darkness of the wild october night           chapter viii    which        a gentleman  my lady      taking a card from the silver salver on which the servant offered it   lady trevlyn read   paul talbot   and below the name these penciled  words   i beseech you to see me   lillian stood beside her and saw the  line  their eyes met  and in the girl s face was such a sudden glow of  hope  and love  and longing  that the mother could not doubt or  disappoint her wish      i will see him   she said      oh  mamma  how kind you are   cried the girl with a passionate embrace   adding breathlessly   he did not ask for me  i cannot see him yet  i ll  hide in the alcove  and can appear or run away as i like when we know  why he comes      they were in the library  for  knowing lillian s fondness for the room  which held no dark memories for her  my lady conquered her dislike and  often sat there  as she spoke  the girl glided into the deep recess of a  bay window and drew the heavy curtains just as paul s step sounded at  the door     hiding her agitation with a woman s skill  my lady rose with  outstretched hand to welcome him  he bowed but did not take the hand   saying  in a voice of grave respect in which was audible an undertone of  strong emotion   pardon me  lady trevlyn  hear what i have to say  and  then if you offer me your hand  i shall gratefully receive it      she glanced at him  and saw that he was very pale  that his eye  glittered with suppressed excitement  and his whole manner was that of a  man who had nerved himself up to the performance of a difficult but  intensely interesting task  fancying these signs of agitation only  natural in a young lover coming to woo  my lady smiled  reseated  herself  and calmly answered   i will listen patiently  speak freely   paul  and remember i am an old friend       i wish i could forget it  then my task would be easier   he murmured in  a voice of mingled regret and resolution  as he leaned on a tall chair  opposite and wiped his damp forehead  with a look of such deep  compassion that her heart sank with a nameless fear      i must tell you a long story  and ask your forgiveness for the offenses  i committed against you when a boy  a mistaken sense of duty guided me   and i obeyed it blindly  now i see my error and regret it   he said  earnestly      go on   replied my lady  while the vague dread grew stronger  and she  braced her nerves as for some approaching shock  she forgot lillian   forgot everything but the strange aspect of the man before her  and the  words to which she listened like a statue  still standing pale and  steady  paul spoke rapidly  while his eyes were full of mingled  sternness  pity  and remorse      twenty years ago  an english gentleman met a friend in a little italian  town  where he had married a beautiful wife  the wife had a sister as  lovely as herself  and the young man  during that brief stay  loved and  married her  in a very private manner  lest his father should disinherit  him  a few months passed  and the englishman was called home to take  possession of his title and estates  the father being dead  he went  alone  promising to send for the wife when all was ready  he told no one  of his marriage  meaning to surprise his english friends by producing  the lovely woman unexpectedly  he had been in england but a short time  when he received a letter from the old priest of the italian town   saying the cholera had swept through it  carrying off half its  inhabitants  his wife and friend among others  this blow prostrated the  young man  and when he recovered he hid his grief  shut himself up in  his country house  and tried to forget  accident threw in his way  another lovely woman  and he married again  before the first year was  out  the friend whom he supposed was dead appeared  and told him that  his wife still lived  and had borne him a child  in the terror and  confusion of the plague  the priest had mistaken one sister for the  other  as the elder did die       yes  yes  i know  go on   gasped my lady  with white lips  and eyes  that never left the narrator s face      this friend had met with misfortune after flying from the doomed  village with the surviving sister  they had waited long for letters  had  written  and  when no answer came  had been delayed by illness and  poverty from reaching england  at this time the child was born  and the  friend  urged by the wife and his own interest  came here  learned that  sir richard was married  and hurried to him in much distress  we can  imagine the grief and horror of the unhappy man  in that interview the  friend promised to leave all to sir richard  to preserve the secret till  some means of relief could be found  and with this promise he returned   to guard and comfort the forsaken wife  sir richard wrote the truth to  lady trevlyn  meaning to kill himself  as the only way of escape from  the terrible situation between two women  both so beloved  both so  innocently wronged  the pistol lay ready  but death came without its  aid  and sir richard was spared the sin of suicide      paul paused for breath  but lady trevlyn motioned him to go on  still  sitting rigid and white as the marble image near her      the friend only lived to reach home and tell the story  it killed the  wife  and she died  imploring the old priest to see her child righted  and its father s name secured to it  he promised  but he was poor  the  child was a frail baby  and he waited  years passed  and when the child  was old enough to ask for its parents and demand its due  the proofs of  the marriage were lost  and nothing remained but a ring  a bit of  writing  and the name  the priest was very old  had neither friends   money  nor proofs to help him  but i was strong and hopeful  and though  a mere boy i resolved to do the work  i made my way to england  to  trevlyn hall  and by various stratagems  among which  i am ashamed to  say  were false keys and feigned sleepwalking  i collected many proofs   but nothing which would satisfy a court  for no one but you knew where  sir richard s confession was  i searched every nook and corner of the  hall  but in vain  and began to despair  when news of the death of  father cosmo recalled me to italy  for helen was left to my care then   the old man had faithfully recorded the facts and left witnesses to  prove the truth of his story  but for four years i never used it  never  made any effort to secure the title or estates       why not   breathed my lady in a faint whisper  as hope suddenly  revived      because i was grateful   and for the first time paul s voice faltered    i was a stranger  and you took me in  i never could forget that  nor  tie many kindnesses bestowed upon the friendless boy  this afflicted me   even while i was acting a false part  and when i was away my heart  failed me  but helen gave me no peace  for my sake  she urged me to keep  the vow made to that poor mother  and threatened to tell the story  herself  talbot s benefaction left me no excuse for delaying longer  and  i came to finish the hardest task i can ever undertake  i feared that a  long dispute would follow any appeal to law  and meant to appeal first  to you  but fate befriended me  and the last proof was found       found  where   cried lady trevlyn  springing up aghast      in sir richard s coffin  where you hid it  not daring to destroy  yet  fearing to keep it       who has betrayed me   and her eye glanced wildly about the room  as if  she feared to see some spectral accuser      your own lips  my lady  last night i came to speak of this  you lay  asleep  and in some troubled dream spoke of the paper  safe in its  writer s keeping  and your strange treasure here  the key of which you  guarded day and night  i divined the truth  remembering hester s  stories  i took the key from your helpless hand  found the paper on sir  richard s dead breast  and now demand that you confess your part in this  tragedy       i do  i do  i confess  i yield  i relinquish everything  and ask pity  only for my child      lady trevlyn fell upon her knees before him  with a submissive gesture   but imploring eyes  for  amid the wreck of womanly pride and worldly  fortune  the mother s heart still clung to its idol      who should pity her  if not i  god knows i would have spared her this  blow if i could  but helen would not keep silent  and i was driven to  finish what i had begun  tell lillian this  and do not let her hate me      as paul spoke  tenderly  eagerly  the curtain parted  and lillian  appeared  trembling with the excitement of that interview  but conscious  of only one emotion as she threw herself into his arms  crying in a tone  of passionate delight   brother  brother  now i may love you      paul held her close  and for a moment forgot everything but the joy of  that moment  lillian spoke first  looking up through tears of  tenderness  her little hand laid caressingly against his cheek  as she  whispered with sudden bloom in her own   now i know why i loved you so  well  and now i can see you marry helen without breaking my heart  oh   paul  you are still mine  and i care for nothing else       but  lillian  i am not your brother       then  in heaven s name  who are you   she cried  tearing herself from  his arms      your lover  dear       who  then  is the heir   demanded lady trevlyn  springing up  as  lillian turned to seek shelter with her mother      i am      helen spoke  and helen stood on the threshold of the door  with a hard   haughty look upon her beautiful face      you told your story badly  paul   she said  in a bitter tone   you  forgot me  forgot my affliction  my loneliness  my wrongs  and the  natural desire of a child to clear her mother s honor and claim her  father s name  i am sir richard s eldest daughter  i can prove my birth   and i demand my right with his own words to sustain me      she paused  but no one spoke  and with a slight tremor in her proud  voice  she added   paul has done the work  he shall have the reward  i  only want my father s name  title and fortune are nothing to one like  me  i coveted and claimed them that i might give them to you  paul  my  one friend  always  so tender and so true       i ll have none of it   he answered  almost fiercely   i have kept my  promise  and am free  you chose to claim your own  although i offered  all i had to buy your silence  it is yours by right  take it  and enjoy  it if you can  i ll have no reward for work like this      he turned from her with a look that would have stricken her to the heart  could she have seen it  she felt it  and it seemed to augment some  secret anguish  for she pressed her hands against her bosom with an  expression of deep suffering  exclaiming passionately   yes  i  will   keep it  since i am to lose all else  i am tired of pity  power is  sweet  and i will use it  go  paul  and be happy if you can  with a  nameless wife  and the world s compassion or contempt to sting your  pride       oh  lillian  where shall we go  this is no longer our home  but who  will receive us now   cried lady trevlyn  in a tone of despair  for her  spirit was utterly broken by the thought of the shame and sorrow in  store for this beloved and innocent child      i will   and paul s face shone with a love and loyalty they could not  doubt   my lady  you gave me a home when i was homeless  now let me pay  my debt  lillian  i have loved you from the time when  a romantic boy  i  wore your little picture in my breast  and vowed to win you if i lived   i dared not speak before  but now  when other hearts may be shut against  you  mine stands wide open to welcome you  come  both  let me protect  and cherish you  and so atone for the sorrow i have brought you      it was impossible to resist the sincere urgency of his voice  the tender  reverence of his manner  as he took the two forlorn yet innocent  creatures into the shelter of his strength and love  they clung to him  instinctively  feeling that there still remained to them one staunch  friend whom adversity could not estrange     an eloquent silence fell upon the room  broken only by sobs  grateful  whispers  and the voiceless vows that lovers plight with eyes  and  hands  and tender lips  helen was forgotten  till lillian  whose elastic  spirit threw off sorrow as a flower sheds the rain  looked up to thank  paul  with smiles as well as tears  and saw the lonely figure in the  shadow  her attitude was full of pathetic significance  she still stood  on the threshold  for no one had welcomed her  and

consequence of the interest that has been recently excited on the  subject of bread reform  we have  says the london  miller   translated the  interesting contribution of h  mege mouries to the imperial and central  society of agriculture of france  and subsequently published in a separate  form in       on  wheat and wheat bread   with the illustration prepared  by the author for the contribution  the author says   i repeat in this  pamphlet the principal facts put forth in the notes issued by me  and in  the reports furnished by mr  chevreul to the academy of science  from       up to           the study of the structure of the wheat berry  its chemical composition   its alimentary value  its preservation  etc   is not alone of interest to  science  agriculture  and industry  but it is worthy of attracting the  attention of governments  for this study  in its connection to political  economy  is bound up with the fate and the prosperity of nations  wheat has  been cultivated from time immemorial  at first it was roughly crushed and  consumed in the form of a thick soup  or in cakes baked on an ordinary  hearth  many centuries before the christian era the egyptians were  acquainted with the means of making fermented or leavened bread  afterwards  this practice spread into greece  and it is found in esteem at rome two  centuries b c   from rome the new method was introduced among the gauls   and it is found to day to exist almost the same as it was practiced at that  period  with the exception  of course  of the considerable improvements  introduced in the baking and grinding     since the fortunate idea was formed of transforming the wheat into bread   this grain has always produced white bread  and dark or brown bread  from  which the conclusion was drawn that it must necessarily make white bread  and brown bread  on the other hand  the flours  mixed with bran  made a  brownish  doughy  and badly risen bread  and it was therefore concluded  that the bran  by its color  produced this inferior bread  from this error   accepted as a truth  the most contradictory opinions of the most opposite  processes have arisen  which are repeated at the present day in the art of  separating as completely as possible all the tissues of the wheat  and of  extracting from the grain only    per cent of flour fit for making white  bread  it is  however  difficult for the observer to admit that a small  quantity of the thin yellow envelope can  by a simple mingling with the  crumb of the loaf  color it brown  and it is still more difficult to admit  that the actual presence of these envelopes can without decomposition  render bread doughy  badly raised  sticky  and incapable of swelling in  water  on the other hand  although some distinguished chemists deny or  exalt the nutritive properties of bran  agriculturists  taking practical  observation as proof  attribute to that portion of the grain a  physiological action which has nothing in common with plastic alimentation   and prove that animals weakened by a too long usage of dry fodder  are  restored to health by the use of bran  which only seems to act by its  presence  since the greater portion of it  as already demonstrated by mr   poggiale  is passed through with the excrement     with these opinions  apparently so opposed  it evidently results that there  is an unknown factor at the bottom of the question  it is the nature of  this factor i wish to find out  and it was after the discovery that i  was able to explain the nature of brown bread  and its  role  in the  alimentation of animals  we have then to examine the causes of the  production of brown bread  to state why white bread kills animals fed  exclusively on it  while bread mixed with bran makes them live  we have to  explain the phenomena of panification  the operations of grinding  and to  explain the means of preparing a bread more economical and more favorable  to health  to explain this question clearly and briefly we must first be  acquainted with the various substances forming the berry  their nature   their position  and their properties  this we shall do with the aid of the  illustration given      illustration  section of a grain of wheat magnified      explanation of diagram         superficial coating of the epidermis  severed at the crease of      the

and chemical composition of wheat     the figure represents the longitudinal cut of a grain of wheat  it was made  by taking  with the aid of the microscope and of photography  the drawing  of a large quantity of fragments  which  joined together at last  produced  the figure of the entire cut  these multiplied results were necessary to  appreciate the insertion of the teguments and their nature in every part  of the berry  in this long and difficult work i have been aided by the  co operation of mr  bertsch  who  as is known  has discovered a means of  fixing rapidly by photography any image from the microscope  i must state   in the first place  that even in      mr  payen studied and published the  structure and the composition of a fragment of a grain of wheat  that  this learned chemist  whose authority in such matters is known  perfectly  described the envelopes or coverings  and indicated the presence of various  immediate principles  especially of azote  fatty and mineral substances  which fill up the range of contiguous cells between them and the periphery  of the perisperm  to the exclusion of the gluten and the starchy granules    as well as to the mode of insertion of the granules of starch in the gluten  contained in the cells  with narrow divisions from the perisperm  and in  such a manner that up to the point of working indicated by the figure    this study was complete  however  i have been obliged to recommence it  to  study the special facts bearing on the alimentary question  and i must say  that all the results obtained by mr  bertsch  mr  trecul  and myself agree  with those given by mr  payen       envelopes of the berry     no    represents a superficial side of the crease     no    indicates the epidermis or cuticle  this covering is extremely light   and offers nothing remarkable      lb  of wheat contain     lb  of it     no    indicates the epicarp  this envelope is distinguished by a double  row of long and pointed vessels  it is  like the first one  very light and  without action      lb  of wheat contain   lb  of it     no    represents the endocarp  or last tegument of the berry  the  sarcocarp  which should be found between the numbers   and    no longer  exists  having been absorbed  the endocarp is remarkable by its row of  round and regular cells  which appear in the cut like a continuous string  of beads      lb  of wheat contain      lb  of it     these three envelopes are colorless  light  and spongy  their elementary  composition is that of straw  they are easily removed besides with the aid  of damp and friction  this property has given rise to an operation called  decortication  the results of which we shall examine later on from an  industrial point of view  the whole of the envelopes of the berry of wheat  amount to   lb  in     lb  of wheat       envelopes and tissues of the berry proper     no    indicates the testa or episperm  this external tegument of the berry  is closer than the preceding ones  it contains in the very small cells  two coloring matters  the one of a palish yellow  the other of an orange  yellow  and according as the one or the other matter predominates  the  wheat is of a more or less intense yellow color  hence come all the  varieties of wheat known in commerce as white  reddish  or red wheats   under this tegument is found a very thin  colorless membrane  which  with  the testa or episperm  forms two per cent  of the weight of the wheat     no    indicates the embryous membrane  which is only an expansion of the  germ or embryo no      this membrane is seen purposely removed from its  contiguous parts  so as to render more visible its form and insertions   under this tissue is found with the nos        and    the endosperm or  perisperm  containing the gluten and the starch  soluble and insoluble  albuminoids  that is to say  the flour     the endosperm and the embryous membrane are the most interesting parts of  the berry  the first is one of the depots of the plastic aliments  the  second contains agents capable of dissolving these aliments during the  germination  of determining their absorption in the digestive organs of  animals  and of producing in the dough a decomposition strong enough to  make dark bread  we shall proceed to examine separately these two parts of  the berry       endosperm or floury portion  nos              this portion is composed of large glutinous cells  in which the granules  of starch are found  the composition of these different layers offers a  particular interest  the center  no     is the softest part  it contains  the least gluten and the most starch  it is the part which first pulverizes  under the stone  and gives  after the first bolting  the fine flour  as  this flour is poorest in gluten  it makes a dough with little consistency   and incapable of making an open bread  well raised  the first layer  no      which surrounds the center  produces small white middlings  harder and  richer in gluten than the center  it bakes very well  and weighs    lb  in       and it is these    parts in     which  when mixed with the    parts in  the center  form the finest quality flour  used for making white bread     the layer no     which surrounds the preceding one  is still harder and  richer in gluten  unfortunately in the reduction it becomes mixed with some  hundredth parts of the bran  which render it unsuitable for making bread  of the finest quality  it produces in the regrinding lower grade and  dark flours  together weighing   per cent  the external layer  naturally  adhering to the membrane  no     becomes mixed in the grinding with bran   to the extent of about    per cent   which renders it unsuitable even  for making brown bread  it serves to form the regrindings and the offals  destined for the nourishment of animals  this layer is  however  the  hardest  and contains the largest quantity of gluten  and it is by  consequence the most nutritive  we now see the endosperm increasing from  the center  formed of floury layers  which augment in richness in gluten   in proportion as they are removed from the center  now  as the flours make  more bread in proportion to the quantity of gluten they contain  and the  gluten gives more bread in proportion to its being more developed  or  having more consistence  it follows that the flour belonging to the parts  of the berry nearest the envelopes or coverings should produce the greatest  portion of bread  and this is what takes place in effect  the product of  the different layers of the endosperm is given below  and it will be seen  that the quantity of bread increases in a proportion relatively greater  than that of the gluten  which proves once more that the gluten of the  center or last formation has less consistence than that of the other layers  of older formation     the following are the results obtained from the same wheat                                         gluten            bread       parts of flour in center contain       and produce                            first layer                                                 second                                                      external                                on the whole  it is seen  according to the composition of the floury part  of the grain  that the berry contains on an average    parts in     of  flour fit for making bread of the first quality  and that the inevitable  mixing in of a small quantity of bran reduces these    to    parts with  the ordinary processes  but the loss is not alone there  for the foregoing  table shows that the best portion of the grain is rejected from the food  of man that brown or dark bread is made of flour of very good quality  and  that the first quality bread is made from the portion of the endosperm  containing the gluten in the smallest quantity and in the least developed  form     this is a consideration not to be passed over lightly  assuredly the gluten  of the center contains as much azote as the gluten of the circumference   but it must not be admitted in a general way that the alimentary power of  a body is in connection with the amount of azote it contains  and without  entering into considerations which would carry us too wide of the subject   we shall simply state that if the flesh of young animals  as  for instance   the calf  has a debilitating action  while the developed flesh of  full grown animals  of a heifer  for example  has really nourishing  properties  although the flesh of each animal contains the same quantity of  azote  we must conclude that the proportion of elements is not everything   and that the azotic or nitrogenous elements are more nourishing in  proportion as they are more developed  this is why the gluten of the layers  nearest the bran is of quite a special interest from the point of view of  alimentation and in the preparation of bread       the embryo and the coating of the embryo     to be intelligible  i must commence by some very brief remarks on the  tissues of vegetables  there are two sorts distinguished among plants   some seem of no importance in the phenomena of nutrition  others  on the  contrary  tend to the assimilation of the organic or inorganic components  which should nourish and develop all the parts of the plant  the latter  have a striking analogy with ferments  their composition is almost similar   and their action is increased or diminished by the same causes     these tissues  formed in a state of repose in vegetables as in grain  have  special properties  thus the berry possesses a pericarp whose tissues  should remain foreign to the phenomena of germination  and these tissues  show no particularity worthy of remark  but the coating of the embryo   which should play an active part  possesses  on the contrary  properties  that may be compared to those of ferments  with regard to these ferments   i must further remark that i have not been able  nor am i yet able  to  express in formula my opinion of the nature of these bodies  but little  known as yet  i have only made use of the language mostly employed  without  wishing to touch on questions raised by the effects of the presence  and  by the more complex effects of living bodies  which exercise analogous  actions     with these reservations i shall proceed to examine the tissues in the berry  which help toward the germination     the embryo      see woodcut  is composed of the root of the plant  with  which we have nothing to do here  this root of the plant which is to grow  is embedded in a mass of cells full of fatty bodies  these bodies present  this remarkable particularity  that they contain among their elements  sulphur and phosphorus  when you dehydrate by alcohol     grammes of the  embryo of wheat  obtained by the same means as the membrane  a process  indicated later on   this embryo  treated with ether  produces    grammes  of oils composed elementarily of hydrogen  oxygen  carbon  azote  sulphur   and phosphorus  this analysis  made according to the means indicated by m   fremy  shows that the fatty bodies of the embryo are composed like those of  the germ of an egg  like those of the brain and of the nervous system of  animals  it is necessary for us to stop an instant at this fact  in the  first place  because it proves that vegetables are designed to form the  phosphoric as well as the nitrogenous and ternary aliments  and finally   because it indicates how important it is to mix the embryo and its  dependents with the bread in the most complete manner possible  seeing that  a large portion of these phosphoric bodies always become decomposed during  the baking     coating of the embryo   this membrane      which is only an expansion of  the embryo  surrounds the endosperm  it is composed of beautiful irregular  cubic cells  diminishing according as they come nearer to the embryo  these  cells are composed  first  of the insoluble cellular tissue  second   of phosphate of chalk and fatty phosphoric bodies  third  of soluble  cerealine  in order to study the composition and the nature of this  tissue  it must be completely isolated  and this result is obtained in the  following manner     the wheat should be damped with water containing    parts in     of  alcoholized caustic soda  at the expiration of one hour the envelopes of  the pericarp  and of the testa nos              should be separated by  friction in a coarse cloth  having been reduced by the action of the alkali  to a pulpy state  each berry should then be opened separately to remove the  portion of the envelope held in the fold of the crease  and then all the  berries divided in two are put into three parts of water charged with  one hundredth of caustic potash  this liquid dissolves the gluten  divides  the starch  and at the expiration of twenty four hours the parts of the  berries are kneaded between the fingers  collected in pure water  and  washed until the water issues clear  these membranes with their embryos   which are often detached by this operation  are cast into water acidulated  with one hundredth of hydrochloric acid  and at the end of several hours  they should be completely washed  the product obtained consists of  beautiful white membranes  insoluble in alkalies and diluted acids  which  show under the microscope beautiful cells joined in a tissue following the  embryo  with which it has indeed a striking analogy in its properties and  composition  this membrane  exhausted by the alcohol and ether  gives  by  an elementary analysis  hydrogen  oxygen  carbon  and azote  unfortunately   under the action of the tests this membrane has been killed  and it no  longer possesses the special properties of active tissues  among these  properties three may be especially mentioned      st  its resistance to water charged with a mineral salt  such as sea salt  for instance     d  its action through its presence      d  its action as a ferment     the action of saltwater is explained as follows  when the berry is plunged  into pure water it will be observed that the water penetrates in the course  of a few hours to the very center of the endosperm  but if water charged  or saturated with sea salt be used  it will be seen that the liquid  immediately passes through the teguments nos           and    and stops  abruptly before the embryo membrane no     which will remain quite dry and  brittle for several days  the berry remaining all the time in the  water  should the water penetrate further after several days  it can be  ascertained that the entrance was gained through the part no    free of  this tissue  and this notwithstanding the cells are full of fatty bodies   this membrane alone produces this action  for if the coatings nos            and   be removed  the resistance to the liquid remains the same  while if  the whole  or a portion of it  be divided  either by friction between two  millstones or by simple incisions  the liquid penetrates the berry within  a few hours  this property is analogous to that of the radicules of roots   which take up the bodies most suitable for the nourishment of the plant  it  proves  besides  that this membrane  like all those endowed with life  does  not obey more the ordinary laws of permeability than those of chemical  affinity  and this property can be turned to advantage in the preservation  of grain in decortication and grinding     to determine the action of this tissue through its presence  take      grammes of wheat  wash it and remove the first coating by decortication   then immerse it for several hours in lukewarm water  and dry afterwards in  an ordinary temperature  it should then be reduced in a small coffee mill   the flour and middlings separated by sifting and the bran repassed through  a machine that will crush it without breaking it  then dress it again  and  repeat the operation six times at least  the bran now obtained is composed  of the embryous membrane  a little flour adhering to it  and some traces  of the teguments nos           and    this coarse tissue weighs about     grammes  and to determine its action through its presence  place it in      grammes of water at a temperature of    deg   afterwards press it  the liquid  that escapes contains chiefly the flour and cerealine  filter this liquid   and put it in a test glass marked no     which will serve to determine the  action of the cerealine     the bran should now be washed until the water issues pure  and until it  shows no bluish color when iodized water and sulphuric acid are added  when  the washing is finished the bran swollen by the water is placed under a  press  and the liquid extracted is placed  after being filtered  in a test  tube  this test tube serves to show that all cerealine has been removed  from the blades of the tissue  finally  these small blades of bran  washed  and pressed  are cast  with    grammes of lukewarm water  into a test tube   marked no         grammes of diluted starch to one tenth of dry starch  are then added in each test tube  and they are put into a water bath at  a temperature of     deg  fahrenheit  being stirred lightly every fifteen  minutes  at the expiration of an hour  or at the most an hour and a half   no    glass no longer contains any starch  as it has been converted into  dextrine and glucose by the cerealine  and the iodized water only produces  a purple color  no    glass  with the same addition  produces a bluish  color  and preserves the starch intact  which proves that the bran was well  freed from the cerealine contained  no    glass  like no     shows a purple  coloring  and the liquid only contains  in place of the starch  dextrine  and glucose   i  e   the tissue has had the same action as the cerealine  deprived of the tissue  and the cerealine as the tissue freed from  cerealine  the same membrane rewashed can again transform the diluted  starch several times  this action is due to the presence of the embryous  membrane  for after four consecutive operations it still preserves its  original weight  as regards the remains of the other segments  they have  no influence on this phenomenon  for the coating nos           and     separated by the water and friction  have no action whatever on the diluted  starch  besides its action through its presence  which is immediate   the embryous membrane may also act as a ferment  active only after a  development  varying in duration according to the conditions of temperature  and the presence or absence of ferments in acting     i make a distinction here as is seen  between the action through being  present  and the action of real ferments  but it is not my intention to  approve or disapprove of the different opinions expressed on this subject   i make use of these expressions only to explain more clearly the phenomena  i have to speak of  for it is our duty to bear in mind that the real  ferments only act after a longer or shorter period of development  while   on the other hand  the effects through presence are immediate     i now return to the embryous membrane  various causes increase or decrease  the action of this tissue  but it may be said in general that all the  agents that kill the embryous membrane will also kill the cerealine  this  was the reason why i at first attributed the production of dark bread  exclusively to the latter ferment  but it was easy to observe that during  the baking  decompositions resulted at over     deg  fah   while the cerealine  was still coagulated  and that bread containing bran  submitted to     deg  of  heat  became liquefied in water at     deg  it was now easy to determine  that dark flours  from which the cerealine had been removed by repeated  washings  still produced dark bread  it was at this time  in remembering  my experiences with organic bodies  i determined the properties of the  insoluble tissue  deprived of the soluble cerealine  with analogous  properties  but distinguished not alone by its solid organization and state  of insolubility  but also by its resistance to heat  which acts as on  yeast  there exists  in reality  i repeat  a resemblance between the  embryous membrane and the yeast  they have the same immediate composition   they are destroyed by the same poisons  deadened by the same temperatures   annihilated by the same agents  propagated in an analogous manner  and  it might be said that the organic tissues endowed with life are only an  agglomeration of fixed cells of ferments  at all events  when the blades of  the embryous membrane  prepared as already stated  are exposed to a water  bath at     deg   this tissue  in contact with the diluted starch  produces  the same decomposition  the contact  however  should continue two or three  hours in place of one  if  instead of placing these membranes in the water  bath  they are enveloped in two pounds of dough  and this dough put in the  oven  after the baking the washed membranes produce the same results  which  especially proves that this membrane can support a temperature of     deg  fah   without disorganization  we shall refer to this property in speaking of the  phenomena of panification     cerealine   the cells composing the embryous membrane contain  as already  stated  the cerealine  but after the germination they contain cerealine and  diastase  that is to say  a portion of the cerealine changed into diastase   with which it has the greatest analogy  it is known how difficult it is to  isolate and study albuminous substances  the following is the method of  obtaining and studying cerealine  take the raw embryous membrane  prepared  as stated  steep it for an hour in spirits of wine diluted with twice its  volume of water  and renew this liquid several times until the dextrine   glucose  coloring matters  etc   have been completely removed  the  membranes should now be pressed and cast into a quantity of water  sufficient to make a fluid paste of them  squeeze out the mixture   filter the liquid obtained  and this liquid will contain the cerealine  sufficiently pure to be studied in its effects  its principal properties  are  the liquid evaporated at a low temperature produces an amorphous   rough mass nearly colorless  and almost entirely soluble in distilled  water  this solution coagulates between     deg  and     deg  fah   and the  coagulum is insoluble in acids and weak alkalies  the solution is  precipitated by all diluted acids  by phosphoric acid at all the degrees of  hydration  and even by a current of carbonic acid  all these precipitates  redissolve with an excess of acid  sulphuric acid excepted  concentrated  sulphuric acid forms an insoluble downy white precipitate  and the  concentrated vegetable acids  with the exception of tannic acid  do not  determine any precipitate  cerealine coagulated by an acid redissolves in  an excess of the same acid  but it has become dead and has no more action  on the starch  the alkalies do not form any precipitate  but they kill the  cerealine as if it had been precipitated the neutral rennet does not make  any precipitate in a solution of cerealine    centigrammes of dry cerealine  transform in twenty five minutes    grammes of starch  reduced to a paste  by     grammes of water at     deg  fah  it will be seen that cerealine has a  grand analogy with albumen and legumine  but it is distinguished from them  by the action of the rennet  of the heat of acids  alcohol  and above all  by its property of transforming the starch into glucose and dextrine     it may be said that some albuminous substances have this property  but it  must be borne in mind that these bodies  like gluten  for example  only  possess it after the commencement of the decomposition  the albuminous  matter approaching nearest to cerealine is the diastase  for it is only a  transformation of the cerealine during the germination  the proof of which  may be had in analyzing the embryous membrane  which shows more diastase  and less cerealine in proportion to the advancement of the germination  it  differs  however  from the diastase by the action of heat  alcohol  etc   it is seen that in every case the cerealine and the embryous membrane  act together  and in an analogous manner  we shall shortly examine their  effects on the digestion and in the phenomena of panification     phosphate of calcium   mr  payen was the first to make the observation  that the greatest amount of phosphate of chalk is found in the teguments  adjoining the farinaceous or floury mass  this observation is important  from two points of view  in the first place  it shows us that this mineral  aliment  necessary to the life of animals  is rejected from ordinary bread   and in the next place  it brings a new proof that phosphate of chalk is  found  and ought to be found  in everyplace where there are membranes  susceptible of exercising vital functions among animals as well as  vegetables     phosphate of chalk is not in reality  as i wished to prove in another work   a plastic matter suitable for forming bones  for the bones of infants are  three times more solid than those of old men  which contain three times  as much of it  the quantity of phosphate of chalk necessary to the  constitution of animals is in proportion to the temperature of those  animals  and often in the inverse ratio of the weight of their bones  for  vegetables  although they have no bones  require phosphate of chalk  this  is because this salt is the natural stimulant of living membranes  and the  bony tissue is only a depot of phosphate of chalk  analogous to the adipose  tissue  the fat of which is absorbed when the alimentation coming from the  exterior becomes insufficient  now  as we know all the parts constituting  the berry of wheat  it will be easy to explain the phenomena of  panification  and to conclude from the present moment that it is not  indifferent to reject from the bread this embryous membrane where the  agents of digestion are found  viz   the phosphoric bodies and the  phosphate of chalk                                                       the origin of new process milling       the following article was written by albert hoppin  editor of the   northwestern miller   at the request of special agent chas  w  johnson   and forms a part of his report to the census bureau on the manufacturing  industries of minneapolis      the development of the milling industry in this city has been so  intimately connected with the growth and prosperity of the city itself   that the steps by which the art of milling has reached its present high  state of perfection are worthy of note  especially as minneapolis may  rightly claim the honor of having brought the improvements  which have  within the last decade so thoroughly revolutionized the art of making  flour  first into public notice  and of having contributed the largest  share of capital and inventive skill to their full development  so much is  this the case that the cluster of mills around the falls of st  anthony is  to day looked upon as the head center of the milling industry not only of  this country  but of the world  an exception to this broad statement may  possibly be made in favor of the city of buda pest  in austro hungary  from  the leading mills in which the millers in this country have obtained many  valuable ideas  to the credit of american millers and millwrights it must   however  be said that they have in all cases improved upon the information  they have thus obtained      to rightly understand the change that has taken place in milling methods  during the last ten years  it is necessary to compare the old way with the  new  and to observe wherein they differ  from the days of oliver evans  the  first american mechanic to make any improvement in milling machinery  until        there was  if we may except some grain cleaning or smut machines   no very strongly marked advance in milling machinery or in the methods of  manufacturing flour  it is true that the reel covered with finely woven  silk bolting cloth had taken the place of the muslin or woolen covered hand  sieve  and that the old granite millstones have given place to the french  burr  but these did not affect the essential parts of the  modus operandi    although the quality of the product was  no doubt  materially improved  the  processes employed in all the mills in the united states ten years ago were  identical  or very nearly so  with those in use in the brandywine mills in  evans s day  they were very simple  and may be divided into two distinct  operations      first  grinding  literally  the wheat      second  bolting or separating the flour or interior portion of the berry  from the outer husk  or bran  it may seem to some a rash assertion  but  this primitive way of making flour is still in vogue in over one half of  the mills of the united states  this does not  however  affect the truth of  the statement that the greater part of the flour now made in this country  is made on an entirely different and vastly improved system  which has come  to be known to the trade as the new process      in looking for a reason for the sudden activity and spirit of progress  which had its culmination in the new process  the character of the  wheat raised in the different sections of the union must be taken into  consideration  wheat may be divided into two classes  spring and winter   the latter generally being more starchy and easily pulverized  and at the  same time having a very tough bran or husk  which does not readily crumble  or cut to pieces in the process of grinding  it was with this wheat that  the mills of the country had chiefly to do  and the defects of the old  system of milling were not then so apparent  with the settlement of  minnesota  and the development of its capacities as a wheat growing state   a new factor in the milling problem was introduced  which for a time bid  fair to ruin every miller who undertook to solve it  the wheat raised in  this state was  from the climatic conditions  a spring wheat  hard in  structure and having a thin  tender  and friable bran  in milling this  wheat  if an attempt was made to grind it as fine as was then customary to  grind winter wheat  the bran was ground almost as fine as the flour  and  passed as readily through the meshes of the bolting reels or sieves   rendering the flour dark  specky  and altogether unfit to enter the eastern  markets in competition with flour from the winter wheat sections  on the  other hand  if the grinding was not so fine as to break up the bran   the interior of the berry being harder to pulverize  was not rendered  sufficiently fine  and there remained after the flour was bolted out a  large percentage of shorts or middlings  which  while containing the  strongest and best flour in the berry  were so full of dirt and impurities  as to render them unfit for any further grinding except for the very lowest  grade of flour  technically known as  red dog   the flour produced from  the first grinding was also more or less specky and discolored  and  in  everything but strength  inferior to that made from winter wheat  while the   yield  was so small  or  in other words  the amount of wheat which it took  to make a barrel of flour was so large  that milling in minnesota and other  spring wheat sections was anything but profitable      the problem which ten years since confronted the millers of this city was  how to obtain from the wheat which they had to grind a white  clear flour   and to so increase the yield as to leave some margin for profit  the first  step in the solution of this problem was the invention by e  n  la croix  of the machine which has since been called the purifier  which removed the  dirt and light impurities from the refuse middlings in the same manner that  dust and chaff are removed from wheat by a fanning mill  the middlings thus  purified were then reground  and the result was a much whiter and cleaner  flour than it had been possible to obtain under the old process of low  close grinding  this flour was called  patent  or  fancy   and at once took  a high position in the market  the first machine built by la croix was  immediately improved by george t  smith  and has since then been the  subject of numberless variations  changes  and improvements  and over the  principles embodied in its construction there has been fought one of the  longest and most bitter battles recorded in the annals of patent litigation  in this country  the purifier is to day the most important machine in use  in the manufacture of flour in this country  and may with propriety be  called the corner stone of new process milling  the earliest experiments in  its use in this country were made in what was then known as the  big mill   in this city  owned by washburn  stephens   co   and now known as the  washburn mill b      the next step in the development of the new process  also originating  in minneapolis  was the abandonment of the old system of cracking the  millstone  and substituting in its stead the use of smooth surfaces on the  millstones  thus in a large measure doing away with the abrasion of the  bran  and raising the quality of the flour produced at the first grinding   so far as we know  mr  e  r  stephens  a minneapolis miller  then employed  in the mill owned by messrs  pillsbury  crocker   fish  and now a member of  the prominent milling firm of freeman   stephens  river falls  wisconsin   was the first to venture on this innovation  he also first practiced the  widening of the furrows in the millstones and increasing their number  thus  adding largely to the amount of middlings made at the first grinding  and  raising the percentage of patent flour  he was warmly supported by amasa k   ostrander  since deceased  the founder and for a number of years the editor  of the  north western miller   a trade newspaper  the new ideas were for a  time vigorously combated by the millers  but their worth was so plain that  they were soon adopted  not only in minneapolis  but by progressive millers  throughout the country  the truth was the  new process  in its entirety   which may be summarized in four steps  first  grinding or  more properly   granulating the berry  second  bolting or separating the  chop  or meal  into first flour  middlings  and bran  third  purifying the middlings   fourth  regrinding and rebolting the middlings to produce the higher grade   or  patent  flour  this higher grade flour drove the best winter wheat  flours out of the eastern markets  and placed milling in minnesota upon a  firm basis  the development of the  new process  cannot be claimed by any  one man  hundreds of millers all over the country have contributed to its  advance  but the millers of minneapolis have always taken the lead      within the past two or three years what may be distinctively called the   new process  has  in the mills of minneapolis and some few other leading  mills in the country  been giving place to a new system  or rather  a  refinement of the processes above described  this latest system is known to  the trade as the  gradual reduction  or high grinding system  as the  new  process  is the medium high grinding system  and the old way is the low or  close grinding system  in using the gradual reduction in making flour the  millstones are abandoned  except for finishing some of the inferior grades  of flour  and the work is done by means of grooved and plain rollers  made  of chilled iron or porcelain  in some cases disks of chilled iron  suitably  furrowed  are used  and in others concave mills  consisting of a cylinder  running against a concave plate  in minneapolis the chilled iron rolls take  the precedence of all other means      the system of gradual reduction is much more complicated than either of  those which preceded it  but the results obtained are a marked advance over  the  new process   the percentage of high grade flour is increased  several  grades of different degrees of excellence being produced  and the yield  is also greater from a given quantity of wheat  the system consists in  reducing the wheat to flour  not at one operation  as in the old system   nor in two grindings  as in the  new process   but in several successive  reductions  four  five  or six  as the case may be  the wheat is first  passed through a pair of corrugated chilled iron rollers  which merely  split it open along the crease of the berry  liberating the dirt which lies  in the crease so that it can be removed by bolting  a very small percentage  of low grade flour is also made in this reduction  after passing through  what is technically called a  scalping reel  to remove the dirt and flour   the broken wheat is passed through a second set of corrugated rollers  by  which it is further broken up  and then passes through a second separating  reel  which removes the flour and middlings  this operation is repeated  successively until the flour portion of the berry is entirely removed from  the bran  the necessary separation being made after each reduction  the  middlings from the several reductions are passed through the purifiers   and  after being purified  are reduced to flour by successive reductions  on smooth iron or porcelain rollers  in some cases  as stated above  iron  disks and concave mills are substituted for the roller mill  but the  operation is substantially the same  one of the principal objects sought to  be attained by this high grinding system is to avoid all abrasion of the  bran  another is to take out the dirt in the crease of the berry at the  beginning of the process  and still another to thoroughly free the bran  from flour  so as to obtain as large a yield as possible  incidental to the  improved methods of milling  as now practiced in this country  is a marked  improvement in the cleaning of the grain and preparing it for flouring  the  earliest grain cleaning machine was the  smutter   the office of which was  to break the smut balls  and scour the outside of the bran to remove any  adhering dust  the scouring machine being too harsh in its action  breaking  the kernels of wheat  and so scratching and weakening the bran that it  broke up readily in the grinding  the scouring process was therefore  lessened  and was followed by brush machines  which brushed the dirt   loosened up and left by the scourer  from the berry  other machines for  removing the fuzzy and germ ends of the berry have also been introduced   and everything possible is done to free the grain from extraneous  impurities before the process of reduction is commenced  in all the minor  details of the mill there has been the same marked change  until the modern  merchant mill of to day no more resembles that of twenty five years ago  than does the modern cotton mill the old fashioned distaff  the change has  extended into the winter wheat sections  and no mill in the united states  can hope to hold its place in the markets unless it is provided with the  many improvements in machinery and processes which have resulted from the  experiments begun in this city only ten years since  and which have  made the name of minneapolis and the products of her many mills famous  throughout the world  the relative merits of the flour made by the new  process and the old have been warmly discussed  but the general verdict  of the great body of consumers is that the patent or new process flour is  better in every way for bread making purposes  being clearer  whiter  more  evenly granulated  and possessing more strength  careful chemical analysis  has confirmed this  as between winter and spring wheat flours made by the  new process and gradual reduction systems  it maybe remarked that the  former contain more starch and are whiter in color  while the latter   having more gluten  excel in strength  in milling all varieties of wheat   whether winter or spring  the new processes are in every way superior to  the old  and  in aiding their inception and development  the millers of  minneapolis have conferred a lasting benefit on the country      minneapolis  minn   december                the milling structures and machinery       mr  johnson added the following  showing the present status of the milling  industry in minneapolis      the description of the process of the manufacture of flour so well  given above  conveys no idea of the extent and magnitude of the milling  structures  machinery  and buildings employed in the business  many of the  leading millers and millwrights have personally visited and studied the  best mills in england  france  hungary  and germany  and are as familiar  with their theory  methods  and construction as of their own  and no  expense or labor has been spared in introducing the most approved features  of the improvements in the foreign mills  experimenting is constantly going  on  and the path behind the successful millers is strewn with the wrecks of  failures  a very large proportion of the machinery is imported  though the  american machinists are fast outstripping their european rivals in the  quality and efficiency of the machinery needed for the new mills constantly  going up      there are twenty eight of these mills now constructed and at work   operating an equivalent of     runs of stone  consuming over sixteen  million bushels of wheat  and manufacturing over three million barrels of  flour annually  their capacities range from     to       barrels of flour  per day  great as these capacities are  there is now one in process of  construction  the pillsbury a mill  which at the beginning of the harvest  of      will have a capacity of       barrels daily  the washburn a mill   whose capacity is now       barrels  is being enlarged to make        barrels a day  and the crown roller mill  owned by christian bros    co    is also being enlarged to produce       barrels a day  the largest mill in  europe has a daily capacity of but       barrels  and no european mill is  fitted with the exquisite perfection of machinery and apparatus to be found  in the mills of this city      the buildings are mainly built of blue limestone  found so abundant in the  quarries of this city  range and line work  and rest on the solid ledge   the earlier built mills are severely plain  but the newer ones are greatly  improved by the taste of the architect  and are imposing and beautiful in  appearance        direct foreign trade     the flour of minneapolis  holding so high a rank in the markets of the  world  is always in active demand  especially the best grades  and brings  from       to       per barrel more than flour of the best qualities of  southern  eastern  or foreign wheat  during the year nearly a million  barrels were shipped direct to european and other foreign ports  on through  bills of lading  and drawn for by banks here having special foreign  exchange arrangements  at sight  on the day of shipment  this trade  is constantly increasing  and the amount of flour handled by eastern  commission men is decreasing in proportion                                                 referring to the foregoing  the following letter from mr  geo  t  smith to  the editor of the  london miller  is of interest     sir  i find published in the  north western miller  of december            extracts from an article on the origin of new process milling  prepared by  albert hoppin  esq   editor of the above named journal  for the use of one  of the statistical divisions of the united states census  which is so at  variance  in at least one important particular  with the facts set forth in  the paper read by me before the british and irish millers  at their meeting  in may last  that i think i ought to take notice of its statements  more  especially as the  north western miller  has quite a circulation on this  side of the water     as stated in the paper read by me above mentioned  i was engaged in  february        by mr  christian  who was then operating the  big   or  washburn mill at minneapolis  to take charge of the stones in that mill  at  this time mr  christian was very much interested in the improvement of the  quality of his flour  which in common with the flour of minneapolis mills   without exception  was very poor indeed  for some time previous to this i  had insisted to him most strenuously that the beginning of any improvement  must be found in smooth  true  and well balanced stones  and it was because  he was at last convinced that my ideas were at least worthy of a practical  test i was placed in charge of his mill  nearly two months were consumed in  truing and smoothing the stone  as all millers in the mill had struck  at once when they became acquainted with the character of the changes i  proposed to make     i remained with mr  christian until the latter part of       in all about  eight months  during this time the flour from the washburn mill attained a  celebrity that made it known and sought after all over the united states   it commanded attention as an event of the very greatest importance  from  the fact that it was justly felt that if a mill grinding spring wheat  exclusively was capable of producing a flour infinitely superior in every  way to the best that could be made from the finest varieties of winter  wheats  the new north western territory  with its peculiar adaptation to  the growing of spring grain  and its boundless capacity for production   must at once become one of the most important sections of the country     mr  christian s appreciation of the improvements i had made in his mill  was attested by doubly locked and guarded entrances  and by the stringent  regulations which were adopted to prevent any of his employes carrying  information with regard to the process to his competitors     all this time other minneapolis mills were doing such work and only such as  they had done previously  ought not the writer of an article on the origin  of new process milling  which article is intended to become historical  and  to have its authenticity indorsed by the government  to have known whether  mr  christian  in the washburn mill  did or did not make a grade of  flour which has hardly been excelled since for months before any other  minneapolis mill approached his product in any degree  and should he not  be well enough acquainted with the milling of that period          to know  that such results as were obtained in the washburn mill could only be  secured by the use of  smooth  and  true  stones  mr  stephens  whom i  shall mention again presently  did  not  work in the washburn mill while i  was in charge of it     in the fall of      i entered into a contract with mr  c  a  pillsbury   owner of the taylor mill and senior partner in the firm by whom the  minneapolis mill was operated  to put both those mills into condition to  make the same grade of flour as mr  christian was making  the consideration  in the contract was       dols  at the above mills i met to some extent the  same obstruction in regard to millers striking as had greeted me at mr   christian s mill earlier in the year  but among those who did not strike at  the minneapolis mill i saw  for the first time  mr  stephens  then still  in his apprenticeship  whom mr  hoppin declares to have been   so far as i  know   the first miller to use smooth stones  if mr  hoppin is right in his  assertion  perhaps he will explain why  during the eight months i was at  the washburn mill  mr  stephens did not make a corresponding improvement  in the product of the minneapolis mill  that he did not do this is amply  proved by the fact of mr  pillsbury giving me       dols  to introduce  improvements into his mills  when  supposing mr  hoppin s statement to  be correct  he might have had the same alterations carried out under mr   stephens  direction at a mere nominal cost  as a matter of fact  the stones  in both the taylor and minneapolis mills were as rough as any in the  washburn mill when i took charge of them     thus it appears     that the flour made by the mill in which stephens was  employed was not improved in quality  while that of the washburn mill   where he was not employed  became the finest that had ever been made in the  united states at that time  that     the owner of the mill in which mr   stephens was employed  as he was not making good flour  engaged me at a  large cost to introduce into his mills the alterations by which only  both  mr  hoppin and myself agree  could any material improvement in the milling  of that period be effected   viz   smooth  true  and well balanced  stones   geo  t  smith                                                 for breachy animals do not use barbed fences  to see the lacerations that  these fences have produced upon the innocent animals should be sufficient  testimony against them  many use pokes and blinders on cattle and goats   but as a rule such things fail  the better way is to separate breachy  animals from the lot  as others will imitate their habits sooner or later   and then  if not curable   sell them                                                        the guenon milk mirror       the name of the simple bordeaux peasant is  and should be  permanently  associated with his discovery that the milking qualities of cows were  to a  considerable extent  indicated by certain external marks easily observed   we had long known that capacious udders and large milk veins  combined with  good digestive capacity and a general preponderance of the alimentary over  the locomotive system  were indications that rarely misled in regard to the  ability of a cow to give much milk  but to judge of the amount of milk a  cow would yield  and the length of time she would hold out in her flow  two  or three years before she could be called a cow  this was guenon s great  accomplishment  and the one for which he was awarded a gold medal by the  agricultural society of his native district  this was the first of many  honors with which he was rewarded  and it is much to say that no committee  of agriculturists who have ever investigated the merits of the system  have ever spoken disparagingly of it  those who most closely study it   especially following guenon s original system  which has never been  essentially improved upon  are most positive in regard to its truth   enthusiastic in regard to its value     the fine  soft hair upon the hinder part of a cow s udder for the most part  turns upward  this upward growing hair extends in most cases all over that  part of the udder visible between the hind legs  but is occasionally marked  by spots or mere lines  usually slender ovals  in which the hair grows  down  this tendency of the hair to grow upward is not confined to the udder  proper  but extends out upon the thighs and upward to the tail  the edges  of this space over which the hair turns up are usually distinctly marked   and  as a rule  the larger the area of this space  which is called the   mirror  or  escutcheon   the more milk the cow will give  and the longer  she will continue in milk      illustration  escutcheon of the jersey bull calf  grand mirror             that portion of the escutcheon which covers the udder and extends out on  the inside of each thigh  has been designated as the udder or mammary  mirror  that which runs upward towards the setting on of the tail  the  rising or placental mirror  the mammary mirror is of the greater value   yet the rising mirror is not to be disregarded  it is regarded of especial  moment that the mirror  taken as a whole  be symmetrical  and especially  that the mammary mirror be so  yet it often occurs that it is far  otherwise  its outline being often very fantastical  exhibiting deep   bays   so to speak  and islands of downward growing hair  there are also  certain  ovals   never very large  yet distinct  which do not detract from  the estimated value of an escutcheon  notably those occurring on the lobes  of the udder just above the hind teats  these are supposed to be points of  value  though for what reason it would be hard to tell  yet they do occur  upon some of the very best milch cows  and those whose mirrors correspond  most closely to their performances     mr  guenon s discovery enables breeders to determine which of their calves  are most promising  and in purchasing young stock it affords indications  which rarely fail as to their comparative milk yield  these indications  occasionally prove utterly fallacious  and mr  guenon gives rules for  determining this class  which he calls  bastards   without waiting for them  to fail in their milk  the signs are  however  rarely so distinct that one  would be willing to sell a twenty quart cow  whose yield confirmed the  prediction of her mirror at first calving  because of the possibility of  the going dry in two months  or so  as indicated by her bastardy marks     it is an interesting fact that the mirrors of bulls  which are much like  those of cows  but less extensive in every direction  are reflected in  their daughters  this gives rise to the dangerous custom of breeding for  mirrors  rather than for milk  what the results may be after a few years it  is easy to see  the mirror  being valued for its own sake  that is  because  it sells the heifers  will be likely to lose its practical significance and  value as a  milk  mirror     we have a striking photograph of a young jersey bull  the property of mr   john l  hopkins  of atlanta  ga   and called  grand mirror   this we have  caused to be engraved and the mirror is clearly shown  a larger mirror is  rarely seen upon a bull  we hope in a future number to exhibit some cows   mirrors of different forms and degrees of excellence    rural new yorker                                                        two good lawn trees       the negundo  or ash leaved maple  as it

which art cannot  improve     h t j                                                       cutting sods for lawns       i am a very good sod layer  and used to lay very large lawns  half to  three quarters of an acre  i cut the sods as follows  take a board eight to  nine inches wide  four  five  or six feet long  and cut downward all around  the board  then turn the board over and cut again alongside the edge of the  board  and so on as many sods as needed  then cut the turf with a sharp  spade  all the same lengths  begin on one end  and roll together  eight  inches by five feet is about as much as a man can handle conveniently  it  is very easy to load them on a wagon  cart  or barrow  and they can be  quickly laid  after laying a good piece  sprinkle a little with a watering  pot  if the sods are dry  then use the back of the spade to smooth them a  little  if a very fine effect is wanted  throw a shovelful or two of good  earth over each square yard  and smooth it with the back of a steel rake     f h                                                        country gentleman      horticultural notes       the western new york society met at rochester  january         new apples  pears  grapes  etc    wm  c barry  secretary of the committee  on native fruits  read a full report  among the older varieties of the  apple  he strongly recommended button beauty  which had proved so excellent  in massachusetts  and which had been equally successful at the mount  hope nurseries at rochester  the fine growth of the tree and its great  productiveness being strongly in its favor  the wagener and northern spy  are among the finer sorts  the melon is one of the best among the older  sorts  the fruit being quite tender will not bear long shipment  but it  possesses great value for home use  and being a poor grower  it had been  thrown aside by nurserymen and orchardists  it should be top grafted on  more vigorous sorts  the jonathan is another fine sort of slender growth   which should be top grafted     among new pears  hoosic and frederic clapp were highly commended for their  excellence  some of the older peaches of fine quality had of late been  neglected  and among them druid hill and brevoort     among the many new peaches highly recommended for their early ripening   there was great resemblance to each other  and some had proved earlier than  alexander     of the new grapes  lady washington was the most promising  the secretary  was a failure  the jefferson was a fine sort  of high promise     among the new white grapes  niagara  prentiss  and duchess stood  pre eminent  and were worthy of the attention of cultivators  the  vergennes  from vermont  a light amber colored sort  was also highly  commended  the elvira  so highly valued in missouri  does not succeed well  here  several facts were stated in relation to the delaware grape  showing  its reliability and excellence     several new varieties of the raspberry were named  but few of them were  found equal to the best old sorts  if brinckle s orange were taken as a  standard for quality  it would show that none had proved its equal in fine  quality  the caroline was like it in color  but inferior in flavor  the new  rochelle was of second quality  turner was a good berry  but too soft for  distant carriage     of the many new strawberries named  each seemed to have some special  drawback  the bidwell  however  was a new sort of particular excellence   and charles downing thinks it the most promising of the new berries      discussion on grapes    c  w  beadle  of ontario  in allusion to moore s  early grape  finds it much earlier than the concord  and equal to it in  quality  ripening even before the hartford  s  d  willard  of geneva   thought it inferior to the concord  and not nearly so good as the worden   the last named was both earlier and better than the concord  and sold for  seven cents per pound when the concord brought only four cents  c  a   green  of monroe county  said the lady washington proved to be a very fine  grape  slightly later than concord  p  l  perry  of canandaigua  said  that the vergennes ripens with hartford  and possesses remarkable keeping  qualities  and is of excellent quality and free from pulp  he presented  specimens which had been kept in good condition  he added  in relation to  the worden grape  that some years ago it brought    cents per pound in new  york when the concord sold three days later for only   cents   in such  comparisons  however  it should be borne in mind that new varieties usually  receive more attention and better culture  giving them an additional  advantage      the niagara grape received special attention from members  a  c  younglove   of yates county  thought it superior to any other white grape for its many  good qualities  it was a vigorous and healthy grower  and the clusters were  full and handsome  w  j  fowler  of monroe county  saw the vine in october   with the leaves still hanging well  a great bearer and the grape of fine  quality  c  l  hoag  of lockport  said he began to pick the niagara on the    th of august  but its quality improved by hanging on the vine  j  harris   of niagara county  was well acquainted with the niagara  and indorsed all  the commendation which had been uttered in its favor  t  c  maxwell said  there was one fault  we could not get it  as it was not in market  w  c   barry  of rochester  spoke highly of the niagara  and its slight foxiness  would be no objection to those who like that peculiarity  c  l  hoag  thought this was the same quality that col  wilder described as  a little  aromatic   a  c  younglove found the niagara to ripen with the delaware   inquiry being made relative to the pockington grape  h  e  hooker said it  ripened as early as the concord  c  a  green was surprised that it had not  attracted more attention  as he regarded it as a very promising grape  j   charlton  of rochester  said that the fruit had been cut for market on the    th of august  and on the  th of september it was fully ripe  but he has  known it to hang as late as november  j  s  stone had found that when it  hung as late as november it became sweet and very rich in flavor      new peaches    a  c  younglove had found such very early sorts as  alexander and amsden excellent for home use  but not profitable for market   the insects and birds made heavy depredations on them  while nearly all  very early and high colored sorts suffer largely from the birds  the  rivers  a white peach  does not attract them  and hence it may be  profitable for market if skillfully packed  rough and careless handling  will spoil the fruit  he added that the wheatland peach sustains its high  reputation  and he thought it the best of all sorts for market  ripening  with late crawford  it is a great bearer  but carries a crop of remarkably  uniform size  so that it is not often necessary to throw out a bad  specimen  this is the result of experience with it by mr  rogers at  wheatland  in monroe county  and at his own residence in vine valley  s  d   willard confirmed all that mr  younglove had said of the excellence of the  rivers peach  he had ripened the amsden for several years  and found it  about two weeks earlier than the rivers  and he thought if the amsden were  properly thinned  it would prevent the common trouble of its rotting  such  had been his experience  e  a  bronson  of geneva  objected to making very  early peaches prominent for marketing  as purchasers would prefer waiting  a few days to paying high prices for the earliest  and he would caution  people against planting the amsden too largely  and its free recommendation  might mislead  may s choice was named by h  e  hooker as a beautiful yellow  peach  having no superior in quality  but perhaps it may not be found  to have more general value than early and late crawford  it is scarcely  distinguishable in appearance from fine specimens of early crawford  w  c   barry was called on for the most recent experience with the waterloo   but said he was not at home when it ripened  but he learned that it had  sustained its reputation  a  c  younglove said that the salway is the best  late peach  ripening eight or ten days after the smock  s  d  willard  mentioned an orchard near geneva  consisting of    salway trees  which for  four years had ripened their crop and had sold for    per bushel in the  philadelphia market  or for    at geneva  a higher price than for any other  sort  and the owner intends to plant     more trees  w  c  barry said the  salway will not ripen at rochester  hill s chili was named by some members  as a good peach for canning and drying  some stating that it ripens before  and others after late crawford  it requires thinning on the tree  or  the fruit will be poor  the allen was pronounced by mr  younglove as an  excellent  intensely high colored late peach      insects affecting horticulture    mr  zimmerman spoke of the importance  of all cultivators knowing so much of insects and their habits as to  distinguish their friends from their enemies  when unchecked they increase  in an immense ratio  and he mentioned as an instance that the green fly    aphis   in five generations may become the parent of six thousand million  descendants  it is necessary  then  to know what other insects are employed  in holding them in check  by feeding on them  some of our most formidable  insects have been accidentally imported from europe  such as the codling  moth  asparagus beetle  cabbage butterfly  currant worm and borer  elm tree  beetle  hessian fly  etc   but in nearly every instance these have come  over without bringing their insect enemies with them  and in consequence  they have spread more extensively here than in europe  it was therefore  urged that the agricultural department at washington be requested to  import  as far as practicable  such parasites as are positively known to  prey on noxious insects  the cabbage fly eluded our keen custom house  officials in       and has enjoyed free citizenship ever since  by  accident  one of its insect enemies  a small black fly  was brought over  with it  and is now doing excellent work by keeping the cabbage fly in  check     the codling moth  one of the most formidable fruit destroyers  may be  reduced in number by the well known paper bands  but a more efficient  remedy is to shower them early in the season with paris green  mixed in  water at the rate of only one pound to one hundred gallons of water  with  a forcing pump  soon after blossoming  after all the experiments made and  repellents used for the plum curculio  the jarring method is found the most  efficient and reliable  if properly performed  various remedies for insects  sometimes have the credit of doing the work  if used in those seasons  when the insects happen to be few  with some insects  the use of oil is  advantageous  as it always closes up their breathing holes and suffocates  them  the oil should be mixed with milk  and then diluted as required  as  the oil alone cannot be mixed with the water  as a general remedy   paris green is the strongest that can be applied  a teaspoonful to a  tablespoonful  in a barrel of water  is enough  hot water is the best  remedy for house plants  place one hand over the soil  invert the pot  and  plunge the foliage for a second only at a time in water heated to from     deg   to     deg f  according to the plants  or apply with a fine rose  the yeast  remedy has not proved successful in all cases     among beneficial insects  there are about one hundred species of lady bugs   and  so far as known  all are beneficial  cultivators should know them   they destroy vast quantities of plant lice  the ground beetles are mostly  cannibals  and should not be destroyed  the large black beetle  with  coppery dots  makes short work with the colorado potato beetles  and  a bright green beetle will climb trees to get a meal of canker worms   ichneumon flies are among our most useful insects  the much abused dragon  flies are perfectly harmless to us  but destroy many mosquitoes and flies     among insects that attack large fruits is the codling moth  to be destroyed  by paper bands  or with paris green showered in water  the round headed  apple tree borer is to be cut out  and the eggs excluded with a sheet of  tarred paper around the stem  and slightly sunk in the earth  for the  oyster shell bark louse  apply linseed oil  paris green  in water   will kill the canker worm  tobacco water does the work for plant lice   peach tree borers are excluded with tarred or felt paper  and cut out with  a knife  jar the grape flea beetle on an inverted umbrella early in the  morning  among small fruit insects  the strawberry worms are readily  destroyed with hellebore  an ounce to a gallon of warm water  the same  remedy destroys the imported currant worm      insect destroyers    prof  w  saunders  of the province of ontario   followed mr  zimmerman with a paper on other departments of the same  general subject  which contained much information and many suggestions of  great value to cultivators  he had found paris green an efficient remedy  for the bud moth on pear and other trees  he also recommends paris green  for the grapevine flea beetle  hellebore is much better for the pear slug  than dusting with sand  as these slugs  as soon as their skin is spoiled  by being sanded  cast it off and go on with their work of destruction as  freely as ever  and this they repeat  he remarked that it is a common error  that all insects are pests to the cultivator  there are many parasites   or useful ones  which prey on our insect enemies  out of       described  insects in this country  only about    have proved destructive to our  crops  parasites are much more numerous  among lepidopterous insects   butterflies  etc    there are very few noxious species  many active  friends are found among the hymenoptera  wasps  etc    the ichneumon flies  pre eminently so  and in the order hemiptera  bugs proper  are several that  destroy our enemies  hence the very common error that birds which destroy  insects are beneficial to us  as they are more likely to destroy our insect  friends than the fewer enemies  those known as  flycatchers  may do neither  harm nor good  so far as they eat the wheat midge and hessian fly they  confer a positive benefit  in other instances they destroy both friends and  enemies  birds that are only partly insectivorous  and which eat grain and  fruit  may need further inquiry  prof  s  had examined the stomachs of many  such birds  and particularly of the american robin  and the only curculio  he ever found in any of these was a single one in a whole cherry which the  bird had bolted entire  robins had proved very destructive to his grapes   but had not assisted at all in protecting his cabbages growing alongside  his fruit garden  these vegetables were nearly destroyed by the larvae of  the cabbage fly  which would have afforded the birds many fine  rich meals   this comparatively feeble insect has been allowed by the throngs of birds  to spread over the whole continent  a naturalist in one of the western  states had examined several species of the thrush  and found they had eaten  mostly that class of insects known as our friends     prof  s  spoke of the remedies for root lice  among which were hot water  and bisulphide of carbon  hot water will get cold before it can reach the  smaller roots  however efficient it may be showered on leaves  bisulphide  of carbon is very volatile  inflammable  and sometimes explosive  and must  be handled with great care  it permeates the soil  and if in sufficient  quantity may be effective in destroying the phylloxera  but its cost and  dangerous character prevent it from being generally recommended     paris green is most generally useful for destroying insects  as sold to  purchasers  it is of various grades of purity  the highest in price is  commonly the purest  and really the cheapest  a difficulty with this  variable quality is that it cannot be properly diluted with water  and  those who buy and use a poor article and try its efficacy  will burn or  kill their plants when they happen to use a stronger  purer  and more  efficient one  or  if the reverse is done  they may pronounce it a humbug  from the resulting failure  one teaspoonful  if pure  is enough for a large  pail of water  or if mixed with flour  there should be forty or fifty times  as much  water is best  as the operator will not inhale the dust  london  purple is another form of the arsenic  and has very variable qualities  of the poison  being merely refuse matter from manufactories  it is more  soluble than paris green  and hence more likely to scorch plants  on the  whole  paris green is much the best and most reliable for common use     at the close of prof  saunders  remarks some objections were made by  members present to the use of paris green on fruit soon after blossoming   and prof  s  sustained the objection  in that the knowledge that the fruit  had been showered with it would deter purchasers from receiving it  even if  no poison could remain on it from spring to autumn  a man had brought to  him potatoes to analyze for arsenic  on which paris green had been used   and although it was shown to him that the poison did not reach the roots  beneath the soil  and if it did it was insoluble and could not enter them   he was not satisfied until a careful analysis was made and no arsenic at  all found in them  a member said that in mixing with plaster there should  be     or     pounds of plaster to one of the paris green  and that a  smaller quantity  by weight  of flour would answer  as that is a more bulky  article for the same weight                                                       observations on the salmon of the pacific     by david s  jordan and chas  h  gilbert       during the most of the present year  the writers have been engaged in the  study of the fishes of the pacific coast of the united states  in the  interest of the u s  fish commission and the u s  census bureau  the  following pages contain the principal facts ascertained concerning the  salmon of the pacific coast  it is condensed from our report to the u s   census bureau  by permission of professor goode  assistant in charge of  fishery investigations     there are five species of salmon  oncorhynchus  in the waters of the north  pacific  we have at present no evidence of the existence of any more on  either the american or the asiatic side     these species may be called the quinnat or king salmon  the blue back  salmon or red fish  the silver salmon  the dog salmon  and the hump back  salmon  or  oncorhynchus chouicha  nerka  kisutch  keta   and  gorbuscha    all these species are now known to occur in the waters of kamtschatka as  well as in those of alaska and oregon     as vernacular names of definite application  the following are on

salmon     e  hump back  gorbuscha  haddo  hone  holia  lost salmon  puget sound  salmon  dog salmon  of alaska      of these species  the blue back predominates in frazer s river  the silver  salmon in puget sound  the quinnat in the columbia and the sacramento  and  the silver salmon in most of the small streams along the coast  all the  species have been seen by us in the columbia and in frazer s river  all  but the blue back in the sacramento  and all but the blue back in waters  tributary to puget sound  only the quinnat has been noticed south of san  francisco  and its range has been traced as far as ventura river  which is  the southernmost stream in california which is not muddy and alkaline at  its mouth     of these species  the quinnat and blue back salmon habitually  run  in the  spring  the others in the fall  the usual order of running in the rivers is  as follows   nerka  chouicha  kisutch  gorbuscha  keta      the economic value of the spring running salmon is far greater than that of  the other species  because they can be captured in numbers when at their  best  while the others are usually taken only after deterioration     the habits of the salmon in the ocean are not easily studied  quinnat and  silver salmon of every size are taken with the seine at almost any season  in puget sound  the quinnat takes the hook freely in monterey bay  both  near the shore and at a distance of six or eight miles out  we have reason  to believe that these two species do not necessarily seek great depths  but  probably remain not very far from the mouth of the rivers in which they  were spawned     the blue back and the dog salmon probably seek deeper water  as the former  is seldom or never taken with the seine in the ocean  and the latter is  known to enter the straits of fuca at the spawning season     the great majority of the quinnat salmon and nearly all blue back salmon  enter the rivers in the spring  the run of both begins generally the last  of march  it lasts  with various modifications and interruptions  until  the actual spawning season in november  the time of running and the  proportionate amount of each of the subordinate runs  varying with each  different river  in general  the runs are slack in the summer and increase  with the first high water of autumn  by the last of august only straggling  blue backs can be found in the lower course of any stream  but both in the  columbia and the sacramento the quinnat runs in considerable numbers till  october at least  in the sacramento the run is greatest in the fall  and  more run in the summer than in spring  in the sacramento and the smaller  rivers southward  there is a winter run  beginning in december     the spring salmon ascend only those rivers which are fed by the melting  snows from the mountains  and which have sufficient volume to send their  waters well out to sea  such rivers are the sacramento  rogue  klamath   columbia  and frazer s rivers     those salmon which run in the spring are chiefly adults  supposed to be at  least three years old   their milt and spawn are no more developed than at  the same time in others of the same species which will not enter the rivers  until fall  it would appear that the contact with cold fresh water  when in  the ocean  in some way caused them to turn toward it and to  run   before  there is any special influence to that end exerted by the development of  the organs of generation     high water on any of these rivers in the spring is always followed by an  increased run of salmon  the canners think  and this is probably true  that  salmon which would not have run till later are brought up by the contact  with the cold water  the cause of this effect of cold fresh water is not  understood  we may call it an instinct of the salmon  which is another way  of expressing our ignorance  in general  it seems to be true that in those  rivers and during those years when the spring run is greatest  the fall run  is least to be depended on     as the season advances  smaller and younger salmon of these two species   quinnat and blue back  enter the rivers to spawn  and in the fall these  young specimens are very numerous  we have thus far failed to notice any  gradations in size or appearance of these young fish by which their ages  could be ascertained  it is  however  probable that some of both sexes  reproduce at the age of one year  in frazer s river  in the fall  quinnat  male grilse of every size  from eight inches upward  were running  the milt  fully developed  but usually not showing the hooked jaws and dark colors  of the older males  females less than eighteen inches in length were rare   all  large and small  then in the river  of either sex  had the ovaries or  milt well developed     little blue backs of every size down to six inches are also found in  the upper columbia in the fall  with their organs of generation fully  developed  nineteen twentieths of these young fish are males  and some of  them have the hooked jaws and red color of the old males     the average weight of the quinnat in the columbia in the spring is  twenty two pounds  in the sacramento about sixteen  individuals weighing  from forty to sixty pounds are frequently found in both rivers  and some as  high as eighty pounds are reported  it is questioned whether these large  fishes are       a    those which  of the same age  have grown more rapidly       b    those which are older but have  for some reason  failed to spawn   or       c    those which have survived one or more spawning seasons     all of these origins may be possible in individual cases  we are  however   of the opinion that the majority of these large fish are those which have  hitherto run in the fall and so may have survived the spawning season  previous     those fish which enter the rivers in the spring continue their ascent until  death or the spawning season overtakes them  probably none of them ever  return to the ocean  and a large proportion fail to spawn  they are known  to ascend the sacramento as far as the base of mount shasta  or to its  extreme head waters  about four hundred miles  in the columbia they are  known to ascend as far as the bitter root mountains  and as far as the  spokan falls  and their extreme limit is not known  this is a distance of  six to eight hundred miles     at these great distances  when the fish have reached the spawning grounds   besides the usual changes of the breeding season  their bodies are covered  with bruises on which patches of white fungus develop  the fins become  mutilated  their eyes are often injured or destroyed  parasitic worms  gather in their gills  they become extremely emaciated  their flesh  becomes white from the loss of the oil  and as soon as the spawning act  is accomplished  and sometimes before  all of them die  the ascent of the  cascades and the dalles probably causes the injury or death of a great many  salmon     when the salmon enter the river they refuse bait  and their stomachs are  always found empty and contracted  in the rivers they do not feed  and when  they reach the spawning grounds their stomachs  pyloric coeca and all  are  said to be no larger than one s finger  they will sometimes take the  fly  or a hook baited with salmon roe  in the clear waters of the upper  tributaries  but there is no other evidence known to us that they feed when  there  only the quinnat and blue back  then called red fish  have been  found in the fall at any great distance from the sea     the spawning season is probably about the same for all the species  it  varies for all in different rivers and in different parts of the same  river  and doubtless extends from july to december     the manner of spawning is probably similar for all the species  but we have  no data for any except the quinnat  in this species the fish pair off  the  male  with tail and snout  excavates a broad shallow  nest  in the gravelly  bed of the stream  in rapid water  at a depth of one to four feet  the  female deposits her eggs in it  and after the exclusion of the milt  they  cover them with stones and gravel  they then float down the stream tail  foremost  a great majority of them die  in the head waters of the large  streams all die  unquestionably  in the small streams  and near the sea  an  unknown percentage probably survive  the young hatch in about sixty days   and most of them return to the ocean during the high water of the spring     the salmon of all kinds in the spring are silvery  spotted or not according  to the species  and with the mouth about equally symmetrical in both sexes     as the spawning season approaches the female loses her silvery color   becomes more slimy  the scales on the back partly sink into the skin  and  the flesh changes from salmon red and becomes variously paler  from the  loss of the oil  the degree of paleness varying much with individuals and  with inhabitants of different rivers     in the lower sacramento the flesh of the quinnat in either spring or fall  is rarely pale  in the columbia  a few with pale flesh are sometimes taken  in spring  and a good many in the fall  in frazer s river the fall run of  the quinnat is nearly worthless for canning purposes  because so many are  white meated  in the spring very few are white meated  but the number  increases towards fall  when there is every variation  some having red  streaks running through them  others being red toward the head and pale  toward the tail  the red and pale ones cannot be distinguished externally   and the color is dependent neither on age nor sex  there is said to be no  difference in the taste  but there is no market for canned salmon not of  the conventional orange color     as the season advances  the differences between the males and the females  become more and more marked  and keep pace with the development of the  milt  as is shown by dissection     the males have    a    the premaxillaries and the tip of the lower jaw  more and more prolonged  both of them becoming finally strongly and often  extravagantly hooked  so that either they shut by the side of each other  like shears  or else the mouth cannot be closed    b    the front teeth  become very long and canine like  their growth proceeding very rapidly   until they are often half an inch long    c    the teeth on the vomer and  tongue often disappear    d    the body grows more compressed and deeper  at the shoulders  so that a very distinct hump is formed  this is more  developed in     gorbuscha   but is found in all    e    the scales  disappear  especially on the back  by the growth of spongy skin    f    the  color changes from silvery to various shades of black and red or blotchy   according to the species  the blue back turns rosy red  the dog salmon a  dull  blotchy red  and the quiunat generally blackish     these distorted males are commonly considered worthless  rejected by the  canners and salmon salters  but preserved by the indians  these changes are  due solely to influences connected with the growth of the testes  they are  not in any way due to the action of fresh water  they take place at about  the same time in the adult males of all species  whether in the ocean or  in the rivers  at the time of the spring runs all are symmetrical  in the  fall  all males of whatever species are more or less distorted  among the  dog salmon  which run only in the fall  the males are hooked jawed and  red blotched when they first enter the straits of fuca from the outside   the hump back  taken in salt water about seattle  shows the same  peculiarities  the male is slab sided  hook billed  and distorted  and is  rejected by the canners  no hook jawed  females  of any species have been  seen     it is not positively known that any hook jawed male survives the  reproductive act  if any do  their jaws must resume the normal form     on first entering a stream the salmon swim about as if playing  they always  head toward the current  and this  playing  may be simply due to facing the  flood tide  afterwards they enter the deepest parts of the stream and swim  straight up  with few interruptions  their rate of travel on the sacramento  is estimated by stone at about two miles per day  on the columbia at about  three miles per day     as already stated  the economic value of any species depends in great part  on its being a  spring salmon   it is not generally possible to capture  salmon of any species in large numbers until they have entered the rivers   and the spring salmon enter the rivers long before the growth of the organs  of reproduction has reduced the richness of the flesh  the fall salmon  cannot be taken in quantity until their flesh has deteriorated  hence the   dog salmon  is practically almost worthless  except to the indians  and  the hump back salmon is little better  the silver salmon  with the same  breeding habits as the dog salmon  is more valuable  as it is found in  puget sound for a considerable time before the fall rains cause the fall  runs  and it may be taken in large numbers with seines before the season  for entering the rivers  the quinnat salmon  from its great size and  abundance  is more valuable than all other fishes on our pacific coast  together  the blue back  similar in flesh but much smaller and less  abundant  is worth much more than the combined value of the three remaining  species     the fall salmon of all species  but especially the dog salmon  ascend  streams but a short distance before spawning  they seem to be in great  anxiety to find fresh water  and many of them work their way up little  brooks only a few inches deep  where they soon perish miserably   floundering about on the stones  every stream  of whatever kind  has more  or less of these fall salmon     it is the prevailing impression that the salmon have some special instinct  which leads them to return to spawn in the same spawning grounds where they  were originally hatched  we fail to find any evidence of this in the case  of the pacific coast salmon  and we do not believe it to be true  it seems  more probable that the young salmon  hatched in any river  mostly remain in  the ocean within a radius of twenty  thirty  or forty miles of its mouth   these  in their movements about in the ocean  may come into contact with  the cold waters of their parent rivers  or perhaps of any other river  at  a considerable distance from the shore  in the case of the quinnat and the  blue back  their  instinct  leads them to ascend these fresh waters  and  in a majority of cases these waters will be those in which the fishes in  question were originally spawned  later in the season the growth of the  reproductive organs leads them to approach the shore and to search for  fresh waters  and still the chances are that they may find the original  stream  but undoubtedly many fall salmon ascend  or try to ascend  streams  in which no salmon was ever hatched     it is said of the russian river and other california rivers  that their  mouths in the time of low water in summer generally become entirely closed  by sand bars  and that the salmon  in their eagerness to ascend them   frequently fling themselves entirely out of water on the beach  but this  does not prove that the salmon are guided by a marvelous geographical  instinct which leads them to their parent river  the waters of russian  river soak through these sand bars  and the salmon  instinct   we think   leads them merely to search for fresh waters     this matter is much in need of further investigation  at present  however   we find no reason to believe that the salmon enter the rogue river simply  because they were spawned there  or that a salmon hatched in the clackamas  river is any the more likely on that account to return to the clackamas  than to go up the cowlitz or the deschutes      at the hatchery on rogue river  the fish are stripped  marked and set  free  and every year since the hatchery has been in operation some of the  marked fish have been re caught  the young fry are also marked  but none of  them have been recaught      this year the run of silver salmon in frazer s river was very light  while  on puget sound the run was said by the indians to be greater than ever  known before  both these cases may be due to the same cause  the dry  summer  low water  and consequent failure of the salmon to find the rivers   the run in the sound is much more irregular than in the large rivers  one  year they will abound in one bay and its tributary stream and hardly be  seen in another  while the next year the condition will be reversed  at  cape flattery the run of silver salmon for the present year was very small   which fact was generally attributed by the indians to the birth of twins at  neah bay     in regard to the diminution of the number of salmon on the coast  in  puget s sound  frazer s river  and the smaller streams  there appears to be  little or no evidence of this  in the columbia river the evidence appears  somewhat conflicting  the catch during the present year        has been  considerably greater than ever before  nearly         cases of    lb  each  having been packed   although the fishing for three or four years has been  very extensive  on the other hand  the high water of the present spring has  undoubtedly caused many fish to become spring salmon which would otherwise  have run in the fall  moreover  it is urged that a few years ago  when the  number caught was about half as great as now  the amount of netting used  was perhaps one eighth as much  with a comparatively small outfit the  canners caught half the fish  now with nets much larger and more numerous   they catch them all  scarcely any escaping during the fishing season  april    to august     whether an actual reduction in the number of fish running  can be proven or not  there can be no question that the present rate of  destruction of the salmon will deplete the river before many years  a  considerable number of quinnat salmon run in august and september  and some  stragglers even later  these now are all which keep up the supply of  fish in the river  the non molestation of this fall run  therefore  does  something to atone for the almost total destruction of the spring run     this  however  is insufficient  a well ordered salmon hatchery is the only  means by which the destruction of the salmon in the river can be prevented   this hatchery should be under the control of oregon and washington  and  should be supported by a tax levied on the canned fish  it should be placed  on a stream where the quinnat salmon actually come to spawn     it has been questioned whether the present hatchery on the clackamas river  actually receives the quinnat salmon in any numbers  it is asserted  in  fact  that the eggs of the silver salmon and dog salmon  with scattering  quinnat  are hatched there  we have no exact information as to the truth of  these reports  but the matter should be taken into serious consideration     on the sacramento there is no doubt of the reduction of the number of  salmon  this is doubtless mainly attributable to over fishing  but in part  it may be due to the destruction of spawning beds by mining operations and  other causes     as to the superiority of the columbia river salmon  there is no doubt that  the quinnat salmon average larger and fatter in the columbia than in the  sacramento and in puget sound  the difference in the canned fish is   however  probably hardly appreciable  the canned salmon from the columbia   however  bring a better price in the market than those from elsewhere  the  canners there generally have had a high regard for the reputation of  the river  and have avoided canning fall fish or species other than the  quinnat  in the frazer s river the blue back is largely canned  and its  flesh being a little more watery and perhaps paler  is graded below the  quinnat  on puget sound various species are canned  in fact  everything  with red flesh  the best canners on the sacramento apparently take equal  care with their product with those of the columbia  but they depend largely  on the somewhat inferior fall run  there are  however  sometimes salmon  canned in san francisco  which have been in the city markets  and for some  reason remaining unsold  have been sent to the canners  such salmon are  unfit for food  and canning them should be prohibited     the fact that the hump back salmon runs only on alternate years in puget  sound                    etc   is well attested and at present unexplained   stray individuals only are taken in other years  this species has a  distinct  run   in the united states  only in puget sound  although  individuals  called  lost salmon   are occasionally taken in the columbia  and in the sacramento    american naturalist                                                        the relation between electricity and light      footnote  a lecture by dr  o  j  lodge  delivered at the london  institution on december                 ever since the subject on which i have the honor to speak to you to night  was arranged  i have been astonished at my own audacity in proposing to  deal in the course of sixty minutes with a subject so gigantic and so  profound that a course of sixty lectures would be quite inadequate for its  thorough and exhaustive treatment     i must indeed confine myself carefully to some few of the typical and most  salient points in the relation between electricity and light  and i must  economize time by plunging at once into the middle of the matter without  further preliminaries     now  when a person is setting off to discuss the relation between  electricity and light  it is very natural and very proper to pull him up  short with the two questions  what do you mean by electricity  and what do  you mean by light  these two questions i intend to try briefly to answer   and here let me observe that in answering these fundamental questions  i do  not necessarily assume a fundamental ignorance on your part of these two  agents  but rather the contrary  and must beg you to remember that if i  repeat well known and simple experiments before you  it is for the purpose  of directing attention to their real meaning and significance  not to their  obvious and superficial characteristics  in the same way that i might  repeat the exceedingly familiar experiment of dropping a stone to the earth  if we were going to define what we meant by gravitation     now  then  we will ask first  what is electricity  and the simple answer  must be  we don t know  well  but this need not necessarily be depressing   if the same question were asked about matter  or about energy  we should  have likewise to reply  no one knows     but then the term matter is a very general one  and so is the term energy   they are heads  in fact  under which we classify more special phenomena     thus  if we were asked  what is sulphur  or what is selenium  we should at  least be able to reply  a form of matter  and then proceed to describe its  properties   i  e    how it affected our bodies and other bodies     again  to the question  what is heat  we can reply  a form of energy  and  proceed to describe the peculiarities which distinguish it from other forms  of energy     but to the question  what is electricity  we have no answer pat like this   we can not assert that it is a form of matter  neither can we deny it  on  the other hand  we certainly can not assert that it is a form of energy   and i should be disposed to deny it  it may be that electricity is an  entity  per se   just as matter is an entity  per se      nevertheless  i can tell you what i mean by electricity by appealing to its  known behavior     here is a battery  that is  an electricity pump  it will drive electricity  along  prof  ayrtou is going  i am afraid  to tell you  on the   th of  january next  that it  produces  electricity  but if he does  i hope you  will remember that that is exactly what neither it nor anything else can  do  it is as impossible to generate electricity in the sense i am trying to  give the word  as it is to produce matter  of course i need hardly say that  prof  ayrton knows this perfectly well  it is merely a question of words    i  e    of what you understand by the word electricity     i want you  then  to regard this battery and all electrical machines and  batteries as kinds of electricity pumps  which drive the electricity along  through the wire very much as a water pump can drive water along pipes   while this is going on the wire manifests a whole series of properties   which are called the properties of the current      here were shown an ignited platinum wire  the electric arc between two  carbons  an electric machine spark  an induction coil spark  and a vacuum  tube glow  also a large nail was magnetized by being wrapped in the  current  and two helices were suspended and seen to direct and attract each  other      to make a magnet  then  we only need a current of electricity flowing round  and round in a whirl  a vortex or whirlpool of electricity is in fact a  magnet  and  vice versa   and these whirls have the power of directing and  attracting other previously existing whirls according to certain laws   called the laws of magnetism  and  moreover  they have the power of  exciting fresh whirls in neighboring conductors  and of repelling them  according to the laws of diamagnetism  the theory of the actions is known   though the nature of the whirls  as of the simple stream of electricity  is  at present unknown      here was shown a large electro magnet and an induction coil vacuum  discharge spinning round and round when placed in its field      so much for what happens when electricity is made to travel along  conductors   i  e    when it travels along like a stream of water in a  pipe  or spins round and round like a whirlpool     but there is another set of phenomena  usually regarded as distinct and of  another order  but which are not so distinct as they appear  which  manifest themselves when you join the pump to a piece of glass  or any  non conductor  and try to force the electricity through that  you succeed  in driving some through  but the flow is no longer like that of water in an  open pipe  it is as if the pipe were completely obstructed by a number of  elastic partitions or diaphragms  the water can not move without straining  and bending these diaphragms  and if you allow it  these strained  partitions will recover themselves  and drive the water back again   here  was explained the process of charging a leyden jar   the essential thing to  remember is that we may have electrical energy in two forms  the static  and the kinetic  and it is  therefore  also possible to have the rapid  alternation from one of these forms to the other  called vibration     now we will pass to the second question  what do you mean by light  and the  first and obvious answer is  everybody knows  and everybody that is not  blind does know to a certain extent  we have a special sense organ for  appreciating light  whereas we have none for electricity  nevertheless  we  must admit that we really know very little about the intimate nature of  light  very little more than about electricity  but we do know this   that light is a form of energy  and  moreover  that it is energy rapidly  alternating between the static and the kinetic forms  that it is  in fact   a special kind of energy of vibration  we are absolutely certain that light  is a periodic disturbance in some medium  periodic both in space and time   that is to say  the same appearances regularly recur at certain equal  intervals of distance at the same time  and also present themselves at  equal intervals of time at the same place  that in fact it belongs to the  class of motions called by mathematicians undulatory or wave motions  the  wave motion in this model  powell s wave apparatus  results from the simple  up and down motion popularly associated with the term wave  but when  a mathematician calls a thing a wave he means that the disturbance is  represented by a certain general type of formula  not that it is an  up and down motion  or that it looks at all like those things on the top of  the sea  the motion of the surface of the sea falls within that formula   and hence is a special variety of wave motion  and the term wave has  acquired in popular use this signification and nothing else  so that when  one speaks ordinarily of a wave or undulatory motion  one immediately  thinks of something heaving up and down  or even perhaps of something  breaking on the shore  but when we assert that the form of energy called  light is undulatory  we by no means intend to assert that anything whatever  is moving up and down  or that the motion  if we could see it  would be  anything at all like what we are accustomed to in the ocean  the kind of  motion is unknown  we are not even sure that there is anything like motion  in the ordinary sense of the word at all     now  how much connection between electricity and light have we perceived in  this glance into their natures  not much  truly  it amounts to about  this  that on the one hand electrical energy may exist in either of two  forms  the static form  when insulators are electrically strained by having  had electricity driven partially through them  as in the leyden jar   which  strain is a form of energy because of the tendency to discharge and do  work  and the kinetic form  where electricity is moving bodily along  through conductors or whirling round and round inside them  which motion  of electricity is a form of energy  because the conductors and whirls can  attract or repel each other and thereby do work     and  on the other hand  that light is the rapid alternation of energy  from one of these forms to the other  the static form where the medium is  strained  to the kinetic form when it moves  it is just conceivable  then   that the static form of the energy of light is  electro  static  that is   that the medium is  electrically  strained  and that the kinetic form of  the energy of light is  electro  kinetic  that is  that the motion is  not ordinary motion  but electrical motion  in fact  that light is an  electrical vibration  not a material one     on november    last year  there died at cambridge a man in the full  vigor of his faculties  such faculties as do not appear many times in a  century  whose chief work has been the establishment of this very fact  the  discovery of the link connecting light and electricity  and the proof  for  i believe it amounts to a proof  that they are different manifestations  of one and the same class of phenomena  that light is  in fact  an  electro magnetic disturbance  the premature death of james clerk maxwell is  a loss to science which appears at present utterly irreparable  for he was  engaged in researches that no other man can hope as yet adequately to grasp  and follow out  but fortunately it did not occur till he had published his  book on  electricity and magnetism   one of those immortal productions  which exalt one s idea of the mind of man  and which has been mentioned by  competent critics in the same breath as the  principia  itself     but it is not perfect like the  principia   much of it is rough hewn  and  requires to be thoroughly worked out  it contains numerous misprints and  errata  and part of the second volume is so difficult as to be almost  unintelligible  some  in fact  consists of notes written for private use  and not intended for publication  it seems next to impossible now to mature  a work silently for twenty or thirty years  as was done by newton two and a  half centuries ago  but a second edition was preparing  and much might have  been improved in form if life had been spared to the illustrious author     the main proof of the electro magnetic theory of light is this  the rate at  which light travels has been measured many times  and is pretty well known   the rate at which an electro magnetic wave disturbance would travel if such  could be generated  and mr  fitzgerald  of dublin  thinks he has proved  that it can not be generated directly by any known electrical means  can  be also determined by calculation from electrical measurements  the two  velocities agree exactly  this is the great physical constant known as the  ratio v  which so many physicists have been measuring  and are likely to be  measuring for some time to come     many and brilliant as were maxwell s discoveries  not only in electricity   but also in the theory of the nature of gases  and in molecular science  generally  i can not help thinking that if one of them is more striking and  more full of future significance than the rest  it is the one i have just  mentioned  the theory that light is an electrical phenomenon     the first glimpse of this splendid generalization was caught in       five  and thirty years ago  by that prince of pure experimentalists  michael  faraday  his reasons for suspecting some connection between electricity and  light are not clear to us  in fact  they could not have been clear to him   but he seems to have felt a conviction that if he only tried long enough  and sent all kinds of rays of light in all possible directions across  electric and magnetic fields in all sorts of media  he must ultimately  hit upon something  well  this is very nearly what he did  with a sublime  patience and perseverance which remind one of the way kepler hunted down  guess after guess in a different field of research  faraday combined  electricity  or magnetism  and light in all manner of ways  and at last he  was rewarded with a result  and a most out of the way result it seemed   first  you have to get a most powerful magnet and very strongly excite it   then you have to pierce its two poles with holes  in order that a beam of  light may travel from one to the other along the lines of force  then  as  ordinary light is no good  you must get a beam of plane polarized light   and send it between the poles  but still no result is obtained until   finally  you interpose a piece of a rare and out of the way material  which  faraday had himself discovered and made  a kind of glass which contains  borate of lead  and which is very heavy  or dense  and which must be  perfectly annealed     and now  when all these arrangements are completed  what is seen is simply  this  that if an analyzer is arranged to stop the light and make the field  quite dark before the magnet is excited  then directly the battery is  connected and the magnet called into action  a faint and barely perceptible  brightening of the field occurs  which will disappear if the analyzer be  slightly rotated   the experiment was then shown   now  no wonder that no  one understood this result  faraday himself did not understand it at all   he seems to have thought that the magnetic lines of force were rendered  luminous  or that the light was magnetized  in fact  he was in a fog   and had no idea of its real significance  nor had any one  continental  philosophers experienced some difficulty and several failures before they  were able to repeat the experiment  it was  in fact  discovered too soon   and before the scientific world was ready to receive it  and it was  reserved for sir william thomson briefly  but very clearly  to point  out  and for clerk maxwell more fully to develop  its most important  consequences   the principle of the experiment was then illustrated by the  aid of a mechanical model      this is the fundamental experiment on which clerk maxwell s theory of  light is based  but of late years many fresh facts and relations between  electricity and light have been discovered  and at the present time they  are tumbling in in great numbers     it was found by faraday that many other transparent media besides heavy  glass would show the phenomenon if placed between the poles  only in a less  degree  and the very important observation that air itself exhibits the  same phenomenon  though to an exceedingly small extent  has just been made  by kundt and rontgen in germany     dr  kerr  of glasgow  has extended the result to opaque bodies  and has  shown that if light be passed through magnetized  iron  its plane is  rotated  the film of iron must be exceedingly thin  because of its opacity   and hence  though the intrinsic rotating power of iron is undoubtedly very  great  the observed rotation is exceedingly small and difficult to observe   and it is only by a very remarkable patience and care and ingenuity that  dr  kerr has obtained his result  mr  fitzgerald  of dublin  has examined  the question mathematically  and has shown that maxwell s theory would have  enabled dr  kerr s result to be predicted     another requirement of the theory is that bodies which are transparent  to light must be insulators or non conductors of electricity  and that  conductors of electricity are necessarily opaque to light  simple  observation amply confirms this  metals are the best conductors  and are  the most opaque bodies known  insulators such as glass and crystals are  transparent whenever they are sufficiently homogeneous  and the very  remarkable researches of prof  graham bell in the last few months have  shown that even  ebonite   one of the most opaque insulators to ordinary  vision  is certainly transparent to some kinds of radiation  and  transparent to no small degree      the reason why transparent bodies must insulate  and why conductors must  be opaque  was here illustrated by mechanical models      a further consequence of the theory is that the velocity of light in a  transparent medium will be affected by its electrical strain constant  in  other words  that its refractive index will bear some close but not yet  quite ascertained relation to its specific inductive capacity  experiment  has partially confirmed this  but the confirmation is as yet very  incomplete  but there are a number of results not predicted by theory  and  whose connection with the theory is not clearly made out  we have the fact  that light falling on the platinum electrode of a voltameter generates a  current  first observed  i think  by sir w  r  grove  at any rate  it is  mentioned in his  correlation of forces   extended by becquerel and robert  sabine to other substances  and now being extended to fluorescent and other  bodies by prof  minchin  and finally  for i must be brief  we have  the remarkable action of light on selenium  this fact was discovered  accidentally by an assistant in the laboratory of mr  willoughby smith  who  noticed that a piece of selenium conducted electricity very much better  when light was falling upon it than when it was in the dark  the light of  a candle is sufficient  and instantaneously brings down the resistance to  something like one fifth of its original value     i could show you these effects  but there is not much to see  it is an  intensely interesting phenomenon  but its external manifestation is not  striking  any more than faraday s heavy glass experiment was     this is the phenomenon which  as you know  has been utilized by prof   graham bell in that most ingenious and striking invention  the photophone   by the kindness of prof  silvanus thompson  i have a few slides to show the  principle of the invention  and mr  shelford bidwell has been kind enough  to lend me his home made photophone  which answers exceedingly well for  short distances     i have now trespassed long enough upon your patience  but i must just  allude to what may very likely be the next striking popular discovery  and  that is the transmission of light by electricity  i mean the transmission  of such things as views and pictures by means of the electric wire  it has  not yet been done  but it seems already theoretically possible  and it may  very soon be practically accomplished                                                       interesting electrical researches       during the last six years dr  warren de la rue has been investigating   in conjunction with dr  hugo muller  the various and highly interesting  phenomena which accompany the electric discharge  from time to time the  results of their researches were communicated to the royal society  and  appeared in its proceedings  early last year dr  de la rue being requested  to bring the subject before the members of the royal institution  acceded  to the pressing invitation of his colleagues and scientific friends   the discourse  which was necessarily long postponed on account of the  preparations that had to be made  was finally given on friday  the   st of  january  and was one of the most remarkable  from the elaborate nature of  the experiments  ever delivered in the theater of that deservedly famous  institution     owing to the great inconvenience of removing the battery from his  laboratory  dr  de la rue  despite the great expenditure  directed mr  s   tisley to prepare  expressly for the lecture  a second series of         cells  and fit it up in the basement of the royal institution  the  construction of this new battery occupied mr  tisley a whole year  while  the charging of it extended over a fortnight     the  de la rue cell   if we may so call one of these elements  consists of  a zinc rod  the lower portion of which is embedded in a solid electrolyte   viz   chloride of silver  with which are connected two flattened silver  wires to serve as electrodes  when these are united and the silver chloride  moistened  chemical action begins  and a weak but constant current is  generated     the electromotive force of such a cell is      volts  and a current  equivalent to one volt passing through a resistance of one ohm was found to  decompose         grain of water in one second  the battery is divided  into  cabinets   which hold from       to       small elements each  this  facilitates removal  and also the detection of any fault that may occur     it will be remembered that in      sir humphry davy constructed his battery  of       cells  and thus succeeded in exalting the tiny spark obtained in  closing the circuit into the luminous sheaf of the voltaic arc  he also  observed that the spark passed even when the poles were separated by a  distance varying from      to      of an inch  this appears to have been  subsequently forgotten  as we find later physicists questioning the  possibility of the spark leaping over any interpolar distance  mr  j   p  gassiot  of clapham  demonstrated the inaccuracy of this opinion by  constructing a battery of       leclanche cells  which gave a spark of        inch  a similar number of  de la rue  cells gives an        inch  spark  this considerable increase in potential is chiefly due to better  insulation     the great energy of this battery was illustrated by a variety of  experiments  thus  a large condenser  specially constructed by messrs   varley  and having a capacity equal to that of       large leyden jars   was almost immediately charged by the current from        cells  wires of  various kinds  and from   inches to    inches in length  were instantly  volatilized by the passage of the electricity thus stored up  the current  induced in the secondary wire of a coil by the discharge of the condenser  through the primary  was also sufficiently intense to deflagrate wires of  considerable length and thickness     it was with such power at his command that dr  de la rue proceeded to  investigate several important electrical laws  he has found  for example   that the positive discharge is more intermittent than the negative   that the arc is always preceded by a streamer like discharge  that its  temperature is about        deg   and its length at the ordinary pressure  of the atmosphere  when taken between two points  varies as the square  of the number of cells  thus  with a battery of       cells  the arc was         inch  with        cells it increased to      inch  the same law was  found to hold when the discharge took place between a point and a disk  it  failed entirely  however  when the terminals were two disks     it was also shown that the voltaic arc is not a phenomenon of conduction   but is essentially a disruptive discharge  the intervals between the  passage of two successive static sparks being the time required for the  battery to collect sufficient power to leap over the interposed resistance   this was further confirmed by the introduction of a condenser  when the  intervals were perceptibly larger     faraday proved that the quantity of electricity necessary to produce a  strong flash of lightning would result from the decomposition of a single  grain of water  and dr  de la rue s experiments confirm this extraordinary  statement  he has calculated that this quantity of electricity would be        times as great as the charge of his large condenser  and that a  lightning flash a mile long would require the potential of           cells   that is to say  of     of his powerful batteries     in experimenting with  vacuum  tubes  he has found that the discharge is  also invariably disruptive  this is an important point  as many physicists  speak and write of the phenomenon as one of conduction  air  in every  degree of tenuity  refuses to act as a conductor of electricity  these  experiments show that the resistance of gaseous media diminishes with the  pressure only up to a certain point  beyond which it rapidly increases   thus  in the case of hydrogen  it diminishes up to       mm        millionths  it then rises as the exhaustion proceeds  and at         mm        millionths  it requires as high a potential as at      mm           millionths  at         mm       millionth  the current from        cells  would not pass through a tube for which     cells sufficed at the pressure  of minimum resistance  at a pressure of        mm         millionth  the  highest exhaust obtained in any of the experiments  even a one inch spark  from an induction coil refused to pass  it was also ascertained that there  is neither condensacian nor dilatation of the gas in contact with the  terminals prior to the passage of the discharge     these researches naturally led to some speculation about the conditions  under which auroral phenomena may occur  observers have variously stated  the height at which the aurora borealis attains its greatest brilliancy  as ranging between     and     miles  dr  de la rue s conclusions fix  the upper limit at     miles  and that of maximum display at    miles   admitting also that the aurora may sometimes occur at an altitude of a few  thousand feet     the aurora was beautifully illustrated by a very large tube  in which the  theoretical pressure was carefully maintained  the characteristic roseate  tinge being readily produced and maintained     in studying the

torsion balance has been adapted by m  baille to the measurement  of low electromotive forces in a very successful manner  and has been found  preferable by him to the delicate electrometers of sir w  thomson  it  is necessary to guard it from disturbances due to extraneous electric  influences and the trembling of the ground  these can be eliminated  completely by encircling the instrument in a metal case connected to  earth  and mounting it on solid pillars in a still place  heat also has a  disturbing effect  and makes itself felt in the torsion of the fiber and  the cage surrounding the lever  these effects are warded off by inclosing  the instrument in a non conducting jacket of wood shavings     the apparatus of m  baille consists of an annealed silver torsion wire of       meters long  and a lever      meter long  carrying at each extremity  a ball of copper  gilded  and three centimeters in diameter  similar balls  are fixed at the corners of a square      meters in the side  and connected  in diagonal pairs by fine wire  the lever placed at equal distances from  the fixed balls communicates  by the medium of the torsion wire  with the  positive pole of a battery  p  the other pole being to earth     owing to some unaccountable variations in the change of the lever or  needle  m  baille was obliged to measure the change at each observation   this was done by joining the   pole of the battery to the needle  and one  pair of the fixed balls  and observing the deflection  then the deflection  produced by the other balls was observed  this operation was repeated  several times     the battery  x  to be measured consisted of ten similar elements  and one  pole of it was connected to the fixed balls  while the other pole was  connected to the earth  the needle  of course  remained in contact with the    pole of the charging battery  p     the deflections were read from a clear glass scale  placed at a distance  of      meters from the needle  and the results

arrangements  based upon the principle of magnetic  induction  a relatively considerable expenditure of force is required in  order to set the tightly stretched membrane in vibration  in the so called  carbon telephones only a very feeble impulse is required to produce the  differences in the current necessary for the transmission of sounds  in  order to produce relatively strong currents  even in case of sound action  of a minimum strength  franz kroettlinger  of vienna  has made an  interesting experiment to use thermo electric currents for the transmission  of sound to a distance  the apparatus which he has constructed is  exceedingly simple  a current of hot air flowing from below upward is  deflected more or less from its direction by the human voice  by its action  an adjacent thermo battery is excited  whose current passes through the  spiral of an ordinary telephone  which serves as the receiving instrument   as a source of heat the inventor uses a common stearine candle  the flame  of which is kept at one and the same level by means of a spring similar to  those used in carriage lamps  on one side of the candle is a sheet metal  voice funnel fixed upon a support  its mouth being covered with a movable  sliding disk  fitted with a suitable number of small apertures  on the  other side a similar support holds a funnel shaped thermo battery  the  single bars of metal forming this battery are very thin  and of such a  shape that they may cool as quickly as possible  both the speaking funnel  and the battery can be made to approach  at will  to the stream of warm air  rising up from the flame  the entire apparatus is inclosed in a tin case  in such a manner that only the aperture of the voice funnel and the polar  clamps for securing the conducting wires appear on the outside  the inside  of the case is suitably stayed to prevent vibration  on speaking into the  mouth piece of the funnel  the sound waves occasion undulations in the  column of hot air which are communicated to the thermo battery  and in this  manner corresponding differences are produced in the currents in the wires  leading to the receiving instrument    oesterreichische

telegraphic wire pictures taken on the plate of a camera  was invented in  the early part of      by m  senlecq  of ardres  a description of the first  specification submitted by m  senlecq to m  du moncel  member of the  paris academy of sciences  appeared in all the continental and american  scientific journals  since then the apparatus has everywhere occupied the  attention of prominent electricians  who have striven to improve on it   among these we may mention mm  ayrton  perry  sawyer  of new york    sargent  of philadelphia   brown  of london   carey  of boston   tighe  of  pittsburg   and graham bell himself  some experimenters have used many  wires  bound together cable wise  others one wire only  the result has  been  on the one hand  confusion of conductors beyond a certain distance   with the absolute impossibility of obtaining perfect insulation  and   on the other hand  an utter want of synchronism  the unequal and slow  sensitiveness of the selenium likewise obstructed the proper working of the  apparatus  now  without a relative simplicity in the arrangement of the  conducting wires intended to convey to a distance the electric current with  its variations of intensity  without a perfect and rapid synchronism  acting concurrently with the luminous impressions  so as to insure the  simultaneous action of transmitter and receiver  without  in fine  an  increased sensitiveness in the selenium  the idea of the telectroscope  could not be realized  m  senlecq has fortunately surmounted most of these  main obstacles  and we give to day a description of the latest apparatus he  has contrived       transmitter     a brass plate  a  whereon the rays of light impinge inside a camera  in  their various forms and colors  from the external objects placed before the  lens  the said plate being coated with selenium on the side intended to  face the dark portion of the camera this brass plate has its entire surface  perforated with small holes as near to one another as practicable  these  holes are filled with selenium  heated  and then cooled very slowly  so as  to obtain the maximum sensitiveness  a small brass wire passes through the  selenium in each hole  without  however  touching the plate  on to the  rectangular and vertical ebonite plate  b  fig     from under this plate  at point  c  thus  every wire passing through plate  a  has its point  of contact above the plate  b  lengthwise  with this view the wires are  clustered together when leaving the camera  and thence stretch to their  corresponding points of contact on plate  b  along line  c c  the surface  of brass  a  is in permanent contact with the positive pole of the battery   selenium   on each side of plate  b  are let in two brass rails  d and e   whereon the slide hereinafter described works      illustration  fig        rail  e  communicates with the line wire intended to conduct the various  light and shade vibrations  rail  d  is connected with the battery wire   along f are a number of points of contact corresponding with those along  c c  these contacts help to work the apparatus  and to insure the perfect  isochronism of the transmitter and receiver  these points of contact   though insulated one from the other on the surface of the plate  are all  connected underneath with a wire coming from the positive pole of a special  battery  this apparatus requires two batteries  as  in fact  do all  autographic telegraphs  one for sending the current through the selenium   and one for working the receiver  etc  the different features of this  important plate may  therefore  be summed up thus     figure       d  brass rail  grooved and connected with the line wire working the  receiver     f  contacts connected

in the dial telegraphs  by a rod  working in and out under the successive movements of the electro magnet   h  and of the counter spring  by means of this rod  which must be of a  non metallic material  so as not to divert the motive current   and of an  elbow lever  this alternating movement is transmitted to a catch  g  which  works up and down between the cogs  and answers the same purpose as the  ordinary clock anchor      illustration  fig        this cogged wheel is worked by clockwork inclosed between two disks  and  would rotate continuously were it not for the catch  g  working in and out  of the cogs  through this catch  g  the wheel is dependent on the movement  of electro magnet  this cogged wheel is a double one  consisting of two  wheels coupled together  exactly similar one with the other  and so fixed  that the cogs of the one correspond with the void between the cogs of the  others  as the catch  g  moves down it frees a cog in first wheel  and both  wheels begin to turn  but the second wheel is immediately checked by catch   g  and the movement ceases  a catch again works the two wheels  turn half a  cog  and so on  each wheel contains as many cogs as there are contacts on  transmitter disk  consequently as many as on circular disk  a  fig     and  on brass disk within camera      illustration  fig         illustration  fig        having now described the several parts of the apparatus  let us see how it  works  all the contacts correspond one with the other  both on the side of  selenium current and that of the motive current  let us suppose that the  slide of transmitter is on contact no     for instance  the selenium  current starting from no     reaches contact    of rectangular transmitter   half the slide bearing on this point  as also on the parallel rail   communicates the current to said rail  thence to line  from the line to  axis of cogged wheel  from axis to contact    of circular fixed disk   and thence to contact    of receiver  at each selenium contact of the  rectangular disk there is a corresponding contact to the battery and  electro magnet  now  on reaching contact    the intermission of the current  has turned the wheel    cogs  and so brought the small contact  o  fig      on no     of the fixed circular disk     as may be seen  the synchronism of the apparatus could not be obtained in  a more simple and complete mode  the rectangular transmitter being placed  vertically  and the slide being of a certain weight to its fall from the  first point of contact sufficient to carry it rapidly over the whole length  of this transmitter     the picture is  therefore  reproduced almost instantaneously  indeed  by  using platinum wires on the receiver connected with the negative pole  by  the incandescence of these wires according to the different degrees of  electricity we can obtain a picture  of a fugitive kind  it is true  but  yet so vivid that the impression on the retina does not fade during the  relatively very brief space of time the slide occupies in traveling over  all the contacts  a ruhmkorff coil may also be employed for obtaining  sparks in proportion to the current emitted  the apparatus is regulated  in precisely the same way as dial telegraphs  starting always from first  contact  the slide should  therefore  never be removed from the rectangular  disk  whereon it is held by the grooves in the brass rails  into which it  fits with but slight friction  without communicating any current to the  line wires when not placed on points of contact

institution of mechanical  engineers      by arthur achard  of geneva       but allowing that the figure of    h  p   assumed for this power  the  result in calculating the work with compressed air being    h  p   may be  somewhat incorrect  it is unlikely that this error can be so large that its  correction could reduce the efficiency below    per cent  messrs  sautter  and lemonnier  who construct a number of compressors  on being consulted  by the author  have written to say that they always confined themselves in  estimating the power stored in the compressed air  and had never measured  the gross power expended  compressed air in passing along the pipe  assumed  to be horizontal  which conveys it from the place of production to the  place where it is to be used  experiences by friction a diminution of  pressure  which represents a reduction in the mechanical power stored up   and consequently a loss of efficiency     the loss of pressure in question can only be calculated conveniently on the  hypothesis that it is very small  and the general formula       p    p      l                   f u       delta     d     tex   frac p     p   delta     frac  l  d f u

velocity at which the compressed air  travels   delta  its specific weight  and f u  the friction per unit of  length  in proportion as the air loses pressure its speed increases  while  its specific weight diminishes  but the variations in pressure are assumed  to be so small that u and  delta  may be considered constant  as regards  the quantity f u   or the friction per unit of length  the natural law  which regulates it is not known  audit can only be expressed by some  empirical formula  which  while according sufficiently nearly with the  facts  is suited for calculation  for this purpose the binomial formula  au    bu squared  or the simple formula  b  u squared  is generally adopted  a b and b  being  coefficients deduced from experiment  the values  however  which are to  be given to these coefficients are not constant  for they vary with the  diameter of the pipe  and in particular  contrary to formerly received  ideas  they vary according to its internal surface  the uncertainty in this  respect is so great that it is not worth while  with a view to accuracy  to  relinquish the great convenience which the simple formula  b  u squared  offers   it would be better from this point of view to endeavor  as has been  suggested  to render this formula more exact by the substitution of a  fractional power in the place of the square  rather than to go through  the long calculations necessitated by the use of the binomial au   bu squared   accordingly  making use of the formula b  u squared  the above equation becomes       p    p      l                   b  u

velocity by the relation  q      pi  d squared u     we have      p    p         b                         l q squared      delta     pi  squared d       tex   frac p     p   delta     frac    b     pi   d    l q       generally the pressure  p   at the entrance is known  and the pressure  p   has to be found  it is then from p  that the values of q and  delta  are  calculated  in experiments where p  and p are measured directly  in order  to arrive at the value of the coefficient b   q and  delta  would be  calculated for the mean pressure     p    p   the values given to the  coefficient b  vary considerably  because  as stated above  it varies with  the diameter  and also with the nature of the material of the pipe  it  is generally admitted that it is independent of the pressure  and it is  probable that within certain limits of pressure this hypothesis is in  accordance with the truth     d aubuisson gives for this case  in his  traite d hydraulique   a rather  complicated formula  containing a constant deduced from experiment  whose  value  according to a calculation made by the author  is approximately b             this constant was determined by taking the mean of experiments made  with tin tubes of        meter        in         meter    in    and       meter    in   diameter  and it was erroneously assumed that it was correct  for all diameters and all substances     m  arson  engineer to the paris gas company  published in       in the   memoires de la societe des ingenieurs civils de france   the results of  some experiments on the loss of pressure in gas when passing through pipes   he employed cast iron pipes of the ordinary type  he has represented the  results of his experiments by the binomial formula  au   bu squared  and gives  values for the coefficients a and b  which diminish with an increase in  diameter  but would indicate greater losses of pressure than d aubuisson s  formula  m  deviller  in his  rapport sur les travaux de percement du  tunnel sous les alpes   states that the losses of pressure observed in the  air pipe at the mont cenis tunnel confirm the correctness of d aubuisson s  formula  but his reasoning applies to too complicated a formula to be  absolutely convincing     quite recently m  e  stockalper  engineer in chief at the northern end of  the st  gothard tunnel  has made some experiments on the air conduit of  this tunnel  the results of which he has kindly furnished to the author   these lead to values for the coefficient b  appreciably less than that  which is contained implicitly in d aubuisson s formula  as he experimented  on a rising pipe  it is necessary to introduce into the formula the  difference of level  h  between the two ends  it then becomes      p    p

results which d aubuisson s formula would give is due  to the fact that his formula was determined with very small pipes  it is  probable that the coefficients corresponding to diameters of      meter     in   and      meter    in   for a substance as smooth as tin  would be  still smaller respectively than the figures obtained above     the divergence from the results obtained by m  arson s formula does not  arise from a difference in size  as this is taken into account  the author  considers that it may be attributed to the fact that the pipes for the st   gothard tunnel were cast with much greater care than ordinary pipes  which  rendered their surface smoother  and also to the fact that flanged joints  produce much less irregularity in the internal surface than the ordinary  spigot and faucet joints     lastly  the difference in the methods of observation and the errors which  belong to them  must be taken into account  m  stockalper  who experimented  on great pressures  used metallic gauges  which are instruments on whose  sensibility and correctness complete reliance cannot be placed  and  moreover the standard manometer with which they were compared was one of  the same kind  the author is not of opinion that the divergence is owing to  the fact that m  stockalper made his observations on an air conduit  where  the pressure was much higher than in gas pipes  indeed  it may be assumed  that gases and liquids act in the same manner  and  as will be      explained later on  there is reason to believe that with the latter a rise  of pressure increases the losses of pressure instead of diminishing them      transcribers note    corrected from  as will we explained      all the pipes for supplying compressed air in tunnels and in headings of  mines are left uncovered  and have flanged joints  which are advantages not  merely as regards prevention of leakage  but also for facility of laying  and of inspection  if a compressed air pipe had to be buried in the ground  the flanged joint would lose a part of its advantages  but  nevertheless   the author considers that it would still be preferable to the ordinary  joint     it only remains to refer to the motors fed with the compressed air   this subject is still in its infancy from a practical point of view  in  proportion as the air becomes hot by compression  so it cools by expansion   if the vessel containing it is impermeable to heat  under these conditions  it gives out in expanding a power appreciably less than if it retained its  original temperature  besides which the fall of temperature may impede the  working of the machine by freezing the vapor of water contained in the air     if it is desired to utilize to the utmost the force stored up in the  compressed air it is necessary to endeavor to supply heat to the air during  expansion so as to keep its temperature constant  it would be possible  to attain this object by the same means which prevent heating from  compression  namely  by the circulation and injection of water  it would  perhaps be necessary to employ a little larger quantity of water for  injection  as the water  instead of acting by virtue both of its heat of  vaporization and of its specific heat  can in this case act only by virtue  of the latter  these methods might be employed without difficulty for air  machines of some size  it would be more difficult to apply them to small  household machines  in which simplicity is an essential element  and we  must rest satisfied with imperfect methods  such as proximity to a stove   or the immersion of the cylinder in a tank of water  consequently loss of  power by cooling and by incomplete expansion cannot be avoided  the only  way to diminish the relative amount of this loss is to employ compressed  air at a pressure not exceeding three or four atmospheres     the only real practical advance made in this matter is m  mekarski s  compressed air engine for tramways  in this engine the air is made to pass  through a small boiler containing water at a temperature of about     deg   cent       deg  fahr    before entering the cylinder of the engine  it must  be observed that in order to reduce the size of the reservoirs  which  are carried on the locomotive  the air inside them must be very highly  compressed  and that in going from the reservoir into the cylinder it  passes through a reducing valve or expander  which keeps the pressure of  admission at a definite figure  so that the locomotive can continue working  so long as the supply of air contained in the reservoir has not come down  to this limiting pressure  the air does not pass the expander until after  it has gone through the boiler already mentioned  therefore  if the  temperature which it assumes in the boiler is     deg  cent       deg  fahr    and  if the limiting pressure is   atm   the gas which enters the engine will be  a mixture of air and water vapor at     deg  cent   and of its total pressure  the vapor of water will contribute i atm  and the air   atm  thus this  contrivance  by a small expenditure of fuel  enables the air to act  expansively without injurious cooling  and even reduces the consumption of  compressed air to an extent which compensates for part of the loss of power  arising from the preliminary expansion which the air experiences before its  admission into the engine  it is clear that this same contrivance  or what  amounts to the same thing  a direct injection of steam  at a sufficient  pressure  for the purpose of maintaining the expanding air at a constant  temperature  might be tried in a fixed engine worked by compressed air with  some chance of success     whatever method is adopted it would be advantageous that the losses of  pressure in the pipes connecting the compressors with the motors should be  reduced as much as possible  for in this case that loss would represent  a loss of efficiency  if  on the other hand  owing to defective means of  reheating  it is necessary to remain satisfied with a small amount of  expansion  the loss of pressure in the pipe is unimportant  and has only  the effect of transferring the limited expansion to a point a little lower  on the scale of pressures  if w is the net disposable force on the shaft  of the engine which works the compressor  v  the volume of air at the  compressor  p   given by the compressor  and at the temperature of the  surrounding air  and p  the atmospheric pressure  the efficiency of the  compressor  assuming the air to expand according to boyle s law  is given  by the well known formula        p  v  log  p    p                                      w     tex   frac p   v    log  frac p    p     w      let p  be the value to which the pressure is reduced by the loss of  pressure at the end of the conduit  and v  the volume which the air  occupies at this pressure and at the same temperature  the force stored  up in the air at the end of its course through the conduit is p  v   log p  p    consequently  the efficiency of the conduit is      p  v  log p  p                          p  v  log p  p       tex   frac p   v    log frac p    p     p   v    log frac p    p         a fraction that may be reduced to the simple form      log p  p                     log p  p       tex   frac  log frac p    p      log frac p    p         if there is no leakage during the passage of the air  because in that cause  p  v    p  v   lastly  if w  is the net disposable force on the shaft of  the compressed air motor  the efficiency of this engine will be             w                         p  v  log p  p       tex   frac w    p   v    log  frac p    p         and the product of these three partial efficiencies is equal to w  w  the  general efficiency of the transmission     iii   transmission by pressure water    as transmission of power by  compressed air has been specially applied to the driving of tunnels  so  transmission by pressure water has been specially resorted to for lifting  heavy loads  or for work of a similar nature  such as the operations  connected with the manufacture of bessemer steel or of cast iron pipes   the author does not propose to treat of transmissions established for this  special purpose  and depending on the use of accumulators at high pressure   as he has no fresh matter to impart on this subject  and as he believes  that the remarkable invention of sir william armstrong was described for  the first time  in the  proceedings of the institution of mechanical  engineers   his object is to refer to transmissions applicable to general  purposes     the transmission of power by water may occur in another form  the motive  force to be transmitted may be employed for working pumps which raise the  water  not to a fictitious height in an accumulator  but to a real height  in a reservoir  with a channel from this reservoir to distribute the water  so raised among several motors arranged for utilizing the pressure  the  author is not aware that works have been carried out for this purpose   however  in many towns a part of the water from the public mains serves to  supply small motors  consequently  if the water  instead of being brought  by a natural fall  has been previously lifted artificially  it might be  said that a transmission of power is here grafted on to the ordinary  distribution of water     unless a positive or negative force of gravity is introduced into the  problem  independently of the force to be transmitted  the receivers of  the water pressure must be assumed to be at the same level as the forcing  pumps  or more correctly  the water discharged from the receivers to be at  the same level as the surface of the water from which the pumps draw their  supply  in this case the general efficiency of transmission is the product  of three partial efficiencies  which correspond exactly to those mentioned  with regard to compressed air  the height of lift  contained in the  numerator of the fraction which expresses the efficiency of the pumps  is  not to be taken as the difference in level between the surface of the water  in the reservoir and the surface of the water whence the pumps draw their  supply  but as this difference in level  plus the loss of pressure in the  suction pipe  which is usually very short  and plus the loss in the channel  to the reservoir  which may be very long  a similar loss of initial  pressure affects the efficiency of the discharge channel  the reservoir  if  of sufficient capacity  may become an important store of power  while the  compressed air reservoir can only do so to a very limited extent     omitting the subject of the pumps  and passing on at once to the discharge  main  the author may first point out that the distinction between the  ascending and descending mains of the system is of no importance  for two  reasons  first  that nothing prevents the motors being supplied direct from  the first alone  and second  that the one is not always distinct from the  other  in fact  the reservoir may be connected by a single branch pipe with  the system which goes from the pumps to the motors  it may even be placed  at the extreme end of this system beyond the motors  provided always that  the supply pipe is taken into it at the bottom  the same formula may be  adopted for the loss of initial pressure in water pipes as for compressed  air pipes  viz        p    p         b                         l q squared    h      delta     pi  squared d       tex   frac p     p   delta

branching  from it  at the beginning and end of the transit  the values assigned to  the coefficient b  in france  are those determined by d arcy  for new  cast iron pipes he gives b                  d              and recommends  that this value should be doubled  to allow for the rust and incrustation  which more or less form inside the pipes during use  the determination of  this coefficient has been made from experiments where the pressure has  not exceeded four atmospheres  within these limits the value of the  coefficient  as is generally admitted  is independent of the pressure  the  experiments made by m  barret  on the pressure pipes of the accumulator at  the marseilles docks  seem to indicate that the loss of pressure would be  greater for high pressures  everything else being equal  this pipe  having  a diameter of       m     in    was subjected to an initial pressure of     atmospheres  the author gives below the results obtained for a straight  length     m        ft

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   moreover  these results would appear to indicate a different law from that  which is expressed by the formula b  u squared  as is easy to see by representing  them graphically  it would be very desirable that fresh experiments should  be made on water pipes at high pressure  and of various diameters  of  machines worked by water pressure the author proposes to refer only to two  which appear to him in every respect the most practical and advantageous   one is the piston machine of m  albert schmid  engineer at zurich  the  cylinder is oscillating  and the distribution is effected  without an  eccentric  by the relative motion of two spherical surfaces fitted one  against the other  and having the axis of oscillation for a common axis   the convex surface  which is movable and forms part of the cylinder  serves  as a port face  and has two ports in it communicating with the two ends of  the cylinder  the concave surface  which is fixed and plays the part of a  slide valve  contains three openings  the two outer ones serving to admit  the pressure water  and the middle one to discharge the water after it has  exerted its pressure  the piston has no packing  its surface of contact has  two circumferential grooves  which produce a sort of water packing acting  by adhesion  a small air chamber is connected with the inlet pipe  and  serves to deaden the shocks  this engine is often made with two cylinders   having their cranks at right angles     the other engine  which is much less used  is a turbine on girard s system   with a horizontal axis and partial admission  exactly resembling in  miniature those which work in the hydraulic factory of st  maur  near  paris  the water is introduced by means of a distributer  which is fitted  in the interior of the turbine chamber  and occupies a certain portion  of its circumference  this turbine has a lower efficiency than schmid s  machine  and is less suitable for high pressures  but it possesses this  advantage over it  that by regulating the amount of opening of the  distributer  and consequently the quantity of water admitted  the force can  be altered without altering the velocity of rotation  as it admits of great  speeds  it could be usefully employed direct  without the interposition of  spur wheels or belts for driving magneto electric machines employed for the  production of light  for electrotyping  etc     in compressed air machines the losses of pressure due to incomplete  expansion  cooling  and waste spaces  play an important part  in water  pressure machines loss does not occur from these causes  on account of the  incompressibility of the liquid  but the frictions of the parts are the  principal causes of loss of power  it would be advisable to ascertain  whether  as regards this point  high or low pressures are the most  advantageous  theoretical considerations would lead the author to imagine  that for a piston machine low pressures are preferable  in conclusion  the  following table gives the efficiencies of a girard turbine  constructed by  messrs  escher wyss   co   of zurich  and of a schmid machine  as measured  by professor fliegnor  in

                                                                                                                                                                                                    it will be observed that these experiments relate to low pressures  it  would be desirable to extend them to higher pressures     iv   transmission by electricity    however high the efficiency of an  electric motor may be  in relation to the chemical work of the electric  battery which feeds it  force generated by an electric battery is too  expensive  on account of the nature of the materials consumed  for a  machine of this kind ever to be employed for industrial purposes  if   however  the electric current  instead of being developed by chemical  work in a battery  is produced by ordinary mechanical power in a  magneto electric or dynamo electric machine  the case is different  and  the double transformation  first of the mechanical force into an electric  current  and then of that current into mechanical force  furnishes a means  for effecting the conveyance of the power to a distance     it is this last method of transmission which remains to be discussed  the  author  however  feels himself obliged to restrict himself in this matter  to a mere summary  and  indeed  it is english physicists and engineers who  have taken the technology of electricity out of the region of empiricism  and have placed it on a scientific and rational basis  moreover  they are  also taking the lead in the progress which is being accomplished in this  branch of knowledge  and are best qualified to determine its true bearings   when an electric current  with an intensity  i  is produced  either by  chemical or mechanical work  in a circuit having a total resistance  r  a  quantity of heat is developed in the circuit  and this heat is the exact  equivalent of the force expended  so long as the current is not made use of  for doing any external work  the expression for this quantity of heat  per  unit of time  is ai squaredr  a being the thermal equivalent of the unit of power  corresponding to the units of current and resistance  in which i and r are  respectively expressed  the product  i squaredr  is a certain quantity of power   which the author proposes to call  power transformed into electricity    when mechanical power is employed for producing a current by means of  a magneto electric or dynamo electric machine  or  to use a better  expression  by means of a  mechanical generator of electricity   it is  necessary in reality to expend a greater quantity of power than i squaredr in  order to make up for losses which result either from ordinary friction  or from certain electro magnetic reactions which occur  the ratio of the  quantity  i squaredr  to the power  w  actually expended per unit of time is  called the efficiency of the generator  designating it by k  we obtain  w    i squaredr k  it is very important to ascertain the value of this efficiency   considering that it necessarily enters as a factor into the evaluation of  all the effects to be produced by help of the generator in question  the  following table gives the results of certain experiments made early in        with a gramme machine  by an able physicist  m hagenbach  professor  at the university at basle  and kindly furnished by him to the author

hagenbach s dynamometric measurements were made by the aid of a brake   after each experiment on the electric machine  he applied the brake to the  engine which he employed  taking care to make it run at precisely the same  speed  with the same pressure of steam  and with the same expansion as  during experiment  it would certainly be better to measure the force  expended during and not after the experiment  by means of a registering  dynamometer  moreover  m  hagenbach writes that his measurements by means  of the brake were very much prejudiced by external circumstances  doubtless  this is the reason of the divergences between the results obtained     about the same time dr  hopkinson communicated to this institution the  results of some very careful experiments made on a siemens machine  he  measured the force expended by means of a registering dynamometer  and  obtained very high coefficients of efficiency  amounting to nearly    per  cent  m  hagenbach also obtained from one machine a result only a little  less than unity  mechanical generators of electricity are certainly  capable of being improved in several respects  especially as regards their  adaptation to certain definite classes of work  but there appears to  remain hardly any margin for further progress as regards efficiency  force  transformed into electricity in a generator may be expressed by i  omega  m  c   omega  being the angular velocity of rotation  m the magnetism of one  of the poles  inducing or induced  which intervenes  and c a constant  specially belonging to each apparatus  and which is independent of  the units adopted  this constant could not be determined except by  an integration practically impossible  and the product  m c  must be  considered indivisible  even in a magneto electric machine  with permanent  inducing magnets   and much more in a dynamo electric machine  inducing by  means of electro magnets excited by the very current produced  the product   m c  is a function of the intensity  from the identity of the expressions   i squaredr and i  omega  m c we obtain the relation m c   ir  omega  which  indicates the course to be pursued to determine experimentally the law  which connects the variations of m c with those of i  some experiments made  in       by m  hagenbach  on a gramme dynamo electric machine  appear to  indicate that the magnetism  m c  does not increase indefinitely with the  intensity  but that there is some maximum value for this quantity  if   instead of working a generator by an external motive force  a current is  passed through its circuit in a certain given direction  the movable part  of the machine will begin to turn in an opposite direction to that in which  it would have been necessary to turn it in order to obtain a current in the  aforesaid direction  in virtue of this motion the electro magnetic forces  which are generated may be used to overcome a resisting force  the machine  will then work as a motor or receiver  let i be the intensity of the  external current which works the motor  when the motor is kept at rest  if  it is now allowed to move  its motion produces  in virtue of the laws of  induction  a current in the circuit of intensity  i   in the opposite  direction to the external current  the effective intensity of the current  traversing the circuit is thus reduced to i   i   the intensity of the  counter current is given  like that of the generating current  by the  equation  i  squaredr   i   omega   m  c   or i r    omega   m  c   the index      denoting the quantities relating to the motor  here m  c  is a function of  i   i   not of i  as in a generator the force transformed into electricity  has a value  i  omega  m c  so in a motor the force developed by  electricity is  i   i    omega   m  c   on account  however  of the losses  which occur  the effective power  that is the disposable power on the shaft  of the motor  will have a smaller value  and in order to arrive at it a  coefficient of efficiency  k   must be added  we shall then have w    k    i i    omega   m  c   the author has no knowledge of any experiments  having been made for obtaining this efficiency  k   next let us suppose  that the current feeding the motor is furnished by a generator  so that  actual transmission by electricity is taking place  the circuit  whose  resistance is r  comprises the coils  both fixed and movable  of the  generator and motor  and of the conductors which connect them  the  intensity of the current which traverses the circuit had the value  i  when  the motor was at rest  by the working of the motor it is reduced to i   i    the power applied to the generator is itself reduced to w   i i   omega   m c  k  the prime mover is relieved by the action of the counter current   precisely as the consumption of zinc in the battery would be reduced by the  same cause  if the battery was the source of the current  the efficiency  of the transmission is w  w  calculation shows that it is expressed by the  following equations w  w   k k     omega    m  c     omega   m c    or   k  k     omega    m  c    omega    m  c     i i   r    expressions in which  it must be remembered m c and m  c  are really functions of  i i    this  efficiency is  then  the product of three distinct factors  each evidently  less than unity  namely  the efficiency belonging to the generator  the  efficiency belonging to the motor  and a third factor depending on the rate  of rotation of the motor and the resistance of the circuit  the influence  which these elements exert on the value of the third factor cannot be  estimated  unless the law is first known according to which the magnetisms   m c  m  c c   vary with the intensity of the current       general results     casting a retrospective glance at the four methods of transmission of power  which have been examined  it would appear that transmission by ropes forms  a class by itself  while the three other methods combine into a natural  group  because they possess a character in common of the greatest  importance  it may be said that all three involve a temporary  transformation of the mechanical power to be utilized into potential  energy  also in each of these methods the efficiency of transmission is  the product of three factors or partial efficiencies  which correspond  exactly  namely  first  the efficiency of the instrument which converts  the actual energy of the prime mover into potential energy  second  the  efficiency of the instrument which reconverts this potential energy into  actual energy  that is  into motion  and delivers it up in this shape  for the actual operations which accomplish industrial work  third  the  efficiency of the intermediate agency which serves for the conveyance of  potential energy from the first instrument to the second     this last factor has just been given for transmission by electricity  it  is the exact correlative of the efficiency of the pipe in the case of  compressed air or of pressure water  it is as useful in the case of  electric transmission  as of any other method  to be able  in studying the  system  to estimate beforehand what results it is able to furnish  and for  this purpose it is necessary to calculate exactly the factors which compose  the efficiency     in order to obtain this desirable knowledge  the author considers that the  three following points should form the aim of experimentalists  first   the determination of the efficiency  k  of the principal kinds of  magneto electric  or dynamo electric machines working as generators   second  the determination of the efficiency  k   of the same machines  working as motors  third  the determination of the law according to which  the magnetism of the cores of these machines varies with the intensity of  the current  the author is of opinion that experiments made with these  objects in view would be more useful than those conducted for determining  the general efficiency of transmission  for the latter give results only  available under precisely similar conditions  however  it is clear that  they have their value and must not be neglected     there are  moreover  many other questions requiring to be elucidated by  experiment  especially as regards the arrangement of the conducting wires   but it is needless to dwell further upon this subject  which has been ably  treated by many english men of science  for instance  dr  siemens and  professor ayrton  nevertheless  for further information the author would  refer to the able articles published at paris  by m  mascart  in the   journal de physique   in      and       the author would gladly have  concluded this paper with a comparison of the efficiencies of the four  systems which have been examined  or what amounts to the same thing  with a  comparison of the losses of power which they occasion  unfortunately  such  a comparison has never been made experimentally  because hitherto the  opportunity of doing it in a demonstrative manner has been wanting  for the  transmission of power to a distance belongs rather to the future than to  the present time  transmission by electricity is still in its infancy  it  has only been applied on a small scale and experimentally     of the three other systems  transmission by means of ropes is the only one  that has been employed for general industrial purposes  while compressed  air and water under pressure have been applied only to special purposes   and their use has been due much more to their special suitableness for  these purposes than from any considerations relative to loss of power   thus the effective work of the compressed air used in driving the  tunnels through the alps  assuming its determination to be possible  was  undoubtedly very low  nevertheless  in the present state of our appliances  it is the only process by which such operations can be accomplished  the  author believes that transmission by ropes furnishes the highest proportion  of useful work  but that as regards a wide distribution of the transmitted  power the other two methods  by air and water  might merit a preference                                                       the hotchkiss revolving gun       the hotchkiss revolving gun  already adopted in the french navy and by  other leading european nations  has been ordered for use in the german navy  by the following decree of the german emperor  dated january    last   on  the report made to me  i approve the adoption of the hotchkiss revolving  cannon as a part of the artillery of my navy  and each of my ships   according to their classification  shall in general be armed with this  weapon in such a manner that every point surrounding the vessel may be  protected by the fire of at least two guns at a minimum range of      meters                                                        thallium papers as ozonometers       schoene has given the results of an extended series of experiments on the  use of thallium paper for estimating approximately the oxidizing material  in the atmosphere  whether it be hydrogen peroxide alone  or mixed with  ozone  or perhaps also with other constituents hitherto unknown  the  objection to schoenbein s ozonometer  potassium iodide on starch paper  and  to houzeau s ozonometer  potassium iodide on red litmus paper  lies in  the fact that their materials are hygroscopic  and their indications vary  widely with the moisture of the air  since dry ozone does not act on these  papers  they must be moistened  and then the amount of moisture varies the  result quite as much as the amount of ozone  indeed  attention has been  called to the larger amount of ozone near salt works and waterfalls  and  the erroneous opinion advanced that ozone is formed when water is finely  divided  and boettger has stated that ozone is formed when ether is  atomized  the fact being that the reaction he observed was due to the  h  o   always present in ether  direct experiments with the schoenbein  ozonometer and the psychrometer gave parallel curves  whence the author  regards the former as only a crude hygrometer  these objections do not lie  against the thallium paper  the oxidation to brown oxide by either ozone or  hydrogen peroxide not requiring the presence of moisture  and the color   therefore  being independent of the hygrometric state of the air  moreover   when well cared for  the papers undergo no farther change of color and may  be preserved indefinitely  the author prepares the thallium paper a few  days before use  by dipping strips of swedish filtering paper in a solution  of thallous hydrate  and drying  the solution is prepared by pouring a  solution

exposed for thirty six hours  the  coloration is determined by comparison with a scale having eleven degrees  of intensity upon it  compared with schoenbein s ozonometer  the results are  in general directly opposite  the thallium papers show that the greatest  effect is in the daytime  the iodide papers that it is at night  yearly  curves show that the former generally indicate a rise when the

              the audiphone in england       the audiphone has been recently tried in the board school for deaf and  dumb at turin street  bethnal green  with very satisfactory results  so  satisfactory that the report will recommend its adoption in the four  schools which the london board have erected for the education of the deaf  and dumb  some    per cent  of the pupils in deaf and dumb schools have  sufficient power of hearing when assisted by the audiphone to enable them  to take their places in the classes of the ordinary schools                                                       conductivity of moist air       many physical treatises still assert that moist air conducts electricity   though silberman and others have proved the contrary  an interesting  experiment bearing on this has been described lately by prof  marangoni   over a flame is heated some water in a glass jar  through the stopper of  which passes a bent tube to bell jar  held obliquely   which thus gets  filled with aqueous vapor  the upper half of a thin leyden jar charged is  brought into the bell jar  and held there four or five seconds  it is  then found entirely discharged  that the real cause of this  however  is  condensation of the vapor on the part of the glass that is not coated with  tin foil  the liquid layer acting by conduction  can be proved  for if that  part of the jar be passed several times rapidly through the flame  so as  to heat it to near     deg  c   before inserting in the bell jar  a different  effect will be had  the leyden jar will give out long sparks after  withdrawal  this is because the glass being heated no longer condenses the  vapor on its surface  and there is no superficial conduction  as in the  previous case                                                       floating pontoon dock       considerable attention has been given for some years past to the subject of  floating pontoon docks by mr  robert turnbull  naval architect  of south  shields  eng   who has devised the ingenious arrangement which forms the  subject of the annexed illustration  the end aimed at and now achieved by  mr  turnbull was so to construct floating docks or pontoons that they may  rise and fall in a berth  and be swung round at one end upon a center post  or cylinder  nautically known as a dolphin  projecting from the ground at  a slight distance from the berth  the cylinder is in deep water  and   when the pontoon is swung and sunk to the desired depth by letting in the  necessary amount of water  a vessel can be floated in and then secured  the  pontoon  with the vessel on it  is then raised by pumping out the contained  water until she is a little above the level of the berth  the whole is then  swung round over the berth  the vessel then being high and dry to enable  repairs or other operations to be conducted  for this purpose  one end of  the pontoon is so formed as to enable it to fit around the cylinder  and  to be held to it as to a center or fulcrum  about which the pontoon can be  swung  the pontoon is of special construction  and has air chambers at the  sides placed near the center  so as to balance it  it also has chambers at  the ends  which are divided horizontally in order that the operation of  submerging within a berth or in shallow water may be conducted without  risk  the upper chambers being afterwards supplied with water to sink the  pontoon to the full depth before a vessel is hauled in  when the ship is in  place  the pontoon with her is then lifted above the level of the berth in  which it has to be placed  and then swung round into the berth  in some  cases  the pontoon is provided with a cradle  so that  when in berth  the  vessel on the cradle can be hauled up a slip with rails arranged as  a continuation of the cradle rails of the pontoon  which can be then  furnished with another cradle  and another vessel lifted     it is this latter arrangement which forms the subject of our illustration   the vessel represented being of the following dimensions  length between  perpendiculars      feet  breadth  moulded     feet  depth  moulded      feet  tons  b  m

with the ship raised and swung round on to a low level quay  going a step  further in the operation  we see at c  the vessel hauled on to the slipways  on the high level quay  in this case the cylinder is arranged so that  the vessel may be delivered on to the rails or slips  which are arranged  radially  taking the cylinder as the center  there may be any number of  slips so arranged  and one pontoon may be made available for several  cylinders at the deep water parts of neighboring repairing or building  yards  in which case the recessed portion of the pontoon  when arranged  around the cylinder  has stays or retaining bars fitted to prevent it  leaving the cylinder when the swinging is taking place  such as might  happen in a tideway      illustration  fig     improved floating

radial slips for drawing the vessels with the cradle off the pontoon   and hauling them up on to the high level quay  and g shows the repairing  shops  stores  and sheds  a pontoon attached to a cylinder may be fitted  with an ordinary wet dock  and then the pontoon  before or after the vessel  is upon it  can be slewed round to suit the slips up which the vessel has  to be moved  supposing the slips are arranged radially  in this case  the  pivot end of the pontoon would be a fixture  so to speak  to the cylinder     the pontoon may also be made available for lifting heavy weights  by  fitting a pair of compound levers or other apparatus at one end  the  lifting power being in the pontoon itself  in some cases  in order to  lengthen the pontoon  twenty five or fifty foot lengths are added at  the after end  when not thus engaged  those lengths form short pontoons  suitable for small vessels    iron                                                        weirleigh  brenchley  kent

    footnote  read before the philadelphia county medical society  may            by w  g  a  bonwill  m d   d d s   philadelphia        through the kind invitation of your directors  i am present to give you  the history of  rapid breathing  as an analgesic agent  as well as my  experience therein since i first discovered it  it is with no little  feeling of modesty that i appear before such a learned and honorable  body of physicians and surgeons  and i accept the privilege as a high  compliment  i trust the same liberal spirit which prompted you to call this  subject to the light of investigation will not forsake you when you have  heard all i have to say and you sit in judgment thereon  sufficient time  has now elapsed since the first promulgation of the subject for the shafts  of ridicule to be well nigh spent  which is the common logic used to crush  out all new ideas   and it is to be expected that gentlemen will look upon  it with all the charity of a learned body  and not be too hasty to condemn  what they have had but little chance to investigate  and  of course  have  not practiced with that success which can only come from an intelligent  understanding of its application and  modus operandi      knowing the history of past discoveries  i was well prepared for the  crucible  i could not hope to be an exception  but  so far  the medical  profession have extended me more favor than i have received at the hands of  the dental profession     my first conception of the analgesic property of a pain obtunder in  contradistinction to its anaesthetic effect  which finally led to the  discovery of the inhalation of common air by  rapid breathing   was in       or       while performing upon my own teeth certain operations which gave  me intense pain  and i could not afford to hurt myself  without a resort to  ether and chloroform  these agents had been known so short a time that no  one was specially familiar with their action  without knowing whether i  could take chloroform administered by myself  and at the same time perform  with skill the excavation of extremely sensitive dentine or tooth bone  as  if no anaesthetic had been taken  and not be conscious of pain  was more  than the experience of medical men at that time could assure me  but   having a love for investigation of the unknown  i prepared myself for the  ordeal  by degrees i took the chloroform until i began to feel very plainly  its primary effects  and knowing that i must soon be unconscious  i applied  the excavator to the carious tooth  and  to my surprise  found no pain  whatever  but the sense of touch and hearing were marvelously intensified   the small cavity seemed as large as a half bushel  the excavator more the  size of an ax  and the sound was equally magnified  that i might not be  mistaken  i repeated the operation until i was confident that anaesthetics  possessed a power not hitherto known  that of analgesia  to be doubly  certain  i gave it in my practice  in many cases with the same happy  results  which saved me from the risks incident to the secondary effects of  anaesthetics  and which answered for all the purposes of extracting from  one to four teeth  not satisfied with any advance longer than i could find  a better plan  i experimented with the galvanic current  to and fro  by so  applying the poles that i substituted a stronger impression by electricity  from the nerve centers or ganglia to the peripheries than was made from the  periphery to the brain  this was so much of a success that i threw  aside chloroform and ether in removing the living nerve of a tooth with  instruments instead of using arsenic  and for excavating sensitive caries  in teeth  preparatory to filling  as well as many teeth extracted by it   but this was short lived  for it led to another step  sometimes i would  inflict severe pain in cases of congested pulps or from its hasty  application  or pushing it to do too much  when my patient invariably would  draw or inhale the breath  very forcibly and rapidly   i was struck with  the repeated coincidence  and was led to exclaim   nature s anaesthetic    this then reminded me of boyhood s bruises  the involuntary action of every  one who has a finger hurt is to place it to the mouth and draw violently in  the air and hold it for an instant  and again repeat it until the pain is  subdued  the same action of the lungs occurs  except more powerfully   in young children who take to crying when hurt  it will be noticed they  breathe very rapidly while furiously crying  which soon allays the  irritation  and sleep comes as the sequel  witness also when one is  suddenly startled  how violently the breath is taken  which gives relief   the same thing occurs in the lower animals when pain is being inflicted at  the hand of man     this was advance no     and so sure was i of this new discovery  that i at  once made an application while removing decay from an extremely sensitive  tooth  to be successful  i found i must make the patient take the start   and i would follow with a thrust from the excavator  which move would be  accomplished before the lungs could be inflated  this was repeated for  at least a minute  until the operation was completed  i always following  immediately or synchronously with the inhalation     this led to step no     which resulted in its application to the extracting  of teeth and other operations in minor surgery     up to this time i had believed the sole effect of the rapid inhalation was  due to mere diversion of the will  and this was the only way nature could  so violently exert herself  that of controlling the involuntary action of  the lungs to her uses by the  safety valve   or the voluntary movement     the constant breathing of the patient for thirty seconds to a minute left  him in a condition of body and mind resembling the effects of ether and  chloroform in their primary stages  i could but argue that the prolonged  breathing each time had done it  and  if so  then there must be some  specific effect over and above the mere diversion by the will  to what  could it be due  to the air alone  which went in excess into the lungs in  the course of a minute  why did i not then immediately grasp the idea of  its broader application as now claimed for it  it was too much  gentlemen   for that hour  enough had been done in this fourth step of conception to  rest in the womb of time  until by evolution a higher step could be made at  the maturity of the child  being self satisfied with my own baby  i watched  and caressed it until it could take care of itself  and my mind was again  free for another conception     the births at first seemed to come at very short intervals  but see how  long it was between the fourth and the fifth birth  it was soon after that  my mind became involved in inventions  a hereditary outgrowth  and the  electric mallet and then the dental engine  the parent of your surgical  engine  to be found in the principal hospitals of this city  took such  possession of my whole soul  that my air analgesic was left slumbering  it  was not until august        nineteen years after  that it again came up in  full force  without any previous warning     this time it was no law of association that revived it  but it seemed  the whispering of some one in the air  some ethereal spirit  if you  please  which instituted it  and advanced the following problem   nitrous  oxide gas is composed of the same elements as ordinary air  with a larger  equivalent of oxygen  except it is a chemical compound  not a mechanical  mixture  and its anaesthetic effects are said to be due to the excess of  oxygen  if this be a fact  then why can you not produce a similar effect by  rapid breathing for a minute  more or less  by which a larger quantity of  oxygen is presented in the lungs for absorption by the blood      this query was soon answered by asking myself another   if the rapid  inhalation of air into the lungs does not increase the heart s action and  cause it to drive the blood in exact ratio to the inhalations  then  i can   produce partial anaesthesia from this excess of oxygen brought about by the  voluntary movements over their ordinary involuntary action of the lungs    the next question was  will my heart be affected by this excess of air in  the lungs to such an extent that there will be a full reciprocity between  them  without making any trial of it  i argued that  while there is no  other muscular movement than that of the chest as under the control of the  will  and as nature has given to the will the perfect control over the  lungs to supply more or less air  as is demanded by the pneumogastric nerve  for the immediate wants of the economy  when the  involuntary action  is  not sufficient  and the heart not being under the control of the will  and  its action never accelerated or diminished except by a specific poison  or  from the general activity of the person in violent running or working  the  blood is forced into the heart faster and must get rid of it  when a larger  supply of oxygen is demanded and rapid breathing must occur  or asphyxia  result  i was not long in deciding that the heart  would not be  accelerated  but a trifle  say a tenth  and  under the circumstances  i  said   the air  is  an anaesthetic      from this rapid course of argument  i was so profoundly convinced of its  truth  that without having first tried it upon my own person  i would have  sat where i was  upon the curbstone  and had a tooth removed with the  perfect expectation of absence of pain and of still being conscious of  touch  while yet walking with my children  i commenced to breathe as  rapidly as possible  and  as anticipated  found my steps growing shorter  and shorter  until i came to a stand  showing to my mind clearly that my  argument in advance was right  so far as locomotion was concerned  and   upon referring to my pulse  i found but little acceleration     to what other conclusion could i arrive from this argument  with the  foundation laid nineteen years before  when i established on my own person  by experiment the fact of analgesia as induced from chloroform  with the  many experiments in rapid respiration on tooth bone     from this moment until its first application to the extraction of a tooth  you can well imagine my suspense  that i might not fail in the very first  attempt  i compelled myself and others in my household to breathe rapidly  to investigate the phenomenon  this gave me some idea as to the proper  method of proceeding in its administering     the first case soon appeared  and was a perfect success  going far beyond  my anticipations  for the effect was such as to produce a partial paralysis  of the hands and arms to the elbow  again and again i tried it in every  case of extraction and many other experiments  doubting my own senses for  a long time at a result so anomalous and paradoxical  i was reminded just  here of a phenomenon which gave me additional proof  that of blowing a  dull fire to revive it  for a minute or so one blows and blows in rapid  succession until  rising from the effort  a sense of giddiness for a  few moments so overcomes that the upright position is with difficulty  maintained  in this condition you are fitted for having a tooth extracted  or an abscess lanced     believing that i had something new to offer which might be of use to  suffering humanity  i read the first article upon it nov            before  the franklin institute  shortly after i was invited before the northern  medical society of this city to address them thereon  a number of medical  gentlemen have been using it in their practice  while the bulk of them have  spurned it as  negative  and preposterous  without an effort at trying it   which i can  now  very well understand     unless one is aware of the fact that in the use of any agent which has the  power to suspend the volition  it can be taken to that point where he is  still conscious of  touch and hearing   and at the same time not cognizant  of pain inflicted  the action of rapid breathing could not be understood   and i regret to say that of three fourths of the medical men i have talked  with on the subject they had not been aware of such a possibility from  ether and chloroform  until this analgesic state could be established in  their minds it was impossible to convince them that the excess of oxygen   as obtained by rapid breathing  could be made to produce a similar effect    i  should have been as reluctant as any one to believe it  had i not  personally experienced the effect while performing an operation which would  otherwise have been very painful  such a result could not well be reached  by any course of reasoning     has it proven in my practice what has been claimed for it  a substitute  for the powerful anaesthetics in minor operations in surgery  most  emphatically  yes  so completely has it fulfilled its humble mission in  my office  that i can safely assert there has not been more than five per  cent  of failures  i have given it under all circumstances of diseased  organs  and have seen no other than the happiest results in its after  effects  it may well be asked just here  why has it not been more generally  and widely used by the dental profession as well as the medical  if it is  really what is claimed for it  the most satisfactory and charitable answer  to be given is  the failure upon their part to comprehend the  fact  as  existing in chloroform and ether that there is such a state as analgesia   or  in other words  that the animal economy is so organized  while the  sense of touch is not destroyed  but rather increased  the mind of the  subject fails to perceive a sense of pain when anaesthetics are given  and  the effects are manifested in the primary stage  as i before intimated   such is the knowledge possessed by most of those who administer ether and  chloroform  this was enough to cause nearly every one to look upon it as a  bubble or air castle  many gentlemen told me they tried it upon themselves   and  while it affected them very seriously by giddiness  they still   retained consciousness   and  such being the case  no effect could be  produced for obtunding pain  others told me they were afraid to continue  the breathing alarmed at the vertigo induced  and the practitioner who has  adopted it more effectively than any other laughed at me when i first told  him of the discovery  but his intimate association with me changed his  views after much explanation and argument between us     it was hardly to be expected that without this knowledge of analgesia   and without any explanation from me as to the  modus operandi  of rapid  breathing  other than a few suggestions or directions as to how the effect  was induced  even the most liberal of medical men should be able to make  it effective  or have the least disposition to give it a preliminary trial  upon themselves  and  of course  would not attempt it upon a patient   notwithstanding  it found a few adherents  but only among my personal   medical  friends  with whom i had an opportunity to explain what i  believed its physiological action  and the cases of success in my own  practice  to this i have submitted as among the inevitable in the calendar  of discoveries of all grades     my own profession have attempted to  ridicule  it out of its birthright  and possible existence  which style of argument is not resorted to by true  logicians     to all this i can truly say i have not for one moment faltered  i could  afford to wait  the liberality of this society alone fully compensates for  the seeming indisposition of the past  believing that it is proper that  every advance should be confronted  and  if in time found worthy  give it  god speed     from its first conception i have diligently labored to solve its  modus  operandi   and the doubt in my own mind as to whether i could be mistaken  in my observations  i asked the opinion of our best chemical teachers if  air could have such effect  one attributed it to oxygen stimulation  and  the other to nitrogen  another gentleman told me the medical profession had  come to the conclusion that it was possible for me to thus extract teeth   but it was due solely to my strong  personal magnetism   which power i was  not before aware i possessed      now  from what i have related of the successive and natural steps which  finally culminated in this process or plan of analgesia induced by an  excess of ordinary air taken forcibly into the lungs above what is  necessary for life  and from what i shall state as to the apparently  anomalous or paradoxical effects  with its physiological action  and the  simple tests made upon each of my patients  i shall trust to so convince  you of its plausibility and possibility that it will be made use of in  hundreds of minor operations where ether and chloroform are now used     aside from my assertion and that of its friends  that the effects can be  produced by air alone  you must have some light shed upon the causes of its  physiological action  which will appeal to your  medical  reason     to assign an action to any drug is difficult  and in the cases of ether and  the other anaesthetics a quarter of a century still finds many conflicting  opinions  this being true  you will deal leniently with me for the opinion  i hold as to their analgesic action  of course it will be objected to   for the unseen is  to a great extent  unknowable  enough for my argument   however  it seems to suit the case very well without looking for another   and while it was based on the phenomenon resulting from many trials  and  not the trials upon it as a previous theory  i shall be content with it  until a better one can be found     what is it i claim as a new discovery  and the facts and its philosophy     i have asserted that i can produce  from rapidly breathing common air at  the rate of a hundred respirations a minute  a similar effect to that from  ether  chloroform  and nitrous oxide gas  in their primary stages  and i  can in this way render patients sufficiently insensible to acute pain from  any operation where the time consumed is not over twenty to thirty seconds   while the special senses are in partial action  the sense of pain is  obtunded  and in many cases completely annulled  consciousness and general  sensibility being preserved     to accomplish this  each patient must be instructed how to act and what to  expect  as simple as it may seem  there is a proper and consistent plan to  enable you to reach full success  before the patient commences to inhale he  is informed of the fact that  while he will be unconscious of pain  he  will know full  or partially well  every touch upon the person  that the  inhalation must be vigorously kept up during the whole operation without  for an instant stopping  that the more energetically and steadily he  breathes  the more perfect the effect  and that if he cease breathing  during the operation  pain will be felt  fully impress them with this  idea  for the very good reason that they may stop when in the midst of an  operation  and the fullest effects be lost  it is obligatory to do so on  account of its evanescent effects  which demand that the patient be pushed  by the operator s own energetic appeals to  go on   it is very difficult  for any person to respire more than one hundred times to the minute  as he  will become by that time so exhausted as not to be able to breathe at all   as is evidenced by all who have thus followed my directions  for the next  minute following the completion of the operation the subject will not  breathe more than once or twice  very few have force enough left to raise  hand or foot  the voluntary muscles have nearly all been subjugated and  overcome by the undue effort at forced inhalation of one hundred over  seventeen  the normal standard  it will be more fully understood further on  in my argument why i force patients  and am constantly speaking to them to  go on     i further claim that for the past four years  so satisfactory has been the  result of this system in the extracting of teeth and deadening extremely  sensitive dentine  there was no longer any necessity for chloroform   ether  or nitrous oxide in the dental office  that such teeth as cannot be  extracted by its aid can well be preserved and made useful  except in a  very few cases  who will not be forced to breathe     the anaesthetics  when used in major operations  where time is needed for  the operation  can be made more effective by a lesser quantity when given  in conjunction with  rapid breathing   drs  garrettson and hews  who have  thus tried it  tell me it takes one half to three fourths less  and the  after effects are far less nauseating and unpleasant     as an agent in labor where an anaesthetic is indicated  it is claimed by  one who has employed it  dr  hews  in nearly every case for three years  he  has used  rapid breathing  solely  and to the exclusion of chloroform and  ether  for this i have his assertion  and have no doubt of it whatever  for  if any agent could break down the action of the voluntary muscles of the  parts involved  which prevent the involuntary muscles of the uterus from  having their fullest effect  it is this  the very act of rapid breathing so  affects the muscles of the abdomen as to force the contents of the uterus  downward or outward  while the specific effect of the air at the end of a  minute s breathing leaves the subject in a semi prostrate condition  giving  the uterus full chance to act in the interim  because free of the will to  make any attempt at withholding the involuntary muscles of the uterus from  doing their natural work  it is self evident  and in this agent we claim  here a boon of inestimable value  and not least in such cases is  there is  no danger of hemorrhage  since the cause of the effect is soon removed     in attestation of many cases where it has been tried  i have asked the  mother  and  in some cases  the attendants  whether anything else had been  given  and whether the time was very materially lessened  there has been  but one response  and that in its favor     gentlemen  if we are not mistaken in this  you will agree with me in saying  that it is no mean thing  and should be investigated by intelligent men and  reported upon  from my own knowledge of its effects in my practice  i am  bound to believe this gentleman s record     i further claim for it a special application in dislocations  it has  certainly peculiar merits here  as the will is so nearly subjugated by  it as to render the patient quite powerless to resist your effort at  replacing  and at the same time the pain is subdued     it is not necessary i should further continue special applications  when  its  modus operandi  is understood  its adaptation to many contingencies  will of a sequence follow     it is well just here  before passing to the next point of consideration  to  answer a query which may arise at this juncture     what are the successive stages of effects upon the economy from its  commencement until the full effect is observed  and what proof have i that  it was due to the amount of air inhaled     the heart s action is not increased more than from seventy  the average  to  eighty and sometimes ninety  but is much enfeebled  or throwing a lesser  quantity of blood  the face becomes suffused  as in blowing a fire or in  stooping  which continues until the breathing is suspended  when the  face becomes paler   have not noticed any purple as from asphyxia by a  deprivation of oxygen   the vision becomes darkened  and a giddiness soon  appears  the voluntary muscles furthest from the heart seem first to be  affected  and the feet and hands  particularly the latter  have a numbness  at their ends  which increases  until in many cases there is partial  paralysis as far as the elbow  while the limbs become fixed  the hands are  so thoroughly affected that  when open  the patient is powerless to close  them and  vice versa   there is a vacant gaze from the eyes and looking  into space without blinking of the eyelids for a half minute or more  the  head seems incapable of being held erect  and there is no movement of the  arms or legs as is usual when in great pain  there is no disposition on the  part of the patient to take hold of the operator s hand or interfere with  the operation     many go on breathing mechanically after the tooth is removed  as if nothing  had occurred  some are aware that the tooth has been extracted  and say  they felt it  others could not tell what had been accomplished  the  majority of cases have an idea of what is being done  but are powerless to  resist     with the very intelligent  or those who stop to reason  i have to teach  them the peculiarities of being sensible of touch and not of pain     one very interesting case i will state  in extracting seven teeth for a  lady who was very  unwilling  to believe my statement as to touch and no  pain  i first removed three teeth after having inhaled for one minute  and  when fully herself  she stated that she could not understand why there was  no pain while she was conscious of each one extracted  it was preposterous  to believe such an effect could be possible  as her reason told her that  there is connected with tooth extracting pain in the part  and of severe  character  admitting  though  she felt no pain  she allowed one to be  removed without anything  and she could easily distinguish the change  and  exclaimed   it is all the difference imaginable   when the other three were  extracted  there was perfect success again as with the first three     one of the most marked proofs of the effects of rapid breathing was that of  a boy of eleven years of age for whom i had to extract the upper and lower  first permanent molars on each side  he breathed for nearly a minute  when  i removed in about twenty seconds all four of the teeth  without a moment s  intermission or the stopping the vigorous breathing  and not a murmur   sigh  or tear afterward     he declared there was no pain  and we needed no such assertion  for there  was not the first manifestation from him that he was undergoing such a  severe operation     another case  the same day  when i had to extract the superior wisdom teeth  on both sides for an intelligent young lady of eighteen years  where i had  to use two pairs of forceps on each tooth  equivalent to extraction of four  teeth   and she was so profoundly affected afterward that she could  not  tell me what had been done other than that i had touched her four times   she was overcome from its effects for at least a minute afterward  she was  delighted     with such severe tests i fear very little the result in any case i can have  them do as i bid     there can be no mistake that there is a  specific action  from something   it cannot be personal magnetism or mesmeric influence exerted by me  for  such cases are rare  averaging about    per cent  only of all classes   besides  in mesmeric influence the time has nothing to do with it  whereas   in my cases  it cannot last over a half minute or minute at most  it cannot  be fear  as such cases are generally more apt to get hurt the worse  it is  not diversion of mind alone  as we have an effect above it     there is no better way of testing whether pain has been felt than by taking  the lacerated or contused gums of the patient between the index finger  and thumb and making a gentle pressure to collapse the alveolar borders   invariably  they will cry out lustily   that is pain   this gives undoubted  proof of a specific agent  there is no attempt upon my  own  part to exert  any influence over my patients in any way other than that they shall  believe what i say in regard to  giving  them  no pain  and in the  following of my orders  any one who knows how persons become mesmerized can  attest that it was not the  operator who forces them under it against  their will   but it is a peculiar state into which any one who has within  themselves this temperament can  place  themselves where any one who knows  how can have control  it is not the will of the operator  i therefore  dismiss this as unworthy of consideration in connection with rapid  breathing     then you may now ask  to what do i attribute this very singular phenomenon     any one who followed  in the earlier part of this paper  the course of  the argument in my soliloquy  after twenty years had elapsed from my  observation upon myself of the analgesic effects of chloroform  can almost  give something of an answer     that you may the more easily grasp what i shall say  i will ask you  if it  be possible for any human being to make one hundred inhalations in a minute  and the heart s action is not increased more than ten or twenty pulsations  over the normal  what should be the effect upon the brain and nerve  centers     if the function of oxygen in common air is to set free in the blood   either in the capillaries alone  or throughout the whole of the arterial  circulation  carbonic acid gas  and that it cannot escape from the system  unless it do so in the lungs as it passes in the general current  except  a trace that is removed by the skin and kidneys  and that the quantity of  carbonic acid gas set free is in exact relation to the amount of oxygen  taken into the blood  what effect  must be  manifested where one hundred  respirations in one minute are made  five or six times the normal  number  while the heart is only propelling the blood a very little faster  through the lungs  and  more feebly   say    pulsations at most  when to  be in proportion it should be     to     respirations to sustain life any  length of time     you cannot deny the fact that a definite amount of oxygen can be absorbed  and is absorbed as fast as it is carried into the lungs  even if there be  one hundred respirations to the minute  while the pulsations of the heart  are only ninety  nature has  made it  possible to breathe so rapidly to  meet any emergency  and we can well see its beautiful application in the  normal action of both the heart and lungs while one is violently running     what would result  and that very speedily  were the act of respiration to  remain at the standard  say    or     when the heart is in violent action  from this running  asphyxia would surely end the matter  and why  the  excessive exercise of the whole body is setting free from the tissues such  an amount of excretive matter  and carbon more largely than all the others   that  without a relative action of the lungs to admit the air that oxygen  may be absorbed  carbonic acid gas cannot be liberated through the lungs  as fast as the waste carbon of the overworked tissues is being made by  disassimilation from this excess of respiration     you are already aware how small a quantity of carbonic acid in excess in  the air will seriously affect life  even   to   per cent  in a short time  will prove fatal  in ordinary respiration of    to the minute the average  of carbonic acid exhaled is          from experiments long ago made by vierordt  see carpenter  p       you will  see the relative per cent  of carbonic acid exhaled from a given number of  respirations  when he was breathing six times per minute      per cent of  the exhaled air was carbonic acid  twelve times       twenty four times        forty eight times     ninety six times          remember this is based upon the whole number of respirations in the minute  and not each exhalation  which latter could not be measured by the most  minute method     let us deduct the minimum amount      per cent  of carbonic acid when  breathing ninety six times per minute  from the average  at twenty per  minute  or the normal standard  which is recorded in carpenter  p       as       per minute  and we have retained in the circulation nearly   per cent   of carbonic acid  that  at the average  would have passed off through the  lungs without any obstruction  and life equalized  but it not having been  thrown off as fast as it should have been  must  of necessity  be left to  prey upon the brain and nerve centers  and as   to   per cent   we are  told  will so poison the blood  life is imperiled and that speedily     it is not necessary we should argue the point as to whether oxygen  displaces carbonic acid in the tissues proper or the capillaries  the  theory of lavoisier on this point has been accepted     we know furthermore  as more positive  that tissues placed in an atmosphere  of oxygen will set free carbonic acid  and that carbonic acid has a  paralyzing effect upon the human hand held in it for a short time  the  direct and speedy effects of this acid upon the delicate nervous element of  the brain is so well known that it must be accepted as law  one of the most  marked effects is the suspension of locomotion of the legs and arms   and the direct loss of will power which must supervene before voluntary  muscular inactivity  which amounts to partial paralysis in the hands or  feet  or peripheral extremities of the same     now that we have sufficient evidence from the authorities that carbonic  acid can be retained in the blood by excessive breathing  and enough to  seriously affect the brain  and what its effects are when taken directly  into the lungs in excess  we can enter upon what i have held as the most  reasonable theory of the phenomenon produced by rapid breathing for  analgesic purposes  which  theory  was not  first  conceived and the  process made to yield to it  but the phenomenon was long observed  and  from the repetition of the effects and their close relationship to that  of carbonic acid on the economy  with the many experiments performed  upon myself  i am convinced that what i shall now state will be found to  substantiate my discovery  should it not be found to coincide with what  some may say is physiological truth  it will not invalidate the discovery  itself  for of that i am far more positive than harvey was of the discovery  of the circulation of the blood  or of galileo of the spherical shape of  the earth  and i ask that it shall not be judged by my theory  but from the  practice     it should have as much chance for investigation as the theory of  julius robert mayer  upon which he founded  or which gave rise to the  establishment of one of the most important scientific truths   the  conservation of energy   and finally the  correlation of forces   which  theory i am not quite sure was correct  although it was accepted  and as  yet  i have not seen it questioned     in all due respect to him i quote it from the sketch of that remarkable  man  as given in the  popular science monthly   as specially bearing on my  discovery      mayer observed while living in java  that the  venous blood  of some of  his patients had a singularly bright red color  the observation riveted  his attention  he reasoned upon it  and came to the conclusion that the  brightness of the color was due to the fact that a less amount of oxidation  was sufficient to keep up the temperature of the body in a hot climate than  a cold one  the darkness of the venous blood he regarded as the visible  sign of the energy of the oxidation      my observation leads me to the contrary  that the higher the temperature  the more rapid the breathing to get clear of the excess of carbon  and  hence more oxygenation of the blood which will arterialize the venous  blood  unless there is a large amount of carbonized matter from the tissues  to be taken up     nor must it be denied because of the reasoning as presented to my mind by  some outside influence in my soliloquy when i first exclaimed   nature s  anaesthetic   where the argument as to the effects of nitrous oxide gas  being due to an excess of oxygen was urged  and that common air breathed in  excess would do the same thing     i am not sure that  it  was correct  for the effects of nitrous oxide is   perhaps  due to a deprivation of mechanically mixed air     knowing what i do of theory and practice  i can say with assurance that  there is not a medical practitioner who would long ponder in any urgent  case as to the thousand and one theories of the action of remedies  but  would resort to the  practical  experience of others and his own finally    what surgeon ever stops to ask how narcotics effect their influence    after nearly thirty years of association with ether and chloroform  who can  positively answer as to their  modus operandi   it is thus with nearly the  whole domain of medicine  it is not yet  by far  among the sciences  with  immutable laws  such as we have in chemistry  experimentation is giving us  more specific knowledge  and  practice alone has tended to make perfect     then  gentlemen will not set at naught my assertion and practical results   when i have stated my case in full it is for  you  to disprove both the  theory and practice annunciated  so far as i am concerned i am responsible  for both      you will please bear with me for a few minutes in my attempt at theory     the annulling of pain  and  in some cases  its complete annihilation   can be accomplished in many ways  narcotics  anaesthetics  local and  internal  direct action of cold  and mesmeric or physiological influence   have all their advocates  and each  will surely  do its work  there is one  thing about which  i think  we can all agree  as to these agencies  unless  the  will  is partially and in some cases completely subjugated there can  be no primary or secondary effect  the voluntary muscles must become wholly  or partially paralyzed for the time  telegraphic communication must be cut  off from the brain  that there be no reflex action  it is not necessary  there should be separate nerves to convey pleasure and pain any more than  there should be two telegraphic wires to convey two messages     if  then  we are certain of this  it matters little as to whether it was  done by corpuscular poisoning and anaemia as from chloroform or hyperaemia  from ether     i think we are now prepared to show clearly the causes which effect the  phenomena in  rapid breathing      the first thing enlisted is the  diversion of the will force  in the act of  forced respiration at a moment when the heart and lungs have been in normal  reciprocal action     respirations to    pulsations   which act could  not be made and carried up to     respirations per minute without such  concentrated effort that ordinary pain could make no impression upon the  brain while this abstraction is kept up     second  there is a specific effect resulting from enforced respiration of      to the minute  due to the  excess of carbonic acid gas set free from  the tissues   generated by this enforced normal act of throwing into the  lungs  five times  the normal amount of oxygen in one minute demanded  when  the heart has not been aroused to exalted action  which comes from violent  exercise in running or where one is suddenly startled  which excess of  carbonic acid cannot escape in the same ratio from the lungs  since the  heart does not respond to the proportionate overaction of the lungs     third   hyperaemia is the last in this chain of effects  which is due to  the excessive amount of air passing into the lungs preventing but little  more than the normal quantity of blood from passing from the heart into  the arterial circulation  but draws it up in the brain with its excess of  carbonic acid gas to act also directly upon the brain as well as throughout  the capillary and venous system  and as well upon the heart  the same as if  it were suspended in that gas outside the body     these are evident to the senses of any liberal observer who can witness a  subject rapidly breathing     some ask why is not this same thing produced when one has been running  rapidly for a few minutes  for a very good reason  in this case the rapid  inhalations are preceded by the violent throes of the heart to propel the  carbonized blood from the overworked tissues and have them set free at the  lungs where the air is rushing in at the normal ratio of four to one  this  is not an abnormal action  but is of necessity  or asphyxia would instantly  result and the runner would drop  such sometimes occurs where the runner  exerts himself too violently at the very outset  and to do so he is  compelled to hold his breath for this undue effort  and the heart cannot  carry the blood fast enough  in this instance there is an approach to  analgesia as from rapid breathing     let me take up the first factor   diversion of will   and show that nature  invariably resorts to a sudden inhalation to prevent severe infliction of  pain being felt  it is the panacea to childhood s frequent bruises and  cuts  and every one will remember how when a finger has been hurt it is  thrust into the mouth and a violent number of efforts at rapid inhalation  is effected until ease comes  by others it is subdued by a fit of crying   which if you will but imitate the sobs  will find how frequently the  respirations are made     one is startled  and the heart would seem to jump out of the chest  in  quick obedience to nature the person is found making a number of quick  inhalations  which subdue the heart and pacify the will by diversion from  the cause     the same thing is observed in the lower animals  i will relate a case     an elephant had been operated upon for a diseased eye which gave him great  pain  for which he was unprepared  and he was wrathy at the keeper and  surgeon  it soon passed off  and the result of the application was so  beneficial to the animal that when brought out in a few days after  to have  another touch of caustic to the part  he was prepared for them  and  just  before the touch  he inflated the lungs to their fullest extent  which  occupied more time than the effect of the caustic  when he made no effort  at resistance and showed no manifestation of having been pained     in many cases of extraction of the temporary teeth of children  i make them  at the instant i grasp the tooth take  one  very violent inhalation  which  is sufficient  mesmeric anaesthesia can well be classified under diversion  or subjugation of the will  but can be effected in but a small percentage  of the cases  to rely upon this first or primary effect  except in  instantaneous cases  would be failure     the second factor is the one upon which i can rely in such of the cases as  come into my care  save when i cannot induce them to make such a number of  respirations as is absolutely necessary  the  whole secret of success lies   in the greatest number of respirations that can be effected in from    to     seconds  and that without any intermission  if the heart  by the  alow  method of respiration   is pulsating in ratio of four to one respiration    no effect can be induced      when the respirations are  say      to the minute  and made with all the  energy the patient can muster  and are kept up while the operation is going  on  there can hardly be a failure in the minor operations     it is upon this point many of you may question the facts  before i tried  it for the first time upon my own person  i arrived at the same conclusion  from a course of argument  that rapid breathing would control the heart s  action and pacify it  and even reduce it below the normal standard under my  urgent respirations     in view of the many applications made i feel quite sure in my belief that   inasmuch as the heart s action is but slightly accelerated  though with  less force from rapid breathing at the rate of     to the minute  there is  such an excess of carbonic acid gas set free and crowding upon the heart  and capillaries of the brain  without a chance to escape by the lungs  that  it is the same to all intents as were carbonic acid breathed through the  lungs in common air  look at the result after this has been kept up for a  minute or more  during the next minute the respirations are not more than  one or two  and the heart has fallen really below  in some cases  the  standard beat  showing most conclusively that once oxygenation has taken  place and that the free carbonic acid gas has been so completely consumed   that there is no involuntary call through the pneumogastric nerve for a  supply of oxygen     if any physiological facts can be proven at all  then i feel quite sure of  your verdict upon my side     there is no one thing that goes so far to prove the theory of lavoisier  regarding the action of oxygen in the tissues and capillaries for  converting carbon into carbonic acid gas instead of the lungs  as held  prior to that time  and still held by many who are not posted in late  experiments  at the time i commenced this practice i must confess i knew  nothing of it  the study of my cases soon led me to the same theory of  lavoisier  as i could not make the phenomena agree with the old theory of  carbonic acid generated only in the lungs     when vierordt was performing his experiments upon himself in rapid  breathing from six times per minute to ninety six  i cannot understand  why he failed to observe and record what did certainly result  an extreme  giddiness with muscular prostration and numbness in the peripheries of the  hands and feet  with suffusion of the face  and such a loss of locomotion  as to prevent standing erect without desiring support  besides  the very  great difference he found in the amount of carbonic acid retained in the  circulation  the very cause of the phenomena just spoken of     one thing comes in just here to account for the lack of respiration the  minute after the violent effort  the residual air  which in a normal state  is largely charged with carbonic acid  has been so completely exhausted  that some moments are consumed before there is sufficient again to call  upon the will for its discharge     as to hyperaemia you will also assent  now that my second factor is  explained  but it is so nearly allied to the direct effect of excessive  respiration that we can well permit it to pass without argument  if  hyperaemia  is present   we have a more certain and rather more lasting  effect     in conclusion  i will attempt to prognosticate the application of this  principle to the cure of many diseases of chronic nature  and especially  tuberculosis  where from a diminished amount of air going into the lungs  for want of capacity  and particularly for want of energy and inclination  to breathe in full or excess  the tissues cannot get clear of their  excrementitious material  and particularly the carbon  which must go to the  lungs  this voluntary effort can be made frequently during the day to  free the tissues and enable them to take nutritious material for their  restoration to their standard of health     air will be found of far more value than ever before as one of the greatest  of factors in nutrition  and which is as necessary as proper food  and  without which every organization must become diseased  and no true  assimilation can take place without a due amount of oxygen is hourly  and daily supplied by this extra aid of volition which has been so long  overlooked     the pure oxygen treatment has certainly performed many cures  yet  when  compared to the mechanical mixture and under the direct control of  the will  at all times and seasons  there is no danger from excessive  oxygenation as while oxygen is given  when every patient can be taught to  rely upon this great safety valve of nature  there will be less need for  medication  and the longevity of our race be increased with but little  dread by mankind for that terrible monster consumption  which seems to have  now unbounded control     when this theory i have here given you to night is fully comprehended by  the medical world and taught the public  together with the kind of foods  necessary for every one in their respective occupation  location  and  climate  we may expect a vast change in their physical condition and a hope  for the future which will brighten as time advances     i herewith attach the sphygmographic tracings made upon myself by another   showing the state of the pulse as compared with the progress of the  respiration       addenda     sphygmographic tracings of the pulse of the essayist  normal pulse     to the minute  ten seconds necessary for the slip to

so  the heart needing the  stimulus of the oxygen for full power     the following incident which has but very recently been made known  gives  most conclusive evidence of the truth of the theory and practice of rapid  breathing     a mexican went into the office of a dentist in one of the mexican cities to  have a tooth extracted by nitrous oxide gas     the dentist was not in  and the assistant was about to permit the patient  to leave without removing the tooth  when the wife of the proprietor  exclaimed that she had often assisted her husband in giving the gas  and  that she would do so in this instance if the assistant would agree to  extract the tooth  it was agreed  all being in readiness  the lady turned  on as she supposed the gas  and the mexican patient was ordered to breathe  as fast as possible to make sure of the full effect and no doubt of the  final success  the assistant was about to extract  but the wife insisted on  his breathing more rapidly  whereupon the patient was observed to become  very dark or purple in the face  which satisfied the lady that the  full effect was manifested  and the tooth was extracted  to the great  satisfaction of all concerned  while the gas was being taken by the mexican  the gasometer was noticed to rise higher and higher as the patient breathed  faster  and not to sink as was usual when the gas had been previously  administered  this led to an investigation of the reason of such an  anomalous result  when to their utter surprise they found the valve was so  turned by the wife that the mexican had been breathing nothing but common  air  and instead of exhaling into the surrounding air he violently forced  it into the gasometer with the nitrous oxide gas  causing it to rise and  not sink  which it should have done had the valve been properly turned by  the passage of gas into the lungs of the patient     no more beautiful and positive trial could happen  and might not again by  accident or inadvertence happen again in a lifetime                                                       tap for effervescing liquids       when a bottle of any liquor charged with carbonic acid under strong  pressure  such as champagne  sparkling cider  seltzer water  etc   is  uncorked  the contents often escape with considerable force  flow out  and  are nearly all lost  besides this  the noise made by the popping of the  cork is not agreeable to most persons  to remedy these inconveniences  there has been devised the simple apparatus which we represent in the  accompanying cut  taken from  la nature   the device consists of a hollow   sharp pointed tube  having one or two apertures in its upper extremity  which are kept closed by a hollow piston fitting in the interior of the  tube  this tube  or  tap   as it may be called  is supported on a firm base  to which is attached a draught tube  and a small lever for actuating the  piston  after the tap has been thrust through the cork of the bottle of  liquor the contents may be drawn in any quantity and as often as wanted by  simply pressing down the lever with the finger  this operation raises the  piston so that its apertures correspond with those in the sides of the top   and the liquid thus finds access to the draught tube through the interior  of the piston  by removing the pressure the piston descends and thus closes  the vents  by means of this apparatus  then  the contents of any bottle of  effervescing liquids may be as easily drawn off as are those contained in  the ordinary siphon bottles in use      illustration  tap for effervescing liquids

march last the  author  at the suggestion of dr  debus  undertook an investigation of  pentathionic acid  the existence of which has been denied  the analyses  of the liquid obtained by wackenroder and others  by passing sulphureted  hydrogen and sulphur dioxide through water  are based on the assumption  that only one acid is present in the solution  and consequently do not  establish the existence of pentathionic acid  as  for example  a mixture of  one molecule of h  s  o   and one molecule of h  s  o   would give the same  analytical results as h  s  o    moreover  no salt of pentathionic acid has  been prepared in a pure state  the author has succeeded in preparing barium  pentathionate thus  a wackenroder solution was about half neutralized with  barium hydrate  filtered  and the clear solution evaporated  in vacuo  over  sulphuric acid  after eighteen days crystals  which proved to be barium  pentathionate     molecules of water  formed  these crystals were  separated  and the liquid further evaporated  when a second crop was  obtained intermediate in composition between the tetra and pentathionate   these were separated  and the mother liquor on standing deposited some  oblong rectangular crystals  these on analysis proved to consist of baric  pentathionate with three molecules of water  this salt dissolves readily in  cold water  the solution is decomposed by strong potassic hydrate  baric  sulphite  hyposulphites  and sulphur being formed  by a similar method of  procedure the author obtained potassium pentathionate  anhydrous  and with  one or two molecules of water  the author promises some further results  with some other salts of the higher thionates     the president said that the society had to thank the author for a very  complete research on the subject of pentathionic acid  he  however  begged  to differ from him as to his statements concerning the researches of  messrs  takamatsu and smith  in his opinion these authors had proved the  existence of pentathionic acid  he hoped that the crystals  which were very  fine  would be measured     dr  debus said that no one had previously been able to make the salts of  pentathionic acid  and expressed his sense of the great merit due to the  author for his perseverance and success  the paper opened up some highly  interesting theoretical speculations as to the existence of hexathionic  acid  if potassium tetrathionate was dissolved in water it could be  re crystallized  but potassium pentathionate under similar circumstances  splits into sulphur and tetrathionate  but a mixture of tetrathionate and  pentathionate can be re crystallized  it seemed as if the sulphur when  eliminated from the pentathionate combined with the tetrathionate     dr  dupre asked dr  debus how it was that a molecule of pentathionate could  be re crystallized  whereas two molecules of pentathionate  which should   when half decomposed  furnish a molecule of tetra and a molecule of  pentathionate  could not     dr  armstrong then read a   preliminary note on some hydrocarbons from  rosin spirit    after giving an account of our knowledge of rosin spirit   the author described the result of the examination of the mixture of  hydrocarbons remaining after heating it with sulphuric acid and diluting  with half its volume of water and steam distilling  thus treated rosin  spirit furnishes about one fourth of its volume of a colorless mobile  liquid  which after long continued fractional distillation is resolved into  a variety of fractions boiling at temperatures from    deg  to over     deg  each  of the fractions was treated with concentrated sulphuric acid  and the  undissolved portions were then re fractionated  the hydrocarbons dissolved  by the acid were recovered by heating under pressure with hydrochloric  acid  besides a cymene and a toluene  which have already been shown to  exist in rosin spirit  metaxylene was found to be present  the hydrocarbons  insoluble in sulphuric acid are  apparently  all members of the c nh   n   series  they are not  however  true homologues of ethylene  but hexhydrides  of hydrocarbons of the benzene series  hexhydro toluene and probably  hex hydrometaxylene are present besides the hydrocarbon  c   h     but it  is doubtful if an intermediate term is also present  it is by no means  improbable  however  that these hydrocarbons are  at least in part   products of the action of the sulphuric acid  cahours and kraemer s and  godzki s observations on the higher fractions of crude wood spirit  in  fact  furnish a precedent for this view  referring to the results obtained  by anderson  tilden  and renard  the author suggests that rosin spirit  perhaps contains hydrides intermediate in composition between those of  the c nh   n    and c nh   n  series  also derived like the latter from  hydrocarbons of the benzene series  finally  dr armstrong mentioned that  the volatile portion of the distillate from the non volatile product of the  oxidation of oil of turpentine in moist air furnishes ordinary cymene when  treated in the manner above described  the fact that rosin spirit yields a  different cymene is  he considers  an argument against the view which  has more than once been put forward  that rosin is directly derived from  terpene  probably resin and turpentine  though genetically related  are  products of distinct processes     the next paper was   on the determination of the relative weight of single  molecules    by e  vogel  of san francisco  this paper  which was taken as  read  consists of a lengthy theoretical disquisition  in which the author  maintains the following propositions  that the combining weights of all  elements are one third of their present values  the assumption that equal  volumes of gases contain equal numbers of molecules does not hold good   that the present theory of valency is not supported by chemical facts  and  that its elimination would be no small gain for chemistry in freeing it  of an element full of mystery  uncertainty  and complication  that the  distinction between atoms and molecules will no longer be necessary   that the facts of specific heat do not lend any support to the theory of  valency  the paper concludes as follows   the cause of chemical action is  undoubtedly atmospheric pressure  which under ordinary conditions is equal  to the weight of    cubic centimeters of mercury  one of which equals        mercury molecules  so that the whole pressure equals     mercury molecules   this force  which with regard to its chemical effect on molecules can be  multiplied by means of heat  is amply sufficient to bring about the highest  degree of molecular specific gravity by the reduction of the molecular  volumes  to it all molecules are exposed and subjected unalterably  and  if not accepted as the cause of chemical action  its influence has to be  eliminated to allow the introduction and display of other forces      the next communication was   on the synthetical production of ammonia   by the combination of hydrogen and nitrogen in presence of heated spongy  platinum  preliminary notice     by g  s  johnson  some experiments  in  which pure nitrogen was passed over heated copper containing occluded  hydrogen  suggested to the author the possibility of the formation of  ammonia  only minute traces were formed  on passing  however  a mixture of  pure nitrogen  from ammonium nitrite  and hydrogen over spongy platinum at  a low red heat  abundant evidence was obtained of the synthesis of ammonia   the gases were passed  before entering the tube containing the platinum   through a potash bulb containing nessler reagent  which remained colorless   on the contrary  the gas issuing from the platinum rapidly turned nessler  reagent brown  and in a few minutes turned faintly acid litmus solution  blue  the odor of nh   was also perceptible  in one experiment         gramme of ammonia was formed in two hours and a half  the author promises  further experiment as to the effect of temperature  rate of the gaseous  current  and substitution of palladium for platinum  the author synthesized  some ammonia before the society with complete success     the president referred to the synthesis of ammonia from its elements  recently effected by donkin  and remarked that apparently the ammonia was  formed in much larger quantities by the process proposed by the author of  the present paper     mr  warington suggested that some hcl gas should be simultaneously passed  with the nitrogen and hydrogen  and that the temperature of the spongy  platinum should be kept just below the temperature at which nh    dissociates  in order to improve the yield of nh         on the oxidation of organic matter in water   by a  downes  the author  considers that the mere presence of oxygen in contact with the organic  matter has but little oxidizing action unless lowly organisms  as bacteria   etc  be simultaneously present  sunlight has apparently considerable  effect in promoting the oxidation of organic matter  the author quotes the  following experiment  a sample of river water was filtered through paper   it required per        parts       oxygen as permanganate  a second portion  was placed in a flask plugged with cotton wool  and exposed to sunlight for  a week  it then required        a third portion after a week  but excluded  from light  required        a fourth was boiled for five minutes  plugged   and then exposed to sunlight for a week  required        in a second  experiment with well water a similar result was obtained  more organic  matter was oxidized when the organisms had been killed by the addition of  sulphuric acid than when the original water was allowed to stand for an  equal length of time  the author also discusses the statement made by dr   frankland that there is less ground for assuming that the organized and  living matter of sewage is oxidized in a flow of twelve miles of a river  than for assuming that dead organic matter is oxidized in a similar  flow    chem  news                                                        rose oil  or otto of roses     by charles g  warnford lock       this celebrated perfume is the volatile essential oil distilled from the  flowers of some varieties of rose  the botany of roses appears to be in a  transition and somewhat unsatisfactory state  thus the otto yielding rose  is variously styled  rosa damascena  r  sempervirens  r  moschata  r   gallica  r  centifolia  r  provincialis   it is pretty generally agreed  that the kind grown for its otto in bulgaria in the damask rose   r   damascena    a variety induced by long cultivation  as it is not to be  found wild  it forms a bush  usually three to four feet  but sometimes six  feet high  its flowers are of moderate size  semi double  and arranged  several on a branch  though not in clusters or bunches  in color  they are  mostly light red  some few are white  and said to be less productive of  otto     the utilization of the delicious perfume of the rose was attempted  with  more or less success  long prior to the comparatively modern process of  distilling its essential oil  the early methods chiefly in vogue were the  distillation of rose water  and the infusion of roses in olive oil  the  latter flourishing in europe generally down to the last century  and  surviving at the present day in the south of france  the butyraceous oil  produced by the distillation of roses for making rose water in this country  is valueless as a perfume  and the real otto was scarcely known in british  commerce before the present century     the profitable cultivation of roses for the preparation of otto is limited  chiefly by climatic conditions  the odoriferous constitutent of the otto  is a liquid containing oxygen  the solid hydrocarbon or stearoptene  with  which it is combined  being absolutely devoid of perfume  the proportion  which this inodorous solid constituents bears to the liquid perfume  increases with the unsuitability of the climate  varying from about    per  cent  in bulgarian oil  to    and even    per cent  in rose oils distilled  in france and england  this increase in the proportion of stearoptene is  also shown by the progressively heightened fusing point of rose oils from  different sources  thus  while bulgarian oil fuses at about    deg  to    deg   fahr   an indian sample required    deg  fahr   one from the south of france      deg  to    deg  fahr   one from paris     deg  fahr   and one obtained in making  rose water in london     deg  to       deg  fahr  even in the bulgarian oil  a  notable difference is observed between that produced on the hills and that  from the lowlands     it is  therefore  not surprising that the culture of roses  and extraction  of their perfume  should have originated in the east  persia produced  rose water at an early date  and the town of nisibin  north west of mosul   was famous for it in the   th century  shiraz  in the   th century   prepared both rose water and otto  for export to other parts of persia  as  well as all over india  the perso indian trade in rose oil  which continued  to possess considerable importance in the third quarter of the   th  century  is declining  and has nearly disappeared  but the shipments of  rose water still maintain a respectable figure  the value  in rupees  of  the exports of rose water from bushire in       were        to india         to java      to aden and the red sea        to muscat and dependencies       to arab coast of persian gulf and bahrein      to persian coast and mekran   and       to zanzibar  similar statistics relating to lingah  in the same  year  show  otto      to arab coast of persian gulf  and bahrein  and      to persian coast and mekran  and bahrein  persian otto        to koweit   busrah  and bagdad  rose water      to arab coast of persian gulf  and        to koweit  busrah  and bagdad     india itself has a considerable area devoted to rose gardens  as at  ghazipur  lahore  amritzur  and other places  the kind of rose being  r   damascena   according to brandis  both rose water and otto are produced   the flowers are distilled with double their weight of water in clay stills   the rose water   goolabi pani   thus obtained is placed in shallow vessels   covered with moist muslin to keep out dust and flies  and exposed all night  to the cool air  or fanned  in the morning  the film of oil  which has  collected on the top  is skimmed off by a feather  and transferred to a  small phial  this is repeated for several nights  till almost the whole of  the oil has separated  the quantity of the product varies much  and three  different authorities give the following figures    a          roses to  make   rupee s weight      gr   of otto    b           to make the same  weight    c         roses afford less than   gr  of otto  the color ranges  from green to bright amber  and reddish  the oil  otto  is the most  carefully bottled  the receptacles are hermetically sealed with wax  and  exposed to the full glare of the sun for several days  rose water deprived  of otto is esteemed much inferior to that which has not been so treated   when bottled  it is also exposed to the sun for a fortnight at least     the mediterranean countries of africa enter but feebly into this industry   and it is a little remarkable that the french have not cultivated it in  algeria  egypt s demand for rose water and rose vinegar is supplied from  medinet fayum  south west of cairo  tunis has also some local reputation  for similar products  von maltzan says that the rose there grown for otto  is the dog rose   r  canina    and that it is extremely fragrant     lb   of the flower yielding about   dr  of otto  genoa occasionally imports a  little of this product  which is of excellent quality  in the south of  france rose gardens occupy a large share of attention  about grasse   cannes  and nice  they chiefly produce rose water  much of which is  exported to england  the essence  otto  obtained by the distillation of the  provence rose   r  provincialis   has a characteristic perfume  arising  it  is believed  from the bees transporting the pollen of the orange flowers  into the petals of the roses  the french otto is richer in stearoptene than  the turkish  nine grammes crystallizing in a liter       pint  of alcohol at  the same temperature as    grammes of the turkish  the best preparations  are made at cannes and grasse  the flowers are not there treated for the  otto  but are submitted to a process of maceration in fat or oil  ten  kilos  of roses being required to impregnate one kilo  of fat  the price of  the roses varies from   c  to   fr    c  per kilo     but the one commercially important source of otto of roses is a  circumscribed patch of ancient thrace or modern bulgaria  stretching along  the southern slopes of the central balkans  and approximately included  between the   th and   th degrees of east longitude  and the   d and   d of  north latitude  the chief rose growing districts are philippopoli  chirpan   giopcu  karadshah dagh  kojun tepe  eski sara  jeni sara  bazardshik  and  the center and headquarters of the industry  kazanlik  kisanlik    situated in a beautiful undulating plain  in the valley of the tunja  the  productiveness of the last mentioned district may be judged from the fact  that  of the     thracian localities carrying on the preparation of otto in        they numbered     in          belong to it  the only place affording  otto on the northern side of the balkans is travina  the geological  formation throughout is syenite  the decomposition of which has provided a  soil so fertile as to need but little manuring  the vegetation  according  to baur  indicates a climate differing but slightly from that of the black  forest  the average summer temperatures being stated at    deg  fahr  at noon   and    deg  fahr  in the evening  the rose bushes nourish best and live longest  on sandy  sun exposed  south and south east aspect  slopes  the flowers  produced by those growing on inclined ground are dearer and more esteemed  than any raised on level land  being    per cent  richer in oil  and that  of a stronger quality  this proves the advantage of thorough drainage  on  the other hand  plantations at high altitudes yield less oil  which is of a  character that readily congeals  from an insufficiency of summer heat  the  districts lying adjacent to and in the mountains are sometimes visited  by hard frosts  which destroy or greatly reduce the crop  floods also  occasionally do considerable damage  the bushes are attacked at intervals  and in patches by a blight similar to that which injures the vines of the  country     the bushes are planted in hedge like rows in gardens and fields  at  convenient distances apart  for the gathering of the crop  they are seldom  manured  the planting takes place in spring and autumn  the flowers attain  perfection in april and may  and the harvest lasts from may till the  beginning of june  the expanded flowers are gathered before sunrise   often with the calyx attached  such as are not required for immediate  distillation are spread out in cellars  but all are treated within the day  on which they are plucked  baur states that  if the buds develop slowly   by reason of cool damp weather  and are not much exposed to sun heat  when  about to be collected  a rich yield of otto  having a low solidifying  point  is the result  whereas  should the sky be clear and the temperature  high at or shortly before the time of gathering  the product is diminished  and is more easily congealable  hanbury  on the contrary  when distilling  roses in london  noticed that when they had been collected on fine dry  days the rose water had most volatile oil floating upon it  and that  when  gathered in cool rainy weather  little or no volatile oil separated     the flowers are not salted  nor subjected to any other treatment  before  being conveyed in baskets  on the heads of men and women and backs of  animals  to the distilling apparatus  this consists of a tinned copper  still  erected on a semicircle of bricks  and heated by a wood fire  from  the top passes a straight tin pipe  which obliquely traverses a tub kept  constantly filled with cold water  by a spout  from some convenient  rivulet  and constitutes the condenser  several such stills are usually  placed together  often beneath the shade of a large tree  the still is  charged with    to    lb  of roses  not previously deprived of their  calyces  and double the volume of spring water  the distillation is carried  on for about l    hours  the result being simply a very oily rose water    ghyul suyu    the exhausted flowers are removed from the still  and the  decoction is used for the next distillation  instead of fresh water   the first distillates from each apparatus are mixed and distilled by  themselves  one sixth being drawn off  the residue replaces spring water  for subsequent operations  the distillate is received in long necked  bottles  holding about      gallon  it is kept in them for a day or two  at a  temperature exceeding    deg  fahr   by which time most of the oil  fluid  and bright  will have reached the surface  it is skimmed off by a small   long handled  fine orificed tin funnel  and is then ready for sale  the  last run rose water is extremely fragrant  and is much prized locally for  culinary and medicinal purposes  the quantity and quality of the otto are  much influenced by the character of the water used in distilling  when  hard spring water is employed  the otto is rich in stearoptene  but less  transparent and fragrant  the average quantity of the product is estimated  by baur at       to       per cent   another authority says that        kilos  of roses give   kilo  of oil     pure otto  carefully distilled  is at first colorless  but speedily becomes  yellowish  its specific gravity is      at      deg  fahr   its boiling point  is     deg  fahr   it solidifies at      deg  to      deg  fahr   or still higher  it  is soluble in absolute alcohol  and in acetic acid  the most usual and  reliable tests of the quality of an otto are     its odor      its  congealing point      its crystallization  the odor can be judged only  after long experience  a good oil should congeal well in five minutes at  a temperature of      deg  fahr   fraudulent additions lower the congealing  point  the crystals of rose stearoptene are light  feathery  shining  plates  filling the whole liquid  almost the only material used for  artificially heightening the apparent proportion of stearoptene is said to  be spermaceti  which is easily recognizable from its liability to settle  down in a solid cake  and from its melting at     deg  fahr   whereas  stearoptene fuses at      deg  fahr  possibly paraffin wax would more easily  escape detection     the adulterations by means of other essential oils are much more difficult  of discovery  and much more general  in fact  it is said that none of the  bulgarian otto is completely free from this kind of sophistication  the  oils employed for the purpose are certain of the grass oils   andropogon   and  cymbopogon spp    notably that afforded by  andropogon  schoenanthus   called  idris yaghi  by the turks  and commonly known to europeans as   geranium oil   though quite distinct from true geranium oil  the addition  is generally made by sprinkling it upon the rose leaves before distilling   it is largely produced in the neighborhood of delhi  and exported to  turkey by way of arabia  it is sold by arabs in constantinople in large  bladder shaped tinned copper vessels  holding about     lb  as it is  usually itself adulterated with some fatty oil  it needs to undergo  purification before use  this is effected in the following manner  the  crude oil is repeatedly shaken up with water acidulated with lemon juice   from which it is poured off after standing for a day  the washed oil  is placed in shallow saucers  well exposed to sun and air  by which it  gradually loses its objectionable odor  spring and early summer are the  best seasons for the operation  which occupies two to four weeks  according  to the state of the weather and the quality of the oil  the general  characters of this oil are so similar to those of otto of roses  even the  odor bearing a distant resemblance  that their discrimination when mixed is  a matter of practical impossibility  the ratio of the adulteration varies  from a small figure up to    or    per cent  the only safeguard against  deception is to pay a fair price  and to deal with firms of good repute   such as messrs  papasoglu  manoglu   son  ihmsen   co   and holstein   co   in constantinople     the otto is put up in squat shaped flasks of tinned copper  called   kunkumas   holding from   to    lb   and sewn up in white woolen cloths   usually their contents are transferred at constantinople into small gilded  bottles of german manufacture for export  the bulgarian otto harvest   during the five years          was reckoned to average somewhat below           meticals  miskals   or  midkals   of about   dwt  troy   or        lb  av   that of       which was good  was estimated at          value  about l         the harvest of      realized more than l           though  the roses themselves

thoughts away   than the soft rustle of a maiden s gown  fanning away the dandelion s down   than the light music of her nimble toes  patting against the sorrel as she goes   how she would start  and blush  thus to be caught  playing in all her innocence of thought   o let me lead her gently o er the brook   watch her half smiling lips  and downward look   o let me for one moment touch her wrist

hover till it dozes   o er which it well might take a pleasant sleep   but that  tis ever startled by the leap  of buds into ripe flowers  or by the flitting  of diverse moths  that aye their rest are

light   in the calm grandeur of a sober line   we see the waving of the mountain pine   and when a tale is beautifully staid   we feel the safety of a hawthorn glade   when it is moving on luxurious wings   the soul is lost in pleasant smotherings   fair dewy roses brush against our faces   and flowering laurels spring from diamond vases   o er head we see the jasmine and sweet briar   and bloomy grapes laughing from green attire   while at our feet  the voice of crystal bubbles  charms us at once away from all our troubles   so that we feel uplifted from the world   walking upon the white clouds wreath d and curl d   so felt he  who first told  how psyche went  on the smooth wind to realms of wonderment   what psyche felt  and love  when their full lips  first touch d  what amorous  and fondling nips  they gave each other s cheeks  with all their sighs   and how they kist each other s tremulous eyes   the silver lamp   the ravishment   the wonder    the darkness   loneliness   the fearful thunder   their woes gone by  and both to heaven upflown   to bow for gratitude before jove s throne   so did he feel  who pull d the boughs aside   that we might look into a forest wide   to catch a glimpse of fawns  and dryades  coming with softest rustle through the trees   and garlands woven of flowers wild  and sweet   upheld on ivory wrists  or sporting feet   telling us how fair  trembling syrinx fled  arcadian pan  with such a fearful dread   poor nymph   poor pan   how he did weep to find   nought but a lovely sighing of the wind  along the reedy stream  a half heard strain   full of sweet desolation  balmy pain     what first inspired a bard of old to sing  narcissus pining o er the untainted spring   in some delicious ramble  he had found  a little space  with boughs all woven round   and in the midst of all  a clearer pool  than e er reflected in its pleasant cool   the blue sky here  and there  serenely peeping  through tendril wreaths fantastically creeping   and on the bank a lonely flower he spied   a meek and forlorn flower  with naught of pride   drooping its beauty o er the watery clearness   to woo its own sad image into nearness   deaf to light zephyrus it would not move   but still would seem to droop  to pine  to love   so while the poet stood in this sweet spot   some fainter gleamings o er his fancy shot   nor was it long ere he had told the tale  of young narcissus  and sad echo s bale     where had he been  from whose warm head out flew  that sweetest of all songs  that ever new   that aye refreshing  pure deliciousness   coming ever to bless  the wanderer by moonlight  to him bringing  shapes from the invisible world  unearthly singing  from out the middle air  from flowery nests   and from the pillowy silkiness that rests  full in the speculation of the stars   ah  surely he had burst our mortal bars   into some wond rous region he had gone   to search for thee  divine endymion     he was a poet  sure a lover too   who stood on latmus  top  what time there blew  soft breezes from the myrtle vale below   and brought in faintness solemn  sweet  and slow  a hymn from dian s temple  while upswelling   the incense went to her own starry dwelling   but though her face was clear as infant s eyes   though she stood smiling o er the sacrifice   the poet wept at her so piteous fate   wept that such beauty should be desolate   so in fine wrath some golden sounds he won   and gave meek cynthia her endymion     queen of the wide air  thou most lovely queen  of all the brightness that mine eyes have seen   as thou exceedest all things in thy shine   so every tale  does this sweet tale of thine   o for three words of honey  that i might  tell but one wonder of thy bridal night     where distant ships do seem to show their keels   phoebus awhile delayed his mighty wheels   and turned to smile upon thy bashful eyes   ere he his unseen pomp would solemnize   the evening weather was so bright  and clear   that men of health were of unusual cheer   stepping like homer at the trumpet s call   or young apollo on the pedestal   and lovely women were as fair and warm   as venus looking sideways in alarm   the breezes were ethereal  and pure   and crept through half closed lattices to cure  the languid sick  it cool d their fever d sleep   and soothed them into slumbers full and deep   soon they awoke clear eyed  nor burnt with thirsting   nor with hot fingers  nor with temples bursting   and springing up  they met the wond ring sight  of their dear friends  nigh foolish with delight   who feel their arms  and breasts  and kiss and stare   and on their placid foreheads part the hair   young men  and maidens at each other gaz d  with hands held back  and motionless  amaz d  to see the brightness in each others  eyes   and so they stood  fill d with a sweet surprise   until their tongues were loos d in poesy   therefore no lover did of anguish die   but the soft numbers  in that moment spoken   made silken ties  that never may be broken   cynthia  i cannot tell the greater blisses   that follow d thine  and thy dear shepherd s kisses   was there a poet born   but now no more   my wand ring spirit must no further soar             specimen of an induction to a poem       lo  i must tell a tale of chivalry   for large white plumes are dancing in mine eye   not like the formal crest of latter days   but bending in a thousand graceful ways   so graceful  that it seems no mortal hand   or e en the touch of archimago s wand   could charm them into such an attitude   we must think rather  that in playful mood   some mountain breeze had turned its chief delight   to show this wonder of its gentle might   lo  i must tell a tale of chivalry   for while i muse  the lance points slantingly  athwart the morning air  some lady sweet   who cannot feel for cold her tender feet   from the worn top of some old battlement  hails it with tears  her stout defender sent   and from her own pure self no joy dissembling   wraps round her ample robe with happy trembling   sometimes  when the good knight his rest would take   it is reflected  clearly  in a lake   with the young ashen boughs   gainst which it rests   and th  half seen mossiness of linnets  nests   ah  shall i ever tell its cruelty   when the fire flashes from a warrior s eye   and his tremendous hand is grasping it   and his dark brow for very wrath is knit   or when his spirit  with more calm intent   leaps to the honors of a tournament   and makes the gazers round about the ring  stare at the grandeur of the balancing   no  no  this is far off   then how shall i  revive the dying tones of minstrelsy   which linger yet about lone gothic arches   in dark green ivy  and among wild larches   how sing the splendour of the revelries   when buts of wine are drunk off to the lees   and that bright lance  against the fretted wall   beneath the shade of stately banneral   is slung with shining cuirass  sword  and shield   where ye may see a spur in bloody field   light footed damsels move with gentle paces  round the wide hall  and show their happy faces   or stand in courtly talk by fives and sevens   like those fair stars that twinkle in the heavens   yet must i tell a tale of chivalry   or wherefore comes that knight so proudly by   wherefore more proudly does the gentle knight   rein in

forehead to the cool blue sky   and smiles at the far clearness all around   until his heart is well nigh over wound   and turns for calmness to the pleasant green  of easy slopes  and shadowy trees that lean  so elegantly o er the waters  brim  and show their blossoms trim   scarce can his clear and nimble eye sight follow  the freaks  and dartings of the black wing d swallow   delighting much  to see it half at rest   dip so refreshingly its wings  and breast   gainst the smooth surface  and to mark anon   the widening circles into nothing gone     and now the sharp keel of his little boat  comes up with ripple  and with easy float   and glides into a bed of water lillies   broad leav d are they and their white canopies  are upward turn d to catch the heavens  dew   near to a little island s point they grew   whence calidore might have the goodliest view  of this sweet spot of earth  the bowery shore  went off in gentle windings to the hoar  and light blue mountains  but no breathing man  with a warm heart  and eye prepared to scan  nature s clear beauty  could pass lightly by  objects that look d out so invitingly  on either side  these  gentle calidore  greeted  as he had known them long before     the sidelong view of swelling leafiness   which the glad setting sun  in gold doth dress   whence ever  and anon the jay outsprings   and scales upon the beauty of its wings     the lonely turret  shatter d  and outworn   stands venerably proud  too proud to mourn  its long lost grandeur  fir trees grow around   aye dropping their hard fruit upon the ground     the

silvery stems  of delicate birch trees  or long grass which hems  a little brook  the youth had long been viewing  these pleasant things  and heaven was bedewing  the mountain flowers  when his glad senses caught  a trumpet s silver voice  ah  it was fraught  with many joys for him  the warder s ken  had found white coursers prancing in the glen   friends very dear to him he soon will see   so pushes off his boat most eagerly   and soon upon the lake he skims along   deaf to the nightingale s first under song   nor minds he the white swans that dream so sweetly   his spirit flies before him so completely     and now he turns a jutting point of land   whence may be seen the castle gloomy  and grand   nor will a bee buzz round two swelling peaches   before the point of his light shallop reaches  those marble steps that through the water dip   now over them he goes with hasty trip   and scarcely stays to ope the folding doors   anon he leaps along the oaken floors  of halls and corridors     delicious sounds  those little bright eyed things  that float about the air on azure wings   had been less heartfelt by him than the clang  of clattering hoofs  into the court he sprang   just as two noble steeds  and palfreys twain   were slanting out their necks with loosened rein   while from beneath the threat ning portcullis  they brought their happy burthens  what a kiss   what gentle squeeze he gave each lady s hand   how tremblingly their delicate ancles spann d   into how sweet a trance his soul was gone   while whisperings of affection  made him delay to let their tender feet  come to the earth  with an incline so sweet  from their low palfreys o er his neck they bent   and whether there were tears of languishment   or that the evening dew had pearl d their tresses   he feels a moisture on his cheek  and blesses  with lips that tremble  and with glistening eye  all the soft luxury  that nestled in his arms  a dimpled hand   fair as some wonder out of fairy land   hung from his shoulder like the drooping flowers  of whitest cassia  fresh from summer showers   and this he fondled with his happy cheek  as if for joy he would no further seek   when the kind voice of good sir clerimond  came to his ear  like something from beyond  his present being  so he gently drew  his warm arms  thrilling now with pulses new   from their sweet thrall  and forward gently bending   thank d heaven that his joy was never ending   while  gainst his forehead he devoutly press d  a hand heaven made to succour the distress d   a hand that from the world s bleak promontory  had lifted calidore for deeds of glory     amid the pages  and the torches  glare   there stood a knight  patting the flowing hair  of his proud horse s mane  he was withal  a man of elegance  and stature tall   so that the waving of his plumes would be  high as the berries of a wild ash tree   or as the winged cap of mercury   his armour was so dexterously wrought  in shape  that sure no living man had thought  it hard  and heavy steel  but that indeed  it was some glorious form  some splendid weed   in which a spirit new come from the skies  might live  and show itself to human eyes    tis the far fam d  the brave sir gondibert   said the good man to calidore alert   while the young warrior with a step of grace  came up   a courtly smile upon his face   and mailed hand held out  ready to greet  the large eyed wonder  and ambitious heat  of the aspiring boy  who as he led  those smiling ladies  often turned his head  to admire the visor arched so gracefully  over a knightly

and airy feel  of a light mantle  and while clerimond  is looking round about him with a fond   and placid eye  young calidore is burning  to hear of knightly deeds  and gallant spurning  of all unworthiness  and how the strong of arm  kept off dismay  and terror  and alarm  from lovely woman  while brimful of this   he gave each damsel s hand so warm a kiss   and had such manly ardour in his

their wit employ d  to raise a trophy to the drama s muses   the thought of this great partnership diffuses  over the genius loving heart  a feeling  of all that s high  and great  and good  and healing     too partial friend  fain would i follow thee  past each horizon of fine poesy   fain would i echo back each pleasant note  as o er sicilian seas  clear anthems float   mong the light skimming gondolas far parted   just when the sun his farewell beam has darted   but  tis impossible  far different cares  beckon me sternly from soft  lydian airs    and hold my faculties so long in thrall   that i am oft in doubt whether at all  i shall again see phoebus in the morning   or flush d aurora in the roseate dawning   or a white naiad in a rippling stream   or a rapt seraph in a moonlight beam   or again witness what with thee i ve seen   the dew by fairy feet swept from the green   after a night of some quaint jubilee  which every elf and fay had come to see   when bright processions took their airy march  beneath the curved moon s triumphal arch     but might i now each passing moment give  to the coy muse  with me she would not live  in this dark city  nor would condescend   mid contradictions her delights to lend   should e er the fine eyed maid to me be kind   ah  surely it must be whene er i find  some flowery spot  sequester d  wild  romantic   that often must have seen a poet frantic   where oaks  that erst the druid knew  are growing   and flowers  the glory of one day  are blowing   where the dark leav d laburnum s drooping clusters  reflect athwart the stream their yellow lustres   and intertwined the cassia s arms unite   with its own drooping buds  but very white   where on one side are covert branches hung    mong which the nightingales have always sung  in leafy quiet  where to pry  aloof   atween the pillars of the sylvan roof   would be to find where violet beds were nestling   and where the bee with cowslip bells was wrestling   there must be too a ruin dark  and gloomy   to say  joy not too much in all that s bloomy      yet this is vain  o mathew lend thy aid  to find a place where i may greet the maid    where we may soft humanity put on   and sit  and rhyme and think on chatterton   and that warm hearted shakspeare sent to meet him  four laurell d spirits  heaven ward to intreat him   with reverence would we speak of all the sages  who have left streaks of light athwart their ages   and thou shouldst moralize on milton s blindness   and mourn the fearful dearth of human kindness  to those who strove with the bright golden wing  of genius  to flap away each sting  thrown by the pitiless world  we next could tell  of those who in the cause of freedom fell   of our own alfred  of helvetian tell   of him whose name to ev ry heart s a solace   high minded and unbending william wallace   while to the rugged north our musing turns  we well might drop a tear for him  and burns     felton  without incitements such as these   how vain for me the niggard muse to tease   for thee  she will thy every dwelling grace   and make  a sun shine in a shady place    for thou wast once a flowret blooming wild   close to the source  bright  pure  and undefil d   whence gush the streams of song  in happy hour  came chaste diana from her shady bower   just as the sun was from the east uprising   and  as

into a fish of gold  apollo chang d thee  how thou next didst seem  a black eyed swan upon the widening stream   and when thou first didst in that mirror trace  the placid features of a human face   that thou hast never told thy travels strange   and all the wonders of the mazy range  o er pebbly crystal  and o er golden sands   kissing thy daily food from naiad s pearly hands      november                  to my brother george     full many a dreary hour have i past   my brain bewilder d  and my mind o ercast  with heaviness  in seasons when i ve thought  no spherey strains by me could e er be caught  from the blue dome  though i to dimness gaze  on the far depth where sheeted lightning plays   or  on the wavy grass outstretch d supinely   pry  mong the stars  to strive to think divinely   that i should never hear apollo s song   though feathery clouds were floating all along  the purple west  and  two bright streaks between   the golden lyre itself were dimly seen   that the still murmur of the honey bee  would never teach a rural song to me   that the bright glance from beauty s eyelids slanting  would never make a lay of mine enchanting   or warm my breast with ardour to unfold  some tale of love and arms in time of old     but there are times  when those that love the bay   fly from all sorrowing far  far away   a sudden glow comes on them  nought they see  in water  earth  or air  but poesy   it has been said  dear george  and true i hold it    for knightly spenser to libertas told it    that when a poet is in such a trance   in air he sees white coursers paw  and prance   bestridden of gay knights  in gay apparel   who at each other tilt in playful quarrel   and what we  ignorantly  sheet lightning call   is the swift opening of their wide portal   when the bright warder blows his trumpet clear   whose tones reach nought on earth but poet s ear   when these enchanted portals open wide   and through the light the horsemen swiftly glide   the poet s eye can reach those golden halls   and view the glory of their festivals   their ladies fair  that in the distance seem  fit for the silv ring of a seraph s dream   their rich brimm d goblets  that incessant run  like the bright spots that move about the sun   and  when upheld  the wine from each bright jar  pours with the lustre of a falling star   yet further off  are dimly seen their bowers   of which  no mortal eye can reach the flowers   and  tis right just  for well apollo knows   twould make the poet quarrel with the rose   all that s reveal d from that far seat of blisses   is  the clear fountains  interchanging kisses   as gracefully descending  light and thin   like silver streaks across a dolphin s fin   when he upswimmeth from the coral caves   and sports with half his tail above the waves     these wonders strange be sees  and many more   whose head is pregnant with poetic lore   should he upon an evening ramble fare  with forehead to the soothing breezes bare   would he naught see but the dark  silent blue  with all its diamonds trembling through and through   or the coy moon  when in the waviness  of whitest clouds she does her beauty dress   and staidly paces higher up  and higher   like a sweet nun in holy day attire   ah  yes  much more would start into his sight    the revelries  and mysteries of night   and should i ever see them  i will tell you  such tales as needs must with amazement spell you     these are the living pleasures of the bard   but richer far posterity s award   what does he murmur with his latest breath   while his proud eye looks

pillows   wreather of poppy buds  and weeping willows   silent entangler of a beauty s tresses   most happy listener  when the morning blesses  thee for enlivening all the cheerful eyes  that glance so brightly at the new sun rise     but what is higher beyond thought than thee   fresher than berries of a mountain tree   more strange  more beautiful  more smooth  more regal   than wings of swans  than doves  than dim seen eagle   what is it  and to what shall i compare it   it has a glory  and nought else can share it   the thought thereof is awful  sweet  and holy   chacing away all worldliness and folly   coming sometimes like fearful claps of thunder   or the low rumblings earth s regions under   and sometimes like a gentle whispering  of all the secrets of some wond rous thing  that breathes about us in the vacant air   so that we look around with prying stare   perhaps to see shapes of light  aerial lymning   and catch soft floatings from a faint heard hymning   to see the laurel wreath  on high suspended   that is to crown our name when life is ended   sometimes it gives a glory to the voice   and from the heart up springs  rejoice  rejoice   sounds which will reach the framer of all things   and die away in ardent mutterings     no one who once the glorious sun has seen   and all the clouds  and felt his bosom clean  for his great maker s presence  but must know  what  tis i mean  and feel his being glow   therefore no insult will i give his spirit   by telling what he sees from native merit     o poesy  for thee i hold my pen  that am not yet a glorious denizen  of thy wide heaven  should i rather kneel  upon some mountain top until i feel  a glowing splendour round about me hung   and echo back the voice of thine own tongue   o poesy  for thee i grasp my pen  that am not yet a glorious denizen  of thy wide heaven  yet  to my ardent prayer   yield from thy sanctuary some clear air   smoothed for intoxication by the breath  of flowering bays  that i may die a death  of luxury  and my young spirit follow  the morning sun beams to the great apollo  like a fresh sacrifice  or  if i can bear  the o erwhelming sweets   twill bring to me the fair  visions of all places  a bowery nook  will be elysium  an eternal book  whence i may copy many a lovely saying  about the leaves  and flowers  about the playing  of nymphs in woods  and fountains  and the shade  keeping a silence round a sleeping maid   and many a verse from so strange influence  that we must ever wonder how  and whence  it came  also imaginings will hover  round my fire side  and haply there discover  vistas of solemn beauty  where i d wander  in happy silence  like the clear meander  through its lone vales  and where i found a spot  of awfuller shade  or an enchanted grot   or a green hill o erspread with chequered dress  of flowers  and fearful from its loveliness   write on my tablets all that was permitted   all that was for our human senses fitted   then the events of this wide world i d seize  like a strong giant  and my spirit teaze  till at its shoulders it should proudly see  wings to find out an immortality     stop and consider  life is but a day   a fragile dew drop on its perilous way  from a tree s summit  a poor indian s sleep  while his boat hastens to the monstrous steep  of montmorenci  why so sad a moan   life is the rose s hope while yet unblown   the reading of an ever changing tale   the light uplifting of a maiden s veil   a pigeon tumbling in clear summer air   a laughing school boy  without grief or care   riding the springy branches of an elm     o for ten years  that i may overwhelm  myself in poesy  so i may do the deed  that my own soul has to itself decreed   then will i pass the countries that i see  in long perspective  and continually  taste their pure fountains  first the realm i ll pass  of flora  and old pan  sleep in the grass   feed upon apples red  and strawberries   and choose each pleasure that my fancy sees   catch the white handed nymphs in shady places   to woo sweet kisses from averted faces     play with their fingers  touch their shoulders white  into a pretty shrinking with a bite  as hard as lips can make it  till agreed   a lovely tale of human life we ll read   and one will teach a tame dove how it best  may fan the cool air gently o er my rest   another  bending o er her nimble tread   will set a green robe floating round her head   and still will dance with ever varied case   smiling upon the flowers and the trees   another will entice me on  and on  through almond blossoms and rich cinnamon   till in the bosom of a leafy world  we rest in silence  like two gems upcurl d  in the recesses of a pearly shell     and can i ever bid these joys farewell   yes  i must pass them for a nobler life   where i may find the agonies  the strife  of human hearts  for lo  i see afar   o er sailing the blue cragginess  a car  and steeds with streamy manes  the charioteer  looks out upon the winds with glorious fear   and now the numerous tramplings quiver lightly  along a huge cloud s ridge  and now with sprightly  wheel downward come they into fresher skies   tipt round with silver from the sun s bright eyes   still downward with capacious whirl they glide   and now i see them on a green hill s side  in breezy rest among the nodding stalks   the charioteer with wond rous gesture talks  to the trees and mountains  and there soon appear  shapes of delight  of mystery  and fear   passing along before a dusky space  made by some mighty oaks  as they would chase  some ever fleeting music on they sweep   lo  how they murmur  laugh  and smile  and weep   some with upholden hand and mouth severe   some with their faces muffled to the ear  between their arms  some  clear in youthful bloom   go glad and smilingly  athwart the gloom   some looking back  and some with upward gaze   yes  thousands in a thousand different ways  flit onward  now a lovely wreath of girls  dancing their sleek hair into tangled curls   and now broad wings  most awfully intent  the driver  of those steeds is forward bent   and seems to listen  o that i might know  all that he writes with such a hurrying glow     the visions all are fled  the car is fled  into the light of heaven  and in their stead  a sense of real things comes doubly strong   and  like a muddy stream  would bear along  my soul to nothingness  but i will strive  against all doublings  and will keep alive  the thought of that same chariot  and the strange  journey it went                 is there so small a range  in the present strength of manhood  that the high  imagination cannot freely fly  as she was wont of old  prepare her steeds   paw up against the light  and do strange deeds  upon the clouds  has she not shewn us all   from the clear space of ether  to the small  breath of new buds unfolding  from the meaning  of jove s large eye brow  to the tender greening  of april meadows  here her altar shone   e en in this isle  and who could paragon  the fervid choir that lifted up a noise  of harmony  to where it aye will poise  its mighty self of convoluting sound   huge as a planet  and like that roll round   eternally around a dizzy void   ay  in those days the muses were nigh cloy d  with honors  nor had any other care  than to sing out and sooth their wavy hair     could all this be forgotten  yes  a schism  nurtured by foppery and barbarism   made great apollo blush for this his land   men were thought wise who could not understand  his glories  with a puling infant s force  they sway d about upon a rocking horse   and thought it pegasus  ah dismal soul d   the winds of heaven blew  the ocean roll d  its gathering waves  ye felt it not  the blue  bared its eternal bosom  and the dew  of summer nights collected still to make  the morning precious  beauty was awake   why were ye not awake  but ye were dead  to things ye knew not of   were closely wed  to musty laws lined out with wretched rule  and compass vile  so that ye taught a school  of dolts to smooth  inlay  and clip  and fit   till  like the certain wands of jacob s wit   their verses tallied  easy was the task   a thousand handicraftsmen wore the mask  of poesy  ill fated  impious race   that blasphemed the bright lyrist to his face   and did not know it   no  they went about   holding a poor  decrepid standard out  mark d with most flimsy mottos  and in large  the name of one boileau                                   o ye whose charge  it is to hover round our pleasant hills   whose congregated majesty so fills  my boundly reverence  that i cannot trace  your hallowed names  in this unholy place   so near those common folk  did not their shames  affright you  did our old lamenting thames  delight you  did ye never cluster round  delicious avon  with a mournful sound   and weep  or did ye wholly bid adieu  to regions where no more the laurel grew   or did ye stay to give a welcoming  to some lone spirits who could proudly sing  their youth away  and die   twas even so   but let me think away those times of woe   now  tis a fairer season  ye have breathed  rich benedictions o er us  ye have wreathed  fresh garlands  for sweet music has been heard  in many places   some has been upstirr d  from out its crystal dwelling in a lake   by a swan s ebon bill  from a thick brake   nested and quiet in a valley mild   bubbles a pipe  fine sounds are floating wild  about the earth  happy are ye and glad     these things are doubtless  yet in truth we ve had  strange thunders from the potency of song   mingled indeed with what is sweet and strong   from majesty  but in clear truth the themes  are ugly clubs  the poets polyphemes  disturbing the grand sea  a drainless shower  of light is poesy   tis the supreme of power    tis might half slumb ring on its own right arm   the very archings of her eye lids charm  a thousand willing agents to obey   and still she governs with the mildest sway   but strength alone though of the muses born  is like a fallen angel  trees uptorn   darkness  and worms  and shrouds  and sepulchres  delight it  for it feeds upon the burrs   and thorns of life  forgetting the great end  of poesy  that it should be a friend  to sooth the cares  and lift the thoughts of man       yet i rejoice  a myrtle fairer than  e er grew in paphos  from the bitter weeds  lifts its sweet head into the air  and feeds  a silent space with ever sprouting green   all tenderest birds there find a pleasant screen   creep through the shade with jaunty fluttering   nibble the little cupped flowers and sing   then let us clear away the choaking thorns  from round its gentle stem  let the young fawns   yeaned in after times  when we are flown   find a fresh sward beneath it  overgrown  with simple flowers  let there nothing be  more boisterous than a lover s bended knee   nought more ungentle than the placid look  of one who leans upon a closed book   nought more untranquil than the grassy slopes  between two hills  all hail delightful hopes   as she was wont  th  imagination  into most lovely labyrinths will be gone   and they shall be accounted poet kings  who simply tell the most heart easing things   o may these joys be ripe before i die     will not some say that i presumptuously  have spoken  that from hastening disgrace   twere better far to hide my foolish face   that whining boyhood should with reverence bow  ere the dread thunderbolt could reach  how   if i do hide myself  it sure shall be  in the very fane  the light of poesy   if i do fall  at least i will be laid  beneath the silence of a poplar shade   and over me the grass shall be smooth shaven   and there shall be a kind memorial graven   but oft  despondence  miserable bane   they should not know thee  who athirst to gain  a noble end  are thirsty every hour   what though i am not wealthy in the dower  of spanning wisdom  though i do not know  the shiftings of the mighty winds  that blow  hither and thither all the changing thoughts  of man  though no great minist ring reason sorts  out the dark mysteries of human souls  to clear conceiving  yet there ever rolls  a vast idea before me  and i glean  therefrom my liberty  thence too i ve seen  the end and aim of poesy   tis clear  as any thing most true  as that the year  is made of the four seasons  manifest  as a large cross  some old cathedral s crest   lifted to the white clouds  therefore should i  be but the essence of deformity   a coward  did my very eye lids wink  at speaking out what i have dared to think   ah  rather let me like a madman run  over some precipice  let the hot sun  melt my dedalian wings  and drive me down  convuls d and headlong  stay  an inward frown  of conscience bids me be more calm awhile   an ocean dim  sprinkled with many an isle   spreads awfully before me  how much toil   how many days  what desperate turmoil   ere i can have explored its widenesses   ah  what a task  upon my bended knees   i could unsay those  no  impossible   impossible                      for sweet relief i ll dwell  on humbler thoughts  and let this strange assay  begun in gentleness die so away   e en now all tumult from my bosom fades   i turn full hearted to the friendly aids  that smooth the path of honour  brotherhood   and friendliness the nurse of mutual good   the hearty grasp that sends a pleasant sonnet  into the brain ere one can think upon it   the silence when some rhymes are coming out   and when they re come  the very pleasant rout   the message certain to be done to morrow    tis perhaps as well that it should be to borrow  some precious book from out its snug retreat   to cluster round it when we next shall meet   scarce can i scribble on  for lovely airs  are fluttering round the room like doves in pairs   many delights of that glad day recalling   when first my senses caught their tender falling   and with these airs come forms of elegance  stooping their shoulders o er a horse s prance   careless  and grand  fingers soft and round  parting luxuriant curls   and the swift bound  of bacchus from his chariot  when his eye  made ariadne s cheek look blushingly   thus i remember all the pleasant flow  of words at opening a portfolio     things such as these are ever harbingers  to trains of peaceful images  the stirs  of a swan s neck unseen among the rushes   a linnet starting all about the bushes   a butterfly  with golden wings broad parted   nestling a rose  convuls d as though it smarted  with over pleasure  many  many more   might i indulge at large in all my store  of luxuries  yet i must not forget  sleep  quiet with his poppy coronet   for what there may be worthy in these rhymes  i partly owe to him  and thus  the chimes  of friendly voices had just given place  to as sweet a silence  when i  gan retrace  the pleasant day  upon a couch at ease   it was a poet s house who keeps the keys  of pleasure s temple  round about were hung  the glorious features of the bards who sung  in other ages  cold and sacred busts  smiled at each other  happy he who trusts  to clear futurity his darling fame   then there were fauns and satyrs taking aim  at swelling apples with a frisky leap  and reaching fingers   mid a luscious heap  of vine leaves  then there rose to view a fane  of liny marble  and thereto a train  of nymphs approaching fairly o er the sward   one  loveliest  holding her white band toward  the dazzling sun rise  two sisters sweet  bending their graceful figures till they meet  over the trippings of a little child   and some are hearing  eagerly  the wild  thrilling liquidity of dewy piping   see  in another picture  nymphs are wiping  cherishingly diana s timorous limbs     a fold of lawny mantle dabbling swims  at the bath s edge  and keeps a gentle motion  with the subsiding crystal  as when ocean  heaves calmly its broad swelling smoothiness o er  its rocky marge  and balances once more  the patient weeds  that now unshent by foam  feel all about their undulating home     sappho s meek head was there half smiling down  at nothing  just as though the earnest frown  of over thinking had that moment gone  from off her brow  and left her all alone     great alfred s too  with anxious  pitying eyes   as if he always listened to the sighs  of the goaded world  and kosciusko s worn  by horrid suffrance  mightily forlorn     petrarch  outstepping from the shady green   starts at the sight of laura  nor can wean  his eyes from her sweet face  most happy they   for over them was seen a free display  of out spread wings  and from between them shone  the face of poesy  from off her throne  she overlook d things that i scarce could tell   the very sense of where i was might well  keep sleep aloof  but more than that there came  thought after thought to nourish up the flame  within my breast  so that the morning light  surprised me even from a sleepless night   and up i rose refresh d  and glad  and gay   resolving to begin that very day  these lines  and howsoever they be done   i leave them as a father does his son

end  full license    scene that was passing or approaching  to forbear to grasp at  futurity  to suffer so much thought to wander from the purpose which  engrossed my fears and my hopes  could not be     yet am i sure that even now my perturbations are sufficiently stilled  for an employment like this  that the incidents i am going to relate can  be recalled and arranged without indistinctness and confusion  that  emotions will not be reawakened by my narrative  incompatible with order  and coherence  yet when i shall be better qualified for this task i know  not  time may take away these headlong energies  and give me back my  ancient sobriety  but this change will only be effected by weakening my  remembrance of these events  in proportion as i gain power over words   shall i lose dominion over sentiments  in proportion as my tale is  deliberate and slow  the incidents and motives which it is designed to  exhibit will be imperfectly revived and obscurely portrayed     oh  why art thou away at a time like this  wert thou present  the office  to which my pen is so inadequate would easily be executed by my tongue   accents can scarcely be too rapid  or that which words should fail to  convey  my looks and gestures would suffice to communicate  but i know  thy coming is impossible  to leave this spot is equally beyond my power   to keep thee in ignorance of what has happened would justly offend thee   there is no method of informing thee except by letter  and this method  must i  therefore  adopt     how short is the period that has elapsed since thou and i parted  and  yet how full of tumult and dismay has been my soul during that period   what light has burst upon my ignorance of myself and of mankind  how  sudden and enormous the transition from uncertainty to knowledge     but let me recall my thoughts  let me struggle for so much composure as  will permit my pen to trace intelligible characters  let me place in  order the incidents that are to compose my tale  i need not call on thee  to listen  the fate of waldegrave was as fertile of torment to thee as  to me  his bloody and mysterious catastrophe equally awakened thy grief   thy revenge  and thy curiosity  thou wilt catch from my story every  horror and every sympathy which it paints  thou wilt shudder with my  foreboding and dissolve with my tears  as the sister of my friend  and  as one who honours me with her affection  thou wilt share in all my  tasks and all my dangers     you need not be reminded with what reluctance i left you  to reach this  place by evening was impossible  unless i had set out early in the  morning  but your society was too precious not to be enjoyed to the last  moment  it was indispensable to be here on tuesday  but my duty required  no more than that i should arrive by sunrise on that day  to travel  during the night was productive of no formidable inconvenience  the air  was likely to be frosty and sharp  but these would not incommode one who  walked with speed  a nocturnal journey in districts so romantic and wild  as these  through which lay my road  was more congenial to my temper  than a noonday ramble     by nightfall i was within ten miles of my uncle s house  as the darkness  increased  and i advanced on my way  my sensations sunk into melancholy   the scene and the time reminded me of the friend whom i had lost  i  recalled his features  and accents  and gestures  and mused with  unutterable feelings on the circumstances of his death     my recollections once more plunged me into anguish and perplexity  once  more i asked  who was his assassin  by what motives could he be impelled  to a deed like this  waldegrave was pure from all offence  his piety was  rapturous  his benevolence was a stranger to remissness or torpor  all  who came within the sphere of his influence experienced and acknowledged  his benign activity  his friends were few  because his habits were timid  and reserved  but the existence of an enemy was impossible     i recalled the incidents of our last interview  my importunities that he  should postpone his ill omened journey till the morning  his  inexplicable obstinacy  his resolution to set out on foot during a dark  and tempestuous night  and the horrible disaster that befell him     the first intimation i received of this misfortune  the insanity of  vengeance and grief into which i was hurried  my fruitless searches for  the author of this guilt  my midnight wanderings and reveries beneath  the shade of that fatal elm  were revived and reacted  i heard the  discharge of the pistol  i witnessed the alarm of inglefield  i heard  his calls to his servants  and saw them issue forth with lights and  hasten to the spot whence the sound had seemed to proceed  i beheld my  friend  stretched upon the earth  ghastly with a mortal wound  alone   with no traces of the slayer visible  no tokens by which his place of  refuge might be sought  the motives of his enmity or his instruments of  mischief might be detected     i hung over the dying youth  whose insensibility forbade him to  recognise his friend  or unfold the cause of his destruction  i  accompanied his remains to the grave  i tended the sacred spot where he  lay  i once more exercised my penetration and my zeal in pursuit of his  assassin  once more my meditations and exertions were doomed to be  disappointed     i need not remind thee of what is past  time and reason seemed to have  dissolved the spell which made me deaf to the dictates of duty and  discretion  remembrances had ceased to agonize  to urge me to headlong  acts and foster sanguinary purposes  the gloom was half dispersed  and a  radiance had succeeded sweeter than my former joys     now  by some unseen concurrence of reflections  my thoughts reverted  into some degree of bitterness  methought that to ascertain the hand who  killed my friend was not impossible  and to punish the crime was just   that to forbear inquiry or withhold punishment was to violate my duty to  my god and to mankind  the impulse was gradually awakened that bade me  once more to seek the elm  once more to explore the ground  to  scrutinize its trunk  what could i expect to find  had it not been a  hundred times examined  had i not extended my search to the neighbouring  groves and precipices  had i not pored upon the brooks  and pried into  the pits and hollows  that were adjacent to the scene of blood     lately i had viewed this conduct with shame and regret  but in the  present state of my mind it assumed the appearance of conformity with  prudence  and i felt myself irresistibly prompted to repeat my search   some time had elapsed since my departure from this district   time  enough for momentous changes to occur  expedients that formerly were  useless might now lead instantaneously to the end which i sought  the  tree which had formerly been shunned by the criminal might  in the  absence of the avenger of blood  be incautiously approached  thoughtless  or fearless of my return  it was possible that he might  at this moment   be detected hovering near the scene of his offences     nothing can be pleaded in extenuation of this relapse into folly  my  return  after an absence of some duration  into the scene of these  transactions and sufferings  the time of night  the glimmering of the  stars  the obscurity in which external objects were wrapped  and which   consequently  did not draw my attention from the images of fancy  may in  some degree account for the revival of those sentiments and resolutions  which immediately succeeded the death of waldegrave  and which  during  my visit to you  had been suspended     you know the situation of the elm  in the midst of a private road  on  the verge of norwalk  near the habitation of inglefield  but three miles  from my uncle s house  it was now my intention to visit it  the road in  which i was travelling led a different way  it was requisite to leave  it  therefore  and make a circuit through meadows and over steeps  my  journey would  by these means  be considerably prolonged  but on that  head i was indifferent  or rather  considering how far the night had  already advanced  it was desirable not to reach home till the dawn     i proceeded in this new direction with speed  time  however  was allowed  for my impetuosities to subside  and for sober thoughts to take place   still i persisted in this path  to linger a few moments in this shade   to ponder on objects connected with events so momentous to my happiness   promised me a mournful satisfaction  i was familiar with the way  though  trackless and intricate  and i climbed the steeps  crept through the  brambles  leaped the rivulets and fences with undeviating aim  till at  length i reached the craggy and obscure path which led to inglefield s  house     in a short time  i descried through the dusk the widespread branches of  the elm  this tree  however faintly seen  cannot be mistaken for  another  the remarkable bulk and shape of its trunk  its position in the  midst of the way  its branches spreading into an ample circumference   made it conspicuous from afar  my pulse throbbed as i approached it     my eyes were eagerly bent to discover the trunk and the area beneath the  shade  these  as i approached  gradually became visible  the trunk was  not the only thing which appeared in view  somewhat else  which made  itself distinguishable by its motions  was likewise noted  i faltered  and stopped     to a casual observer this appearance would have been unnoticed  to me   it could not but possess a powerful significance  all my surmises and  suspicions instantly returned  this apparition was human  it was  connected with the fate of waldegrave  it led to a disclosure of the  author of that fate  what was i to do  to approach unwarily would alarm  the person  instant flight would set him beyond discovery and reach     i walked softly to the roadside  the ground was covered with rocky  masses  scattered among shrub oaks and dwarf cedars  emblems of its  sterile and uncultivated state  among these it was possible to elude  observation and yet approach near enough to gain an accurate view of  this being     at this time  the atmosphere was somewhat illuminated by the moon   which  though it had already set  was yet so near the horizon as to  benefit me by its light  the shape of a man  tall and robust  was now  distinguished  repeated and closer scrutiny enabled me to perceive that  he was employed in digging the earth  something like flannel was wrapped  round his waist and covered his lower limbs  the rest of his frame was  naked  i did not recognise in him any one whom i knew     a figure  robust and strange  and half naked  to be thus employed  at  this hour and place  was calculated to rouse up my whole soul  his  occupation was mysterious and obscure  was it a grave that he was  digging  was his purpose to explore or to hide  was it proper to watch  him at a distance  unobserved and in silence  or to rush upon him and  extort from him  by violence or menaces  an explanation of the scene     before my resolution was formed  he ceased to dig  he cast aside his  spade and sat down in the pit that he had dug  he seemed wrapped in  meditation  but the pause was short  and succeeded by sobs  at first low  and at wide intervals  but presently louder and more vehement  sorely  charged was indeed that heart whence flowed these tokens of sorrow   never did i witness a scene of such mighty anguish  such heart bursting  grief     what should i think  i was suspended in astonishment  every sentiment   at length  yielded to my sympathy  every new accent of the mourner  struck upon my heart with additional force  and tears found their way  spontaneously to my eyes  i left the spot where i stood  and advanced  within the verge of the shade  my caution had forsaken me  and  instead  of one whom it was duty to persecute  i beheld  in this man  nothing but  an object of compassion     my pace was checked by his suddenly ceasing to lament  he snatched the  spade  and  rising on his feet  began to cover up the pit with the  utmost diligence  he seemed aware of my presence  and desirous of hiding  something from my inspection  i was prompted to advance nearer and hold  his hand  but my uncertainty as to his character and views  the  abruptness with which i had been ushered into this scene  made me still  hesitate  but  though i hesitated to advance  there was nothing to  hinder me from calling      what  ho   said i   who is there  what are you doing      he stopped  the spade fell from his hand  he looked up and bent forward  his face towards the spot where i stood  an interview and explanation  were now  methought  unavoidable  i mustered up my courage to confront  and interrogate this being     he continued for a minute in his gazing and listening attitude  where i  stood i could not fail of being seen  and yet he acted as if he saw  nothing  again he betook himself to his spade  and proceeded with new  diligence to fill up the pit  this demeanour confounded and bewildered  me  i had no power but to stand and silently gaze upon his motions     the pit being filled  he once more sat upon the ground  and resigned  himself to weeping and sighs with more vehemence than before  in a short  time the fit seemed to have passed  he rose  seized the spade  and  advanced to the spot where i stood     again i made preparation as for an interview which could not but take  place  he passed me  however  without appearing to notice my existence   he came so near as almost to brush my arm  yet turned not his head to  either side  my nearer view of him made his brawny arms and lofty  stature more conspicuous  but his imperfect dress  the dimness of the  light  and the confusion of my own thoughts  hindered me from discerning  his features  he proceeded with a few quick steps along the road  but  presently darted to one side and disappeared among the rocks and bushes     my eye followed him as long as he was visible  but my feet were rooted  to the spot  my musing was rapid and incongruous  it could not fail to  terminate in one conjecture  that this person was  asleep   such  instances were not unknown to me  through the medium of conversation and  books  never  indeed  had it fallen under my own observation till now   and now it was conspicuous  and environed with all that could give edge  to suspicion and vigour to inquiry  to stand here was no longer of use   and i turned my steps towards my uncle s habitation           chapter ii       i had food enough for the longest contemplation  my steps partook  as  usual  of the vehemence of my thoughts  and i reached my uncle s gate  before i believed myself to have lost sight of the elm  i looked up and  discovered the well known habitation  i could not endure that my  reflections should so speedily be interrupted  i therefore passed the  gate  and stopped not till i had reached a neighbouring summit  crowned  with chestnut oaks and poplars     here i more deliberately reviewed the incidents that had just occurred   the inference was just  that the man  half clothed and digging  was a  sleeper  but what was the cause of this morbid activity  what was the  mournful vision that dissolved him in tears  and extorted from him  tokens of inconsolable distress  what did he seek  or what endeavour to  conceal  in this fatal spot  the incapacity of sound sleep denotes a  mind sorely wounded  it is thus that atrocious criminals denote the  possession of some dreadful secret  the thoughts  which considerations  of safety enable them to suppress or disguise during wakefulness   operate without impediment  and exhibit their genuine effects  when the  notices of sense are partly excluded and they are shut out from a  knowledge of their entire condition     this is the perpetrator of some nefarious deed  what but the murder of  waldegrave could direct his steps hither  his employment was part of  some fantastic drama in which his mind was busy  to comprehend it  demands penetration into the recesses of his soul  but one thing is  sure  an incoherent conception of his concern in that transaction  bewitches him hither  this it is that deluges his heart with bitterness  and supplies him with ever flowing tears     but whence comes he  he does not start from the bosom of the earth  or  hide himself in airy distance  he must have a name and a terrestrial  habitation  it cannot be at an immeasurable distance from the haunted  elm  inglefield s house is the nearest  this may be one of its  inhabitants  i did not recognise his features  but this was owing to the  dusky atmosphere and to the singularity of his garb  inglefield has two  servants  one of whom was a native of this district  simple  guileless   and incapable of any act of violence  he was  moreover  devoutly  attached to his sect  he could not be the criminal     the other was a person of a very different cast  he was an emigrant from  ireland  and had been six months in the family of my friend  he was a  pattern of sobriety and gentleness  his mind was superior to his  situation  his natural endowments were strong  and had enjoyed all the  advantage of cultivation  his demeanour was grave  and thoughtful  and  compassionate  he appeared not untinctured with religion  but his  devotion  though unostentatious  was of a melancholy tenor     there was nothing in the first view of his character calculated to  engender suspicion  the neighbourhood was populous  but  as i conned  over the catalogue  i perceived that the only foreigner among us was  clithero  our scheme was  for the most part  a patriarchal one  each  farmer was surrounded by his sons and kinsmen  this was an exception to  the rule  clithero was a stranger  whose adventures and character   previously to his coming hither  were unknown to us  the elm was  surrounded by his master s domains  an actor there must be  and no one  was equally questionable     the more i revolved the pensive and reserved deportment of this man  the  ignorance in which we were placed respecting his former situation  his  possible motives for abandoning his country and choosing a station so  much below the standard of his intellectual attainments  the stronger my  suspicions became  formerly  when occupied with conjectures relative to  the same topic  the image of this man did not fail to occur  but the  seeming harmlessness of his ordinary conduct had raised him to a level  with others  and placed him equally beyond the reach of suspicion  i did  not  till now  advert to the recentness of his appearance among us  and  to the obscurity that hung over his origin and past life  but now these  considerations appeared so highly momentous as almost to decide the  question of his guilt     but how were these doubts to be changed into absolute certainty   henceforth this man was to become the subject of my scrutiny  i was to  gain all the knowledge  respecting him  which those with whom he lived   and were the perpetual witnesses of his actions  could impart  for this  end i was to make minute inquiries  and to put seasonable  interrogatories  from this conduct i promised myself an ultimate  solution of my doubts     i acquiesced in this view of things with considerable satisfaction  it  seemed as if the maze was no longer inscrutable  it would be quickly  discovered who were the agents and instigators of the murder of my  friend     but it suddenly occurred to me  for what purpose shall i prosecute this  search  what benefit am i to reap from this discovery  how shall i  demean myself when the criminal is detected  i was not insensible  at  that moment  of the impulses of vengeance  but they were transient  i  detested the sanguinary resolutions that i had once formed  yet i was  fearful of the effects of my hasty rage  and dreaded an encounter in  consequence of which i might rush into evils which no time could repair   nor penitence expiate      but why   said i   should it be impossible to arm myself with firmness   if forbearance be the dictate of wisdom  cannot it be so deeply engraven  on my mind as to defy all temptation  and be proof against the most  abrupt surprise  my late experience has been of use to me  it has shown  me my weakness and my strength  having found my ancient fortifications  insufficient to withstand the enemy  what should i learn from thence but  that it becomes me to strengthen and enlarge them      no caution  indeed  can hinder the experiment from being hazardous  is  it wise to undertake experiments by which nothing can be gained  and  much may be lost  curiosity is vicious  if undisciplined by reason  and  inconducive to benefit      i was not  however  to be diverted from my purpose  curiosity  like  virtue  is its own reward  knowledge is of value for its own sake  and  pleasure is annexed to the acquisition  without regard to any thing  beyond  it is precious even when disconnected with moral inducements and  heartfelt sympathies  but the knowledge which i sought by its union with  these was calculated to excite the most complex and fiery sentiments in  my bosom     hours were employed in revolving these thoughts  at length i began to be  sensible of fatigue  and  returning home  explored the way to my chamber  without molesting the repose of the family  you know that our doors are  always unfastened  and are accessible at all hours of the night     my slumbers were imperfect  and i rejoiced when the morning light  permitted me to resume my meditations  the day glided away  i scarcely  know how  and  as i had rejoiced at the return of morning  i now hailed   with pleasure  the approach of night     my uncle and sisters having retired  i betook myself  instead of  following their example  to the  chestnut hill   concealed among  its rocks  or gazing at the prospect which stretched so far and so wide  around it  my fancy has always been accustomed to derive its highest  enjoyment from this spot  i found myself again at leisure to recall the  scene which i had witnessed during the last night  to imagine its  connection with the fate of waldegrave  and to plan the means of  discovering the secret that was hidden under these appearances     shortly  i began to feel insupportable disquiet at the thoughts of  postponing this discovery  wiles and stratagems were practicable  but  they were tedious  and of dubious success  why should i proceed like a  plotter  do i intend the injury of this person  a generous purpose will  surely excuse me from descending to artifices  there are two modes of  drawing forth the secrets of another   by open and direct means and by  circuitous and indirect  why scruple to adopt the former mode  why not  demand a conference  and state my doubts  and demand a solution of them   in a manner worthy of a beneficent purpose  why not hasten to the spot   he may be  at this moment  mysteriously occupied under this shade  i may  note his behaviour  i may ascertain his person  if not by the features  that belong to him  yet by tracing his footsteps when he departs  and  pursuing him to his retreats     i embraced this scheme  which was thus suggested  with eagerness  i  threw myself with headlong speed down the hill and pursued my way to the  elm  as i approached the tree  my palpitations increased  though my pace  slackened  i looked forward with an anxious glance  the trunk of the  tree was hidden in the deepest shade  i advanced close up to it  no one  was visible  but i was not discouraged  the hour of his coming was   perhaps  not arrived  i took my station at a small distance  beside a  fence  on the right hand     an hour elapsed before my eyes lighted on the object of which they were  in search  my previous observation had been roving from one quarter to  another  at last  it dwelt upon the tree  the person whom i before  described was seated on the ground  i had not perceived him before  and  the means by which he placed himself in this situation had escaped my  notice  he seemed like one whom an effort of will  without the exercise  of locomotion  had transported hither  or made visible  his state of  disarray  and the darkness that shrouded him  prevented me  as before   from distinguishing any peculiarities in his figure or countenance     i continued watchful and mute  the appearances already described took  place on this occasion  except the circumstance of digging in the earth   he sat musing for a while  then burst into sighs and lamentations     these being exhausted  he rose to depart  he stalked away with a solemn  and deliberate pace  i resolved to tread  as closely as possible  in his  footsteps  and not to lose sight of him till the termination of his  career     contrary to my expectation  he went in a direction opposite to that  which led to inglefield s  presently  he stopped at bars  which he  cautiously removed  and  when he had passed through them  as  deliberately replaced  he then proceeded along an obscure path  which  led across stubble fields  to a wood  the path continued through the  wood  but he quickly struck out of it  and made his way  seemingly at  random  through a most perplexing undergrowth of bushes and briers     i was  at first  fearful that the noise which i made behind him  in  trampling down the thicket  would alarm him  but he regarded it not  the  way that he had selected was always difficult  sometimes considerable  force was requisite to beat down obstacles  sometimes it led into a deep  glen  the sides of which were so steep as scarcely to afford a footing   sometimes into fens  from which some exertions were necessary to  extricate the feet  and sometimes through rivulets  of which the water  rose to the middle     for some time i felt no abatement of my speed or my resolution  i  thought i might proceed  without fear  through brakes and dells which my  guide was able to penetrate  he was perpetually changing his direction   i could form no just opinion as to my situation or distance from the  place at which we had set out     i began at length to be weary  a suspicion  likewise  suggested itself  to my mind  whether my guide did not perceive that he was followed  and  thus prolonged his journey in order to fatigue or elude his pursuer  i  was determined  however  to baffle his design  though the air was  frosty  my limbs were bedewed with sweat and my joints were relaxed with  toil  but i was obstinately bent upon proceeding     at length a new idea occurred to me  on finding me indefatigable in  pursuit  this person might resort to more atrocious methods of  concealment  but what had i to fear  it was sufficient to be upon my  guard  man to man  i needed not to dread his encounter     we at last arrived at the verge of a considerable precipice  he kept  along the edge  from this height  a dreary vale was discoverable   embarrassed with the leafless stocks of bushes  and encumbered with  rugged and pointed rocks  this scene reminded me of my situation  the  desert tract called norwalk  which i have often mentioned to you  my  curiosity had formerly induced me to traverse in various directions  it  was in the highest degree rugged  picturesque  and wild  this vale   though i had never before viewed it by the glimpses of the moon   suggested the belief that i had visited it before  such a one i knew  belonged to this uncultivated region  if this opinion were true  we were  at no inconsiderable distance from inglefield s habitation   where    said i   is this singular career to terminate      though occupied with these reflections  i did not slacken my pursuit   the stranger kept along the verge of the cliff  which gradually declined  till it terminated in the valley  he then plunged into its deepest  thickets  in a quarter of an hour he stopped under a projecture of the  rock which formed the opposite side of the vale  he then proceeded to  remove the stalks  which  as i immediately perceived  concealed the  mouth of a cavern  he plunged into the darkness  and in a few moments  his steps were heard no more     hitherto my courage had supported me  but here it failed  was this  person an assassin  who was acquainted with the windings of the grotto   and who would take advantage of the dark to execute his vengeance upon  me  who had dared to pursue him to these forlorn retreats  or was he  maniac  or walker in his sleep  whichever supposition were true  it  would be rash in me to follow him  besides  he could not long remain in  these darksome recesses  unless some fatal accident should overtake him     i seated myself at the mouth of the cave  determined patiently to wait  till he should think proper to emerge  this opportunity of rest was  exceedingly acceptable after so toilsome a pilgrimage  my pulse began to  beat more slowly  and the moisture that incommoded me ceased to flow   the coolness  which for a little time was delicious  presently increased  to shivering  and i found it necessary to change my posture  in order to  preserve my blood from congealing     after i had formed a path before the cavern s mouth  by the removal of  obstructions  i employed myself in walking to and fro  in this situation  i saw the moon gradually decline to the horizon  and  at length   disappear  i marked the deepenings of the shade  and the mutations which  every object successively underwent  the vale was narrow  and hemmed in  on all sides by lofty and precipitous cliffs  the gloom deepened as the  moon declined  and the faintness of starlight was all that preserved my  senses from being useless to my own guidance     i drew nearer the cleft at which this mysterious personage had entered   i stretched my hands before it  determined that he should not emerge  from his den without my notice  his steps would  necessarily   communicate the tidings of his approach  he could not move without a  noise which would be echoed to  on all sides  by the abruptness by which  this valley was surrounded  here  then  i continued till the day began  to dawn  in momentary expectation of the stranger s reappearance     my attention was at length excited by a sound that seemed to issue from  the cave  i imagined that the sleeper was returning  and prepared  therefore to seize him  i blamed myself for neglecting the opportunities  that had already been afforded  and was determined that another should  not escape  my eyes were fixed upon the entrance  the rustling  increased  and presently an animal leaped forth  of what kind i was  unable to discover  heart struck by this disappointment  but not  discouraged  i continued to watch  but in vain  the day was advancing  apace  at length the sun arose  and its beams glistened on the edges of  the cliffs above  whose sapless stalks and rugged masses were covered  with hoarfrost  i began to despair of success  but was unwilling to  depart until it was no longer possible to hope for the return of this  extraordinary personage  whether he had been swallowed up by some of the  abysses of this grotto  or lurked near the entrance  waiting my  departure  or had made his exit at another and distant aperture  was  unknown to me     exhausted and discouraged  i prepared  at length  to return  it was easy  to find my way out of this wilderness by going forward in one direction   regardless of impediments and cross paths  my absence i believed to have  occasioned no alarm to my family  since they knew not of my intention to  spend the night abroad  thus unsatisfactorily terminated this night s  adventures           chapter iii       the ensuing day was spent partly in sleep  and partly in languor and  disquietude  i incessantly ruminated on the incidents of the last night   the scheme that i had formed was defeated  was it likely that this  unknown person would repeat his midnight visits to the elm  if he did   and could again be discovered  should i resolve to undertake a new  pursuit  which might terminate abortively  or in some signal disaster   but what proof had i that the same route would be taken  and that he  would again inter himself alive in the same spot  or  if he did  since  his reappearance would sufficiently prove that the cavern was not  dangerous  and that he who should adventure in might hope to come out  again in safety  why not enter it after him  what could be the  inducements of this person to betake himself to subterranean retreats   the basis of all this region is  limestone   a substance that  eminently abounds in rifts and cavities  these  by the gradual decay of  their cementing parts  frequently make their appearance in spots where  they might have been least expected  my attention has often been excited  by the hollow sound which was produced by my casual footsteps  and which  showed me that i trod upon the roof of caverns  a mountain cave and the  rumbling of an unseen torrent are appendages of this scene  dear to my  youthful imagination  many of romantic structure were found within the  precincts of norwalk     these i had industriously sought out  but this had hitherto escaped my  observation  and i formed the resolution of some time exploring it  at  present i determined to revisit the elm  and dig in the spot where this  person had been employed in a similar way  it might be that something  was here deposited which might exhibit this transaction in a new light   at the suitable hour  on the ensuing night  i took my former stand  the  person again appeared  my intention to dig was to be carried into effect  on condition of his absence  and was  consequently  frustrated     instead of rushing on him  and breaking at once the spell by which his  senses were bound  i concluded  contrary to my first design  to wait his  departure  and allow myself to be conducted whithersoever he pleased   the track into which he now led me was different from the former one  it  was a maze  oblique  circuitous  upward and downward  in a degree which  only could take place in a region so remarkably irregular in surface  so  abounding with hillocks and steeps and pits and brooks  as   solesbury   it seemed to be the sole end of his labours to  bewilder or fatigue his pursuer  to pierce into the deepest thickets  to  plunge into the darkest cavities  to ascend the most difficult heights   and approach the slippery and tremulous verge of the dizziest  precipices     i disdained to be outstripped in this career  all dangers were  overlooked  and all difficulties defied  i plunged into obscurities  and  clambered over obstacles  from which  in a different state of mind  and  with a different object of pursuit  i should have recoiled with  invincible timidity  when the scene had passed  i could not review the  perils i had undergone without shuddering     at length my conductor struck into a path which  compared with the  ruggedness of that which we had lately trodden  was easy and smooth   this track led us to the skirt of the wilderness  and at no long time we  reached an open field  when a dwelling appeared  at a small distance   which i speedily recognised to be that belonging to inglefield  i now  anticipated the fulfilment of my predictions  my conductor directed his  steps towards the barn  into which he entered by a small door     how were my doubts removed  this was no other than clithero edny  there  was nothing in his appearance incompatible with this conclusion  he and  his fellow servant occupied an apartment in the barn as a lodging room   this arduous purpose was accomplished  and i retired to the shelter of a  neighbouring shed  not so much to repose myself after the fatigues of my  extraordinary journey  as to devise further expedients     nothing now remained but to take clithero to task  to repeat to him the  observations of the two last nights  to unfold to him my conjectures and  suspicions  to convince him of the rectitude of my intentions  and to  extort from him a disclosure of all the circumstances connected with the  death of waldegrave which it was in his power to communicate     in order to obtain a conference  i resolved to invite him to my uncle s  to perform a certain piece of work for me under my own eyes  he would   of course  spend the night with us  and in the evening i would take an  opportunity of entering into conversation with him     a period of the deepest deliberation was necessary to qualify myself for  performing suitably my part in this projected interview  i attended to  the feelings that were suggested in this new state of my knowledge  i  found reason to confide in my newly acquired equanimity   remorse   said  i   is an ample and proper expiation for all offences  what does  vengeance desire but to inflict misery  if misery come  its desires are  accomplished  it is only the obdurate and exulting criminal that is  worthy of our indignation  it is common for pity to succeed the  bitterest suggestions of resentment  if the vengeful mind be delighted  with the spectacle of woes of its own contriving  at least its canine  hunger is appeased  and thenceforth its hands are inactive      on the evening of the next day  i paid a visit to inglefield  i wished  to impart to him the discoveries that i had made  and to listen to his  reflections on the subject  i likewise desired to obtain all possible  information from the family respecting the conduct of clithero     my friend received me with his usual kindness  thou art no stranger to  his character  thou knowest with what paternal affection i have ever  been regarded by this old man  with what solicitude the wanderings of my  reason and my freaks of passion have been noted and corrected by him   thou knowest his activity to save the life of thy brother  and the hours  that have been spent by him in aiding my conjectures as to the cause of  his death  and inculcating the lessons of penitence and duty     the topics which could not but occur at such a meeting were quickly  discussed  and i hastily proceeded to that subject which was nearest my  heart  i related the adventures of the two preceding nights  and  mentioned the inference to which they irresistibly led     he said that this inference coincided with suspicions he had formed   since our last interview  in consequence of certain communications from  his housekeeper  it seems the character of clithero had  from the first   exercised the inquisitiveness of this old lady  she had carefully marked  his musing and melancholy deportment  she had tried innumerable  expedients for obtaining a knowledge of his past life  and particularly  of his motives for coming to america  these expedients  however profound  and addressful  had failed  he took no pains to elude them  he contented  himself with turning a deaf ear to all indirect allusions and hints   and  when more explicitly questioned  with simply declaring that he had  nothing to communicate worthy of her notice     during the day he was a sober and diligent workman  his evenings he  spent in incommunicative silence  on sundays  he always rambled away  no  one knew whither  and without a companion  i have already observed that  he and his fellow servant occupied the same apartment in the barn  this  circumstance was not unattended to by miss inglefield  the name of  clithero s companion was ambrose  this man was copiously interrogated by  his mistress  and she found him by no means so refractory as the other     ambrose  in his tedious and confused way  related that  soon after  clithero and he had become bedfellows  the former was considerably  disturbed by restlessness and talking in his sleep  his discourse was  incoherent  it was generally in the tone of expostulation  and appeared  to be entreating to be saved from some great injury  such phrases as  these    have pity    have mercy   were frequently intermingled with  groans  and accompanied with weeping  sometimes he seemed to be holding  conferences with some one who was making him considerable offers on  condition of his performing some dangerous service  what he said in his  own person  and in answer to his imaginary tempter  testified the utmost  reluctance     ambrose had no curiosity on the subject  as this interruption prevented  him at first from sleeping  it was his custom to put an end to the  dialogue  by awakening his companion  who betrayed tokens of great alarm  and dejection on discovering how he had been employed  he would  solicitously inquire what were the words that he had uttered  but  ambrose s report was seldom satisfactory  because he had attended to  them but little  and because he grudged every moment in which he was  deprived of his accustomed repose     whether clithero had ceased from this practice  or habit had reconciled  his companion to the sounds  they no longer occasioned any interruption  to his slumber     no one appeared more shocked than he at the death of waldegrave  after  this event his dejection suddenly increased  this symptom was observed  by the family  but none but the housekeeper took the trouble to notice  it to him  or build conjectures on the incident  during nights  however   ambrose experienced a renewal of his ancient disturbances  he remarked  that clithero  one night  had disappeared from his side  ambrose s range  of reflection was extremely narrow  quickly falling asleep  and finding  his companion beside him when he awoke  he dismissed it from his mind     on several ensuing nights he awakened in like manner  and always found  his companion s place empty  the repetition of so strange an incident at  length incited him to mention it to clithero  the latter was confounded  at this intelligence  he questioned ambrose with great anxiety as to the  particulars of this event  but he could gain no satisfaction from the  stupid inattention of the other  from this time there was a visible  augmentation of his sadness  his fits of taciturnity became more  obstinate  and a deeper gloom sat upon his brow     there was one other circumstance  of particular importance  mentioned by  the housekeeper  one evening some one on horseback stopped at this gate   he rattled at the gate  with an air of authority  in token of his desire  that some one would come from the house  miss inglefield was employed in  the kitchen  from a window of which she perceived who it was that made  the signal  clithero happened  at the same moment  to be employed near  her  she  therefore  desired him to go and see whom the stranger wanted   he laid aside his work and went  the conference lasted above five  minutes  the length of it excited in her a faint degree of surprise   inducing her to leave her employment and pay an unintermitted attention  to the scene  there was nothing  however  but its duration that rendered  it remarkable     clithero at length entered  and the traveller proceeded  the countenance  of the former betrayed a degree of perturbation which she had never  witnessed before  the muscles of his face were distorted and tremulous   he immediately sat down to his work  but he seemed  for some time  to  have lost all power over his limbs  he struggled to avoid the sight of  the lady  and his gestures  irresolute or misdirected  betokened the  deepest dismay  after some time  he recovered  in some degree  his  self possession  but  while the object was viewed through a new medium   and the change existed only in the imagination of the observer  a change  was certainly discovered     these circumstances were related to me by inglefield and corroborated by  his housekeeper  one consequence inevitably flowed from them  the  sleep walker  he who had led me through so devious a tract  was no other  than clithero  there was  likewise  a strong relation between this person  and him who stopped at the gate  what was the subject of discourse between  them  in answer to miss inglefield s interrogatories  he merely said  that the traveller inquired whither the road led which  at a small  distance forward  struck out of the principal one  considering the  length of the interview  it was not likely that this was the only topic     my determination to confer with him in private acquired new force from  these reflections  inglefield assented to my proposal  his own affairs  would permit the absence of his servant for one day  i saw no necessity  for delay  and immediately made my request to clithero  i was fashioning  an implement  i told him  with respect to which i could not wholly  depend upon my own skill  i was acquainted with the dexterity of his  contrivances  and the neatness of his workmanship  he readily consented  to assist me on this occasion  next day he came  contrary to my  expectation  he prepared to return home in the evening  i urged him to  spend the night with us  but no  it was equally convenient  and more  agreeable to him  to return     i was not aware of this resolution  i might  indeed  have foreseen that   being conscious of his infirmity  he would desire to avoid the scrutiny  of strangers  i was painfully disconcerted  but it occurred to me  that  the best that could be done was to bear him company  and seize some  opportunity  during this interval  of effecting my purpose  i told him   that  since he would not remain  i cared not if  for the sake of  recreation  and of a much more momentous purpose  i went along with him   he tacitly  and without apparent reluctance  consented to my scheme   and  accordingly  we set off together  this was an awful crisis  the  time had now come that was to dissipate my uncertainty  by what means  should i introduce a topic so momentous and singular  i had been  qualified by no experience for rightly conducting myself on so critical  an emergency  my companion preserved a mournful and inviolable silence   he afforded me no opening by which i might reach the point in view  his  demeanour was sedate  while i was almost disabled  by the confusion of  my thoughts  to utter a word     it was a dreadful charge that i was about to insinuate  i was to accuse  my companion of nothing less than murder  i was to call upon him for an  avowal of his guilt  i was to state the ground of my suspicions  and  desire him to confute or confirm them  in doing this  i was principally  stimulated by an ungovernable curiosity  yet  if i intended not the  conferring of a benefit  i did not  at least  purpose the infliction of  evil  i persuaded myself that i was able to exclude from my bosom all  sanguinary or vengeful impulses  and that  whatever should be the issue  of this conversation  my equanimity would be unsubdued     i revolved various modes of introducing the topic by which my mind was  engaged  i passed rapidly from one to another  none of them were  sufficiently free from objection to allow me to adopt it  my perplexity  became  every moment  more painful  and my ability to extricate myself   less     in this state of uncertainty  so much time elapsed  that the elm at  length appeared in sight  this object had somewhat of a mechanical  influence upon me  i stopped short  and seized the arm of my companion   till this moment  he appeared to have been engrossed by his own  reflections  and not to have heeded those emotions which must have been  sufficiently conspicuous in my looks     this action recalled him from his reverie  the first idea that occurred  to him  when he had noticed my behaviour  was  that i was assailed by  some sudden indisposition      what is the matter   said he  in a tone of anxiety   are you not well       yes   replied i    perfectly well  but stop a moment  i have something  to say to you       to me   answered he  with surprise      yes   said i   let us turn down this path    pointing  at the same  time  to that along which i had followed him the preceding night      he now partook  in some degree  of my embarrassment      is there any thing particular   said he  in a doubting accent  there he  stopped      something   i answered   of the highest moment  go with me down this  path  we shall be in less danger of interruption      he was irresolute and silent  but  seeing me remove the bars and pass  through them  he followed me  nothing more was said till we entered the  wood  i trusted to the suggestions of the moment  i had now gone too far  to recede  and the necessity that pressed upon me supplied me with  words  i continued        this is a remarkable spot  you may wonder why i have led you to it  i  ought not to keep you in suspense  there is a tale connected with it   which i am desirous of telling you  for this purpose i have brought you  hither  listen to me      i then recapitulated the adventures of the two preceding nights  i added  nothing  nor retrenched any thing  he listened in the deepest silence   from every incident  he gathered new cause of alarm  repeatedly he wiped  his face with his handkerchief  and sighed deeply  i took no verbal  notice of these symptoms  i deemed it incumbent on me to repress  nothing  when i came to the concluding circumstance  by which his person  was identified  he heard me without any new surprise  to this narrative  i subjoined the inquiries that i had made at inglefield s  and the  result of those inquiries  i then continued in these words        you may ask why i subjected myself to all this trouble  the  mysteriousness of these transactions would have naturally suggested  curiosity in any one  a transient passenger would probably have acted as  i have done  but i had motives peculiar to myself  need i remind you of  a late disaster  that it happened beneath the shade of this tree  am i  not justified in drawing certain inferences from your behaviour  what  they are  i leave you to judge  be it your task to confute or confirm  them  for this end i have conducted you hither      my suspicions are vehement  how can they be otherwise  i call upon you  to say whether they be just      the spot where we stood was illuminated by the moon  that had now risen   though all around was dark  hence his features and person were easily  distinguished  his hands hung at his side  his eyes were downcast  and  he was motionless as a statue  my last words seemed scarcely to have  made any impression on his sense  i had no need to provide against the  possible suggestions of revenge  i felt nothing but the tenderness of  compassion  i continued  for some time  to observe him in silence  and  could discover no tokens of a change of mood  i could not forbear  at  last  to express my uneasiness at the fixedness of his features and  attitude      recollect yourself  i mean not to urge you too closely  this topic is  solemn  but it need not divest you of the fortitude becoming a man      the sound of my voice startled him  he broke from me  looked up  and  fixed his eyes upon me with an expression of affright  he shuddered and  recoiled as from a spectre  i began to repent of my experiment  i could  say nothing suitable to this occasion  i was obliged to stand a silent  and powerless spectator  and to suffer this paroxysm to subside of  itself  when its violence appeared to be somewhat abated  i resumed        i can feel for you  i act not thus in compliance with a temper that  delights in the misery of others  the explanation that i have solicited  is no less necessary for your sake than for mine  you are no stranger to  the light in which i viewed this man  you have witnessed the grief which  his fate occasioned  and the efforts that i made to discover and drag to  punishment his murderer  you heard the execrations that i heaped upon  him  and my vows of eternal revenge  you expect that  having detected  the offender  i will hunt him to infamy and death  you are mistaken  i  consider the deed as sufficiently expiated      i am no stranger to your gnawing cares  to the deep and incurable  despair that haunts you  to which your waking thoughts are a prey  and  from which sleep cannot secure you  i know the enormity of your crime   but i know not your inducements  whatever they were  i see the  consequences with regard to yourself  i see proofs of that remorse which  must ever be attendant on guilt      this is enough  why should the effects of our misdeeds be  inexhaustible  why should we be debarred from a comforter  an  opportunity of repairing our errors may  at least  be demanded from the  rulers of our destiny      i once imagined that he who killed waldegrave inflicted the greatest  possible injury on me  that was an error  which reflection has cured   were futurity laid open to my view  and events  with their consequences   unfolded  i might see reason to embrace the assassin as my best friend   be comforted      he was still incapable of speaking  but tears came to his relief   without attending to my remonstrances  he betrayed a disposition to  return  i had  hitherto  hoped for some disclosure  but now feared that  it was designed to be withheld  he stopped not till we reached  inglefield s piazza  he then spoke  for the first time  but in a hollow  and tremulous voice        you demand of me a confession of crimes  you shall have it  some time  you shall have it  when it will be  i cannot tell  something must be  done  and shortly      he hurried from me into the house  and  after a pause  i turned my  steps home wards  my reflections  as i proceeded  perpetually revolved  round a single point  these were scarcely more than a repetition  with  slight variations  of a single idea     when i awoke in the morning  i hied  in fancy  to the wilderness  i saw  nothing but the figure of the wanderer before me  i traced his footsteps  anew  retold my narrative  and pondered on his gestures and words  my  condition was not destitute of enjoyment  my stormy passions had  subsided into a calm  portentous and awful  my soul was big with  expectation  i seemed as if i were on the eve of being ushered into a  world whose scenes were tremendous but sublime  the suggestions of  sorrow and malice had  for a time  taken their flight  and yielded place  to a generous sympathy  which filled my eyes with tears  but had more in  it of pleasure than of pain  that clithero was instrumental to the death  of waldegrave  that he could furnish the clue explanatory of every  bloody and mysterious event that had hitherto occurred  there was no  longer the possibility of doubting   he  indeed   said i   is the  murderer of excellence  and yet it shall be my province to emulate a  father s clemency  and restore this unhappy man to purity and to peace      day after day passed  without hearing any thing of clithero  i began to  grow uneasy and impatient  i had gained so much  and by means so  unexpected  that i could more easily endure uncertainty with respect to  what remained to be known  but my patience had its limits  i should   doubtless  have made use of new means to accelerate this discovery  had  not his timely appearance made them superfluous     sunday being at length arrived  i resolved to go to inglefield s  seek  an interview with his servant  and urge him  by new importunities  to  confide to me the secret  on my way thither  clithero appeared in sight   his visage was pale and wan  and his form emaciated and shrunk  i was  astonished at the alteration which the lapse of a week had made in his  appearance  at a small distance i mistook him for a stranger  as soon as  i perceived who it was  i greeted him with the utmost friendliness  my  civilities made little impression on him  and he hastened to inform me   that he was coming to my uncle s  for the purpose of meeting and talking  with me  if i thought proper  we would go into the wood together  and  find some spot where we might discourse at our leisure and be exempt  from interruption     you will easily conceive with what alacrity i accepted his invitation   we returned from the road into the first path  and proceeded in silence   till the wildness of the surrounding scenery informed us that we were in  the heart of norwalk  we lighted on a recess  to which my companion  appeared to be familiar  and which had all the advantages of solitude   and was suitable to rest  here we stopped  hitherto my companion had  displayed a certain degree of composure  now his countenance betokened a  violent internal struggle  it was a considerable time before he could  command his speech  when he had so far effected the conquest of his  feelings  he began           chapter iv       you call upon me for a confession of my offences  what a strange fortune  is mine  that a human being  in the present circumstances  should make  this demand  and that i should be driven  by an irresistible necessity   to comply with it  that here should terminate my calamitous series  that  my destiny should call upon me to lie down and die  in a region so  remote from the scene of my crime  at a distance so great from all that  witnessed and endured their consequences     you believe me to be an assassin  you require me to explain the motives  that induced me to murder the innocent  while this is your belief  and  this the scope of your expectations  you may be sure of my compliance  i  could resist every demand but this     for what purpose have i come hither  is it to relate my story  shall i  calmly sit here  and rehearse the incidents of my life  will my strength  be adequate to this rehearsal  let me recollect the motives that  governed me  when i formed this design  perhaps a strenuousness may be  imparted by them which  otherwise  i cannot hope to obtain  for the sake  of those  i consent to conjure up the ghost of the past  and to begin a  tale that  with a fortitude like mine  i am not sure that i shall live  to finish     you are unacquainted with the man before you  the inferences which you  have drawn  with regard to my designs and my conduct  are a tissue of  destructive errors  you  like others  are blind to the most momentous  consequences of your own actions  you talk of imparting consolation  you  boast the beneficence of your intentions  you set yourself to do me a  benefit  what are the effects of your misguided zeal and random efforts   they have brought my life to a miserable close  they have shrouded the  last scene of it in blood  they have put the seal to my perdition     my misery has been greater than has fallen to the lot of mortals  yet it  is but beginning  my present path  full as it is of asperities  is  better than that into which i must enter when this is abandoned   perhaps  if my pilgrimage had been longer  i might  at some future day   have lighted upon hope  in consequence of your interference  i am  forever debarred from it  my existence is henceforward to be invariable   the woes that are reserved for me are incapable alike of alleviation or  intermission     but i came not hither to recriminate  i came not hither to accuse  others  but myself  i know the retribution that is appointed for guilt  like mine  it is just  i may shudder at the foresight of my punishment  and shrink in the endurance of it  but i shall be indebted for part of  my torment to the vigour of my understanding  which teaches me that my  punishment is just  why should i procrastinate my doom and strive to  render my burden more light  it is but just that it should crush me  its  procrastination is impossible  the stroke is already felt  even now i  drink of the cup of retribution  a change of being cannot aggravate my  woe  till consciousness itself be extinct  the worm that gnaws me will  never perish     fain would i be relieved from this task  gladly would i bury in oblivion  the transactions of my life  but no  my fate is uniform  the demon that  controlled me at first is still in the fruition of power  i am entangled  in his fold  and every effort that i make to escape only involves me in  deeper ruin  i need not conceal  for all the consequences of disclosure  are already experienced  i cannot endure a groundless imputation  though  to free me from it i must create and justify imputations still more  atrocious  my story may at least be brief  if the agonies of remembrance  must be awakened afresh  let me do all that in me lies to shorten them     i was born in the county of armagh  my parents were of the better sort  of peasants  and were able to provide me with the rudiments of  knowledge  i should doubtless have trodden in their footsteps  and have  spent my life in the cultivation of their scanty fields  if an event had  not happened  which  for a long time  i regarded as the most fortunate  of my life  but which i now regard as the scheme of some infernal agent   and as the primary source of all my calamities     my father s farm was a portion of the demesne of one who resided wholly  in the metropolis and consigned the management of his estates to his  stewards and retainers  this person married a lady who brought him great  accession of fortune  her wealth was her only recommendation in the eyes  of her husband   whose understanding was depraved by the prejudices of  luxury and rank   but was the least of her attractions in the estimate  of reasonable beings     they passed some years together  if their union were not a source of  misery to the lady  she was indebted for her tranquillity to the force  of her mind  she was  indeed  governed  in every action of her life  by  the precepts of duty  while her husband listened to no calls but those  of pernicious dissipation  he was immersed in all the vices that grow  out of opulence and a mistaken education     happily for his wife  his career was short  he was enraged at the  infidelity of his mistress  to purchase whose attachment he had lavished  two thirds of his fortune  he called the paramour  by whom he had been  supplanted  to the field  the contest was obstinate  and terminated in  the death of the challenger     this event freed the lady from many distressful and humiliating  obligations  she determined to profit by her newly acquired  independence  to live thenceforward conformably to her notions of right   to preserve and improve  by schemes of economy  the remains of her  fortune  and to employ it in the diffusion of good  her plans made it  necessary to visit her estates in the distant provinces     during her abode in the manor of which my father was a vassal  she  visited his cottage  i was at that time a child  she was pleased with my  vivacity and promptitude  and determined to take me under her own  protection  my parents joyfully acceded to her proposal  and i returned  with her to the capital     she had an only son of my own age  her design  in relation to me  was  that i should be educated with her child  and that an affection  in this  way  might be excited in me towards my young master  which might render  me  when we should attain to manhood  one of his most faithful and  intelligent dependants  i enjoyed  equally with him  all the essential  benefits of education  there were certain accomplishments  from which i  was excluded  from the belief that they were unsuitable to my rank and  station  i was permitted to acquire others  which  had she been actuated  by true discernment  she would  perhaps  have discovered to be far more  incompatible with a servile station  in proportion as my views were  refined and enlarged by history and science  i was likely to contract a  thirst of independence  and an impatience of subjection and poverty     when the period of childhood and youth was past  it was thought proper  to send her son to improve his knowledge and manners by a residence on  the continent  this young man was endowed with splendid abilities  his  errors were the growth of his condition  all the expedients that  maternal solicitude and wisdom could suggest were employed to render him  a useful citizen  perhaps this wisdom was attested by the large share of  excellence which he really possessed  and that his character was not  unblemished proved only that no exertions could preserve him from the  vices that are inherent in wealth and rank  and which flow from the  spectacle of universal depravity     as to me  it would be folly to deny that i had benefited by my  opportunities of improvement  i fulfilled the expectation of my  mistress  in one respect  i was deeply imbued with affection for her  son  and reverence for herself  perhaps the force of education was  evinced in those particulars  without reflecting any credit on the  directors of it  those might merit the name of defects  which were  regarded by them as accomplishments  my unfavourable qualities  like  those of my master  were imputed to my condition  though  perhaps  the  difference was advantageous to me  since the vices of servitude are less  hateful than those of tyranny     it was resolved that i should accompany my master in his travels  in  quality of favourite domestic  my principles  whatever might be their  rectitude  were harmonious and flexible  i had devoted my life to the  service of my patron  i had formed conceptions of what was really  conducive to his interest  and was not to be misled by specious  appearances  if my affection had not stimulated my diligence  i should  have found sufficient motives in the behaviour of his mother  she  condescended to express her reliance on my integrity and judgment  she  was not ashamed to manifest  at parting  the tenderness of a mother  and  to acknowledge that all her tears were not shed on her son s account  i  had my part in the regrets that called them forth     during our absence  i was my master s constant attendant  i corresponded  with his mother  and made the conduct of her son the principal theme of  my letters  i deemed it my privilege  as well as duty  to sit in  judgment on his actions  to form my opinions without regard to selfish  considerations  and to avow them whenever the avowal tended to benefit   every letter which i wrote  particularly those in which his behaviour  was freely criticized  i allowed him to peruse  i would  on no account   connive at or participate in the slightest irregularity  i knew the duty  of my station  and assumed no other control than that which resulted  from the avoiding of deceit  and the open expression of my sentiments   the youth was of a noble spirit  but his firmness was wavering  he  yielded to temptations which a censor less rigorous than i would have  regarded as venial  or  perhaps  laudable  my duty required me to set  before him the consequences of his actions  and to give impartial and  timely information to his mother     he could not brook a monitor  the more he needed reproof the less  supportable it became  my company became every day less agreeable  till  at length there appeared a necessity of parting  a separation took  place  but not as enemies  i never lost his respect  in his  representations to his mother  he was just to my character and services   my dismission was not allowed to injure my fortune  and his mother  considered this event merely as a new proof of the inflexible  consistency of my principles     on this change in my situation  she proposed to me to become a member of  her own family  no proposal could be more acceptable  i was fully  acquainted with the character of this lady  and had nothing to fear from  injustice and caprice  i did not regard her with filial familiarity  but  my attachment and reverence would have done honour to that relation  i  performed for her the functions of a steward  her estates in the city  were put under my direction  she placed boundless confidence in my  discretion and integrity  and consigned to me the payment  and  in some  degree  the selection and government  of her servants  my station was a  servile one  yet most of the evils of servitude were unknown to me  my  personal ease and independence were less infringed than that of those  who are accounted the freest members of society  i derived a sort of  authority and dignity from the receipt and disbursement of money  the  tenants and debtors of the lady were  in some respects  mine  it was   for the most part  on my justice and lenity that they depended for their  treatment  my lady s household establishment was large and opulent  her  servants were my inferiors and menials  my leisure was considerable  and  my emoluments large enough to supply me with every valuable instrument  of improvement or pleasure     these were reasons why i should be contented with my lot  these  circumstances alone would have rendered it more eligible than any other   but it had additional and far more powerful recommendations  arising  from the character of mrs  lorimer  and from the relation in which she  allowed me to stand to her     how shall i enter upon this theme  how shall i expatiate upon  excellencies which it was my fate to view in their genuine colours  to  adore with an immeasurable and inextinguishable ardour  and which   nevertheless  it was my hateful task to blast and destroy  yet i will  not be spared  i shall find  in the rehearsal  new incitements to  sorrow  i deserve to be supreme in misery  and will not be denied the  full measure of a bitter retribution     no one was better qualified to judge of her excellencies  a casual  spectator might admire her beauty  and the dignity of her demeanour   from the contemplation of those  he might gather motives for loving or  revering her  age was far from having withered her complexion  or  destroyed the evenness of her skin  but no time could rob her of the  sweetness and intelligence which animated her features  her habitual  beneficence was bespoken in every look  always in search of occasions  for doing good  always meditating scenes of happiness  of which she was  the author  or of distress  for which she was preparing relief  the most  torpid insensibility was  for a time  subdued  and the most depraved  smitten by charms of which  in another person  they would not perhaps  have been sensible     a casual visitant might enjoy her conversation  might applaud the  rectitude of her sentiments  the richness of her elocution  and her  skill in all the offices of politeness  but it was only for him who  dwelt constantly under the same roof  to mark the inviolable consistency  of her actions and opinions  the ceaseless flow of her candour  her  cheerfulness  and her benevolence  it was only for one who witnessed her  behaviour at all hours  in sickness and in health  her management of  that great instrument of evil and good  money  her treatment of her son   her menials  and her kindred  rightly to estimate her merits     the intercourse between us was frequent  but of a peculiar kind  my  office in her family required me often to see her  to submit schemes to  her consideration  and receive her directions  at these times she  treated me in a manner in some degree adapted to the difference of rank  and the inferiority of my station  and yet widely dissimilar from that  which a different person would have adopted in the same circumstances   the treatment was not that of an equal and a friend  but still more  remote was it from that of a mistress  it was merely characterized by  affability and condescension  but as such it had no limits     she made no scruple to ask my counsel in every pecuniary affair  to  listen to my arguments  and decide conformably to what  after sufficient  canvassings and discussions  should appear to be right  when the direct  occasions of our interview were dismissed  i did not of course withdraw   to detain or dismiss me was indeed at her option  but  if no engagement  interfered  she would enter into general conversation  there was none  who could with more safety to herself have made the world her confessor   but the state of society in which she lived imposed certain limitations  on her candour  in her intercourse with me there were fewer restraints  than on any other occasion  my situation had made me more intimately  acquainted with domestic transactions  with her views respecting her  son  and with the terms on which she thought proper to stand with those  whom old acquaintance or kindred gave some title to her good offices  in  addition to all those motives to a candid treatment of me  there were  others which owed their efficacy to her maternal regard for me  and to  the artless and unsuspecting generosity of her character     her hours were distributed with the utmost regularity  and appropriated  to the best purposes  she selected her society without regard to any  qualities but probity and talents  her associates were numerous  and her  evening conversations embellished with all that could charm the senses  or instruct the understanding  this was a chosen field for the display  of her magnificence  but her grandeur was unostentatious  and her  gravity unmingled with haughtiness  from these my station excluded me   but i was compensated by the freedom of her communications in the  intervals  she found pleasure in detailing to me the incidents that  passed on those occasions  in rehearsing conversations and depicting  characters  there was an uncommon portion of dramatic merit in her  recitals  besides valuable and curious information  one uniform effect  was produced in me by this behaviour  each day i thought it impossible  for my attachment to receive any new accessions  yet the morrow was sure  to produce some new emotion of respect or of gratitude  and to set the  unrivalled accomplishments of this lady in a new and more favourable  point of view  i contemplated no change in my condition  the necessity  of change  whatever were the alternative  would have been a subject of  piercing regret  i deemed my life a cheap sacrifice in her cause  no  time would suffice to discharge the debt of gratitude that was due to  her  yet it was continually accumulating  if an anxious thought ever  invaded my bosom  it arose from this source     it was no difficult task faithfully to execute the functions assigned to  me  no merit could accrue to me from this source  i was exposed to no  temptation  i had passed the feverish period of youth  no contagious  example had contaminated my principles  i had resisted  the allurements  of sensuality and dissipation incident to my age  my dwelling was in  pomp and splendour  i had amassed sufficient to secure me  in case of  unforeseen accidents  in the enjoyment of competence  my mental  resources were not despicable  and the external means of intellectual  gratification were boundless  i enjoyed an unsullied reputation  my  character was well known in that sphere which my lady occupied  not only  by means of her favourable report  but in numberless ways in which it  was my fortune to perform personal services to others           chapter v       mrs  lorimer had a twin brother  nature had impressed the same image  upon them  and had modelled them after the same pattern  the resemblance  between them was exact to a degree almost incredible  in infancy and  childhood they were perpetually liable to be mistaken for each other  as  they grew up  nothing  to a superficial examination  appeared to  distinguish them  but the sexual characteristics  a sagacious observer  would  doubtless  have noted the most essential differences  in all  those modifications of the features which are produced by habits and  sentiments  no two persons were less alike  nature seemed to have  intended them as examples of the futility of those theories which  ascribe every thing to conformation and instinct and nothing to external  circumstances  in what different modes the same materials may be  fashioned  and to what different purposes the same materials may be  applied  perhaps the rudiments of their intellectual character  as well  as of their form  were the same  but the powers that in one case were  exerted in the cause of virtue were  in the other  misapplied to sordid  and flagitious purposes     arthur wiatte  that was his name  had ever been the object of his  sister s affection  as long as he existed  she never ceased to labour in  the promotion of his happiness  all her kindness was repaid by a stern  and inexorable hatred  this man was an exception to all the rules which  govern us in our judgments of human nature  he exceeded in depravity all  that has been imputed to the arch foe of mankind  his wickedness was  without any of those remorseful intermissions from which it has been  supposed that the deepest guilt is not entirely exempt  he seemed to  relish no food but pure unadulterated evil  he rejoiced in proportion to  the depth of that distress of which he was the author     his sister  by being placed most within the reach of his enmity   experienced its worst effects  she was the subject on which  by being  acquainted with the means of influencing her happiness  he could try his  malignant experiments with most hope of success  her parents being high  in rank and wealth  the marriage of their daughter was  of course  an  object of anxious attention  there is no event on which our felicity and  usefulness more materially depends  and with regard to which  therefore   the freedom of choice and the exercise of our own understanding ought to  be less infringed  but this maxim is commonly disregarded in proportion  to the elevation of our rank and extent of our property     the lady made her own election  but she wras one of those who acted on a  comprehensive plan  and would not admit her private inclination to  dictate her decision  the happiness of others  though founded on  mistaken views  she did not consider as unworthy of her regard  the  choice was such as was not likely to obtain the parental sanction  to  whom the moral qualities of their son in law  though not absolutely  weightless in the balance  were greatly inferior to the considerations  of wealth and dignity     the brother set no value on any thing but the means of luxury and power   he was astonished at that perverseness which entertained a different  conception of happiness from himself  love and friendship he considered  as groundless and chimerical  and believed that those delusions would   in people of sense  be rectified by experience  but he knew the  obstinacy of his sister s attachment to these phantoms  and that to  bereave her of the good they promised was the most effectual means of  rendering her miserable  for this end he set himself to thwart her  wishes  in the imbecility and false indulgence of his parents he found  the most powerful auxiliaries  he prevailed upon them to forbid that  union which wanted nothing but their concurrence  and their consent to  endow her with a small portion of their patrimony  to render completely  eligible  the cause was that of her happiness and the happiness of him  on whom she had bestowed her heart  it behooved her  therefore  to call  forth all her energies in defence of it  to weaken her brother s  influence on the minds of her parents  or to win him to be her advocate   when i reflect upon her mental powers  and the advantages which should  seem to flow from the circumstance of pleading in the character of  daughter arid sister  i can scarcely believe that her attempts  miscarried  i should have imagined that all obstacles would yield before  her  and particularly in a case like this  in which she must have  summoned all her forces  and never have believed that she had struggled  sufficiently     certain it is that her lot was fixed  she was not only denied the  husband of her choice  but another was imposed upon her  whose  recommendations were irresistible in every one s apprehension but her  own  the discarded lover was treated with every sort of contumely   deceit and violence were employed by her brother to bring his honour   his liberty  and even his life  into hazard  all these iniquities  produced no inconsiderable effect on the mind of the lady  the  machinations to which her love was exposed would have exasperated him  into madness  had not her most strenuous exertions been directed to  appease him     she prevailed on him at length to abandon his country  though she  thereby merely turned her brother s depravity into a new channel  her  parents died without consciousness of the evils they inflicted  but they  experienced a bitter retribution in the conduct of their son  he was the  darling and stay of an ancient and illustrious house  but his actions  reflected nothing but disgrace upon his ancestry  and threatened to  bring the honours of their line to a period in his person  at their  death the bulk of their patrimony devolved upon him  this he speedily  consumed in gaming and riot  from splendid he descended to meaner vices   the efforts of his sister to recall him to virtue were unintermitted and  fruitless  her affection for him he converted into a means of prolonging  his selfish gratifications  she decided for the best  it was no argument  of weakness that she was so frequently deceived  if she had judged truly  of her brother  she would have judged not only without example  but in  opposition to the general experience of mankind  but she was not to be  forever deceived  her tenderness was subservient to justice  and when  his vices had led him from the gaming table to the highway  when seized  at length by the ministers of law  when convicted and sentenced to  transportation  her intercession was solicited  when all the world knew  that pardon would readily be granted to a suppliant of her rank   fortune  and character  when the criminal himself  his kindred  his  friends  and even indifferent persons  implored her interference  her  justice was inflexible  she knew full well the incurableness of his  depravity  that banishment was the mildest destiny that would befall  him  that estrangement from ancient haunts and associates was the  condition from which his true friends had least to fear  finding  entreaties unavailing  the wretch delivered himself to the suggestions  of his malice  and he vowed to be bloodily revenged on her  inflexibility  the sentence was executed  that character must indeed be  monstrous from which the execution of such threats was to be dreaded   the event sufficiently showed that our fears on this head were well  grounded  this event  however  was at a great distance  it was reported  that the felons  of whom he was one  mutinied on board the ship in which  they had been embarked  in the affray that succeeded  it was said that  he was killed     among the nefarious deeds which he perpetrated was to be numbered the  seduction of a young lady  whose heart was broken by the detection of  his perfidy  the fruit of this unhappy union was a daughter  her mother  died shortly after her birth  her father was careless of her destiny   she was consigned to the care of a hireling  who  happily for the  innocent victim  performed the maternal offices for her own sake  and  did not allow the want of a stipulated recompense to render hor cruel or  neglectful     this orphan was sought out by the benevolence of mrs  lorimer and placed  under her own protection  she received from her the treatment of a  mother  the ties of kindred  corroborated by habit  was not the only  thing that united them  that resemblance to herself which had been so  deplorably defective in her brother was completely realized in his  offspring  nature seemed to have precluded every difference between them  but that of age  this darling object excited in her bosom more than  maternal sympathies  her soul clung to the happiness of her   clarice  with more ardour than to that of her own son  the latter  was not only less worthy of affection  but their separation necessarily  diminished their mutual confidence     it was natural for her to look forward to the future destiny of   clarice   on these occasions she could not help contemplating the  possibility of a union between her son and niece  considerable  advantages belonged to this scheme  yet it was the subject of hope  rather than the scope of a project  the contingencies were numerous and  delicate on which the ultimate desirableness of this union depended  she  was far from certain that her son would be worthy of this benefit  or  that  if he were worthy  his propensities would not select for  themselves a different object  it was equally dubious whether the young  lady would not think proper otherwise to dispose of her affections   these uncertainties could be dissipated only by time  meanwhile she was  chiefly solicitous to render them virtuous and wise     as they advanced in years  the hopes that she had formed were  annihilated  the youth was not exempt from egregious errors  in addition  to this  it was manifest that the young people were disposed to regard  each other in no other light than that of brother and sister  i was not  unapprized of her views  i saw that their union was impossible  i was  near enough to judge of the character of clarice  my youth and  intellectual constitution made me peculiarly susceptible to female  charms  i was her playfellow in childhood  and her associate in studies  and amusements at a maturer age  this situation might have been  suspected of a dangerous tendency  this tendency  however  was obviated  by motives of which i was  for a long time  scarcely conscious     i was habituated to consider the distinctions of rank as indelible  the  obstructions that existed  to any wish that i might form  were like  those of time and space  and  in their own nature  as insuperable     such was the state of things previous to our setting out upon our  travels  clarice was indirectly included in our correspondence  my  letters were open to her inspection  and i was sometimes honoured with a  few complimentary lines under her own hand  on returning to my ancient  abode  i was once more exposed to those sinister influences which  absence had at least suspended  various suitors had  meanwhile  been  rejected  their character  for the most part  had been such as to  account for her refusal  without resorting to the supposition of a  lurking or unavowed attachment     on our meeting she greeted me in a respectful but dignified manner   observers could discover in it nothing not corresponding to that  difference of fortune which subsisted between us  if her joy  on that  occasion  had in it some portion of tenderness  the softness of her  temper  and the peculiar circumstances in which we had been placed   being considered  the most rigid censor could find no occasion for blame  or suspicion     a year passed away  but not without my attention being solicited by  something new and inexplicable in my own sensations  at first i was not  aware of their true cause  but the gradual progress of my feelings left  me not long in doubt as to their origin  i was alarmed at the discovery   but my courage did not suddenly desert me  my hopes seemed to be  extinguished the moment that i distinctly perceived the point to which  they led  my mind had undergone a change  the ideas with which it was  fraught wrere varied  the sight or recollection of clarice was sure to  occasion my mind to advert to the recent discovery  and to revolve the  considerations naturally connected with it  some latent glows and secret  trepidations were likewise experienced  when  by some accident  our  meetings were abrupt or our interviews unwitnessed  yet my usual  tranquillity was not as yet sensibly diminished  i could bear to think  of her marriage with another without painful emotions  and was anxious  only that her choice should be judicious and fortunate     my thoughts could not long continue in this state  they gradually became  more ardent and museful  the image of clarice occurred with unseasonable  frequency  its charms were enhanced by some nameless and indefinable  additions  when it met me in the way i was irresistibly disposed to stop  and survey it with particular attention  the pathetic cast of her  features  the deep glow of her cheek  and some catch of melting music  she had lately breathed  stole incessantly upon my fancy  on recovering  from my thoughtful moods  i sometimes found my cheeks wet with tears  that had fallen unperceived  and my bosom heaved with involuntary sighs   these images did not content themselves with invading my wakeful hours   but  likewise  encroached upon my sleep  i could no longer resign myself  to slumber with the same ease as before  when i slept  my visions were  of the same impassioned tenor     there was no difficulty in judging rightly of my situation  i knew what  it was that duty exacted from me  to remain in my present situation was  a chimerical project  that time and reflection would suffice to restore  me to myself was a notion equally fallacious  yet i felt an  insupportable reluctance to change it  this reluctance was owing  not  wholly or chiefly to my growing passion  but to the attachment which  bound me to the service of my lady  all my contemplations had hitherto  been modelled on the belief of my remaining in my present situation  during my life  my mildest anticipations had never fashioned an event  like this  any misfortune was light in comparison with that which tore  me from her presence and service  but  should i ultimately resolve to  separate  how should i communicate my purpose  the pain of parting would  scarcely be less on her side than on mine  could i consent to be the  author of disquietude to her  i had consecrated all my faculties to her  service  this was the recompense which it was in my power to make for  the benefits that i had received  would not this procedure bear the  appearance of the basest ingratitude  the shadow of an imputation like  this was more excruciating than the rack     what motive could i assign for my conduct  the truth must not be told   this would be equivalent to supplicating for a new benefit  it would  more become me to lessen than increase my obligations  among all my  imaginations on this subject  the possibility of a mutual passion never  occurred to me  i could not be blind to the essential distinctions that  subsist among men  i could expatiate  like others  on the futility of  ribbons and titles  and on the dignity that was annexed to skill and  virtue  but these  for the most part  were the incoherences of  speculation  and in no degree influenced the stream of my actions and  practical sentiments  the barrier that existed in the present case i  deemed insurmountable  this was not even the subject of doubt  in  disclosing the truth  i should be conceived to be soliciting my lady s  mercy and intercession  but this would be the madness of presumption   let me impress her with any other opinion than that i go in search of  the happiness that i have lost under her roof  let me save her generous  heart from the pangs which this persuasion would infallibly produce     i could form no stable resolutions  i seemed unalterably convinced of  the necessity of separation  and yet could not execute my design  when i  had wrought up my mind to the intention of explaining myself on the next  interview  when the next interview took place my tongue was powerless  i  admitted any excuse for postponing my design  and gladly admitted any  topic  however foreign to my purpose     it must not be imagined that my health sustained no injury from this  conflict of my passions  my patroness perceived this alteration  she  inquired with the most affectionate solicitude into the cause  it could  not be explained  i could safely make light of it  and represented it as  something which would probably disappear of itself  as it originated  without any adequate cause  she was obliged to acquiesce in my imperfect  account     day after day passed in this state of fluctuation  i was conscious of  the dangers of delay  and that procrastination  without rendering the  task less necessary  augmented its difficulties  at length  summoning my  resolution  i demanded an audience  she received me with her usual  affability  common topics were started  but she saw the confusion and  trepidation of my thoughts  and quickly relinquished them  she then  noticed to me what she had observed  and mentioned the anxiety which  these appearances had given her she reminded me of the maternal regard  which she had always manifested towards me  and appealed to my own heart  whether any thing could be said in vindication of that reserve with  which i had lately treated her  and urged me  as i valued her good  opinion  to explain the cause of a dejection  that was too  visible      to all this i could make but one answer    think me not  madam  perverse  or ungrateful  i came just now to apprize you of a resolution that i had  formed  i cannot explain the motives that induce me  in this case  to  lie to you would be unpardonable  and  since i cannot assign my true  motives  i will not mislead you by false representations  i came to  inform you of my intention to leave your service  and to retire  with  the fruits of your bounty  to my native village  where i shall spend my  life  i hope  in peace      her surprise at this declaration was beyond measure  she could not  believe her ears  she had not heard me rightly  she compelled me to  repeat it  still i was jesting  i could not possibly mean what my words  imported     i assured her  in terms still more explicit  that my resolution was  taken and was unalterable  and again entreated her to spare me the task  of assigning my motives     this was a strange determination  what could be the grounds of this new  scheme  what could be the necessity of hiding them from her  this  mystery was not to be endured  she could by no means away with it  she  thought it hard that i should abandon her at this time  when she stood  in particular need of my assistance and advice  she would refuse nothing  to make my situation eligible  i had only to point out where she was  deficient in her treatment of me  and she would endeavour to supply it   she was willing to augment my emoluments in any degree that i desired   she could not think of parting with me  but  at any rate  she must be  informed of my motives      it is a hard task   answered i   that i have imposed upon myself  i  foresaw its difficulties  and this foresight has hitherto prevented me  from undertaking it  but the necessity by which i am impelled will no  longer be withstood  i am determined to go  but to say why is  impossible  i hope i shall not bring upon myself the imputation of  ingratitude  but this imputation  more intolerable than any other  must  be borne  if it cannot be avoided but by this disclosure      keep your motives to yourself   said she   i have too good an opinion  of you to suppose that you would practise concealment without good  reason  i merely desire you to remain where you are  since you will not  tell me why you take up this new scheme  i can only say that it is  impossible there should be any advantage in this scheme  i will not hear  of it  i tell you  therefore  submit to my decree with a good grace      notwithstanding this prohibition  i persisted in declaring that my  determination was fixed  and that the motives that governed me would  allow of no alternative      so  you will go  will you  whether i will or no  i have no power to  detain you  you will regard nothing that i can say       believe me  madam  no resolution ever was formed after a more vehement  struggle  if my motives were known  you would not only cease to oppose   but would hasten  my departure  honour me so far with your good opinion  as to believe that  in saying this  i say nothing but the truth  and  render my duty less burdensome by cheerfully acquiescing in its  dictates       i would   replied the lady   i could find somebody that has more power  over you than i have  whom shall i call in to aid me in this arduous  task       nay  dear madam  if i can resist your entreaties  surely no other can  hope to succeed       i am not sure of that   said my friend  archly   there is one person in  the world whose supplications  i greatly suspect  you would not  withstand       whom do you mean   said i  in some trepidation      you will know presently  unless i can prevail upon you  i shall be  obliged to call for assistance       spare me the pain of repeating that no power on earth can change my  resolution       that s a fib   she rejoined  with increased archness   you know it is   if a certain person entreat you to stay  you will easily comply  i see i  cannot hope to prevail by my own strength  that is a mortifying  consideration  but we must not part  that is a point settled  if nothing  else will do  i must go and fetch my advocate  stay here a moment      i had scarcely time to breathe  before she returned  leading in clarice   i did not yet comprehend the meaning of this ceremony  the lady was  overwhelmed with sweet confusion  averted eyes and reluctant steps might  have explained to me the purpose of this meeting  if i had believed that  purpose to be possible  i felt the necessity of new fortitude  and  struggled to recollect the motives that had hitherto sustained me      there   said my patroness   i have been endeavouring to persuade this  young man to live with us a little longer  he is determined  it seems   to change his abode  he will not tell why  and i do not care to know   unless i could show his reasons to be groundless  i have merely  remonstrated with him on the folly of his scheme  but he has proved  refractory to all i can say  perhaps your efforts may meet with better  success      clarice said not a word  my own embarrassment equally disabled me from  speaking  regarding us both  for some time  with a benign aspect  mrs   lorimer resumed  taking a hand of each and joining them together        i very well know what it was that suggested this scheme  it is strange  that you should suppose me so careless an observer as not to note  or  not to understand  your situation  i am as well acquainted with what is  passing in your heart as you yourself are  but why are you so anxious to  conceal it  you know less of the adventurousness of love than i should  have suspected  but i will not trifle with your feelings      you  clithero  know the wishes that i once cherished  i had hoped that  my son would have found  in this darling child  an object worthy of his  choice  and that my girl would have preferred him to all others  but i  have long since discovered that this could not be  they are nowise  suited to each other  there is one thing in the next place desirable   and now my wishes are accomplished  i see that you love each other  and  never  in my opinion  was a passion more rational and just  i should  think myself the worst of beings if i did not contribute all in my power  to your happiness  there is not the shadow of objection to your union  i  know your scruples  clithero  and am sorry to see that you harbour them  for a moment  nothing is more unworthy of your good sense      i found out this girl long ago  take my word for it  young man  she  does not fall short of you in the purity and tenderness of her  attachment  what need is there of tedious preliminaries  i will leave  you together  and hope you will not be long in coming to a mutual  understanding  your union cannot be completed too soon for my wishes   clarice is my only and darling daughter  as to you  clithero  expect  henceforth that treatment from me  not only to which your own merit  entitles you  but which is due to the husband of my daughter    with  these words she retired  and left us together     great god  deliver me from the torments of this remembrance  that a  being by whom i was snatched from penury and brutal ignorance  exalted  to some rank in the intelligent creation  reared to affluence and  honour  and thus  at last  spontaneously endowed with all that remained  to complete the sum of my felicity  that a being like this but such  thoughts must not yet be  i must shut them out  or i shall never arrive  at the end of my tale  my efforts have been thus far successful  i have  hitherto been able to deliver a coherent narrative  let the last words  that i shall speak afford some glimmering of my better days  let me  execute without faltering the only task that remains for me           chapter vi       how propitious  how incredible  was this event  i could scarcely confide  in the testimony of my senses  was it true that clarice was before me   that she was prepared to countenance my presumption  that she had  slighted obstacles which i had deemed insurmountable  that i was fondly  beloved by her  and should shortly be admitted to the possession of so  inestimable a good  i will not repeat the terms in which i poured forth   at her feet  the raptures of my gratitude  my impetuosity soon extorted  from clarice a confirmation of her mother s declaration  an unrestrained  intercourse was thenceforth established between us  dejection and  languor gave place  in my bosom  to the irradiations of joy and hope  my  flowing fortunes seemed to have attained their utmost and immutable  height     alas  they were destined to ebb with unspeakably greater rapidity  and  to leave me  in a moment  stranded and wrecked     our nuptials would have been solemnized without delay  had not a  melancholy duty interfered  clarice had a friend in a distant part of  the kingdom  her health had long been the prey of a consumption  she was  now evidently tending to dissolution  in this extremity she entreated  her friend to afford her the consolation of her presence  the only wish  that remained was to die in her arms     this request could not but be willingly complied with  it became me  patiently to endure the delay that would thence arise to the completion  of my wishes  considering the urgency and mournfulness of the occasion   it was impossible for me to murmur  and the affectionate clarice would  suffer nothing to interfere with the duty which she owed to her dying  friend  i accompanied her on this journey  remained with her a few days   and then parted from her to return to the metropolis  it was not  imagined that it would be necessary to prolong her absence beyond a  month  when i bade her farewell  and informed her on what day i proposed  to return for her  i felt no decay of my satisfaction  my thoughts were  bright and full of exultation  why was not some intimation afforded me  of the snares that lay in my path  in the train laid for my destruction   the agent had so skilfully contrived that my security was not molested  by the faintest omen     i hasten to the crisis of my tale  i am almost dubious of my strength   the nearer i approach to it  the stronger is my aversion  my courage   instead of gathering force as i proceed  decays  i am willing to dwell  still longer on preliminary circumstances  there are other incidents  without which my story would be lame  i retail them because they afford  me a kind of respite from horrors at the thought of which every joint in  my frame trembles  they must be endured  but that infirmity may be  forgiven which makes me inclined to procrastinate my suffering     i mentioned the lover whom my patroness was compelled  by the  machinations of her brother  to discard  more than twenty years had  passed since their separation  his birth was mean and he was without  fortune  his profession was that of a surgeon  my lady not only  prevailed upon him to abandon his country  but enabled him to do this by  supplying his necessities from her own purse  his excellent  understanding was  for a time  obscured by passion  but it was not  difficult for my lady ultimately to obtain his concurrence to all her  schemes  he saw and adored the rectitude of her motives  did not disdain  to accept her gifts  and projected means for maintaining an epistolary  intercourse during their separation     her interest procured him a post in the service of the east india  company  she was  from time to time  informed of his motions  a war  broke out between the company and some of the native powers  he was  present at a great battle in which the english were defeated  she could  trace him by his letters and by other circumstances thus far  but here  the thread was discontinued  and no means which she employed could  procure any tidings of him  whether he was captive  or dead  continued   for several years  to be merely matter of conjecture     on my return to dublin  i found my patroness engaged in conversation  with a stranger  she introduced us to each other in a manner that  indicated the respect which she entertained for us both  i surveyed and  listened to him with considerable attention  his aspect was noble and  ingenuous  but his sunburnt and rugged features bespoke a various and  boisterous pilgrimage  the furrows of his brow were the products of  vicissitude and hardship  rather than of age  his accents were fiery and  energetic  and the impassioned boldness of his address  as well as the  tenor of his discourse  full of allusions to the past  and regrets that  the course of events had not been different  made me suspect something  extraordinary in his character     as soon as he left us  my lady explained who he was  he was no other  than the object of her youthful attachment  who had  a few days before   dropped among us as from the skies  he had a long and various story to  tell  he had accounted for his silence by enumerating the incidents of  his life  he had escaped from the prisons of hyder  had wandered on  foot  and under various disguises  through the northern district of  hindostan  he was sometimes a scholar of benares  and sometimes a  disciple of the mosque  according to the exigencies of the times  he was  a pilgrim to mecca or to juggernaut  by a long  circuitous  and perilous  route  he at length arrived at the turkish capital  here he resided for  several years  deriving a precarious subsistence from the profession of  a surgeon  he was obliged to desert this post  in consequence of a duel  between two scotsmen  one of them had embraced the greek religion  and  was betrothed to the daughter of a wealthy trader of that nation  he  perished in the conflict  and the family of the lady not only procured  the execution of his antagonist  but threatened to involve all those who  were known to be connected with him in the same ruin     his life being thus endangered  it became necessary for him to seek a  new residence  he fled from constantinople with such precipitation as  reduced him to the lowest poverty  he had traversed the indian conquests  of alexander  as a mendicant  in the same character  he now wandered  over the native country of philip and philopoemen  he passed safely  through multiplied perils  and finally  embarking at salonica  he  reached venice  he descended through the passes of the apennines into  tuscany  in this journey he suffered a long detention from banditti  by  whom he was waylaid  in consequence of his harmless deportment  and a  seasonable display of his chirurgical skill  they granted him his life   though they  for a time  restrained him of his liberty  and compelled  him to endure their society  the time was not misemployed which he spent  immured in caverns and carousing with robbers  his details were  eminently singular and curious  and evinced the acuteness of his  penetration  as well as the steadfastness of his courage     after emerging from these wilds  he found his way along the banks of the  arno to leghorn  thence he procured a passage to america  whence he had  just returned  with many additions to his experience  but none to his  fortune     this was a remarkable event  it did not at first appear how far its  consequences would extend  the lady was  at present  disengaged and  independent  though the passion which clouded her early prosperity was  extinct  time had not diminished the worth of her friend  and they were  far from having reached that age when love becomes chimerical and  marriage folly  a confidential intercourse was immediately established  between them  the bounty of mrs  lorimer soon divested her friend of all  fear of poverty   at any rate   said she   he shall wander no farther   but shall be comfortably situated for the rest of his life   all his  scruples were vanquished by the reasonableness of her remonstrances and  the vehemence of her solicitations     a cordial intimacy grew between me and the newly arrived  our interviews  were frequent  and our communications without reserve  he detailed to me  the result of his experience  and expatiated without end on the history  of his actions and opinions  he related the adventures of his youth  and  dwelt upon all the circumstances of his attachment to my patroness  on  this subject i had heard only general details  i continually found  cause  in the course of his narrative  to revere the illustrious  qualities of my lady  and to weep at the calamities to which the  infernal malice of her brother had subjected her     the tale of that man s misdeeds  amplified and dramatized by the  indignant eloquence of this historian  oppressed me with astonishment   if a poet had drawn such a portrait  i should have been prone to suspect  the soundness of his judgment  till now i had imagined that no character  was uniform and unmixed  and my theory of the passions did not enable me  to account for a propensity gratified merely by evil  and delighting in  shrieks and agony for their own sake     it was natural to suggest to my friend  when expatiating on this theme   an inquiry as to how far subsequent events had obliterated the  impressions that were then made  and as to the plausibility of reviving   at this more auspicious period  his claims on the heart of his friend   when he thought proper to notice these hints  he gave me to understand  that time had made no essential alteration in his sentiments in this  respect  that he still fostered a hope  to which every day added new  vigour  that  whatever was the ultimate event  he trusted in his  fortitude to sustain it  if adverse  and in his wisdom to extract from  it the most valuable consequences  if it should prove prosperous     the progress of things was not unfavourable to his hopes  she treated  his insinuations and professions with levity  but her arguments seemed  to be urged with no other view than to afford an opportunity of  confutation  and  since there was no abatement of familiarity and  kindness  there was room to hope that the affair would terminate  agreeably to his wishes           chapter vii       clarice  meanwhile  was absent  her friend seemed  at the end of a  month  to be little less distant from the grave than at first  my  impatience would not allow me to wait till her death  i visited her  but  was once more obliged to return alone  i arrived late in the city  and   being greatly fatigued  i retired almost immediately to my chamber     on hearing of my arrival  sarsefield hastened to see me  he came to my  bedside  and such  in his opinion  was the importance of the tidings  which he had to communicate  that he did not scruple to rouse me from a  deep sleep          at this period of his narrative  clithero stopped  his complexion varied  from one degree of paleness to another  his brain appeared to suffer  some severe constriction  he desired to be excused  for a few minutes   from proceeding  in a short time he was relieved from this paroxysm  and  resumed his tale with an accent tremulous at first  but acquiring  stability and force as he went on         on waking  as i have said  i found my friend seated at my bedside  his  countenance exhibited various tokens of alarm  as soon as i perceived  who it was  i started  exclaiming   what is the matter      he sighed   pardon   said he   this unseasonable intrusion  a light  matter would not have occasioned it  i have waited  for two days past   in an agony of impatience  for your return  happily you are  at last   come  i stand in the utmost need of your counsel and aid       heaven defend   cried i   this is a terrible prelude  you may  of  course  rely upon my assistance and advice  what is it that you have to  propose       tuesday evening   he answered   i spent here  it was late before i  returned to my lodgings  i was in the act of lifting my hand to the  bell  when my eye was caught by a person standing close to the wall  at  the distance of ten paces  his attitude was that of one employed in  watching my motions  his face was turned towards me  and happened  at  that moment  to be fully illuminated by the rays of a globe lamp that  hung over the door  i instantly recognised his features  i was  petrified  i had no power to execute my design  or even to move  but  stood  for some seconds  gazing upon him  he was  in no degree   disconcerted by the eagerness of my scrutiny  he seemed perfectly  indifferent to the consequences of being known  at length he slowly  turned his eyes to another quarter  but without changing his posture  or  the sternness of his looks  i cannot describe to you the shock which  this encounter produced in me  at last i went into the house  and have  ever since been excessively uneasy       i do not see any ground for uneasiness       you do not then suspect who this person is       no       it is arthur wiatte       good heaven  it is impossible  what  my lady s brother       the same       it cannot be  were we not assured of his death  that he perished in a  mutiny on board the vessel in which he was embarked for transportation       such was rumour  which is easily mistaken  my eyes cannot be deceived  in this case  i should as easily fail to recognise his sister  when i  first met her  as him  this is the man  whether once dead or not  he is  at present alive  and in this city       but has any thing since happened to confirm you in this opinion       yes  there has  as soon as i had recovered from my first surprise  i  began to reflect upon the measures proper to be taken  this was the  identical arthur wiatte  you know his character  no time was likely to  change the principles of such a man  but his appearance sufficiently  betrayed the incurableness of his habits  the same sullen and atrocious  passions were written in his visage  you recollect the vengeance which  wiatte denounced against his sister  there is every thing to dread from  his malignity  how to obviate the danger  i know not  i thought   however  of one expedient  it might serve a present purpose  and  something better might suggest itself on your return      i came hither early the next day  old gowan  the porter  is well  acquainted with wiatte s story  i mentioned to him that i had reason to  think that he had returned  i charged him to have a watchful eye upon  every one that knocked at the gate  and that  if this person should  come  by no means to admit him  the old man promised faithfully to abide  by my directions  his terrors  indeed  were greater than mine  and he  knew the importance of excluding wiatte from these walls       did you not inform my lady of this       no  in what way could i tell it to her  what end could it answer  why  should i make her miserable  but i have not done  yesterday morning  gowan took me aside  and informed me that wiatte had made his  appearance  the day before  at the gate  he knew him  he said  in a  moment  he demanded to see the lady  but the old man told him she was  engaged  and could not be seen  he assumed peremptory and haughty airs   and asserted that his business was of such importance as not to endure a  moment s delay  gowan persisted in his first refusal  he retired with  great reluctance  but said he should return to morrow  when he should  insist upon admission to the presence of the lady  i have inquired  and  find that he has not repeated his visit  what is to be done      i was equally at a loss with my friend  this incident was so  unlooked for  what might not be dreaded from the monstrous depravity of  wiatte  his menaces of vengeance against his sister still rung in my ears   some means of eluding them were indispensable  could law be resorted to   against an evil like this  no legal provision had been made  nine years  had elapsed since his transportation  seven years was the period of his  exile  in returning  therefore  he had committed no crime  his person  could not be lawfully molested  we were justified merely in repelling an  attack  but suppose we should appeal to law  could this be done without  the knowledge and concurrence of the lady  she would never permit it   her heart was incapable of fear from this quarter  she would spurn at  the mention of precautions against the hatred of her brother  her  inquietude would merely be awakened on his own account     i was overwhelmed with perplexity  perhaps if he were sought out  and  some judgment formed of the kind of danger to be dreaded from him  by a  knowledge of his situation and views  some expedient might be thence  suggested     but how should his haunts be discovered  this was easy  he had intimated  the design of applying again for admission to his sister  let a person  be stationed near at hand  who  being furnished with an adequate  description of his person and dress  shall mark him when he comes  and  follow him when he retires  and shall forthwith impart to us the  information on that head which he shall be able to collect     my friend concurred in this scheme  no better could  for the present  be  suggested  here ended our conference     i was thus supplied with a new subject of reflection  it was calculated  to fill my mind with dreary forebodings  the future was no longer a  scene of security and pleasure  it would be hard for those to partake of  our fears who did not partake of our experience  the existence of wiatte  was the canker that had blasted the felicity of my patroness  in his  reappearance on the stage there was something portentous  it seemed to  include in it consequences of the utmost moment  without my being able  to discover what these consequences were     that sarsefield should be so quickly followed by his arch foe  that they  started anew into existence  without any previous intimation  in a  manner wholly unexpected  and at the same period   it seemed as if there  lurked  under those appearances  a tremendous significance  which human  sagacity could not uncover  my heart sunk within me when i reflected  that this was the father of my clarice  he by whose cruelty her mother  was torn from the enjoyment of untarnished honour  and consigned to  infamy and an untimely grave  he by whom herself was abandoned in the  helplessness of infancy  and left to be the prey of obdurate avarice   and the victim of wretches who traffic in virgin innocence  who had done  all that in him lay to devote her youth to guilt and misery  what were  the limits of his power  how may he exert the parental prerogatives     to sleep  while these images were haunting me  was impossible  i passed  the night in continual motion  i strode  without ceasing  across the  floor of my apartment  my mind was wrought to a higher pitch than i had  ever before experienced  the occasion  accurately considered  was far  from justifying the ominous inquietudes which i then felt  how  then   should i account for them     sarsefield probably enjoyed his usual slumber  his repose might not be  perfectly serene  but when he ruminated on impending or possible  calamities his tongue did not cleave to his mouth  his throat was not  parched with unquenchable thirst  he was not incessantly stimulated to  employ his superfluous fertility of thought in motion  if i trembled for  the safety of her whom i loved  and whose safety was endangered by being  the daughter of this miscreant  had he not equal reason to fear for her  whom he also loved  and who  as the sister of this ruffian  was  encompassed by the most alarming perils  yet he probably was calm while  i was harassed by anxieties     alas  the difference was easily explained  such was the beginning of a  series ordained to hurry me to swift destruction  such were the primary  tokens of the presence of that power by whose accursed machinations i  was destined to fall  you are startled at this declaration  it is one to  which you have been little accustomed  perhaps you regard it merely as  an effusion of frenzy  i know what i am saying  i do not build upon  conjectures and surmises  i care not  indeed  for your doubts  your  conclusion may be fashioned at your pleasure  would to heaven that my  belief were groundless  and that i had no reason to believe my  intellects to have been perverted by diabolical instigations     i could procure no sleep that night  after sarsefield s departure i did  not even lie down  it seemed to me that i could not obtain the benefits  of repose otherwise than by placing my lady beyond the possibility of  danger     i met sarsefield the next day  in pursuance of the scheme which had been  adopted by us on the preceding evening  a person was selected and  commissioned to watch the appearance of wiatte  the day passed as usual  with respect to the lady  in the evening she was surrounded by a few  friends  into this number i was now admitted  sarsefield and myself made  a part of this company  various topics were discussed with ease and  sprightliness  her societies were composed of both sexes  and seemed to  have monopolized all the ingenuity and wit that existed in the  metropolis     after a slight repast the company dispersed  this separation took place  earlier than usual  on account of a slight indisposition in mrs    lorimer   sarsefield and i went out together  we took that  opportunity of examining our agent  and  receiving no satisfaction from  him  we dismissed him for that night  enjoining him to hold himself in  readiness for repeating the experiment to morrow  my friend directed his  steps homeward  and i proceeded to execute a commission with which i had  charged myself     a few days before  a large sum had been deposited in the hands of a  banker  for the use of my lady  it was the amount of a debt which had  lately been recovered  it was lodged here for the purpose of being paid  on demand of her or her agents  it was my present business to receive  this money  i had deferred the performance of this engagement to this  late hour  on account of certain preliminaries which were necessary to  be adjusted     having received this money  i prepared to return home  the inquietude  which had been occasioned by sarsefield s intelligence had not  incapacitated me from performing my usual daily occupations  it was a  theme to which  at every interval of leisure from business or discourse   i did not fail to return  at those times i employed myself in examining  the subject on all sides  in supposing particular emergencies  and  delineating the conduct that was proper to be observed on each  my daily  thoughts were  by no means  so fear inspiring as the meditations of the  night had been     as soon as i left the banker s door  my meditations fell into this  channel  i again reviewed the recent occurrences  and imagined the  consequences likely to flow from them  my deductions were not  on this  occasion  peculiarly distressful  the return of darkness had added  nothing to my apprehensions  i regarded wiatte merely as one against  whose malice it was wise to employ the most vigilant precautions  in  revolving these precautions nothing occurred that was new  the danger  appeared without unusual aggravations  and the expedients that offered  themselves to my choice were viewed with a temper not more sanguine or  despondent than before     in this state of mind i began and continued my walk  the distance was  considerable between my own habitation and that which i had left  my way  lay chiefly through populous and well frequented streets  in one part of  the way  however  it was at the option of the passenger either to keep  along the large streets  or considerably to shorten the journey by  turning into a dark  crooked  and narrow lane  being familiar with every  part of this metropolis  and deeming it advisable to take the shortest  and obscurest road  i turned into the alley  i proceeded without  interruption to the next turning  one night officer  distinguished by  his usual ensigns  was the only person who passed me  i had gone three  steps beyond when i perceived a man by my side  i had scarcely time to  notice this circumstance  when a hoarse voice exclaimed   damn ye   villain  ye re a dead man      at the same moment a pistol flashed at my ear  and a report followed   this  however  produced no other effect than  for a short space  to  overpower my senses  i staggered back  but did not fall     the ball  as i afterwards discovered  had grazed my forehead  but  without making any dangerous impression  the assassin  perceiving that  his pistol had been ineffectual  muttered  in an enraged tone   this  shall do your business   at the same time  he drew a knife forth from  his bosom     i was able to distinguish this action by the rays of a distant lamp   which glistened on the blade  all this passed in an instant  the attack  was so abrupt that my thoughts could not be suddenly recalled from the  confusion into which they were thrown  my exertions were mechanical  my  will might be said to be passive  and it was only by retrospect and a  contemplation of consequences that i became fully informed of the nature  of the scene     if my assailant had disappeared as soon as he had discharged the pistol   my state of extreme surprise might have slowly given place to resolution  and activity  as it was  my sense was no sooner struck by the reflection  from the blade  than my hand  as if by spontaneous energy  was thrust  into my pocket  i drew forth a pistol     he lifted up his weapon to strike  but it dropped from his powerless  fingers  he fell  and his groans informed me that i had managed my arms  with more skill than my adversary  the noise of this encounter soon  attracted spectators  lights were brought  and my antagonist discovered  bleeding at my feet  i explained  as briefly as i was able  the scene  which they witnessed  the prostrate person was raised by two men  and  carried into a public house nigh at hand     i had not lost my presence of mind  i at once perceived the propriety of  administering assistance to the wounded man  i despatched  therefore   one of the bystanders for a surgeon of considerable eminence  who lived  at a small distance  and to whom i was well known  the man was carried  into an inner apartment and laid upon the floor  it was not till now  that i had a suitable opportunity of ascertaining who it was with whom i  had been engaged  i now looked upon his face  the paleness of death  could not conceal his well known features  it was wiatte himself who was  breathing his last groans at my feet     the surgeon  whom i had summoned  attended  but immediately perceived  the condition of his patient to be hopeless  in a quarter of an hour he  expired  during this interval  he was insensible to all around him  i  was known to the surgeon  the landlord  and some of the witnesses  the  case needed little explanation  the accident reflected no guilt upon me   the landlord was charged with the care of the corpse till the morning   and i was allowed to return home  without further impediment           chapter viii       till now my mind had been swayed by the urgencies of this occasion   these reflections were excluded  which rushed tumultuously upon me the  moment i was at leisure to receive them  without foresight of a previous  moment  an entire change had been wrought in my condition     i had been oppressed with a sense of the danger that flowed from the  existence of this man  by what means the peril could be annihilated  and  we be placed in security from his attempts  no efforts of mind could  suggest  to devise these means  and employ them with success  demanded   as i conceived  the most powerful sagacity and the firmest courage  now  the danger was no more  the intelligence in which plans of mischief  might be generated was extinguished or flown  lifeless were the hands  ready to execute the dictates of that intelligence  the contriver of  enormous evil was  in one moment  bereft of the power and the will to  injure  our past tranquillity had been owing to the belief of his death   fear and dismay had resumed their dominion when the mistake was  discovered  but now we might regain possession of our wonted confidence   i had beheld with my own eyes the lifeless corpse of our implacable  adversary  thus  in a moment  had terminated his long and flagitious  career  his restless indignation  his malignant projects  that had so  long occupied the stage and been so fertile of calamity  were now at an  end     in the course of my meditations  the idea of the death of this man had  occurred  and it bore the appearance of a desirable event  yet it was  little qualified to tranquillize my fears  in the long catalogue of  contingencies  this  indeed  was to be found  but it was as little  likely to happen as any other  it could not happen without a series of  anterior events paving the way for it  if his death came from us  it  must be the theme of design  it must spring from laborious circumvention  and deep laid stratagems     no  he was dead  i had killed him  what had i done  i had meditated  nothing  i was impelled by an unconscious necessity  had the assailant  been my father  the consequence would have been the same  my  understanding had been neutral  could it be  in a space so short  was it  possible that so tremendous a deed had been executed  was i not deceived  by some portentous vision  i had witnessed the convulsions and last  agonies of wiatte  he was no more  and i was his destroyer     such was the state of my mind for some time after this dreadful event   previously to it i was calm  considerate  and self collected  i marked  the way that i was going  passing objects were observed  if i adverted  to the series of my own reflections  my attention was not seized and  fastened by them  i could disengage myself at pleasure  and could pass   without difficulty  from attention to the world within  to the  contemplation of that without     now my liberty  in this respect  was at an end  i was fettered   confounded  smitten with excess of thought  and laid prostrate with  wonder  i no longer attended to my steps  when i emerged from my stupor   i found that i had trodden back the way which i had lately come  and had  arrived within sight of the banker s door  i checked myself  and once  more turned my steps homeward     this seemed to be a hint for entering into new reflections   the deed    said i   is irretrievable  i have killed the brother of my patroness   the father of my love      this suggestion was new  it instantly involved me in terror and  perplexity  how shall i communicate the tidings  what effect will they  produce  my lady s sagacity is obscured by the benevolence of her  temper  her brother was sordidly wicked   a hoary ruffian  to whom the  language of pity was as unintelligible as the gabble of monkeys  his  heart was fortified against compunction  by the atrocious habits of  forty years  he lived only to interrupt her peace  to confute the  promises of virtue  and convert to rancour and reproach the fair dame of  fidelity     he was her brother still  as a human being  his depravity was never  beyond the health restoring power of repentance  his heart  so long as  it beat  was accessible to remorse  the singularity of his birth had  made her regard this being as more intimately her brother  than would  have happened in different circumstances  it was her obstinate  persuasion that their fates were blended  the rumour of his death she  had never credited  it was a topic of congratulation to her friends  but  of mourning and distress to her  that he would one day reappear upon the  stage  and assume the dignity of virtue  was a source of consolation  with which she would never consent to part     her character was now known  when the doom of exile was pronounced upon  him  she deemed it incumbent on her to vindicate herself from aspersions  founded on misconceptions of her motives in refusing her interference   the manuscript  though unpublished  was widely circulated  none could  resist her simple and touching eloquence  nor rise from the perusal  without resigning his heart to the most impetuous impulses of  admiration  and enlisting himself among the eulogists of her justice and  her fortitude  this was the only monument  in a written form  of her  genius  as such it was engraven on my memory  the picture that it  described was the perpetual companion of my thoughts     alas  it had  perhaps  been well for me if it had been buried in eternal  oblivion  i read in it the condemnation of my deed  the agonies she was  preparing to suffer  and the indignation that would overflow upon the  author of so signal a calamity     i had rescued my life by the sacrifice of his  whereas i should have  died  wretched and precipitate coward  what had become of my boasted  gratitude  such was the zeal that i had vowed to her  such the services  which it was the business of my life to perform  i had snatched her  brother from existence  i had torn from her the hope which she so  ardently and indefatigably cherished  from a contemptible and dastardly  regard to my own safety i had failed in the moment of trial and when  called upon by heaven to evince the sincerity of my professions     she had treated my professions lightly  my vows of eternal devotion she  had rejected with lofty disinterestedness  she had arraigned my  impatience of obligation as criminal  and condemned every scheme i had  projected for freeing myself from the burden which her beneficence had  laid upon me  the impassioned and vehement anxiety with which  in former  days  she had deprecated the vengeance of her lover against wiatte  rung  in my ears  my senses were shocked anew by the dreadful sounds   touch  not my brother  wherever you meet with him  of whatever outrage he be  guilty  suffer him to pass in safety  despise me  abandon me  kill me   all this i can bear even from you  but spare  i implore you  my unhappy  brother  the stroke that deprives him of life will not only have the  same effect upon me  but will set my portion in everlasting misery      to these supplications i had been deaf  it is true i had not rushed upon  him unarmed  intending no injury nor expecting any  of that degree of  wickedness i was  perhaps  incapable  alas  i have immersed myself  sufficiently deep in crimes  i have trampled under foot every motive  dear to the heart of honour  i have shown myself unworthy the society of  men     such were the turbulent suggestions of that moment  my pace slackened  i  stopped  and was obliged to support myself against a wall  the sickness  that had seized my heart penetrated every part of my frame  there was  but one thing wanting to complete my distraction    my lady   said i    believed her fate to be blended with that of wiatte  who shall affirm  that the persuasion is a groundless one  she had lived and prospered   notwithstanding the general belief that her brother was dead  she would  not hearken to the rumour  why  because nothing less than indubitable  evidence would suffice to convince her  because the counter intimation  flowed from an infallible source  how can the latter supposition be  confuted  has she not predicted the event      the period of terrible fulfilment has arrived  the same blow that  bereaved  him  of life has likewise ratified her doom      she has been deceived  it is nothing more  perhaps  than a fond  imagination  it matters not  who knows not the cogency of faith  that  the pulses of life are at the command of the will  the bearer of these  tidings will be the messenger of death  a fatal sympathy will seize her   she will shrink  and swoon  and perish  at the news      fond and short sighted wretch  this is the price thou hast given for  security  in the rashness of thy thought  thou saidst   nothing is  wanting but his death to restore us to confidence and safety   lo  the  purchase is made  havoc and despair  that were restrained during his  life  were let loose by his last sigh  now only is destruction made  sure  thy lady  thy clarice  thy friend  and thyself  are  by this act   involved in irretrievable and common ruin      i started from my attitude  i was scarcely conscious of any transition   the interval was fraught with stupor  and amazement  it seemed as if my  senses had been hushed in sleep  while the powers of locomotion were  unconsciously exerted to bear me to my chamber  by whatever means the  change was effected  there i was     i have been able to proceed thus far  i can scarcely believe the  testimony of my memory that assures me of this  my task is almost  executed  but whence shall i obtain strength enough to finish it  what i  have told is light as gossamer  compared with the insupportable and  crushing horrors of that which is to come  heaven  in token of its  vengeance  will enable me to proceed  it is fitting that my scene should  thus close     my fancy began to be infected with the errors of my understanding  the  mood into which my mind was plunged was incapable of any propitious  intermission  all within me was tempestuous and dark  my ears were  accessible to no sounds but those of shrieks and lamentations  it was  deepest midnight  and all the noises of a great metropolis were hushed   yet i listened as if to catch some strain of the dirge that was begun   sable robes  sobs  and a dreary solemnity encompassed me on all sides  i  was haunted to despair by images of death  imaginary clamours  and the  train of funeral pageantry  i seemed to have passed forward to a distant  era of my life  the effects which were come were already realized  the  foresight of misery created it  and set me in the midst of that hell  which i feared     from a paroxysm like this the worst might reasonably be dreaded  yet the  next step to destruction was not suddenly taken  i paused on the brink  of the precipice  as if to survey the depth of that frenzy that invaded  me  was able to ponder on the scene  and deliberate  in a state that  partook of calm  on the circumstances of my situation  my mind was  harassed by the repetition of one idea  conjecture deepened into  certainty  i could place the object in no light which did not  corroborate the persuasion that  in the act committed  i had insured the  destruction of my lady  at length my mind  somewhat relieved from the  tempest of my fears  began to trace and analyze the consequences which i  dreaded     the fate of wiatte would inevitably draw along with it that of his  sister  in what way would this effect be produced  were they linked  together by a sympathy whose influence was independent of sensible  communication  could she arrive at a knowledge of his miserable and by  other than verbal means  i had heard of such extraordinary  copartnerships in being and modes of instantaneous intercourse among  beings locally distant  was this a new instance of the subtlety of mind   had she already endured his agonies  and like him already ceased to  breathe     every hair bristled at this horrible suggestion  but the force of  sympathy might be chimerical  buried in sleep  or engaged in careless  meditation  the instrument by which her destiny might be accomplished  was the steel of an assassin  a series of events  equally beyond the  reach of foresight with those which had just happened  might introduce   with equal abruptness  a similar disaster  what  at that moment  was her  condition  reposing in safety in her chamber  as her family imagined   but were they not deceived  was she not a mangled corpse  whatever were  her situation  it could not be ascertained  except by extraordinary  means  till the morning  was it wise to defer the scrutiny till then   why not instantly investigate the truth     these ideas passed rapidly through my mind  a considerable portion of  time and amplification of phrase are necessary to exhibit  verbally   ideas contemplated in a space of incalculable brevity  with the same  rapidity i conceived the resolution of determining the truth of my  suspicions  all the family  but myself  were at rest  winding passages  would conduct me  without danger of disturbing them  to the hall  from  which double staircases ascended  one of these led to a saloon above  on  the east side of which was a door that communicated with a suite of  rooms occupied by the lady of the mansion  the first was an antechamber   in which a female servant usually lay  the second was the lady s own  bedchamber  this was a sacred recess  with whose situation  relative to  the other apartments of the building  i was well acquainted  but of  which i knew nothing from my own examination  having never been admitted  into it     thither i was now resolved to repair  i was not deterred by the sanctity  of the place and hour  i was insensible to all consequences but the  removal of my doubts  not that my hopes were balanced by my fears  that  the same tragedy had been performed in her chamber and in the street   nothing hindered me from believing with as much cogency as if my own  eyes had witnessed it  but the reluctance with which we admit a  detestable truth     to terminate a state of intolerable suspense  i resolved to proceed  forthwith to her chamber  i took the light and paced  with no  interruption  along the galleries  i used no precaution  if i had met a  servant or robber  i am not sure that i should have noticed him  my  attention was too perfectly engrossed to allow me to spare any to a  casual object  i cannot affirm that no one observed me  this  however   was probable from the distribution of the dwelling  it consisted of a  central edifice and two wings  one of which was appropriated to  domestics and the other  at the extremity of which my apartment was  placed  comprehended a library  and rooms for formal and social and  literary conferences  these  therefore  were deserted at night  and my  way lay along these  hence it was not likely that my steps would be  observed     i proceeded to the hall  the principal parlour was beneath her chamber   in the confusion of my thoughts  i mistook one for the other  i  rectified  as soon as i detected  my mistake  i ascended  with a beating  heart  the staircase  the door of the antechamber was unfastened  i  entered  totally regardless of disturbing the girl who slept within  the  bed which she occupied was concealed by curtains  whether she were  there  i did not stop to examine  i cannot recollect that any tokens  were given of wakefulness or alarm  it was not till i reached the door  of her own apartment that my heart began to falter     it was now that the momentousness of the question i was about to decide  rushed with its genuine force upon my apprehension  appalled and aghast   i had scarcely power to move the bolt  if the imagination of her death  was not to be supported  how should i bear the spectacle of wounds and  blood  yet this was reserved for me  a few paces would set me in the  midst of a scene of which i was the abhorred contriver  was it right to  proceed  there were still the remnants of doubt  my forebodings might  possibly be groundless  all within might be safety and serenity  a  respite might be gained from the execution of an irrevocable sentence   what could i do  was not any thing easy to endure in comparison with the  agonies of suspense  if i could not obviate the evil i must bear it  but  the torments of suspense were susceptible of remedy     i drew back the bolt  and entered with the reluctance of fear  rather  than the cautiousness of guilt  i could not lift my eyes from the  ground  i advanced to the middle of the room  not a sound like that of  the dying saluted my ear  at length  shaking off the fetters of  hopelessness  i looked up     i saw nothing calculated to confirm my fears  everywhere there reigned  quiet and order  my heart leaped with exultation   can it be   said i    that i have been betrayed with shadows   but this is not sufficient      within an alcove was the bed that belonged to her  if her safety were  inviolate  it was here that she reposed  what remained to convert  tormenting doubt into ravishing certainty  i was insensible to the  perils of my present situation  if she  indeed  were there  would not my  intrusion awaken her  she would start and perceive me  at this hour   standing at her bedside  how should i account for an intrusion so  unexampled and audacious  i could not communicate my fears  i could not  tell her that the blood with which my hands were stained had flowed from  the wounds of her brother     my mind was inaccessible to such considerations  they did not even  modify my predominant idea  obstacles like these  had they existed   would have been trampled under foot     leaving the lamp  that i bore  on the table  i approached the bed  i  slowly drew aside the curtain  and beheld her tranquilly slumbering  i  listened  but so profound was her sleep  that not even her breathings  could be overheard  i dropped the curtain and retired     how blissful and mild were the illuminations of my bosom at this  discovery  a joy that surpassed all utterance succeeded the fierceness  of desperation  i stood  for some moments  wrapped in delightful  contemplation  alas  it was a luminous but transient interval  the  madness to whose black suggestions it bore so strong a contrast began  now to make sensible approaches on my understanding      true   said i   she lives  her slumber is serene and happy  she is  blind to her approaching destiny  some hours will at least be rescued  from anguish and death  when she wakes  the phantom that soothed her  will vanish  the tidings cannot be withheld from her  the murderer of  thy brother cannot hope to enjoy thy smiles  those ravishing accents   with which thou hast used to greet me  will be changed  scowling and  reproaches  the invectives of thy anger and the maledictions of thy  justice  will rest upon my head      what is the blessing which i made the theme of my boastful arrogance   this interval of being and repose is momentary  she will awake  but only  to perish at the spectacle of my ingratitude  she will awake only to the  consciousness of instantly impending death  when she again sleeps she  will wake no more  i  her son   i  whom the law of my birth doomed to  poverty and hardship  but whom her unsolicited beneficence snatched from  those evils  and endowed with the highest good known to intelligent  beings  the consolations of science and the blandishments of  affluence   to whom the darling of her life  the offspring in whom are  faithfully preserved the lineaments of its angelic mother  she has not  denied  what is the recompense that i have made  how have i discharged  the measureless debt of gratitude to which she is entitled  thus        cannot my guilt be extenuated  is there not a good that i can do thee   must i perpetrate unmingled evil  is the province assigned me that of an  infernal emissary  whose efforts are concentred in a single purpose  and  that purpose a malignant one  i am the author of thy calamities   whatever misery is reserved for thee  i am the source whence it flows   can i not set bounds to the stream  cannot i prevent thee from returning  to a consciousness which  till it ceases to exist  will not cease to be  rent and mangled      yes  it is in my power to screen thee from the coming storm  to  accelerate thy journey to rest  i will do it      the impulse was not to be resisted  i moved with the suddenness of  lightning  armed with a pointed implement that lay    it was a dagger   as i set down the lamp  i struck the edge  yet i saw it not  or noticed  it not till i needed its assistance  by what accident it came hither  to  what deed of darkness it had already been subservient  i had no power to  inquire  i stepped to the table and seized it     the time which this action required was insufficient to save me  my doom  was ratified by powers which no human energies can counterwork   need i  go further  did you entertain any imagination of so frightful a  catastrophe  i am overwhelmed by turns with dismay and with wonder  i am  prompted by turns to tear my heart from my breast and deny faith to the  verdict of my senses     was it i that hurried to the deed  no  it was the demon that possessed  me  my limbs were guided to the bloody office by a power foreign and  superior to mine  i had been defrauded  for a moment  of the empire of  my muscles  a little moment for that sufficed   if my destruction had  not been decreed  why was the image of clarice so long excluded  yet why  do i say long  the fatal resolution was conceived  and i hastened to the  execution  in a period too brief for more than itself to be viewed by  the intellect     what then  were my hands imbrued in this precious blood  was it to this  extremity of horror that my evil genius was determined to urge me  too  surely this was his purpose  too surely i was qualified to be its  minister     i lifted the weapon  its point was aimed at the bosom of the sleeper   the impulse was given     at the instant a piercing shriek was uttered behind me  and a  stretched out hand  grasping the blade  made it swerve widely from its  aim  it descended  but without inflicting a wound  its force was spent  upon the bed     oh for words to paint that stormy transition  i loosed my hold of the  dagger  i started back  and fixed eyes of frantic curiosity on the  author of my rescue  he that interposed to arrest my deed  that started  into being and activity at a moment so pregnant with fate  without  tokens of his purpose or his coming being previously imparted  could  not  methought  be less than divinity     the first glance that i darted on this being corroborated my conjecture   it was the figure and lineaments of mrs  lorimer  negligently habited in  flowing and brilliant white  with features bursting with terror and  wonder  the likeness of that being who was stretched upon the bed now  stood before me     all that i am able to conceive of angel was comprised in the moral  constitution of this woman  that her genius had overleaped all bounds   and interposed to save her  was no audacious imagination  in the state  in which my mind then was  no other belief than this could occupy the  first place     my tongue was tied  i gazed by turns upon her who stood before me  and  her who lay upon the bed  and who  awakened by the shriek that had been  uttered  now opened her eyes  she started from her pillow  and  by  assuming a new and more distinct attitude  permitted me to recognise   clarice herself      three days before  i had left her  beside the bed of a dying friend  at  a solitary mansion in the mountains of donegal  here it had been her  resolution to remain till her friend should breathe her last  fraught  with this persuasion  knowing this to be the place and hour of repose of  my lady  hurried forward by the impetuosity of my own conceptions   deceived by the faint gleam which penetrated through the curtain and  imperfectly irradiated features which bore  at all times  a powerful  resemblance to those of mrs  lorimer  i had rushed to the brink of this  terrible precipice     why did i linger on the verge  why  thus perilously situated  did i not  throw myself headlong  the steel was yet in my hand  a single blow would  have pierced my heart  and shut out from my remembrance and foresight  the past and the future     the moment of insanity had gone by  and i was once more myself  instead  of regarding the act which i had meditated as the dictate of compassion  or of justice  it only added to the sum of my ingratitude  and gave  wings to the whirlwind that was sent to bear me to perdition     perhaps i was influenced by a sentiment which i had not leisure to  distribute into parts  my understanding was  no doubt  bewildered in the  maze of consequences which would spring from my act  how should i  explain my coming hither in this murderous guise  my arm lifted to  destroy the idol of my soul and the darling child of my patroness  in  what words should i unfold the tale of wiatte  and enumerate the motives  that terminated in the present scene  what penalty had not my  infatuation and cruelty deserved  what could i less than turn the  dagger s point against my own bosom     a second time  the blow was thwarted and diverted  once more this  beneficent interposer held my arm from the perpetration of a new  iniquity  once more frustrated the instigations of that demon  of whose  malice a mysterious destiny had consigned me to be the sport and the  prey     every new moment added to the sum of my inexpiable guilt  murder was  succeeded  in an instant  by the more detestable enormity of suicide   she to whom my ingratitude was flagrant in proportion to the benefits of  which she was the author  had now added to her former acts that of  rescuing me from the last of mischiefs     i threw the weapon on the floor  the zeal which prompted her to seize my  arm  this action occasioned to subside  and to yield place to those  emotions which this spectacle was calculated to excite  she watched me  in silence  and with an air of ineffable solicitude  clarice  governed  by the instinct of modesty  wrapped her bosom and face in the  bedclothes  and testified her horror by vehement but scarcely articulate  exclamations     i moved forward  but my steps were random and tottering  my thoughts  were fettered by reverie  and my gesticulations destitute of meaning  my  tongue faltered without speaking  and i felt as if life and death were  struggling within me for the mastery     my will  indeed  was far from being neutral in this contest  to such as  i  annihilation is the supreme good  to shake off the ills that fasten  on us by shaking off existence  is a lot which the system of nature has  denied to man  by escaping from life  i should be delivered from this  scene  but should only rush into a world of retribution  and be immersed  in new agonies     i was yet to live  no instrument of my deliverance was within reach  i  was powerless  to rush from the presence of these women to hide me  forever from their scrutiny and their upbraiding  to snatch from their  minds all traces of the existence of clithero  was the scope of  unutterable longings     urged to flight by every motive of which my nature was susceptible  i  was yet rooted to the spot  had the pause been only to be interrupted by  me  it would have lasted forever     at length  the lady  clasping her hands and lifting them  exclaimed  in  a tone melting into pity and grief        clithero  what is this  how came you hither  and why      i struggled for utterance    i came to murder you  your brother has  perished by my hands  fresh from the commission of this deed  i have  hastened hither to perpetrate the same crime upon you       my brother   replied the lady  with new vehemence   oh  say not so  i  have just heard of his return  from sarsefield  and that he lives       he is dead   repeated i  with fierceness   i know it  it was i that  killed him       dead   she faintly articulated   and by thee  clithero  oh  cursed  chance that hindered thee from killing me also  dead  then is the omen  fulfilled  then am i undone  lost forever      her eyes now wandered from me  and her countenance sunk into a wild and  rueful expression  hope was utterly extinguished in her heart  and life  forsook her at the same moment  she sunk upon the floor pallid and  breathless     how she came into possession of this knowledge i know not  it is  possible that sarsefield had repented of concealment  and  in the  interval that passed between our separation and my encounter with  wiatte  had returned  and informed her of the reappearance of this  miscreant     thus  then  was my fate consummated  i was rescued from destroying her  by a dagger  only to behold her perish by the tidings which i brought   thus was every omen of mischief and misery fulfilled  thus was the  enmity of wiatte rendered efficacious  and the instrument of his  destruction changed into the executioner of his revenge     such is the tale of my crimes  it is not for me to hope that the curtain  of oblivion will ever shut out the dismal spectacle  it will haunt me  forever  the torments that grow out of it can terminate only with the  thread of my existence  but that  i know full well  will never end   death is but a shifting of the scene  and the endless progress of  eternity  which to the good is merely the perfection of felicity  is to  the wicked an accumulation of woe  the self destroyer is his own enemy   this has ever been my opinion  hitherto it has influenced my actions   now  though the belief continues  its influence on my conduct is  annihilated  i am no stranger to the depth of that abyss into which i  shall plunge  no matter  change is precious for its own sake     well  i was still to live  my abode must be somewhere fixed  my conduct  was henceforth the result of a perverse and rebellious principle  i  banished myself forever from my native soil  i vowed never more to  behold the face of my clarice  to abandon my friends  my books  all my  wonted labours and accustomed recreations     i was neither ashamed nor afraid  i considered not in what way the  justice of the country would affect me  it merely made no part of my  contemplations  i was not embarrassed by the choice of expedients for  trammelling up the visible consequences and for eluding suspicion  the  idea of abjuring my country and flying forever from the hateful scene  partook  to my apprehension  of the vast  the boundless  and strange  of  plunging from the height of fortune to obscurity and indigence   corresponded with my present state of mind  it was of a piece with the  tremendous and wonderful events that had just happened     these were the images that haunted me  while i stood speechlessly gazing  at the ruin before me  i heard a noise from without  or imagined that i  heard it  my reverie was broken  and my muscular power restored  i  descended into the street  through doors of which i possessed one set of  keys  and hurried by the shortest way beyond the precincts of the city   i had laid no plan  my conceptions with regard to the future were  shapeless and confused  successive incidents supplied me with a clue   and suggested  as they rose  the next step to be taken  i threw off the  garb of affluence  and assumed a beggar s attire  that i had money about  me for the accomplishment of my purposes was wholly accidental  i  travelled along the coast  and  when i arrived at one town  knew not why  i should go farther  but my restlessness was unabated  and change was  some relief  i it length arrived at belfast  a vessel was preparing for  america  i embraced eagerly the opportunity of passing into a new world   i arrived at philadelphia  as soon as i landed i wandered hither  and  was content to wear out my few remaining days in the service of  inglefield     i have no friends  why should i trust my story to mother  i have no  solicitude about concealment  but who is there who will derive pleasure  or benefit from my rehearsal  and why should i expatiate on so hateful a  scheme  yet now have i consented to this  i have confided in you the  history of my disasters  i am not fearful of the use that you may be  disposed to make of it  i shall quickly set myself beyond the reach of  human tribunals  i shall relieve the ministers of law from the trouble  of punishing  the recent events which induced you to summon me to this  conference have likewise determined me to make this disclosure     i was not aware  for some time  of my perturbed sleep  no wonder that  sleep cannot soothe miseries like mine  that i am alike infested by  memory in wakefulness and slumber  yet i was anew distressed by the  discovery that my thoughts found their way to my lips  without my being  conscious of it  and that my steps wandered forth unknowingly and  without the guidance of my will     the story you have told is not incredible  the disaster to which you  allude did not fail to excite my regret  i can still weep over the  untimely fall of youth and worth  i can no otherwise account for my  frequenting his shade than by the distant resemblance which the death of  this man bore to that of which i was the perpetrator  this resemblance  occurred to me at first  if he were able to weaken the impression which  was produced by my crime  this similitude was adapted to revive and  enforce them     the wilderness  and the cave to which you followed me  were familiar to  my sunday rambles  often have i indulged in audible griefs on the cliffs  of that valley  often have i brooded over my sorrows in the recesses of  that cavern  this scene is adapted to my temper  its mountainous  asperities supply me with images of desolation and seclusion  and its  headlong streams lull me into temporary forgetfulness of mankind     i comprehend you  you suspect me of concern in the death of waldegrave   you could not do otherwise  the conduct that you have witnessed was that  of a murderer  i will not upbraid you for your suspicions  though i have  bought exemption from them at a high price           chapter ix       there ended his narrative  he started from the spot where he stood  and   without affording me any opportunity of replying or commenting   disappeared amidst the thickest of the wood  i had no time to exert  myself for his detention  i could have used no arguments for this end   to which it is probable he would have listened  the story i had heard  was too extraordinary  too completely the reverse of all my  expectations  to allow me to attend to the intimations of self murder  which he dropped     the secret which i imagined was about to be disclosed was as inscrutable  as ever  not a circumstance  from the moment when clithero s character  became the subject of my meditations  till the conclusion of his talk   but served to confirm my suspicion  was this error to be imputed to  credulity  would not any one  from similar appearances  have drawn  similar conclusions  or is there a criterion by which truth can always  be distinguished  was it owing to my imperfect education that the  inquietudes of this man were not traced to a deed performed at the  distance of a thousand leagues  to the murder of his patroness and  friend     i had heard a tale which apparently related to scenes and persons far  distant  but  though my suspicions have appeared to have been misplaced   what should hinder but that the death of my friend was  in like manner   an act of momentary insanity and originated in a like spirit of mistaken  benevolence     but i did not consider this tale merely in relation to myself  my life  had been limited and uniform  i had communed with romancers and  historians  but the impression made upon me by this incident was  unexampled in my experience  my reading had furnished me with no  instance in any degree parallel to this  and i found that to be a  distant and second hand spectator of events was widely different from  witnessing them myself and partaking in their consequences  my judgment  was  for a time  sunk into imbecility and confusion  my mind was full of  the images unavoidably suggested by this tale  but they existed in a  kind of chaos  and not otherwise than gradually was i able to reduce  them to distinct particulars  and subject them to a deliberate and  methodical inspection     how was i to consider this act of clithero  what a deplorable  infatuation  yet it was the necessary result of a series of ideas  mutually linked and connected  his conduct was dictated by a motive  allied to virtue  it was the fruit of an ardent and grateful spirit     the death of wiatte could not be censured  the life of clithero was  unspeakably more valuable than that of his antagonist  it was the  instinct of self preservation that swayed him  he knew not his adversary  in time enough to govern himself by that knowledge  had the assailant  been an unknown ruffian  his death would have been followed by no  remorse  the spectacle of his dying agonies would have dwelt upon the  memory of his assassin like any other mournful sight  in the production  of which he bore no part     it must at least be said that his will was not concerned in this  transaction  he acted in obedience to an impulse which he could not  control nor resist  shall we impute guilt where there is no design   shall a man extract food for self reproach from an action to which it is  not enough to say that he was actuated by no culpable intention  but  that he was swayed by no intention whatever  if consequences arise that  cannot be foreseen  shall we find no refuge in the persuasion of our  rectitude and of human frailty  shall we deem ourselves criminal because  we do not enjoy the attributes of deity  because our power and our  knowledge are confined by impassable boundaries     but whence arose the subsequent intention  it was the fruit of a  dreadful mistake  his intents were noble and compassionate  but this is  of no avail to free him from the imputation of guilt  no remembrance of  past beneficence can compensate for this crime  the scale loaded with  the recriminations of his conscience  is immovable by any  counter weight     but what are the conclusions to be drawn by dispassionate observers  is  it possible to regard this person with disdain or with enmity  the crime  originated in those limitations which nature has imposed upon human  faculties  proofs of a just intention are all that are requisite to  exempt us from blame  he is thus  in consequence of a double mistake   the light in which he views this event is erroneous  he judges wrong   and is therefore miserable     how imperfect are the grounds of all our decisions was it of no use to  superintend his childhood  to select his instructors and examples  to  mark the operations of his principles  to see him emerging into youth   to follow him through various scenes and trying vicissitudes  and mark  the uniformity of his integrity  who would have predicted his future  conduct  who would not have affirmed the impossibility of an action like  this     how mysterious was the connection between the fate of wiatte and his  sister  by such circuitous and yet infallible means were the prediction  of the lady and the vengeance of the brother accomplished  in how many  cases may it be said  as in this  that the prediction was the cause of  its own fulfilment  that the very act which considerate observers  and  even himself  for a time  imagined to have utterly precluded the  execution of wiatte s menaces  should be that inevitably leading to it   that the execution should be assigned to him who  abounding in  abhorrence  and in the act of self defence  was the slayer of the  menacer     as the obstructer of his designs  wiatte waylaid and assaulted clithero   he perished in the attempt  were his designs frustrated  no  it was thus  that he secured the gratification of his vengeance  his sister was cut  off in the bloom of life and prosperity  by a refinement of good  fortune  the voluntary minister of his malice had entailed upon himself  exile without reprieve and misery without end     but what chiefly excited my wonder was the connection of this tale with  the destiny of sarsefield  this was he whom i have frequently mentioned  to you as my preceptor  about four years previous to this era  he  appeared in this district without fortune or friend  he desired  one  evening  to be accommodated at my uncle s house  the conversation  turning on the objects of his journey and his present situation  he  professed himself in search of lucrative employment  my uncle proposed  to him to become a teacher  there being a sufficient number of young  people in this neighbourhood to afford him occupation and subsistence   he found it his interest to embrace this proposal     i  of course  became his pupil  and demeaned myself in such a manner as  speedily to grow into a favourite  he communicated to us no part of his  early history  but informed us sufficiently of his adventures in asia  and italy to make it plain that this was the same person alluded to by  clithero  during his abode among us his conduct was irreproachable  when  he left us  he manifested the most poignant regret  but this originated  chiefly in his regard to me  he promised to maintain with me an  epistolary intercourse  since his departure  however  i had heard  nothing respecting him  it was with unspeakable regret that i now heard  of the disappointment of his hopes  and was inquisitive respecting the  measures which he would adopt in his new situation  perhaps he would   once more return to america  and i should again be admitted to the  enjoyment of his society  this event i anticipated with the highest  satisfaction     at present  the fate of the unhappy clithero was the subject of abundant  anxiety  on his suddenly leaving me  at the conclusion of his tale  i  supposed that he had gone upon one of his usual rambles  and that it  would terminate only with the day  next morning a message was received  from inglefield  inquiring if any one knew what had become of his  servant  i could not listen to this message with tranquillity  i  recollected the hints that he had given of some design upon his life   and admitted the most dreary forebodings  i speeded to inglefield s   clithero had not returned  they told me  the preceding evening  he had  not apprized them of any intention to change his abode  his boxes  and  all that composed his slender property  were found in their ordinary  state  he had expressed no dissatisfaction with his present condition     several days passed  and no tidings could be procured of him  his  absence was a topic of general speculation  but was a source of  particular anxiety to no one but myself  my apprehensions were surely  built upon sufficient grounds  from the moment that we parted  no one  had seen or heard of him  what mode of suicide he had selected  he had  disabled us from discovering  by the impenetrable secrecy in which he  had involved it     in the midst of my reflections upon this subject  the idea of the  wilderness occurred  could he have executed his design in the deepest of  its recesses  these were unvisited by human footsteps  and his bones  might lie for ages in this solitude without attracting observation  to  seek them where they lay  to gather them together and provide for them a  grave  was a duty which appeared incumbent on me  and of which the  performance was connected with a thousand habitual sentiments and mixed  pleasures     thou knowest my devotion to the spirit that breathes its inspiration in  the gloom of forests and on the verge of streams  i love to immerse  myself in shades and dells  and hold converse with the solemnities and  secrecies of nature in the rude retreats of norwalk  the disappearance  of clithero had furnished new incitements to ascend its cliffs and  pervade its thickets  as i cherished the hope of meeting in my rambles  with some traces of this man  but might he not still live  his words had  imparted the belief that he intended to destroy himself  this  catastrophe  however  was far from certain  was it not in my power to  avert it  could i not restore a mind thus vigorous  to tranquil and  wholesome existence  could i not subdue his perverse disdain and  immeasurable abhorrence of himself  his upbraiding and his scorn were  unmerited and misplaced  perhaps they argued frenzy rather than  prejudice  but frenzy  like prejudice  was curable  reason was no less  an antidote to the illusions of insanity like his  than to the illusions  of error     i did not immediately recollect that to subsist in this desert was  impossible  nuts were the only fruits it produced  and these were  inadequate to sustain human life  if it were haunted by clithero  he  must occasionally pass its limits and beg or purloin victuals  this  deportment was too humiliating and flagitious to be imputed to him   there was reason to suppose him smitten with the charms of solitude  of  a lonely abode in the midst of mountainous and rugged nature  but this  could not be uninterruptedly enjoyed  life could be supported only by  occasionally visiting the haunts of men  in the guise of a thief or a  mendicant  hence  since clithero was not known to have reappeared at any  farm house in the neighbourhood  i was compelled to conclude either that  he had retired far from this district  or that he was dead     though i designed that my leisure should chiefly be consumed in the  bosom of norwalk  i almost dismissed the hope of meeting with the  fugitive  there were indeed two sources of my hopelessness on this  occasion  not only it was probable that clithero had fled far away  but   should he have concealed himself in some nook or cavern within these  precincts  his concealment was not to be traced  this arose from the  nature of that sterile region     it would not be easy to describe the face of this district  in a few  words  half of solesbury  thou knowest  admits neither of plough nor  spade  the cultivable space lies along the river  and the desert  lying  on the north  has gained  by some means  the appellation of norwalk   canst thou imagine a space  somewhat circular  about six miles in  diameter  and exhibiting a perpetual and intricate variety of craggy  eminences and deep dells     the hollows are single  and walled around by cliffs  ever varying in  shape and height  and have seldom any perceptible communication with  each other  these hollows are of all dimensions  from the narrowness and  depth of a well  to the amplitude of one hundred yards  winter s snow is  frequently found in these cavities at midsummer  the streams that burst  forth from every crevice are thrown  by the irregularities of the  surface  into numberless cascades  often disappear in mists or in  chasms  and emerge from subterranean channels  and  finally  either  subside into lakes  or quietly meander through the lower and more level  grounds     wherever nature left a flat it is made rugged and scarcely passable by  enormous and fallen trunks  accumulated by the storms of ages  and  forming  by their slow decay  a moss covered soil  the haunt of rabbits  and lizards  these spots are obscured by the melancholy umbrage of  pines  whose eternal murmurs are in unison with vacancy and solitude   with the reverberations of the torrents and the whistling of the blasts   hickory and poplar  which abound in the lowlands  find here no fostering  elements     a sort of continued vale  winding and abrupt  leads into the midst of  this region and through it  this vale serves the purpose of a road  it  is a tedious maze and perpetual declivity  and requires  from the  passenger  a cautious and sure foot  openings and ascents occasionally  present themselves on each side  which seem to promise you access to the  interior region  but always terminate  sooner or later  in insuperable  difficulties  at the verge of a precipice or the bottom of a steep     perhaps no one was more acquainted with this wilderness than i  but my  knowledge was extremely imperfect  i had traversed parts of it  at an  early age  in pursuit of berries and nuts  or led by a roaming  disposition  afterwards the sphere of my rambles was enlarged and their  purpose changed  when sarsefield came among us  i became his favourite  scholar and the companion of all his pedestrian excursions  he was fond  of penetrating into these recesses  partly from the love of picturesque  scenes  partly to investigate its botanical and mineral productions  and  partly to carry on more effectually that species of instruction which he  had adopted with regard to me  and which chiefly consisted in moralizing  narratives or synthetical reasonings  these excursions had familiarized  me with its outlines and most accessible parts  but there was much  which  perhaps  could never be reached without wings  and much the only  paths to which i might forever overlook     every new excursion  indeed  added somewhat to my knowledge  new tracks  were pursued  new prospects detected  and new summits were gained  my  rambles were productive of incessant novelty  though they always  terminated in the prospect of limits that could not be overleaped  but  none of these had led me wider from my customary paths than that which  had taken place when in pursuit of clithero  i had a faint remembrance  of the valley into which i had descended after him  but till then i had  viewed it at a distance  and supposed it impossible to reach the bottom  but by leaping from a precipice some hundred feet in height  the  opposite steep seemed no less inaccessible  and the cavern at the bottom  was impervious to any views which my former positions had enabled me to  take of it     my intention to re examine this cave and ascertain whither it led had   for a time  been suspended by different considerations  it was now  revived with more energy than ever  i reflected that this had formerly  been haunted by clithero  and might possibly have been the scene of the  desperate act which he had meditated  it might at least conceal some  token of his past existence  it might lead into spaces hitherto  unvisited  and to summits from which wider landscapes might be seen     one morning i set out to explore this scene  the road which clithero had  taken was laboriously circuitous  on my return from the first pursuit of  him  i ascended the cliff in my former footsteps  but soon lighted on  the beaten track which i have already described  this enabled me to shun  a thousand obstacles which had lately risen before me  and opened an  easy passage to the cavern     i once more traversed this way  the brow of the hill was gained  the  ledges of which it consisted afforded sufficient footing  when the  attempt was made  though viewed at a distance they seemed to be too  narrow for that purpose  as i descended the rugged stair  i could not  but wonder at the temerity and precipitation with which this descent had  formerly been made  it seemed as if the noonday light and the tardiest  circumspection would scarcely enable me to accomplish it  yet then it  had been done with headlong speed  and with no guidance but the moon s  uncertain rays     i reached the mouth of the cave  till now i had forgotten that a lamp or  a torch might be necessary to direct my subterranean footsteps  i was  unwilling to defer the attempt  light might possibly be requisite  if  the cave had no other outlet  somewhat might present itself within to  the eyes  which might forever elude the hands  but i was more inclined  to consider it merely as an avenue terminating in an opening on the  summit of the steep  or on the opposite side of the ridge  caution might  supply the place of light  or  having explored the cave as far as  possible at present  i might hereafter return  better furnished for the  scrutiny           chapter x       with these determinations  i proceeded  the entrance was low  and  compelled me to resort to hands as well as feet  at a few yards from the  mouth the light disappeared  and i found myself immersed in the dunnest  obscurity  had i not been persuaded that another had gone before me  i  should have relinquished the attempt  i proceeded with the utmost  caution  always ascertaining  by outstretched arms  the height and  breadth of the cavity before me  in a short time the dimensions expanded  on all sides  and permitted me to resume my feet     i walked upon a smooth and gentle declivity  presently the wall on one  side  and the ceiling  receded beyond my reach  i began to fear that i  should be involved in a maze  and should be disabled from returning  to  obviate this danger it was requisite to adhere to the nearest wall  and  conform to the direction which it should take  without straying through  the palpable obscurity  whether the ceiling was lofty or low  whether  the opposite wall of the passage was distant or near  this i deemed no  proper opportunity to investigate     in a short time  my progress was stopped by an abrupt descent  i set  down the advancing foot with caution  being aware that i might at the  next step encounter a bottomless pit  to the brink of such a one i  seemed now to have arrived  i stooped  and stretched my hand forward and  downward  but all was vacuity     here it was needful to pause  i had reached the brink of a cavity whose  depth it avas impossible to ascertain  it might be a few inches beyond  my reach  or hundreds of feet  by leaping down i might incur no injury   or might plunge into a lake or dash myself to pieces on the points of  rocks     i now saw with new force the propriety of being furnished with a light   the first suggestion was to return upon my footsteps  and resume my  undertaking on the morrow  yet  having advanced thus far  i felt  reluctance to recede without accomplishing my purposes  i reflected  likewise that clithero had boldly entered this recess  and had certainly  come forth at a different avenue from that at which he entered     at length it occurred to me that  though i could not go forward  yet i  might proceed along the edge of this cavity  this edge would be as safe  a guidance  and would serve as well for a clue by which i might return   as the wall which it was now necessary to forsake     intense dark is always the parent of fears  impending injuries cannot in  this state be descried  nor shunned  nor repelled  i began to feel some  faltering of my courage  and seated myself  for a few minutes  on a  stony mass which arose before me  my situation was new  the caverns i  had hitherto met with in this desert were chiefly formed of low browed  rocks  they were chambers  more or less spacious  into which twilight  was at least admitted  but here it seemed as if i were surrounded by  barriers that would forever cut off my return to air and to light     presently i resumed my courage and proceeded  my road appeared now to  ascend  on one side i seemed still upon the verge of a precipice  and on  the other all was empty and waste  i had gone no inconsiderable  distance  and persuaded myself that my career would speedily terminate   in a short time  the space on the left hand was again occupied  and i  cautiously proceeded between the edge of the gulf and a rugged wall  as  the space between them widened i adhered to the wall     i was not insensible that my path became more intricate and more  difficult to retread in proportion as i advanced  i endeavoured to  preserve a vivid conception of the way which i had already passed  and  to keep the images of the left and right hand wall  and the gulf  in due  succession in my memory     the path  which had hitherto been considerably smooth  now became rugged  and steep  chilling damps  the secret trepidation which attended me  the  length and difficulties of my way  enhanced by the ceaseless caution and  the numerous expedients which the utter darkness obliged me to employ   began to overpower my strength  i was frequently compelled to stop and  recruit myself by rest  these respites from toil were of use  but they  could not enable me to prosecute an endless journey  and to return was  scarcely a less arduous task than to proceed     i looked anxiously forward  in the hope of being comforted by some dim  ray  which might assure me that my labours were approaching an end  at  last this propitious token appeared  and i issued forth into a kind of  chamber  one side of which was open to the air and allowed me to catch a  portion of the checkered sky  this spectacle never before excited such  exquisite sensations in my bosom  the air  likewise  breathed into the  cavern  was unspeakably delicious     i now found myself on the projecture of a rock  above and below  the  hill side was nearly perpendicular  opposite  and at the distance of  fifteen or twenty yards  was a similar ascent  at the bottom was a glen   cold  narrow  and obscure  this projecture  which served as a kind of  vestibule to the cave  was connected with a ledge  by which  though not  without peril and toil  i was conducted to the summit     this summit was higher than any of those which were interposed between  itself and the river  a large part of this chaos of rocks and precipices  was subjected  at one view  to the eye  the fertile lawns and vales  which lay beyond this  the winding course of the river  and the slopes  which rose on its farther side  were parts of this extensive scene   these objects were at any time fitted to inspire rapture  now my delight  was enhanced by the contrast which this lightsome and serene element  bore to the glooms from which i had lately emerged  my station  also   was higher  and the limits of my view  consequently  more ample than any  which i had hitherto enjoyed     i advanced to the outer verge of the hill  which i found to overlook a  steep no less inaccessible  and a glen equally profound  i changed  frequently my station in order to diversify the scenery  at length it  became necessary to inquire by what means i should return  i traversed  the edge of the hill  but on every side it was equally steep and always  too lofty to permit me to leap from it  as i kept along the verge  i  perceived that it tended in a circular direction  and brought me back   at last  to the spot from which i had set out  from this inspection  it  seemed as if return was impossible by any other way than that through  the cavern     i now turned my attention to the interior space  if you imagine a  cylindrical mass  with a cavity dug in the centre  whose edge conforms  to the exterior edge  and if you place in this cavity another cylinder   higher than that which surrounds it  but so small as to leave between  its sides and those of the cavity a hollow space  you will gain as  distinct an image of this hill as words can convey  the summit of the  inner rock was rugged and covered with trees of unequal growth  to reach  this summit would not render my return easier  but its greater elevation  would extend my view  and perhaps furnish a spot from which the whole  horizon was conspicuous     as i had traversed the outer  i now explored the inner  edge of this  hill  at length i reached a spot where the chasm  separating the two  rocks  was narrower than at any other part  at first view  it seemed as  if it were possible to leap over it  but a nearer examination showed me  that the passage was impracticable  so far as my eye could estimate it   the breadth was thirty or forty feet  i could scarcely venture to look  beneath  the height was dizzy  and the walls  which approached each  other at top  receded at the bottom  so as to form the resemblance of an  immense hall  lighted from a rift which some convulsion of nature had  made in the roof  where i stood there ascended a perpetual mist   occasioned by a torrent that dashed along the rugged pavement below     from these objects i willingly turned my eye upon those before and above  me  on the opposite ascent  a stream  rushing from above  fell into a  cavity  which its own force seemed gradually to have made  the noise and  the motion equally attracted my attention  there was a desolate and  solitary grandeur in the scene  enhanced by the circumstances in which  it was beheld  and by the perils through which i had recently passed   that had never before been witnessed by me     a sort of sanctity and awe environed it  owing to the consciousness of  absolute and utter loneliness  it was probable that human feet had never  before gained this recess  that human eyes had never been fixed upon  these gushing waters  the aboriginal inhabitants had no motives to lead  them into caves like this and ponder on the verge of such a precipice   their successors were still less likely to have wandered hither  since  the birth of this continent  i was probably the first who had deviated  thus remotely from the customary paths of men     while musing upon these ideas  my eye was fixed upon the foaming  current  at length i looked upon the rocks which confined and  embarrassed its course  i admired their fantastic shapes and endless  irregularities  passing from one to the other of these  my attention  lighted  at length  as if by some magical transition  on  a human  countenance     my surprise was so abrupt  and my sensations so tumultuous  that i  forgot for a moment the perilous nature of my situation  i loosened my  hold of a pine branch  which had been hitherto one of my supports  and  almost started from my seat  had my station been in a slight degree  nearer the brink than it was  i should have fallen headlong into the  abyss     to meet a human creature  even on that side of the chasm which i  occupied  would have been wholly adverse to my expectation  my station  was accessible by no other road than that through which i had passed   and no motives were imaginable by which others could be prompted to  explore this road  but he whom i now beheld was seated where it seemed  impossible for human efforts to have placed him     but this affected me but little in comparison with other incidents  not  only the countenance was human  but  in spite of shaggy and tangled  locks  and an air of melancholy wildness  i speedily recognised the  features of the fugitive clithero     one glance was not sufficient to make me acquainted with this scene  i  had come hither partly in pursuit of this man  but some casual appendage  of his person  something which should indicate his past rather than his  present existence  was all that i hoped to find  that he should be found  alive in this desert  that he should have gained this summit  access to  which was apparently impossible  were scarcely within the boundaries of  belief     his scanty and coarse garb had been nearly rent away by brambles and  thorns  his arms  bosom  and cheeks were overgrown and half concealed by  hair  there was somewhat in his attitude and looks denoting more than  anarchy of thoughts and passions  his rueful  ghastly  and immovable  eyes testified not only that his mind was ravaged by despair  but that  he was pinched with famine     these proofs of his misery thrilled to my inmost heart  horror and  shuddering invaded me as i stood gazing upon him  and  for a time  i was  without the power of deliberating on the measures which it was my duty  to adopt for his relief  the first suggestion was  by calling  to inform  him of my presence  i knew not what counsel or comfort to offer  by what  words to bespeak his attention  or by what topics to mollify his direful  passions  i knew not  though so near  the gulf by which we were  separated was impassable  all that i could do was to speak     my surprise and my horror were still strong enough to give a shrill and  piercing tone to my voice  the chasm and the rocks loudened and  reverberated my accents while i exclaimed     man  clithero       my summons was effectual  he shook off his trance in a moment  he had  been stretched upon his back  with his eyes fixed upon a craggy  projecture above  as if he were in momentary expectation of its fall and  crushing him to atoms  now he started on his feet  he was conscious of  the voice  but not of the quarter whence it came  he was looking  anxiously around when i again spoke    look hither  it is i who called      he looked  astonishment was now mingled with every other dreadful  meaning in his visage  he clasped his hands together and bent forward   as if to satisfy himself that his summoner was real  at the next moment  he drew back  placed his hands upon his breast  and fixed his eyes on  the ground     this pause was not likely to be broken but by me  i was preparing again  to speak  to be more distinctly heard  i advanced closer to the brink   during this action  my eye was necessarily withdrawn from him  having  gained a somewhat nearer station  i looked again  but  he was gone     the seat which he so lately occupied was empty  i was not forewarned of  his disappearance or directed to the course of his flight by any  rustling among leaves  these  indeed  would have been overpowered by the  noise of the cataract  the place where he sat was the bottom of a  cavity  one side of which terminated in the verge of the abyss  but the  other sides were perpendicular or overhanging  surely he had not leaped  into this gulf  and yet that he had so speedily scaled the steep was  impossible     i looked into the gulf  but the depth and the gloom allowed me to see  nothing with distinctness  his cries or groans could not be overheard  amidst the uproar of the waters  his fall must have instantly destroyed  him  and that he had fallen was the only conclusion i could draw     my sensations on this incident cannot be easily described  the image of  this man s despair  and of the sudden catastrophe to which my  inauspicious interference had led  filled me with compunction and  terror  some of my fears were relieved by the new conjecture  that   behind the rock on which he had lain  there might be some aperture or  pit into which he had descended  or in which he might be concealed     i derived consolation from this conjecture  not only the evil which i  dreaded might not have happened  but some alleviation of his misery was  possible  could i arrest his footsteps and win his attention  i might be  able to insinuate the lessons of fortitude  but if words were impotent   and arguments were nugatory  yet to sit by him in silence  to moisten  his hand with tears  to sigh in unison  to offer him the spectacle of  sympathy  the solace of believing that his demerits were not estimated  by so rigid a standard by others as by himself  that one at least among  his fellow men regarded him with love and pity  could not fail to be of  benign influence     these thoughts inspired me with new zeal  to effect my purpose it was  requisite to reach the opposite steep  i was now convinced that this was  not an impracticable undertaking  since clithero had already performed  it  i once more made the circuit of the hill  every side was steep and  of enormous height  and the gulf was nowhere so narrow as at this spot   i therefore returned hither  and once more pondered on the means of  passing this tremendous chasm in safety     casting my eyes upward  i noted the tree at the root of which i was  standing  i compared the breadth of the gulf with the length of the  trunk of this tree  and it appeared very suitable for a bridge  happily  it grew obliquely  and  if felled by an axe  would probably fall of  itself  in such a manner as to be suspended across the chasm  the stock  was thick enough to afford me footing  and would enable me to reach the  opposite declivity without danger or delay     a more careful examination of the spot  the site of the tree  its  dimensions  and the direction of its growth  convinced me fully of the  practicability of this expedient  and i determined to carry it into  immediate execution  for this end i must hasten home  procure an axe   and return with all expedition hither  i took my former way  once more  entered the subterranean avenue  and slowly re emerged into day  before  i reached home  the evening was at hand  and my tired limbs and jaded  spirits obliged me to defer my undertaking till the morrow     though my limbs were at rest  my thoughts were active through the night   i carefully reviewed the situation of this hill  and was unable to  conjecture by what means clithero could place himself upon it  unless he  occasionally returned to the habitable grounds  it was impossible for  him to escape perishing by famine  he might intend to destroy himself by  this means  and my first efforts were to be employed to overcome this  fatal resolution  to persuade him to leave his desolate haunts might be  a laborious and tedious task  meanwhile  all my benevolent intentions  would be frustrated by his want of sustenance  it was proper  therefore   to carry bread with me  and to place it before him  the sight of food   the urgencies of hunger  and my vehement entreaties  might prevail on  him to eat  though no expostulations might suffice to make him seek food  at a distance           chapter xi       next morning i stored a small bag with meat and bread  and  throwing an  axe on my shoulder  set out  without informing any one of my intentions   for the hill  my passage was rendered more difficult by these  encumbrances  but my perseverance surmounted every impediment  and i  gained  in a few hours  the foot of the tree whose trunk was to serve me  for a bridge  in this journey i saw no traces of the fugitive     a new survey of the tree confirmed my former conclusions  and i began my  work with diligence  my strokes were repeated by a thousand echoes  and  i paused at first  somewhat startled by reverberations which made it  appear as if not one but a score of axes were employed at the same time  on both sides of the gulf     quickly the tree fell  and exactly in the manner which i expected arid  desired  the wide spread limbs occupied and choked up the channel of the  torrent  and compelled it to seek a new outlet and multiplied its  murmurs  i dared not trust myself to cross it in an upright posture  but  clung  with hands and feet  to its rugged bark  having reached the  opposite cliff  i proceeded to examine the spot where clithero had  disappeared  my fondest hopes were realized  for a considerable cavity  appeared  which  on a former day  had been concealed from my distant  view by the rock     it was obvious to conclude that this was his present habitation  or that  an avenue  conducting hither and terminating in the unexplored sides of  this pit  was that by which he had come hither  and by which he had  retired  i could not hesitate long to slide into the pit  i found an  entrance through which i fearlessly penetrated  i was prepared to  encounter obstacles and perils similar to those which i have already  described  but was rescued from them by ascending  in a few minutes   into a kind of passage  open above  but walled by a continued rock on  both sides  the sides of this passage conformed with the utmost  exactness to each other  nature  at some former period  had occasioned  the solid mass to dispart at this place  and had thus afforded access to  the summit of the hill  loose stones and ragged points formed the  flooring of this passage  which rapidly and circuitously ascended     i was now within a few yards of the surface of the rock  the passage  opened into a kind of chamber or pit  the sides of which were not  difficult to climb  i rejoiced at the prospect of this termination of my  journey  here i paused  and  throwing my weary limbs on the ground   began to examine the objects around me  and to meditate on the steps  that were next to be taken     my first glance lighted on the very being of whom i was in search   stretched upon a bed of moss  at the distance of a few feet from my  station  i beheld clithero  he had not been roused by my approach   though my footsteps were perpetually stumbling and sliding  this  reflection gave birth to the fear that he was dead  a nearer inspection  dispelled my apprehensions  and showed me that he was merely buried in  profound slumber  those vigils must indeed have been long which were at  last succeeded by a sleep so oblivious     this meeting was  in the highest degree  propitious  it not only assured  me of his existence  but proved that his miseries were capable of being  suspended  his slumber enabled me to pause  to ruminate on the manner by  which his understanding might be most successfully addressed  to collect  and arrange the topics fitted to rectify his gloomy and disastrous  perceptions     thou knowest that i am qualified for such tasks neither by my education  nor my genius  the headlong and ferocious energies of this man could not  be repelled or diverted into better paths by efforts so undisciplined as  mine  a despair so stormy and impetuous would drown my feeble accents   how should i attempt to reason with him  how should i outroot  prepossessions so inveterate   the fruits of his earliest education   fostered and matured by the observation and experience of his whole  life  how should i convince him that  since the death of wiatte was not  intended  the deed was without crime  that  if it had been deliberately  concerted  it was still a virtue  since his own life could by no other  means be preserved  that when he pointed a dagger at the bosom of his  mistress he was actuated  not by avarice  or ambition  or revenge  or  malice  he desired to confer on her the highest and the only benefit of  which he believed her capable  he sought to rescue her from tormenting  regrets and lingering agonies     these positions were sufficiently just to my own view  but i was not  called upon to reduce them to practice  i had not to struggle with the  consciousness of having been rescued  by some miraculous contingency   from imbruing my hands in the blood of her whom i adored  of having  drawn upon myself suspicions of ingratitude and murder too deep to be  ever effaced  of having bereft myself of love  and honour  and friends   and spotless reputation  of having doomed myself to infamy and  detestation  to hopeless exile  penury  and servile toil  these were the  evils which his malignant destiny had made the unalterable portion of  clithero  and how should my imperfect eloquence annihilate these evils   every man  not himself the victim of irretrievable disasters  perceives  the folly of ruminating on the past  and of fostering a grief which  cannot reverse or recall the decrees of an immutable necessity  but  every man who suffers is unavoidably shackled by the errors which he  censures in his neighbour  and his efforts to relieve himself are as  fruitless as those with which he attempted the relief of others     no topic  therefore  could be properly employed by me on the present  occasion  all that i could do was to offer him food  and  by pathetic  supplications  to prevail on him to eat  famine  however obstinate   would scarcely refrain when bread was placed within sight and reach   when made to swerve from his resolution in one instance  it would be  less difficult to conquer it a second time  the magic of sympathy  the  perseverance of benevolence  though silent  might work a gradual and  secret revolution  and better thoughts might insensibly displace those  desperate suggestions which now governed him     having revolved these ideas  i placed the food which i had brought at  his right hand  and  seating myself at his feet  attentively surveyed  his countenance  the emotions which were visible during wakefulness had  vanished during this cessation of remembrance and remorse  or were  faintly discernible  they served to dignify and solemnize his features   and to embellish those immutable lines which betokened the spirit of his  better days  lineaments were now observed which could never coexist with  folly or associate with obdurate guilt     i had no inclination to awaken him  this respite was too sweet to be  needlessly abridged  i determined to await the operation of nature  and  to prolong  by silence and by keeping interruption at a distance  this  salutary period of forgetfulness  this interval permitted new ideas to  succeed in my mind     clithero believed his solitude to be unapproachable  what new expedients  to escape inquiry and intrusion might not my presence suggest  might he  not vanish  as he had done on the former day  and afford me no time to  assail his constancy and tempt his hunger  if  however  i withdrew  during his sleep  he would awake without disturbance  and be  unconscious  for a time  that his secrecy had been violated  he would  quickly perceive the victuals  and would need no foreign inducements to  eat  a provision so unexpected and extraordinary might suggest new  thoughts  and be construed into a kind of heavenly condemnation of his  purpose  he would not readily suspect the motives or person of his  visitant  would take no precaution against the repetition of my visit   and  at the same time  our interview would not be attended with so much  surprise  the more i revolved these reflections  the greater force they  acquired  at length  i determined to withdraw  and  leaving the food  where it could scarcely fail of attracting his notice  i returned by the  way that i had come  i had scarcely reached home  when a messenger from  inglefield arrived  requesting me to spend the succeeding night at his  house  as some engagement had occurred to draw him to the city     i readily complied with this request  it was not necessary  however  to  be early in my visit  i deferred going till the evening was far  advanced  my way led under the branches of the elm which recent events  had rendered so memorable  hence my reflections reverted to the  circumstances which had lately occurred in connection with this tree     i paused  for some time  under its shade  i marked the spot where  clithero had been discovered digging  it showed marks of being  unsettled  but the sod which had formerly covered it  and which had  lately been removed  was now carefully replaced  this had not been done  by him on that occasion in which i was a witness of his behaviour  the  earth was then hastily removed  and as hastily thrown again into the  hole from which it had been taken     some curiosity was naturally excited by this appearance  either some  other person  or clithero  on a subsequent occasion  had been here  i  was now likewise led to reflect on the possible motives that prompted  the maniac to turn up this earth  there is always some significance in  the actions of a sleeper  somewhat was  perhaps  buried in this spot   connected with the history of mrs  lorimer or of clarice  was it not  possible to ascertain the truth in this respect     there was but one method  by carefully uncovering this hole  and digging  as deep as clithero had already dug  it would quickly appear whether any  thing was hidden  to do this publicly by daylight was evidently  indiscreet  besides  a moment s delay was superfluous  the night had now  fallen  and before it was past this new undertaking might be finished   an interview was  if possible  to be gained with clithero on the morrow   and for this interview the discoveries made on this spot might eminently  qualify me  influenced by these considerations  i resolved to dig  i was  first  however  to converse an hour with the housekeeper  and then to  withdraw to my chamber  when the family were all retired  and there was  no fear of observation or interruption  i proposed to rise and hasten   with a proper implement  hither     one chamber in inglefield s house was usually reserved for visitants  in  this chamber thy unfortunate brother died  and here it was that i was to  sleep  the image of its last inhabitant could not fail of being called  up  and of banishing repose  but the scheme which i had meditated was an  additional incitement to watchfulness  hither i repaired at the due  season  having previously furnished myself with candles  since i knew  not what might occur to make a light necessary     i did not go to bed  but either sat musing by a table or walked across  the room  the bed before me was that on which my friend breathed his  last  to rest my head upon the same pillow  to lie on that pallet which  sustained his cold and motionless limbs  were provocations to  remembrance and grief that i desired to shun  i endeavoured to fill my  mind with more recent incidents  with the disasters of clithero  my  subterranean adventures  and the probable issue of the schemes which i  now contemplated     i recalled the conversation which had just ended with the housekeeper   clithero had been our theme  but she had dealt chiefly in repetitions of  what had formerly been related by her or by inglefield  i inquired what  this man had left behind  and found that it consisted of a square box   put together by himself with uncommon strength  but of rugged  workmanship  she proceeded to mention that she had advised her brother   mr  inglefield  to break open this box and ascertain its contents  but  this he did not think himself justified in doing  clithero was guilty of  no known crime  was responsible to no one for his actions  and might  some time return to claim his property  this box contained nothing with  which others had a right to meddle  somewhat might be found in it   throwing light upon his past or present situation  but curiosity was not  to be gratified by these means  what clithero thought proper to conceal   it was criminal for us to extort from him     the housekeeper was by no means convinced by these arguments  and at  length obtained her brother s permission to try whether any of her own  keys would unlock this chest  the keys were produced  but no lock nor  keyhole were discoverable  the lid was fast  but by what means it was  fastened the most accurate inspection could not detect  hence she was  compelled to lay aside her project  this chest had always stood in the  chamber which i now occupied     these incidents were now remembered  and i felt disposed to profit by  this opportunity of examining this box  it stood in a corner  and was  easily distinguished by its form  i lifted it and found its weight by no  means extraordinary  its structure was remarkable  it consisted of six  sides  square and of similar dimensions  these were joined  not by  mortise and tennon  not by nails  not by hinges  but the junction was  accurate  the means by which they were made to cohere were invisible     appearances on every side were uniform  nor were there any marks by  which the lid was distinguishable from its other surfaces     during his residence with inglefield  many specimens of mechanical  ingenuity were given by his servant  this was the workmanship of his own  hands  i looked at it for some time  till the desire insensibly arose of  opening it and examining its contents     i had no more right to do this than the inglefields  perhaps  indeed   this curiosity was more absurd  and the gratification more culpable  in  me than in them  i was acquainted with the history of clithero s past  life  and with his present condition  respecting these  i had no new  intelligence to gain  and no doubts to solve  what excuse could i make  to the proprietor  should he ever reappear to claim his own  or to  inglefield for breaking open a receptacle which all the maxims of  society combine to render sacred     but could not my end be gained without violence  the means of opening  might present themselves on a patient scrutiny  the lid might be raised  and shut down again without any tokens of my act  its contents might be  examined  and all things restored to their former condition  in a few  minutes     i intended not a theft  i intended to benefit myself without inflicting  injury on others  nay  might not the discoveries i should make throw  light upon the conduct of this extraordinary man which his own narrative  had withheld  was there reason to confide implicitly on the tale which i  had heard     in spite of the testimony of my own feelings  the miseries of clithero  appeared in some degree fantastic and groundless  a thousand conceivable  motives might induce him to pervert or conceal the truth  if he were  thoroughly known  his character might assume a new appearance  and what  is now so difficult to reconcile to common maxims might prove perfectly  consistent with them  i desire to restore him to peace  but a thorough  knowledge of his actions is necessary  both to show that he is worthy of  compassion  and to suggest the best means of extirpating his errors  it  was possible that this box contained the means of this knowledge     there were likewise other motives  which  as they possessed some  influence  however small  deserve to be mentioned  thou knowest that i  also am a mechanist  i had constructed a writing desk and cabinet  in  which i had endeavoured to combine the properties of secrecy  security   and strength  in the highest possible degree  i looked upon this   therefore  with the eye of an artist  and was solicitous to know the  principles on which it was formed  i determined to examine  and  if  possible  to open it           chapter xii       i surveyed it with the utmost attention  all its parts appeared equally  solid and smooth  it could not be doubted that one of its sides served  the purpose of a lid  and was possible to be raised  mere strength could  not be applied to raise it  because there was no projecture which might  be firmly held by the hand  and by which force could be exerted  some  spring  therefore  secretly existed  which might forever elude the  senses  but on which the hand  by being moved over it in all directions   might accidentally light     this process was effectual  a touch  casually applied at an angle  drove  back a bolt  and a spring  at the same time  was set in action  by which  the lid was raised above half an inch  no event could be supposed more  fortuitous than this  a hundred hands might have sought in vain for this  spring  the spot in which a certain degree of pressure was sufficient to  produce this effect was  of all  the least likely to attract notice or  awaken suspicion     i opened the trunk with eagerness  the space within was divided into  numerous compartments  none of which contained any thing of moment   tools of different and curious constructions  and remnants of minute  machinery  were all that offered themselves to my notice     my expectations being thus frustrated  i proceeded to restore things to  their former state  i attempted to close the lid  but the spring which  had raised it refused to bend  no measure that i could adopt enabled me  to place the lid in the same situation in which i had found it  in my  efforts to press down the lid  which were augmented in proportion to the  resistance that i met with  the spring was broken  this obstacle being  removed  the lid resumed its proper place  but no means  within the  reach of my ingenuity to discover  enabled me to push forward the bolt   and thus to restore the fastening     i now perceived that clithero had provided not only against the opening  of his cabinet  but likewise against the possibility of concealing that  it had been opened  this discovery threw me into some confusion  i had  been tempted thus far by the belief that my action was without  witnesses  and might be forever concealed  this opinion was now  confuted  if clithero should ever reclaim his property  he would not  fail to detect the violence of which i had been guilty  inglefield would  disapprove in another what he had not permitted to himself  and the  unauthorized and clandestine manner in which i had behaved would  aggravate  in his eyes  the heinousness of my offence     but now there was no remedy  all that remained was to hinder suspicion  from lighting on the innocent  and to confess  to my friend  the offence  which i had committed  meanwhile my first project was resumed  and  the  family being now wrapped in profound sleep  i left my chamber  and  proceeded to the elm  the moon was extremely brilliant  but i hoped that  this unfrequented road and unseasonable hour would hinder me from being  observed  my chamber was above the kitchen  with which it communicated  by a small staircase  and the building to which it belonged was  connected with the dwelling by a gallery  i extinguished the light  and  left it in the kitchen  intending to relight it  by the embers that  still glowed on the hearth  on my return     i began to remove the sod and cast out the earth  with little confidence  in the success of my project  the issue of my examination of the box  humbled and disheartened me  for some time i found nothing that tended  to invigorate my hopes  i determined  however  to descend  as long as  the unsettled condition of the earth showed me that some one had  preceded me  small masses of stone were occasionally met with  which  served only to perplex me with groundless expectations  at length my  spade struck upon something which emitted a very different sound  i  quickly drew it forth  and found it to be wood  its regular form  and  the crevices which were faintly discernible  persuaded me that it was  human workmanship  and that there was a cavity within  the place in  which it was found easily suggested some connection between this and the  destiny of clithero  covering up the hole with speed  i hastened with my  prize to the house  the door by which the kitchen was entered was not to  be seen from the road  it opened on a field  the farther limit of which  was a ledge of rocks  which formed  on this side  the boundary of  inglefield s estate and the westernmost barrier of norwalk     as i turned the angle of the house  and came in view of this door   methought i saw a figure issue from it  i was startled at this incident   and  stopping  crouched close to the wall  that i might not be  discovered  as soon as the figure passed beyond the verge of the shade   it was easily distinguished to be that of clithero  he crossed the field  with a rapid pace  and quickly passed beyond the reach of my eye     this appearance was mysterious  for what end he should visit this  habitation could not be guessed  was the contingency to be lamented in  consequence of which an interview had been avoided  would it have  compelled me to explain the broken condition of his trunk  i knew not  whether to rejoice at having avoided this interview  or to deplore it     these thoughts did not divert me from examining the nature of the prize  which i had gained  i relighted my candle and hied once more to the  chamber  the first object which  on entering it  attracted my attention   was the cabinet broken into twenty fragments  on the hearth  i had left  it on a low table  at a distant corner of the room     no conclusion could be formed but that clithero had been here  had  discovered the violence which had been committed on his property  and   in the first transport of his indignation  had shattered it to pieces  i  shuddered on reflecting how near i had been to being detected by him in  the very act  and by how small an interval i had escaped that resentment  which  in that case  would have probably been wreaked upon me     my attention was withdrawn  at length  from this object  and fixed upon  the contents of the box which i had dug up  this was equally  inaccessible with the other  i had not the same motives for caution and  forbearance  i was somewhat desperate  as the consequences of my  indiscretion could not be aggravated  and my curiosity was more  impetuous with regard to the smaller than to the larger cabinet  i  placed it on the ground and crushed it to pieces with my heel     something was within  i brought it to the light  and  after loosing  numerous folds  at length drew forth a volume  no object in the circle  of nature was more adapted than this to rouse up all my faculties  my  feelings were anew excited on observing that it was a manuscript  i  bolted the door  and  drawing near the light  opened and began to read     a few pages were sufficient to explain the nature of the work  clithero  had mentioned that his lady had composed a vindication of her conduct  towards her brother when her intercession in his favour was solicited  and refused  this performance had never been published  but had been  read by many  and was preserved by her friends as a precious monument of  her genius and her virtue  this manuscript was now before me     that clithero should preserve this manuscript  amidst the wreck of his  hopes and fortunes  was apparently conformable to his temper  that   having formed the resolution to die  he should seek to hide this volume  from the profane curiosity of survivors  was a natural proceeding  to  bury it rather than to burn  or disperse it into fragments  would be  suggested by the wish to conceal  without committing what his heated  fancy would regard as sacrilege  to bury it beneath the elm was dictated  by no fortuitous or inexplicable caprice  this event could scarcely fail  of exercising some influence on the perturbations of his sleep  and  thus  in addition to other causes  might his hovering near this trunk   and throwing up this earth  in the intervals of slumber  be accounted  for  clithero  indeed  had not mentioned this proceeding in the course  of his narrative  but that would have contravened the end for which he  had provided a grave for this book     i read this copious tale with unspeakable eagerness  it essentially  agreed with that which had been told by clithero  by drawing forth  events into all their circumstances  more distinct impressions were  produced on the mind  and proofs of fortitude and equanimity were here  given to which i had hitherto known no parallel  no wonder that a soul  like clithero s  pervaded by these proofs of inimitable excellence  and  thrillingly alive to the passion of virtuous fame  and the value of that  existence which he had destroyed  should be overborne by horror at the  view of the past     the instability of life and happiness was forcibly illustrated  as well  as the perniciousness of error  exempt as this lady was from almost  every defect  she was indebted for her ruin to absurd opinions of the  sacredness of consanguinity  to her anxiety for the preservation of a  ruffian because that ruffian was her brother  the spirit of clithero was  enlightened and erect  but he weakly suffered the dictates of eternal  justice to be swallowed up by gratitude  the dread of unjust upbraiding  hurried him to murder and to suicide  and the imputation of imaginary  guilt impelled him to the perpetration of genuine and enormous crimes     the perusal of this volume ended not but with the night  contrary to my  hopes  the next day was stormy and wet  this did not deter me from  visiting the mountain  slippery paths and muddy torrents were no  obstacles to the purposes which i had adopted  i wrapped myself  and a  bag of provisions  in a cloak of painted canvas  and speeded to the  dwelling of clithero     i passed through the cave and reached the bridge which my own ingenuity  had formed  at that moment  torrents of rain poured from above  and  stronger blasts thundered amidst these desolate recesses and profound  chasms  instead of lamenting the prevalence of this tempest  i now began  to regard it with pleasure  it conferred new forms of sublimity and  grandeur on this scene     as i crept with hands and feet along my imperfect bridge  a sudden gust  had nearly whirled me into the frightful abyss below  to preserve  myself  i was obliged to loose my hold of my burden  and it fell into  the gulf  this incident disconcerted and distressed me  as soon as i had  effected my dangerous passage  i screened myself behind a cliff and gave  myself up to reflection     the purpose of this arduous journey was defeated by the loss of the  provisions i had brought  i despaired of winning the attention of the  fugitive to supplications  or arguments tending to smother remorse or  revive his fortitude  the scope of my efforts was to consist in  vanquishing his aversion to food  but these efforts would now be  useless  since i had no power to supply his cravings     this deficiency  however  was easily supplied  i had only to return home  and supply myself anew  no time was to be lost in doing this  but i was  willing to remain under this shelter till the fury of the tempest had  subsided  besides  i was not certain that clithero had again retreated  hither  it was requisite to explore the summit of this hill  and  ascertain whether it had any inhabitant  i might likewise discover what  had been the success of my former experiment  and whether the food   which had been left here on the former day  was consumed or neglected     while occupied with these reflections  my eyes were fixed upon the  opposite steeps  the tops of the trees  waving to and fro in the wildest  commotion  and their trunks  occasionally bending to the blast  which   in these lofty regions  blew with a violence unknown in the tracts  below  exhibited an awful spectacle  at length  my attention was  attracted by the trunk which lay across the gulf  and which i had  converted into a bridge  i perceived that it had already somewhat  swerved from its original position  that every blast broke or loosened  some of the fibres by which its roots were connected with the opposite  bank  and that  if the storm did not speedily abate  there was imminent  danger of its being torn from the rock and precipitated into the chasm   thus my retreat would be cut off  and the evils from which i was  endeavouring to rescue another would be experienced by myself     i did not just then reflect that clithero had found access to this hill  by other means  and that the avenue by which he came would be equally  commodious to me  i believed my destiny to hang upon the expedition with  which i should recross this gulf  the moments that were spent in these  deliberations were critical  and i shuddered to observe that the trunk  was held in its place by one or two fibres which were already stretched  almost to breaking     to pass along the trunk  rendered slippery by the wet and unsteadfast by  the wind  was imminently dangerous  to maintain my hold  in passing  in  defiance of the whirlwind  required the most vigorous exertions  for  this end it was necessary to discommode myself of my cloak  and of the  volume which i carried in the pocket of my cloak  i believed there was  no reason to dread their being destroyed or purloined  if left  for a  few hours or a day  in this recess  if laid beside a stone  under  shelter of this cliff  they would  no doubt  remain unmolested till the  disappearance of the storm should permit me to revisit this spot in the  afternoon or on the morrow     just as i had disposed of these encumbrances and had risen from my seat   my attention was again called to the opposite steep  by the most  unwelcome object that  at this time  could possibly occur  something was  perceived moving among the bushes and rocks  which  for a time  i hoped  was no more than a raccoon or opossum  but which presently appeared to  be a panther  his gray coat  extended claws  fiery eyes  and a cry which  he at that moment uttered  and which  by its resemblance to the human  voice  is peculiarly terrific  denoted him to be the most ferocious and  untamable of that detested race      footnote  the gray cougar  this animal has all the essential  characteristics of a tiger  though somewhat inferior in size and  strength  these are such as to make him equally formidable to man      the industry of our hunters has nearly banished animals of prey from  these precincts  the fastnesses of norwalk  however  could not but  afford refuge to some of them  of late i had met them so rarely  that my  fears were seldom alive  and i trod  without caution  the ruggedest and  most solitary haunts  still  however  i had seldom been unfurnished in  my rambles with the means of defence     my temper never delighted in carnage and blood  i found no pleasure in  plunging into bogs  wading through rivulets  and penetrating thickets   for the sake of dispatching woodcocks and squirrels  to watch their  gambols and flittings  and invite them to my hand  was my darling  amusement when loitering among the woods and the rocks  it was much  otherwise  however  with regard to rattlesnakes and panthers  these i  thought it no breach of duty to exterminate wherever they could be  found  these judicious and sanguinary spoilers were equally the enemies  of man and of the harmless race that sported in the trees  and many of  their skins are still preserved by me as trophies of my juvenile  prowess     as hunting was never my trade or my sport  i never loaded myself with  fowling piece or rifle  assiduous exercise had made me master of a  weapon of much easier carriage  and  within a moderate distance  more  destructive and unerring  this was the tomahawk  with this i have often  severed an oak branch  and cut the sinews of a catamount  at the  distance of sixty feet     the unfrequency with which i had lately encountered this foe  and the  encumbrance of provision  made me neglect  on this occasion  to bring  with me my usual arms  the beast that was now before me  when stimulated  by hunger  was accustomed to assail whatever could provide him with a  banquet of blood  he would set upon the man and the deer with equal and  irresistible ferocity  his sagacity was equal to his strength  and he  seemed able to discover when his antagonist was armed and prepared for  defence     my past experience enabled me to estimate the full extent of my danger   he sat on the brow of the steep  eyeing the bridge  and apparently  deliberating whether he should cross it  it was probable that he had  scented my footsteps thus far  and  should he pass over  his vigilance  could scarcely fail of detecting my asylum  the pit into which clithero  had sunk from my view was at some distance  to reach it was the first  impulse of my fear  but this could not be done without exciting the  observation and pursuit of this enemy  i deeply regretted the untoward  chance that had led me  when i first came over  to a different shelter     should he retain his present station  my danger was scarcely lessened   to pass over in the face of a famished tiger was only to rush upon my  fate  the falling of the trunk  which had lately been so anxiously  deprecated  was now  with no less solicitude  desired  every new gust  i  hoped  would tear asunder its remaining bands  and  by cutting off all  communication between the opposite steeps  place me in security     my hopes  however  were destined to be frustrated  the fibres of the  prostrate tree were obstinately tenacious of their hold  and presently  the animal scrambled down the rock and proceeded to cross it     of all kinds of death  that which now menaced me was the most abhorred   to die by disease  or by the hand of a fellow creature  was propitious  and lenient in comparison with being rent to pieces by the fangs of this  savage  to perish in this obscure retreat  by means so impervious to the  anxious curiosity of my friends  to lose my portion of existence by so  untoward and ignoble a destiny  was insupportable  i bitterly deplored  my rashness in coming hither unprovided for an encounter like this     the evil of my present circumstances consisted chiefly in suspense  my  death was unavoidable  but my imagination had leisure to torment itself  by anticipations  one foot of the savage was slowly and cautiously moved  after the other  he struck his claws so deeply into the bark that they  were with difficulty withdrawn  at length he leaped upon the ground  we  were now separated by an interval of scarcely eight feet  to leave the  spot where i crouched was impossible  behind and beside me  the cliff  rose perpendicularly  and before me was this grim and terrific visage  i  shrunk still closer to the ground and closed my eyes     from this pause of horror i was aroused by the noise occasioned by a  second spring of the animal  he leaped into the pit  in which i had so  deeply regretted that i had not taken refuge  and disappeared  my rescue  was so sudden  and so much beyond my belief or my hope  that i doubted   for a moment  whether my senses did not deceive me  this opportunity of  escape was not to be neglected  i left my place  and scrambled over the  trunk with a precipitation which had liked to have proved fatal  the  tree groaned and shook under me  the wind blew with unexampled violence   and i had scarcely reached the opposite steep when the roots were  severed from the rock and the whole fell thundering to the bottom of the  chasm     my trepidations were not speedily quieted  i looked back with wonder on  my hairbreadth escape  and on that singular concurrence of events which  had placed me  in so short a period  in absolute security  had the trunk  fallen a moment earlier  i should have been imprisoned on the hill or  thrown headlong  had its fall been delayed another moment  i should have  been pursued  for the beast now issued from his den  and testified his  surprise and disappointment by tokens the sight of which made my blood  run cold     he saw me  and hastened to the verge of the chasm  he squatted on his  hind legs and assumed the attitude of one preparing to leap  my  consternation was excited afresh by these appearances  it seemed at  first as if the rift was too wide for any power of muscles to carry him  in safety over  but i knew the unparalleled agility of this animal  and  that his experience had made him a better judge of the practicability of  this exploit than i was  still there was hope that he would relinquish  this design as desperate  this hope was quickly at an end  he sprung   and his fore legs touched the verge of the rock on which i stood  in  spite of vehement exertions  however  the surface was too smooth and too  hard to allow him to make good his hold  he fell  and a piercing cry   uttered below  showed that nothing had obstructed his descent to the  bottom     thus was i again rescued from death  nothing but the pressure of famine  could have prompted this savage to so audacious and hazardous an effort   but  by yielding to this impulse  he had made my future visits to this  spot exempt from peril  clithero was  likewise  relieved from a danger  that was imminent and unforeseen  prowling over these grounds  the  panther could scarcely have failed to meet with this solitary fugitive     had the animal lived  my first duty would have been to have sought him  out and assailed him with my tomahawk  but no undertaking would have  been more hazardous  lurking in the grass  or in the branches of a tree   his eye might have descried my approach  he might leap upon me  unperceived  and my weapon would be useless     with a heart beating with unwonted rapidity  i once more descended the  cliff  entered the cavern  and arrived at huntly farm  drenched with  rain  and exhausted by fatigue     by night the storm was dispelled  but my exhausted strength would not  allow me to return to the mountain  at the customary hour i retired to  my chamber  i incessantly ruminated on the adventures of the last day   and inquired into the conduct which i was next to pursue     the bridge being destroyed  my customary access was cut off  there was  no possibility of restoring this bridge  my strength would not suffice  to drag a fallen tree from a distance  and there was none whose position  would abridge or supersede that labour  some other expedient must   therefore  be discovered to pass this chasm     i reviewed the circumstances of my subterranean journey  the cavern was  imperfectly explored  its branches might be numerous  that which i had  hitherto pursued terminated in an opening at a considerable distance  from the bottom  other branches might exist  some of which might lead to  the foot of the precipice  and thence a communication might be found  with the summit of the interior hill     the danger of wandering into dark and untried paths  and the  commodiousness of that road which had at first been taken  were  sufficient reasons for having hitherto suspended my examination of the  different branches of this labyrinth  now my customary road was no  longer practicable  and another was to be carefully explored  for this  end  on my next journey to the mountain  i determined to take with me a  lamp  and unravel this darksome maze  this project i resolved to execute  the next day     i now recollected what  if it had more seasonably occurred  would have  taught me caution  some months before this a farmer  living in the  skirts of norwalk  discovered two marauders in his field  whom he  imagined to be a male and female panther  they had destroyed some sheep   and had been hunted by the farmer with long and fruitless diligence   sheep had likewise been destroyed in different quarters  but the owners  had fixed the imputation of the crime upon dogs  many of whom had atoned  for their supposed offences by their death  he who had mentioned his  discovery of panthers received little credit from his neighbours   because a long time had elapsed since these animals were supposed to  have been exiled from this district  and because no other person had  seen them  the truth of this seemed now to be confirmed by the testimony  of my own senses  but  if the rumour were true  there still existed  another of these animals  who might harbour in the obscurities of this  desert  and against whom it was necessary to employ some precaution   henceforth i resolved never to traverse the wilderness unfurnished with  my tomahawk     these images  mingled with those which the contemplation of futurity  suggested  floated  for a time  in my brain  but at length gave place to  sleep           chapter xiii       since my return home  my mind had been fully occupied by schemes and  reflections relative to clithero  the project suggested by thee  and to  which i had determined to devote my leisure  was forgotten  or  remembered for a moment and at wide intervals  what  however  was nearly  banished from my waking thoughts  occurred in an incongruous and  half seen form  to my dreams  during my sleep  the image of waldegrave  flitted before me  methought the sentiment that impelled him to visit me  was not affection or complacency  but inquietude and anger  some service  or duty remained to be performed by me  which i had culpably neglected   to inspirit my zeal  to awaken my remembrance  and incite me to the  performance of this duty  did this glimmering messenger  this  half indignant apparition  come     i commonly awake soon enough to mark the youngest dawn of the morning   now  in consequence perhaps of my perturbed sleep  i opened my eyes  before the stars had lost any of their lustre  this circumstance  produced some surprise  until the images that lately hovered in my fancy  were recalled  and furnished somewhat like a solution of the problem   connected with the image of my dead friend was that of his sister  the  discourse that took place at our last interview  the scheme of  transcribing  for thy use  all the letters which  during his short but  busy life  i received from him  the nature of this correspondence  and  the opportunity which this employment would afford me of contemplating  these ample and precious monuments of the intellectual existence and  moral pre eminence of my friend  occurred to my thoughts     the resolution to prosecute the task was revived  the obligation of  benevolence  with regard to clithero  was not discharged  this  neither  duty nor curiosity would permit to be overlooked or delayed  but why  should my whole attention and activity be devoted to this man  the hours  which were spent at home and in my chamber could not be more usefully  employed than in making my intended copy     in a few hours after sunrise i purposed to resume my way to the  mountain  could this interval be appropriated to a better purpose than  in counting over my friend s letters  setting them apart from my own   and preparing them for that transcription from which i expected so high  and yet so mournful a gratification     this purpose  by no violent union  was blended with the recollection of  my dream  this recollection infused some degree of wavering and  dejection into my mind  in transcribing these letters i should violate  pathetic and solemn injunctions frequently repeated by the writer  was  there some connection between this purpose and the incidents of my  vision  was the latter sent to enforce the interdictions which had been  formerly imposed     thou art not fully acquainted with the intellectual history of thy  brother  some information on that head will be necessary to explain the  nature of that reluctance which i now feel to comply with thy request   and which had formerly so much excited thy surprise     waldegrave  like other men early devoted to meditation and books  had  adopted  at different periods  different systems of opinion on topics  connected with religion and morals  his earliest creeds tended to efface  the impressions of his education  to deify necessity and universalize  matter  to destroy the popular distinctions between soul and body  and  to dissolve the supposed connection between the moral condition of man  anterior and subsequent to death     this creed he adopted with all the fulness of conviction  and propagated  with the utmost zeal  soon after our friendship commenced  fortune  placed us at a distance from each other  and no intercourse was allowed  but by the pen  our letters  however  were punctual and copious  those  of waldegrave were too frequently devoted to the defence of his  favourite tenets     thou art acquainted with the revolution that afterwards took place in  his mind  placed within the sphere of religious influence  and listening  daily to the reasonings and exhortations of mr  s      whose benign  temper and blameless deportment was a visible and constant lesson  he  insensibly resumed the faith which he had relinquished  and became the  vehement opponent of all that he had formerly defended  the chief object  of his labours  in this new state of his mind  was to counteract the  effect of his former reasonings on my opinions     at this time  other changes took place in his situation  in consequence  of which we were once more permitted to reside under the same roof  the  intercourse now ceased to be by letter  and the subtle and laborious  argumentations which he had formerly produced against religion  and  which were contained in a permanent form  were combated in transient  conversation  he was not only eager to subvert those opinions which he  had contributed to instil into me  but was anxious that the letters and  manuscripts which had been employed in their support should be  destroyed  he did not fear wholly or chiefly on my own account  he  believed that the influence of former reasonings on my faith would be  sufficiently eradicated by the new  but he dreaded lest these  manuscripts might fall into other hands  and thus produce mischiefs  which it would not be in his power to repair  with regard to me  the  poison had been followed by its antidote  but with respect to others   these letters would communicate the poison when the antidote could not  be administered     i would not consent to this sacrifice  i did not entirely abjure the  creed which had  with great copiousness and eloquence  been defended in  these letters  besides  mixed up with abstract reasonings were  numberless passages which elucidated the character and history of my  friend  these were too precious to be consigned to oblivion  and to take  them out of their present connection and arrangement would be to  mutilate and deform them     his entreaties and remonstrances were earnest and frequent  but always  ineffectual  he had too much purity of motives to be angry at my  stubbornness  but his sense of the mischievous tendency of these letters  was so great  that my intractability cost him many a pang     he was now gone  and i had not only determined to preserve these  monuments  but had consented to copy them for the use of another  for  the use of one whose present and eternal welfare had been the chief  object of his cares and efforts  thou  like others of thy sex  art  unaccustomed to metaphysical refinements  thy religion is the growth of  sensibility and not of argument  thou art not fortified and prepossessed  against the subtleties with which the being and attributes of the deity  have been assailed  would it be just to expose thee to pollution and  depravity from this source  to make thy brother the instrument of thy  apostasy  the author of thy fall  that brother whose latter days were so  ardently devoted to cherishing the spirit of devotion in thy heart     these ideas now occurred with more force than formerly  i had promised   not without reluctance  to give thee the entire copy of his letters  but  i now receded from this promise  i resolved merely to select for thy  perusal such as were narrative or descriptive  this could not be done  with too much expedition  it was still dark  but my sleep was at an end   and  by a common apparatus  that lay beside my bed  i could instantly  produce a light     the light was produced  and i proceeded to the cabinet where all my  papers and books are deposited  this was my own contrivance and  workmanship  undertaken by the advice of sarsefield  who took infinite  pains to foster that mechanical genius which displayed itself so early  and so forcibly in thy friend  the key belonging to this was  like the  cabinet itself  of singular structure  for greater safety  it was  constantly placed in a closet  which was likewise locked     the key was found as usual  and the cabinet opened  the letters were  bound together in a compact form  lodged in a parchment case  and placed  in a secret drawer  this drawer would not have been detected by common  eyes  and it opened by the motion of a spring  of whose existence none  but the maker was conscious  this drawer i had opened before i went to  sleep  and the letters were then safe     thou canst not imagine my confusion and astonishment  when  on opening  the drawer  i perceived that the packet was gone  i looked with more  attention  and put my hand within it  but the space was empty  whither  had it gone  and by whom was it purloined  i was not conscious of having  taken it away  yet no hands but mine could have done it  on the last  evening i had doubtless removed it to some other corner  but had  forgotten it  i tasked my understanding and my memory  i could not  conceive the possibility of any motives inducing me to alter my  arrangements in this respect  and was unable to recollect that i had  made this change     what remained  this invaluable relic had disappeared  every thought and  every effort must be devoted to the single purpose of regaining it  as  yet i did not despair  until i had opened and ransacked every part of  the cabinet in vain  i did not admit the belief that i had lost it  even  then this persuasion was tumultuous and fluctuating  it had vanished to  my senses  but these senses were abused and depraved  to have passed  of  its own accord  through the pores of this wood  was impossible  but  if  it were gone  thus did it escape     i was lost in horror and amazement  i explored every nook a second and a  third time  but still it eluded my eye and my touch  i opened my closets  and cases  i pried everywhere  unfolded every article of clothing   turned and scrutinized every instrument and tool  but nothing availed     my thoughts were not speedily collected or calmed  i threw myself on the  bed and resigned myself to musing  that my loss was irretrievable was a  supposition not to be endured  yet ominous terrors haunted me   a  whispering intimation that a relic which i valued more than life was  torn forever away by some malignant and inscrutable destiny  the same  power that had taken it from this receptacle was able to waft it over  the ocean or the mountains  and condemn me to a fruitless and eternal  search     but what was he that committed the theft  thou only  of the beings who  live  wast acquainted with the existence of these manuscripts  thou art  many miles distant  and art utterly a stranger to the mode or place of  their concealment  not only access to the cabinet  but access to the  room  without my knowledge and permission  was impossible  both were  locked during this night  not five hours had elapsed since the cabinet  and drawer had been opened  and since the letters had been seen and  touched  being in their ordinary position  during this interval  the  thief had entered  and despoiled me of my treasure     this event  so inexplicable and so dreadful  threw my soul into a kind  of stupor or distraction  from which i was suddenly roused by a footstep  softly moving in the entry near my door  i started from my bed  as if i  had gained a glimpse of the robber  before i could run to the door  some  one knocked  i did not think upon the propriety of answering the signal   but hastened with tremulous fingers and throbbing heart to open the  door  my uncle  in his night dress  and apparently just risen from his  bed  stood before me     he marked the eagerness and perturbation of my looks  and inquired into  the cause  i did not answer his inquiries  his appearance in my chamber  and in this guise added to my surprise  my mind was full of the late  discovery  and instantly conceived some connection between this  unseasonable visit and my lost manuscript  i interrogated him in my turn  as to the cause of his coming      why   said he   i came to ascertain whether it was you or not who  amused himself so strangely at this time of night  what is the matter  with you  why are you up so early      i told him that i had been roused by my dreams  and  finding no  inclination to court my slumber back again  i had risen  though earlier  by some hours than the usual period of my rising      but why did you go up stairs  you might easily imagine that the sound  of your steps would alarm those below  who would be puzzled to guess who  it was that had thought proper to amuse himself in this manner       up stairs  i have not left my room this night  it is not ten minutes  since i awoke  and my door has not since been opened       indeed  that is strange  nay  it is impossible  it was your feet surely  that i heard pacing so solemnly and indefatigably across the  long  room  for near an hour  i could not for my life conjecture  for a  time  who it was  but finally concluded that it was you  there was  still  however  some doubt  and i came hither to satisfy myself      these tidings were adapted to raise all my emotions to a still higher  pitch  i questioned him with eagerness as to the circumstances he had  noticed  he said he had been roused by a sound  whose power of  disturbing him arose  not from its loudness  but from its uncommonness   he distinctly heard some one pacing to and fro with bare feet  in the  long room  this sound continued  with little intermission  for an hour   he then noticed a cessation of the walking  and a sound as if some one  were lifting the lid of the large cedar chest that stood in the corner  of this room  the walking was not resumed  and all was silent  he  listened for a quarter of an hour  and busied himself in conjecturing  the cause of this disturbance  the most probable conclusion was  that  the walker was his nephew  and his curiosity had led him to my chamber  to ascertain the truth     this dwelling has three stories  the two lower stories are divided into  numerous apartments  the upper story constitutes a single room whose  sides are the four walls of the house  and whose ceiling is the roof   this room is unoccupied  except by lumber  and imperfectly lighted by a  small casement at one end  in this room were footsteps heard by my  uncle     the staircase leading to it terminated in a passage near my door  i  snatched the candle  and  desiring him to follow me  added that i would  ascertain the truth in a moment  he followed  but observed that the  walking had ceased long enough for the person to escape     i ascended to the room  and looked behind and among the tables  and  chairs  and casks  which were confusedly scattered through it  but found  nothing in the shape of man  the cedar chest  spoken of by mr  huntly   contained old books  and remnants of maps and charts  whose  worthlessness unfitted them for accomodation elsewhere  the lid was  without hinges or lock  i examined this repository  but there was  nothing which attracted my attention     the way between the kitchen door and the door of the long room had no  impediments  both were usually unfastened  but the motives by which any  stranger to the dwelling  or indeed any one within it  could be prompted  to choose this place and hour for an employment of this kind  were  wholly incomprehensible     when the family rose  inquiries were made  but no satisfaction was  obtained  the family consisted only of four persons   my uncle  my two  sisters  and myself  i mentioned to them the loss i had sustained  but  their conjectures were no less unsatisfactory on this than on the former  incident     there was no end to my restless meditations  waldegrave was the only  being  besides myself  acquainted with the secrets of my cabinet  during  his life these manuscripts had been the objects of perpetual solicitude   to gain possession  to destroy or secrete them  was the strongest of his  wishes  had he retained his sensibility on the approach of death  no  doubt he would have renewed  with irresistible solemnity  his  injunctions to destroy them     now  however  they had vanished  there were no materials of conjecture   no probabilities to be weighed  or suspicions to revolve  human artifice  or power was unequal to this exploit  means less than preternatural  would not furnish a conveyance for this treasure     it was otherwise with regard to this unseasonable walker  his  inducements indeed were beyond my power to conceive  but to enter these  doors and ascend these stairs demanded not the faculties of any being  more than human     this intrusion  and the pillage of my cabinet  were contemporary events   was there no more connection between them than that which results from  time  was not the purloiner of my treasure and the wanderer the same  person  i could not reconcile the former incident with the attributes of  man  and yet a secret faith  not to be outrooted or suspended  swayed  me  and compelled me to imagine that the detection of this visitant  would unveil the thief     these thoughts were pregnant with dejection and reverie  clithero   during the day  was forgotten  on the succeeding night  my intentions   with regard to this man  returned  i derived some slender consolation  from reflecting  that time  in its long lapse and ceaseless revolutions   might dissipate the gloom that environed me  meanwhile  i struggled to  dismiss the images connected with my loss and to think only of clithero     my impatience was as strong as ever to obtain another interview with  this man  i longed with vehemence for the return of day  i believed that  every moment added to his sufferings  intellectual and physical  and  confided in the efficacy of my presence to alleviate or suspend them   the provisions i had left would be speedily consumed  and the abstinence  of three days was sufficient to undermine the vital energies  i  sometimes hesitated whether i ought not instantly to depart  it was  night indeed  but the late storm had purified the air  and the radiance  of a full moon was universal and dazzling     from this attempt i was deterred by reflecting that my own frame needed  the repairs of sleep  toil and watchfulness  if prolonged another day   would deeply injure a constitution by no means distinguished for its  force  i must  therefore  compel  if it were possible  some hours of  repose  i prepared to retire to bed  when a new incident occurred to  divert my attention for a time from these designs           chapter xiv       while sitting alone by the parlour fire  marking the effects of  moonlight  i noted one on horseback coming towards the gate  at first  sight  methought his shape and guise were not wholly new to me  but all  that i could discern was merely a resemblance to some one whom i had  before seen  presently he stopped  and  looking towards the house  made  inquiries of a passenger who chanced to be near  being apparently  satisfied with the answers he received  he rode with a quick pace into  the court and alighted at the door  i started from my seat  and  going  forth  waited with some impatience to hear his purpose explained     he accosted me with the formality of a stranger  and asked if a young  man  by name edgar huntly  resided here  being answered in the  affirmative  and being requested to come in  he entered  and seated  himself  without hesitation  by the fire  some doubt and anxiety were  visible in his looks  he seemed desirous of information upon some topic   and yet betrayed terror lest the answers he might receive should subvert  some hope or confirm some foreboding     meanwhile i scrutinized his features with much solicitude  a nearer and  more deliberate view convinced me that the first impression was just   but still i was unable to call up his name or the circumstances of our  former meeting  the pause was at length ended by his saying  in a  faltering voice        my name is weymouth  i came hither to obtain information on a subject  in which my happiness is deeply concerned      at the mention of his name  i started  it was a name too closely  connected with the image of thy brother  not to call up affecting and  vivid recollections  weymouth  thou knowest  was thy brother s friend   it is three years since this man left america  during which time no  tidings had been heard of him   at least  by thy brother  he had now  returned  and was probably unacquainted with the fate of his friend     after an anxious pause  he continued    since my arrival i have heard of  an event which has  on many accounts  given me the deepest sorrow  i  loved waldegrave  and know not any person in the world whose life was  dearer to me than his  there were considerations  however  which made it  more precious to me than the life of one whose merits might be greater   with his life  my own existence and property were  i have reason to  think  inseparably united      on my return to my country  after a long absence  i made immediate  inquiries after him  i was informed of his untimely death  i had  questions  of infinite moment to my happiness  to decide with regard to  the state and disposition of his property  i sought out those of his  friends who had maintained with him the most frequent and confidential  intercourse  but they could not afford me any satisfaction  at length  i  was informed that a young man of your name  and living in this district   had enjoyed more of his affection and society than any other  had  regulated the property which he left behind  and was best qualified to  afford the intelligence which i sought  you  it seems  are this person   and of you i must make inquiries to which i conjure you to return  sincere and explicit answers       that   said i   i shall find no difficulty in doing  whatever questions  you shall think proper to ask  i will answer with readiness and truth       what kind of property  and to what amount  was your friend possessed of  at his death       it was money  and consisted of deposits at the bank of north america   the amount was little short of eight thousand dollars       on whom has this property devolved       his sister was his only kindred  and she is now in possession of it       did he leave any will by which he directed the disposition of his  property   while thus speaking  weymouth fixed his eyes upon my  countenance  and seemed anxious to pierce into my inmost soul  i was  somewhat surprised at his questions  but much more at the manner in  which they were put  i answered him  however  without delay    he left  no will  nor was any paper discovered by which we could guess at his  intentions  no doubt  indeed  had he made a will  his sister would have  been placed precisely in the same condition in which she now is  he was  not only bound to her by the strongest ties of kindred  but by affection  and gratitude      weymouth now withdrew his eyes from my face  and sunk into a mournful  reverie  he sighed often and deeply  this deportment and the strain of  his inquiries excited much surprise  his interest in the fate of  waldegrave ought to have made the information he had received a source  of satisfaction rather than of regret  the property which waldegrave  left was much greater than his mode of life and his own professions had  given us reason to expect  but it was no more than sufficient to insure  to thee an adequate subsistence  it ascertained the happiness of those  who were dearest to waldegrave  and placed them forever beyond the reach  of that poverty which had hitherto beset them  i made no attempt to  interrupt the silence  but prepared to answer any new interrogatory  at  length  weymouth resumed        waldegrave was a fortunate man to amass so considerable a sum in so  short a time  i remember  when we parted  he was poor  he used to lament  that his scrupulous integrity precluded him from all the common roads to  wealth  he did not contemn riches  but he set the highest value upon  competence  and imagined that he was doomed forever to poverty  his  religious duty compelled him to seek his livelihood by teaching a school  of blacks  the labour was disproportioned to his feeble constitution   and the profit was greatly disproportioned to the labour  it scarcely  supplied the necessities of nature  and was reduced sometimes even below  that standard by his frequent indisposition  i rejoice to find that his  scruples had somewhat relaxed their force  and that he had betaken  himself to some more profitable occupation  pray  what was his new way  of business       nay   said i   his scruples continued as rigid  in this respect  as  ever  he was teacher of the negro freeschool when he died       indeed  how  then  came he to amass so much money  could he blend any  more lucrative pursuit with his duty as a schoolmaster       so it seems       what was his pursuit       that question  i believe  none of his friends are qualified to answer   i thought myself acquainted with the most secret transactions of his  life  but this had been carefully concealed from me  i was not only  unapprized of any other employment of his time  but had not the  slightest suspicion of his possessing any property besides his clothes  and books  ransacking his papers  with a different view  i lighted on  his bank book  in which was a regular receipt for seven thousand five  hundred dollars  by what means he acquired this money  and even the  acquisition of it  till his death put us in possession of his papers   was wholly unknown to us       possibly he might have held it in trust for another  in this case some  memorandums or letters would be found explaining this affair       true  this supposition could not fail to occur  in consequence of which  the most diligent search was made among his papers  but no shred or  scrap was to be found which countenanced our conjecture       you may reasonably be surprised  and perhaps offended   said weymouth    at these inquiries  but it is time to explain my motives for making  them  three years ago i was  like waldegrave  indigent  and earned my  bread by daily labour  during seven years  service in a public office  i  saved  from the expenses of subsistence  a few hundred dollars  i  determined to strike into a new path  and  with this sum  to lay the  foundation of better fortune  i turned it into a bulky commodity   freighted and loaded a small vessel  and went with it to barcelona in  spain  i was not unsuccessful in my projects  and  changing my abode to  england  france  and germany  according as my interest required  i  became finally possessed of sufficient for the supply of all my wants  i  then resolved to return to my native country  and  laying out my money  in land  to spend the rest of my days in the luxury and quiet of an  opulent farmer  for this end i invested the greatest part of my property  in a cargo of wine from madeira  the remainder i turned into a bill of  exchange for seven thousand five hundred dollars  i had maintained a  friendly correspondence with waldegrave during my absence  there was no  one with whom i had lived on terms of so much intimacy  and had  boundless confidence in his integrity  to him therefore i determined to  transmit this bill  requesting him to take the money into safe keeping  until my return  in this manner i endeavoured to provide against the  accidents that might befall my person or my cargo in crossing the ocean      it was my fate to encounter the worst of these disasters  we were  overtaken by a storm  my vessel was driven ashore on the coast of  portugal  my cargo was utterly lost  and the greater part of the crew  and passengers were drowned  i was rescued from the same fate by some  fishermen  in consequence of the hardships to which i had been exposed   having laboured for several days at the pumps  and spent the greater  part of a winter night hanging from the rigging of the ship and  perpetually beaten by the waves  i contracted a severe disease  which  bereaved me of the use of my limbs  the fishermen who rescued me carried  me to their huts  and there i remained three weeks helpless and  miserable      that part of the coast on which i was thrown was  in the highest  degree  sterile and rude  its few inhabitants subsisted precariously on  the produce of the ocean  their dwellings were of mud   low  filthy   dark  and comfortless  their fuel was the stalks of shrubs sparingly  scattered over a sandy desert  their poverty scarcely allowed them salt  and black bread with their fish  which was obtained in unequal and  sometimes insufficient quantities  and which they ate with all its  impurities  and half cooked      my former habits  as well as my present indisposition  required very  different treatment from what the ignorance and penury of these people  obliged them to bestow  i lay upon the moist earth  imperfectly  sheltered from the sky  and with neither raiment nor fire to keep me  warm  my hosts had little attention or compassion to spare to the wants  of others  they could not remove me to a more hospitable district  and  here  without doubt  i should have perished  had not a monk chanced to  visit their hovels  he belonged to a convent of st  jago  some leagues  farther from the shore  which used to send one of its members annually  to inspect the religious concerns of those outcasts  happily  this was  the period of their visitations      my abode in spain had made me somewhat conversant with its language   the dialect of this monk did not so much differ from castilian but that   with the assistance of latin  we were able to converse  the jargon of  the fishermen was unintelligible  and they had vainly endeavoured to  keep up my spirits by informing me of this expected visit      this monk was touched with compassion at my calamity  and speedily  provided the means of my removal to his convent  here i was charitably  entertained  and the aid of a physician was procured for me  he was but  poorly skilled in his profession  and rather confirmed than alleviated  my disease  the portuguese of his trade  especially in remoter  districts  are little more than dealers in talismans and nostrums  for a  long time i was unable to leave my pallet  and had no prospect before me  but that of consuming my days in the gloom of this cloister      all the members of this convent but he who had been my first  benefactor  and whose name was chaledro  were bigoted and sordid  their  chief motive for treating me with kindness was the hope of obtaining a  convert from heresy  they spared no pains to subdue my errors  and were  willing to prolong my imprisonment  in the hope of finally gaining their  end  had my fate been governed by those  i should have been immured in  this convent  and compelled either to adopt their fanatical creed or to  put an end to my own life  in order to escape their well meant  persecutions  chaledro  however  though no less sincere in his faith and  urgent in his entreaties  yet finding me invincible  exerted his  influence to obtain my liberty      after many delays  and strenuous exertions of my friend  they consented  to remove me to oporto  the journey was to be performed in an open cart   over a mountainous country  in the heats of summer  the monks  endeavoured to dissuade me from the enterprise  for my own sake  it  being scarcely possible that one in my feeble state should survive a  journey like this  but i despaired of improving my condition by other  means  i preferred death to the imprisonment of a portuguese monastery   and knew that i could hope for no alleviation of my disease but from the  skill of scottish or french physicians  whom i expected to meet with in  that city  i adhered to my purpose with so much vehemence and obstinacy   that they finally yielded to my wishes      my road lay through the wildest and most rugged districts  it did not  exceed ninety miles  but seven days were consumed on the way  the motion  of the vehicle racked me with the keenest pangs  and my attendants  concluded that every stage would be my last  they had been selected  without due regard to their characters  they were knavish and inhuman   and omitted nothing but actual violence to hasten my death  they  purposely retarded the journey  and protracted to seven what might have  been readily performed in four days  they neglected to execute the  orders which they had received respecting my lodging and provisions  and  from them  as well as from the peasants  who were sure to be informed  that i was a heretic  i suffered every species of insult and injury  my  constitution  as well as my frame  possessed a fund of strength of which  i had no previous conception  in spite of hardship  and exposure  and  abstinence  i at last arrived at oporto      instead of being carried  agreeably to chaledro s direction  to a  convent of st  jago  i was left  late in the evening  in the porch of a  common hospital  my attendants  having laid me on the pavement and  loaded me with imprecations  left me to obtain admission by my own  efforts  i passed the livelong night in this spot  and in the morning  was received into the house in a state which left it uncertain whether i  was alive or dead      after recovering my sensibility  i made various efforts to procure a  visit from some english merchant  this was no easy undertaking for one  in my deplorable condition  i was too weak to articulate my words  distinctly  and these words were rendered  by my foreign accent   scarcely intelligible  the likelihood of my speedy death made the people  about me more indifferent to my wants and petitions      i will not dwell upon my repeated disappointments  but content myself  with mentioning that i gained the attention of a french gentleman whose  curiosity brought him to view the hospital  through him i obtained a  visit from an english merchant  and finally gained the notice of a  person who formerly resided in america  and of whom i had imperfect  knowledge  by their kindness i was removed from the hospital to a  private house  a scottish surgeon was summoned to my assistance  and in  seven months i was restored to my present state of health      at oporto  i embarked  in an american ship  for new york  i was  destitute of all property  and relied  for the payment of the debts  which i was obliged to contract  as well as for my future subsistence   on my remittance to waldegrave  i hastened to philadelphia  and was soon  informed that my friend was dead  his death had taken place a long time  since my remittance to him  hence this disaster was a subject of regret  chiefly on his own account  i entertained no doubt but that my property  had been secured  and that either some testamentary directions or some  papers had been left behind respecting this affair      i sought out those who were formerly our mutual acquaintance  i found  that they were wholly strangers to his affairs  they could merely relate  some particulars of his singular death  and point out the lodgings which  he formerly occupied  hither i forthwith repaired  and discovered that  he lived in this house with his sister  disconnected with its other  inhabitants  they described his mode of life in terms that showed them  to be very imperfectly acquainted with it  it was easy indeed to infer   from their aspect and manners  that little sympathy or union could have  subsisted between them and their co tenants  and this inference was  confirmed by their insinuations  the growth of prejudice and envy  they  told me that waldegrave s sister had gone to live in the country  but  whither  or for how long  she had not condescended to inform them  and  they did not care to ask  she was a topping dame  whose notions were  much too high for her station  who was more nice than wise  and yet was  one who could stoop when it most became her to stand upright  it was no  business of theirs  but they could not but mention their suspicions that  she had good reasons for leaving the city and for concealing the place  of her retreat  some things were hard to be disguised  they spoke for  themselves  and the only way to hinder disagreeable discoveries was to  keep out of sight      i was wholly a stranger to waldegrave s sister  i knew merely that he  had such a relation  there was nothing  therefore  to outbalance this  unfavourable report  but the apparent malignity and grossness of those  who gave it  it was not  however  her character about which i was  solicitous  but merely the place where she might be found and the  suitable inquiries respecting her deceased brother be answered  on this  head  these people professed utter ignorance  and were either unable or  unwilling to direct me to any person in the city who knew more than  themselves  after much discourse  they  at length  let fall an  intimation that  if any one knew her place of retreat  it was probably a  country lad  by name huntly  who lived near the  forks  of  delaware  after waldegrave s death this lad had paid his sister a visit   and seemed to be admitted on a very confidential footing  she left the  house  for the last time  in his company  and he  therefore  was most  likely to know what had become of her      the name of huntly was not totally unknown to me  i myself was born and  brought up in the neighbouring township of chetasco  i had some  knowledge of your family  and your name used often to be mentioned by  waldegrave as that of one who  at a maturer age  would prove himself  useful to his country  i determined  therefore  to apply to you for what  information you could give  i designed to visit my father  who lives in  chetasco  and relieve him from that disquiet which his ignorance of my  fate could not fail to have inspired  and both these ends could be thus   at the same time  accomplished      before i left the city  i thought it proper to apply to the merchant on  whom my bill had been drawn  if this bill had been presented and paid   he had doubtless preserved some record of it  and hence a clue might be  afforded  though every other expedient should fail  my usual ill fortune  pursued me upon this occasion  for the merchant had lately become  insolvent  and  to avoid the rage of his creditors  had fled  without  leaving any vestige of this or similar transactions behind him  he had   some years since  been an adventurer from holland  and was suspected to  have returned thither            chapter xv        i came hither with a heart desponding of success  adversity had  weakened my faith in the promises of the future  and i was prepared to  receive just such tidings as you have communicated  unacquainted with  the secret motives of waldegrave and his sister  it is impossible for me  to weigh the probabilities of their rectitude  i have only my own  assertion to produce in support of my claim  all other evidence  all  vouchers and papers  which might attest my veracity or sanction my claim  in a court of law  are buried in the ocean  the bill was transmitted  just before my departure from madeira  and the letters by which it was  accompanied informed waldegrave of my design to follow it immediately   hence he did not  it is probable  acknowledge the receipt of my letters   the vessels in which they were sent arrived in due season  i was assured  that all letters were duly deposited in the post office  where  at  present  mine are not to be found      you assure me that nothing has been found among his papers  hinting at  any pecuniary transaction between him and me  some correspondence passed  between us previous to that event  have no letters  with my signature   been found  are you qualified  by your knowledge of his papers  to  answer me explicitly  is it not possible for some letters to have been  mislaid       i am qualified   said i   to answer your inquiries beyond any other  person in the world  waldegrave maintained only general intercourse with  the rest of mankind  with me his correspondence was copious  and his  confidence  as i imagined  without bounds  his books and papers were  contained in a single chest at his lodgings  the keys of which he had  about him when he died  these keys i carried to his sister  and was  authorized by her to open and examine the contents of this chest  this  was done with the utmost care  these papers are now in my possession   among them no paper  of the tenor you mention  was found  and no letter  with your signature  neither mary waldegrave nor i are capable of  disguising the truth or committing an injustice  the moment she receives  conviction of your right  she will restore this money to you  the moment  i imbibe this conviction  i will exert all my influence  and it is not  small  to induce her to restore it  permit me  however  to question you  in your turn  who was the merchant on whom your bill was drawn  what was  the date of it  and when did the bill and its counterparts arrive       i do not exactly remember the date of the bills  they were made out   however  six days before i myself embarked  which happened on the   th  of august        they were sent by three vessels  one of which was bound  to charleston and the others to new york  the last arrived within two  days of each other  and about the middle of november in the same year   the name of the payer was monteith      after a pause of recollection  i answered   i will not hesitate to  apprize you of every thing which may throw light upon this transaction   and whether favourable or otherwise to your claim  i have told you   among my friend s papers your name is not to be found  i must likewise  repeat that the possession of this money by waldegrave was wholly  unknown to us till his death  we are likewise unacquainted with any  means by which he could get possession of so large a sum in his own  right  he spent no more than his scanty stipend as a teacher  though  this stipend was insufficient to supply his wants  this bank receipt is  dated in december        a fortnight  perhaps  after the date that you  have mentioned  you will perceive how much this coincidence  which could  scarcely have taken place by chance  is favourable to your claim      mary waldegrave resides  at present  at abingdon  she will rejoice  as  i do  to see one who  as her brother s friend  is entitled to her  affection  doubt not but that she will listen with impartiality and  candour to all that you can urge in defence of your title to this money   her decision will not be precipitate  but it will be generous and just   and founded on such reasons that  even if it be adverse to your wishes   you will be compelled to approve it       i can entertain no doubt   he answered   as to the equity of my claim   the coincidences you mention are sufficient to convince me that this sum  was received upon my bill  but this conviction must necessarily be  confined to myself  no one but i can be conscious to the truth of my own  story  the evidence on which i build my faith  in this case  is that of  my own memory and senses  but this evidence cannot make itself  conspicuous to you  you have nothing but my bare assertion  in addition  to some probabilities flowing from the conduct of waldegrave  what facts  may exist to corroborate my claim  which you have forgotten  or which  you may think proper to conceal  i cannot judge  i know not what is  passing in the secret of your hearts  i am unacquainted with the  character of this lady and with yours  i have nothing on which to build  surmises and suspicions of your integrity  and nothing to generate  unusual confidence  the frailty of your virtue and the strength of your  temptations i know not  however she decides in this case  and whatever  opinion i shall form as to the reasonableness of her decision  it will  not become me either to upbraid her  or to nourish discontentment and  repinings      i know that my claim has no legal support  that  if this money be  resigned to me  it will be the impulse of spontaneous justice  and not  the coercion of law  to which i am indebted for it  since  therefore   the justice of my claim is to be measured not by law  but by simple  equity  i will candidly acknowledge that  as yet  it is uncertain  whether i ought to receive  even should miss waldegrave be willing to  give it  i know my own necessities and schemes  and in what degree this  money would be subservient to these  but i know not the views and wants  of others  and cannot estimate the usefulness of this money to them   however i decide upon your conduct in withholding or retaining it  i  shall make suitable allowance for my imperfect knowledge of your motives  and wants  as well as for your unavoidable ignorance of mine      i have related my sufferings from shipwreck and poverty  not to bias  your judgment or engage your pity  but merely because the impulse to  relate them chanced to awake  because my heart is softened by the  remembrance of waldegrave  who has been my only friend  and by the sight  of one whom he loved      i told you that my father lived in chetasco  he is now aged  and i am  his only child  i should have rejoiced in being able to relieve his gray  hairs from labour to which his failing strength cannot be equal  this  was one of my inducements in coming to america  another was  to prepare  the way for a woman whom i married in europe and who is now awaiting  intelligence from me in london  her poverty is not less than my own  and  by marrying against the wishes of her kindred she has bereaved herself  of all support but that of her husband  whether i shall be able to  rescue her from indigence  whether i shall alleviate the poverty of my  father  or increase it by burdening his scanty friends by my own  maintenance as well as his  the future alone can determine      i confess that my stock of patience and hope has never been large  and  that my misfortunes have nearly exhausted it  the flower of my years has  been consumed in struggling with adversity  and my constitution has  received a shock  from sickness and mistreatment in portugal  which i  cannot expect long to survive  but i make you sad   he continued   i  have said all that i meant to say in this interview  i am impatient to  see my father  and night has already come  i have some miles yet to ride  to his cottage  and over a rough road  i will shortly visit you again   and talk to you at greater leisure on these and other topics  at present  i leave you      i was unwilling to part so abruptly with this guest  and entreated him  to prolong his visit  but he would not be prevailed upon  repeating his  promise of shortly seeing me again  he mounted his horse and  disappeared  i looked after him with affecting and complex emotions  i  reviewed the incidents of this unexpected and extraordinary interview   as if it had existed in a dream  an hour had passed  and this stranger  had alighted among us as from the clouds  to draw the veil from those  obscurities which had bewildered us so long  to make visible a new train  of disastrous consequences flowing from the untimely death of thy  brother  and to blast that scheme of happiness on which thou and i had  so fondly meditated     but what wilt thou think of this new born claim  the story  hadst thou  observed the features and guise of the relater  would have won thy  implicit credit  his countenance exhibited deep traces of the  afflictions he had endured  and the fortitude which he had exercised  he  was sallow and emaciated  but his countenance was full of seriousness  and dignity  a sort of ruggedness of brow  the token of great mental  exertion and varied experience  argued a premature old age     what a mournful tale  is such the lot of those who wander from their  rustic homes in search of fortune  our countrymen are prone to  enterprise  and are scattered over every sea and every land in pursuit  of that wealth which will not screen them from disease and infirmity   which is missed much oftener than found  and which  when gained  by no  means compensates them for the hardships and vicissitudes endured in the  pursuit     but what if the truth of these pretensions be admitted  the money must  be restored to its right owner  i know that  whatever inconveniences may  follow the deed  thou wilt not hesitate to act justly  affluence and  dignity  however valuable  may be purchased too dear  honesty will not  take away its keenness from the winter blast  its ignominy and  unwholesomeness from servile labour  or strip of its charms the life of  elegance and leisure  but these  unaccompanied with self reproach  are  less deplorable than wealth and honour the possession of which is marred  by our own disapprobation     i know the bitterness of this sacrifice  i know the impatience with  which your poverty has formerly been borne  how much your early  education is at war with that degradation and obscurity to which your  youth has been condemned  how earnestly your wishes panted after a state  which might exempt you from dependence upon daily labour and on the  caprices of others  and might secure to you leisure to cultivate and  indulge your love of knowledge and your social and beneficent  affections     your motive for desiring a change of fortune has been greatly enforced  since we have become known to each other  thou hast honoured me with thy  affection  but that union  on which we rely for happiness  could not  take place while both of us were poor  my habits  indeed  have made  labour and rustic obscurity less painful than they would prove to my  friend  but my present condition is wholly inconsistent with marriage   as long as my exertions are insufficient to maintain us both  it would  be unjustifiable to burden you with new cares and duties  of this you  are more thoroughly convinced than i am  the love of independence and  ease  and impatience of drudgery  are woven into your constitution   perhaps they are carried to an erroneous extreme  and derogate from that  uncommon excellence by which your character is  in other respects   distinguished  but they cannot be removed     this obstacle was unexpectedly removed by the death of your brother   however justly to be deplored was this catastrophe  yet  like every  other event  some of its consequences were good  by giving you  possession of the means of independence and leisure  by enabling us to  complete a contract which poverty alone had thus long delayed  this  event has been  at the same time  the most disastrous and propitious  which could have happened     why thy brother should have concealed from us the possession of this  money   why  with such copious means of indulgence and leisure  he  should still pursue his irksome trade  and live in so penurious a  manner   has been a topic of endless and unsatisfactory conjecture  between us  it was not difficult to suppose that this money was held in  trust for another  but in that case it was unavoidable that some  document or memorandum  or at least some claimant  would appear  much  time has since elapsed  and you have thought yourself at length  justified in appropriating this money to your own use     our flattering prospects are now shut in  you must return to your  original poverty  and once more depend for precarious subsistence on  your needle  you cannot restore the whole  for unavoidable expenses and  the change of your mode of living have consumed some part of it  for so  much you must consider yourself as weymouth s debtor     repine not  my friend  at this unlooked for reverse  think upon the  merits and misfortunes of your brother s friend  think upon his aged  father  whom we shall enable him to rescue from poverty  think upon his  desolate wife  whose merits are  probably  at least equal to your own   and whose helplessness is likely to be greater  i am not insensible to  the evils which have returned upon us with augmented force  after  having  for a moment  taken their flight  i know the precariousness of  my condition and that of my sisters  that our subsistence hangs upon the  life of an old man  my uncle s death will transfer this property to his  son  who is a stranger and an enemy to us  and the first act of whose  authority will unquestionably be to turn us forth from these doors   marriage with thee was anticipated with joyous emotions  not merely on  my own account or on thine  but likewise for the sake of those beloved  girls to whom that event would enable me to furnish an asylum     but wedlock is now more distant than ever  mv heart bleeds to think of  the sufferings which my beloved mary is again fated to endure  but  regrets are only aggravations of calamity  they are pernicious  and it  is our duty to shake them off     i can entertain no doubts as to the equity of weymouth s claim  so many  coincidences could not have happened by chance  the non appearance of  any letters or papers connected with it is indeed a mysterious  circumstance  but why should waldegrave be studious of preserving these   they were useless paper  and might  without impropriety  be cast away or  made to serve any temporary purpose  perhaps  indeed  they still lurk in  some unsuspected corner  to wish that time may explain this mystery in a  different manner  and so as to permit our retention of this money  is   perhaps  the dictate of selfishness  the transfer to weymouth will not  be productive of less benefit to him and to his family  than we should  derive from the use of it     these considerations  however  will be weighed when we meet  meanwhile i  will return to my narrative           chapter xvi       here  my friend  thou must permit me to pause  the following incidents  are of a kind to which the most ardent invention has never conceived a  parallel  fortune  in her most wayward mood  could scarcely be suspected  of an influence like this  the scene was pregnant with astonishment and  horror  i cannot  even now  recall it without reviving the dismay and  confusion which i then experienced     possibly  the period will arrive when i shall look back without agony on  the perils i have undergone  that period is still distant  solitude and  sleep are now no more than the signals to summon up a tribe of ugly  phantoms  famine  and blindness  and death  and savage enemies  never  fail to be conjured up by the silence and darkness of the night  i  cannot dissipate them by any efforts of reason  sly cowardice requires  the perpetual consolation of light  my heart droops when i mark the  decline of the sun  and i never sleep but with a candle burning at my  pillow  if  by any chance  i should awake and find myself immersed in  darkness  i know not what act of desperation i might be suddenly  impelled to commit     i have delayed this narrative longer than my duty to my friend enjoined   now that i am able to hold a pen  i will hasten to terminate that  uncertainty with regard to my fate in which my silence has involved  thee  i will recall that series of unheard of and disastrous  vicissitudes which has constituted the latest portion of my life     i am not certain  however  that i shall relate them in an intelligible  manner  one image runs into another  sensations succeed in so rapid a  train  that i fear i shall be unable to distribute and express them with  sufficient perspicuity  as i look back  my heart is sore  and aches  within my bosom  i am conscious to a kind of complex sentiment of  distress and forlornness that cannot be perfectly portrayed by words   but i must do as well as i can  in the utmost vigour of my faculties  no  eloquence that i possess would do justice to the tale  now  in my  languishing and feeble state  i shall furnish thee with little more than  a glimpse of the truth  with these glimpses  transient and faint as they  are  thou must be satisfied     i have said that i slept  my memory assures me of this  it informs me of  the previous circumstances of my laying aside my clothes  of placing the  light upon a chair within reach of my pillow  of throwing myself upon  the bed  and of gazing on the rays of the moon reflected on the wall and  almost obscured by those of the candle  i remember my occasional  relapses into fits of incoherent fancies  the harbingers of sleep  i  remember  as it were  the instant when my thoughts ceased to flow and my  senses were arrested by the leaden wand of forgetfulness     my return to sensation and to consciousness took place in no such  tranquil scene  i emerged from oblivion by degrees so slow and so faint   that their succession cannot be marked  when enabled at length to attend  to the information which my senses afforded  i was conscious for a time  of nothing but existence  it was unaccompanied with lassitude or pain   but i felt disinclined to stretch my limbs or raise my eyelids  my  thoughts were wildering and mazy  and  though consciousness was present   it was disconnected with the locomotive or voluntary power     from this state a transition was speedily effected  i perceived that my  posture was supine  and that i lay upon my back  i attempted to open my  eyes  the weight that oppressed them was too great for a slight exertion  to remove  the exertion which i made cost me a pang more acute than any  which i ever experienced  my eyes  however  were opened  but the  darkness that environed me was as intense as before     i attempted to rise  but my limbs were cold  and my joints had almost  lost their flexibility  my efforts were repeated  and at length i  attained a sitting posture  i was now sensible of pain in my shoulders  and back  i was universally in that state to which the frame is reduced  by blows of a club  mercilessly and endlessly repeated  my temples  throbbed  and my face was covered with clammy and cold drops  but that  which threw me into deepest consternation was my inability to see  i  turned my head to different quarters  i stretched my eyelids  and  exerted every visual energy  but in vain  i was wrapped in the murkiest  and most impenetrable gloom     the first effort of reflection was to suggest the belief that i was  blind  that disease is known to assail us in a moment and without  previous warning  this  surely  was the misfortune that had now befallen  me  some ray  however fleeting and uncertain  could not fail to be  discerned  if the power of vision were not utterly extinguished  in what  circumstances could i possibly be placed  from which every particle of  light should  by other means  be excluded     this led my thoughts into a new train  i endeavoured to recall the past   but the past was too much in contradiction to the present  and my  intellect was too much shattered by external violence  to allow me  accurately to review it     since my sight availed nothing to the knowledge of my condition  i  betook myself to other instruments  the element which i breathed was  stagnant and cold  the spot where i lay was rugged and hard  i was  neither naked nor clothed  a shirt and trousers composed my dress  and  the shoes and stockings  which always accompanied these  were now  wanting  what could i infer from this scanty garb  this chilling  atmosphere  this stony bed     i had awakened as from sleep  what was my condition when i fell asleep   surely it was different from the present  then i inhabited a lightsome  chamber and was stretched upon a down bed  now i was supine upon a  rugged surface and immersed in palpable obscurity  then i was in perfect  health  now my frame was covered with bruises and every joint was racked  with pain  what dungeon or den had received me  and by whose command was  i transported hither     after various efforts i stood upon my feet  at first i tottered and  staggered  i stretched out my hands on all sides  but met only with  vacuity  i advanced forward  at the third step my foot moved something  which lay upon the ground  i stooped and took it up  and found  on  examination  that it was an indian tomahawk  this incident afforded me  no hint from which i might conjecture my state     proceeding irresolutely and slowly forward  my hands at length touched a  wall  this  like the flooring  was of stone  and was rugged and  impenetrable  i followed this wall  an advancing angle occurred at a  short distance  which was followed by similar angles  i continued to  explore this clue  till the suspicion occurred that i was merely going  round the walls of a vast and irregular apartment     the utter darkness disabled me from comparing directions and distances   this discovery  therefore  was not made on a sudden  and was still  entangled with some doubt  my blood recovered some warmth  and my  muscles some elasticity  but in proportion as my sensibility returned   my pains augmented  overpowered by my fears and my agonies  i desisted  from my fruitless search  and sat down  supporting my back against the  wall     my excruciating sensations for a time occupied my attention  these  in  combination with other causes  gradually produced a species of delirium   i existed  as it were  in a wakeful dream  with nothing to correct my  erroneous perceptions  the images of the past occurred in capricious  combinations and vivid hues  methought i was the victim of some tyrant  who had thrust me into a dungeon of his fortress  and left me no power  to determine whether he intended i should perish with famine  or linger  out a long life in hopeless imprisonment  whether the day was shut out  by insuperable walls  or the darkness that surrounded me was owing to  the night and to the smallness of those crannies through which daylight  was to be admitted  i conjectured in vain     sometimes i imagined myself buried alive  methought i had fallen into  seeming death  and my friends had consigned me to the tomb  from which a  resurrection was impossible  that  in such a case  my limbs would have  been confined to a coffin  and my coffin to a grave  and that i should  instantly have been suffocated  did not occur to destroy my supposition   neither did this supposition overwhelm me with terror or prompt my  efforts at deliverance  my state was full of tumult and confusion  and  my attention was incessantly divided between my painful sensations and  my feverish dreams     there is no standard by which time can be measured but the succession of  our thoughts and the changes that take place in the external world  from  the latter i was totally excluded  the former made the lapse of some  hours appear like the tediousness of weeks and months  at length  a new  sensation recalled my rambling meditations  and gave substance to my  fears  i now felt the cravings of hunger  and perceived that  unless my  deliverance were speedily effected  i must suffer a tedious and  lingering death     i once more tasked my understanding and my senses to discover the nature  of my present situation and the means of escape  i listened to catch  some sound  i heard an unequal and varying echo  sometimes near and  sometimes distant  sometimes dying away and sometimes swelling into  loudness  it was unlike any thing i had before heard  but it was evident  that it arose from wind sweeping through spacious halls and winding  passages  these tokens were incompatible with the result of the  examination i had made  if my hands were true  i was immured between  walls through which there was no avenue     i now exerted my voice  and cried as loud as my wasted strength would  admit  its echoes were sent back to me in broken and confused sounds and  from above  this effort was casual  but some part of that uncertainty in  which i was involved was instantly dispelled by it  in passing through  the cavern on the former day  i have mentioned the verge of the pit at  which i arrived  to acquaint me as far as was possible with the  dimensions of the place  i had hallooed with all my force  knowing that  sound is reflected according to the distance and relative positions of  the substances from which it is repelled     the effect produced by my voice on this occasion resembled  with  remarkable exactness  the effect which was then produced  was i  then   shut up in the same cavern  had i reached the brink of the same  precipice and been thrown headlong into that vacuity  whence else could  arise the bruises which i had received  but from my fall  yet all  remembrance of my journey hither was lost  i had determined to explore  this cave on the ensuing day  but my memory informed me not that this  intention had been carried into effect  still  it was only possible to  conclude that i had come hither on my intended expedition  and had been  thrown by another  or had  by some ill chance  fallen  into the pit     this opinion was conformable to what i had already observed  the  pavement and walls were rugged like those of the footing and sides of  the cave through which i had formerly passed     but if this were true  what was the abhorred catastrophe to which i was  now reserved  the sides of this pit were inaccessible  human footsteps  would never wander into these recesses  my friends were unapprized of my  forlorn state  here i should continue till wasted by famine  in this  grave should i linger out a few days in unspeakable agonies  and then  perish forever     the inroads of hunger were already experienced  and this knowledge of  the desperateness of my calamity urged me to frenzy  i had none but  capricious and unseen fate to condemn  the author of my distress  and  the means he had taken to decoy me hither  were incomprehensible  surely  my senses were fettered or depraved by some spell  i was still asleep   and this was merely a tormenting vision  or madness had seized me  and  the darkness that environed and the hunger that afflicted me existed  only in my own distempered imagination     the consolation of these doubts could not last long  every hour added to  the proof that my perceptions were real  my hunger speedily became  ferocious  i tore the linen of my shirt between my teeth and swallowed  the fragments  i felt a strong propensity to bite the flesh from my arm   my heart overflowed with cruelty  and i pondered on the delight i should  experience in rending some living animal to pieces  and drinking its  blood and grinding its quivering fibres between my teeth     this agony had already passed beyond the limits of endurance  i saw that  time  instead of bringing respite or relief  would only aggravate my  wants  and that my only remaining hope was to die before i should be  assaulted by the last extremes of famine  i now recollected that a  tomahawk was at hand  and rejoiced in the possession of an instrument by  which i could so effectually terminate my sufferings     i took it in my hand  moved its edge over my fingers  and reflected on  the force that was required to make it reach my heart  i investigated  the spot where it should enter  and strove to fortify myself with  resolution to repeat the stroke a second or third time  if the first  should prove insufficient  i was sensible that i might fail to inflict a  mortal wound  but delighted to consider that the blood which would be  made to flow would finally release me  and that meanwhile my pains would  be alleviated by swallowing this blood     you will not wonder that i felt some reluctance to employ so fatal  though indispensable a remedy  i once more ruminated on the possibility  of rescuing myself by other means  i now reflected that the upper  termination of the wall could not be at an immeasurable distance from  the pavement  i had fallen from a height  but if that height had been  considerable  instead of being merely bruised  should i not have been  dashed into pieces     gleams of hope burst anew upon my soul  was it not possible  i asked  to  reach the top of this pit  the sides were rugged and uneven  would not  their projectures and abruptnesses serve me as steps by which i might  ascend in safety  this expedient was to be tried without delay  shortly  my strength would fail  and my doom would be irrevocably sealed     i will not enumerate my laborious efforts  my alternations of  despondency and confidence  the eager and unwearied scrutiny with which  i examined the surface  the attempts which i made  and the failures  which  for a time  succeeded each other  a hundred times  when i had  ascended some feet from the bottom  i was compelled to relinquish my  undertaking by the  untenable  smoothness of the spaces which  remained to be gone over  a hundred times i threw myself  exhausted by  fatigue and my pains  on the ground  the consciousness was gradually  restored that  till i had attempted every part of the wall  it was  absurd to despair  and i again drew my tottering limbs and aching joints  to that part of the wall which had not been surveyed     at length  as i stretched my hand upward  i found somewhat that seemed  like a recession in the wall  it was possible that this was the top of  the cavity  and this might be the avenue to liberty  my heart leaped  with joy  and i proceeded to climb the wall  no undertaking could be  conceived more arduous than this  the space between this verge and the  floor was nearly smooth  the verge was higher from the bottom than my  head  the only means of ascending that were offered me were by my hands   with which i could draw myself upward so as  at length  to maintain my  hold with my feet     my efforts were indefatigable  and at length i placed myself on the  verge  when this was accomplished  my strength was nearly gone  had i  not found space enough beyond this brink to stretch myself at length  i  should unavoidably have fallen backward into the pit  and all my pains  had served no other end than to deepen my despair and hasten my  destruction     what impediments and perils remained to be encountered i could not  judge  i was now inclined to forebode the worst  the interval of repose  which was necessary to be taken  in order to recruit my strength  would  accelerate the ravages of famine  and leave me without the power to  proceed     in this state  i once more consoled myself that an instrument of death  was at hand  i had drawn up with me the tomahawk  being sensible that   should this impediment be overcome  others might remain that would prove  insuperable  before i employed it  however  i cast my eyes wildly and  languidly around  the darkness was no less intense than in the pit  below  and yet two objects were distinctly seen     they resembled a fixed and obscure flame  they were motionless  though  lustrous themselves  they created no illumination around them  this  circumstance  added to others  which reminded me of similar objects  noted on former occasions  immediately explained the nature of what i  beheld  these were the eyes of a panther     thus had i struggled to obtain a post where a savage was lurking and  waited only till my efforts should place me within reach of his fangs   the first impulse was to arm myself against this enemy  the  desperateness of my condition was  for a moment  forgotten  the weapon  which was so lately lifted against my own bosom was now raised to defend  my life against the assault of another     there was no time for deliberation and delay  in a moment he might  spring from his station and tear me to pieces  my utmost speed might not  enable me to reach him where he sat  but merely to encounter his  assault  i did not reflect how far my strength was adequate to save me   all the force that remained was mustered up and exerted in a throw     no one knows the powers that are latent in his constitution  called  forth by imminent dangers  our efforts frequently exceed our most  sanguine belief  though tottering on the verge of dissolution  and  apparently unable to crawl from this spot  a force was exerted in this  throw  probably greater than i had ever before exerted  it was  resistless and unerring  i aimed at the middle space between those  glowing orbs  it penetrated the skull  and the animal fell  struggling  and shrieking  on the ground     my ears quickly informed me when his pangs were at an end  his cries and  his convulsions lasted for a moment and then ceased  the effect of his  voice  in these subterranean abodes  was unspeakably rueful     the abruptness of this incident  and the preternatural exertion of my  strength  left me in a state of languor and sinking  from which slowly  and with difficulty i recovered  the first suggestion that occurred was  to feed upon the carcass of this animal  my hunger had arrived at that  pitch where all fastidiousness and scruples are at an end  i crept to  the spot  i will not shock you by relating the extremes to which dire  necessity had driven me  i review this scene with loathing and horror   now that it is past i look back upon it as on some hideous dream  the  whole appears to be some freak of insanity  no alternative was offered   and hunger was capable of being appeased even by a banquet so  detestable     if this appetite has sometimes subdued the sentiments of nature  and  compelled the mother to feed upon the flesh of her offspring  it will  not excite amazement that i did not turn from the yet warm blood and  reeking fibres of a brute     one evil was now removed  only to give place to another  the first  sensations of fullness had scarcely been felt when my stomach was seized  by pangs  whose acuteness exceeded all that i ever before experienced  i  bitterly lamented my inordinate avidity  the excruciations of famine  were better than the agonies which this abhorred meal had produced     death was now impending with no less proximity and certainty  though in  a different form  death was a sweet relief for my present miseries  and  i vehemently longed for its arrival  i stretched myself on the ground  i  threw myself into every posture that promised some alleviation of this  evil  i rolled along the pavement of the cavern  wholly inattentive to  the dangers that environed me  that i did not fall into the pit whence i  had just emerged must be ascribed to some miraculous chance     how long my miseries endured  it is not possible to tell  i cannot even  form a plausible conjecture  judging by the lingering train of my  sensations  i should conjecture that some days elapsed in this  deplorable condition  but nature could riot have so long sustained a  conflict like this     gradually my pains subsided  and i fell into a deep sleep  i was visited  by dreams of a thousand hues  they led me to flowing streams and  plenteous banquets  which  though placed within my view  some power  forbade me to approach  from this sleep i recovered to the fruition of  solitude and darkness  but my frame was in a state less feeble than  before that which i had eaten had produced temporary distress  but on  the whole had been of use  if this food had not been provided for me i  should scarcely have avoided death  i had reason  therefore  to  congratulate myself on the danger that had lately occurred     i had acted without foresight  and yet no wisdom could have prescribed  more salutary measures  the panther was slain  not from a view to the  relief of my hunger  but from the self preserving and involuntary  impulse  had i foreknown the pangs to which my ravenous and bloody meal  would give birth  i should have carefully abstained  and yet these pangs  were a useful effort of nature to subdue and convert to nourishment the  matter i had swallowed     i was now assailed by the torments of thirst  my invention and my  courage were anew bent to obviate this pressing evil  i reflected that  there was some recess from this cavern  even from the spot where i now  stood  before  i was doubtful whether in this direction from this pit  any avenue could be found  but  since the panther had come hither  there  was reason to suppose the existence of some such avenue     i now likewise attended to a sound  which  from its invariable tenor   denoted somewhat different from the whistling of a gale  it seemed like  the murmur of a running stream  i now prepared to go forward and  endeavour to move along in that direction in which this sound apparently  came     on either side  and above my head  there was nothing but vacuity  my  steps were to be guided by the pavement  which  though unequal and  rugged  appeared  on the whole  to ascend  my safety required that i  should employ both hands and feet in exploring my way     i went on thus for a considerable period  the murmur  instead of  becoming more distinct  gradually died away  my progress was arrested by  fatigue  and i began once more to despond  my exertions produced a  perspiration  which  while it augmented my thirst  happily supplied me  with imperfect means of appeasing it     this expedient would  perhaps  have been accidentally suggested  but my  ingenuity was assisted by remembering the history of certain english  prisoners in bengal  whom their merciless enemy imprisoned in a small  room  and some of whom preserved themselves alive merely by swallowing  the moisture that flowed from their bodies  this experiment i now  performed with no less success     this was slender arid transitory consolation  i knew that  wandering at  random  i might never reach the outlet of this cavern  or might be  disabled  by hunger and fatigue  from going farther than the outlet  the  cravings which had lately been satiated would speedily return  and my  negligence had cut me off from the resource which had recently been  furnished  i thought not till now that a second meal might be  indispensable     to return upon my footsteps to the spot where the dead animal lay was a  heartless project  i might thus be placing myself at a hopeless distance  from liberty  besides  my track could not be retraced  i had frequently  deviated from a straight direction for the sake of avoiding impediments   all of which i was sensible was  that i was travelling up an irregular  acclivity  i hoped some time to reach the summit  but had no reason for  adhering to one line of ascent in preference to another     to remain where i was was manifestly absurd  whether i mounted or  descended  a change of place was most likely to benefit me  i resolved  to vary my direction  and  instead of ascending  keep along the side of  what i accounted a hill  i had gone some hundred feet when the murmur   before described  once more saluted my ear     this sound  being imagined to proceed from a running stream  could not  but light up joy in the heart of one nearly perishing with thirst  i  proceeded with new courage  the sound approached no nearer  nor became  more distinct  but  as long as it died not away  i was satisfied to  listen and to hope     i was eagerly observant if any the least glimmering of light should  visit this recess  at length  on the right hand  a gleam  infinitely  faint  caught my attention  it was wavering and unequal  i directed my  steps towards it  it became more vivid and permanent  it was of that  kind  however  which proceeded from a fire  kindled with dry sticks  and  not from the sun  i now heard the crackling of flames     this sound made me pause  or  at least  to proceed with circumspection   at length the scene opened  and i found myself at the entrance of a  cave  i quickly reached a station  when i saw a fire burning  at first  no other object was noted  but it was easy to infer that the fire was  kindled by men  and that they who kindled it could be at no great  distance           chapter xvii       thus was i delivered from my prison  and restored to the enjoyment of  the air and the light  perhaps the chance was almost miraculous that led  me to this opening  in any other direction  i might have involved myself  in an inextricable maze and rendered my destruction sure  but what now  remained to place me in absolute security  beyond the fire i could see  nothing  but  since the smoke rolled rapidly away  it was plain that on  the opposite side the cavern was open to the air     i went forward  but my eyes were fixed upon the fire  presently  in  consequence of changing my station  i perceived several feet  and the  skirts of blankets  i was somewhat startled at these appearances  the  legs were naked  and scored into uncouth figures  the  moccasins   which lay beside them  and which were adorned in a grotesque manner  in  addition to other incidents  immediately suggested the suspicion that  they were indians  no spectacle was more adapted than this to excite  wonder and alarm  had some mysterious power snatched me from the earth   and cast me  in a moment  into the heart of the wilderness  was i still  in the vicinity of my parental habitation  or was i thousands of miles  distant     were these the permanent inhabitants of this region  or were they  wanderers and robbers  while in the heart of the mountain  i had  entertained a vague belief that i was still within the precincts of  norwalk  this opinion was shaken for a moment by the objects which i now  beheld  but it insensibly returned  yet how was this opinion to be  reconciled to appearances so strange and uncouth  and what measure did a  due regard to my safety enjoin me to take     i now gained a view of four brawny and terrific figures  stretched upon  the ground  they lay parallel to each other  on their left sides  in  consequence of which their faces were turned from me  between each was  an interval where lay a musket  their right hands seemed placed upon the  stocks of their guns  as if to seize them on the first moment of alarm     the aperture through which these objects were seen was at the back of  the cave  and some feet from the ground  it was merely large enough to  suffer a human body to pass  it was involved in profound darkness  and  there was no danger of being suspected or discovered as long as i  maintained silence and kept out of view     it was easily imagined that these guests would make but a short sojourn  in this spot  there was reason to suppose that it was now night  and  that  after a short repose  they would start up and resume their  journey  it was my first design to remain shrouded in this covert till  their departure  and i prepared to endure imprisonment and thirst  somewhat longer     meanwhile my thoughts were busy in accounting for this spectacle  i need  not tell thee that norwalk is the termination of a sterile and narrow  tract which begins in the indian country  it forms a sort of rugged and  rocky vein  and continues upwards of fifty miles  it is crossed in a few  places by narrow and intricate paths  by which a communication is  maintained between the farms and settlements on the opposite sides of  the ridge     during former indian wars  this rude surface was sometimes traversed by  the red men  and they made  by means of it  frequent and destructive  inroads into the heart of the english settlements  during the last war   notwithstanding the progress of population  and the multiplied perils of  such an expedition  a band of them had once penetrated into norwalk  and  lingered long enough to pillage and murder some of the neighbouring  inhabitants     i have reason to remember that event  my father s house was placed on  the verge of this solitude  eight of these assassins assailed it at the  dead of night  my parents and an infant child were murdered in their  beds  the house was pillaged  and then burnt to the ground  happily   myself and my two sisters were abroad upon a visit  the preceding day  had been fixed for our return to our father s house  but a storm  occurred  which made it dangerous to cross the river  and  by obliging  us to defer our journey  rescued us from captivity or death     most men are haunted by some species of terror or antipathy  which they  are  for the most part  able to trace to some incident which befell them  in their early years  you will not be surprised that the fate of my  parents  and the sight of the body of one of this savage band  who  in  the pursuit that was made after them  was overtaken and killed  should  produce lasting and terrific images in my fancy  i never looked upon or  called up the image of a savage without shuddering     i knew that  at this time  some hostilities had been committed on the  frontier  that a long course of injuries and encroachments had lately  exasperated the indian tribes  that an implacable and exterminating war  was generally expected  we imagined ourselves at an inaccessible  distance from the danger  but i could not but remember that this  persuasion was formerly as strong as at present  and that an expedition  which had once succeeded might possibly be attempted again  here was  every token of enmity and bloodshed  each prostrate figure was furnished  with a rifled musket  and a leathern bag tied round his waist  which  was  probably  stored with powder and ball     from these reflections  the sense of my own danger was revived and  enforced  but i likewise ruminated on the evils which might impend over  others  i should  no doubt  be safe by remaining in this nook  but might  not some means be pursued to warn others of their danger  should they  leave this spot without notice of their approach being given to the  fearless and pacific tenants of the neighbouring district  they might  commit  in a few hours  the most horrid and irreparable devastation     the alarm could only be diffused in one way  could i not escape   unperceived  and without alarming the sleepers  from this cavern  the  slumber of an indian is broken by the slightest noise  but  if all noise  be precluded  it is commonly profound  it was possible  i conceived  to  leave my present post  to descend into the cave  and issue forth without  the smallest signal  their supine posture assured me that they were  asleep  sleep usually comes at their bidding  and if  perchance  they  should be wakeful at an unseasonable moment  they always sit upon their  haunches  and  leaning their elbows on their knees  consume the tedious  hours in smoking  my peril would be great  accidents which i could not  foresee  and over which i had no command  might occur to awaken some one  at the moment i was passing the fire  should i pass in safety  i might  issue forth into a wilderness  of which i had no knowledge  where i  might wander till i perished with famine  or where my footsteps might be  noted and pursued and overtaken by these implacable foes  these perils  were enormous and imminent  but i likewise considered that i might be at  no great distance from the habitations of men  and that my escape might  rescue them from the most dreadful calamities  i determined to make this  dangerous experiment without delay     i came nearer to the aperture  and had  consequently  a larger view of  this recess  to my unspeakable dismay  i now caught a glimpse of one  seated at the fire  his back was turned towards me  so that i could  distinctly survey his gigantic form and fantastic ornaments     my project was frustrated  this one was probably commissioned to watch  and to awaken his companions when a due portion of sleep had been taken   that he would not be unfaithful or remiss in the performance of the part  assigned to him was easily predicted  to pass him without exciting his  notice  and the entrance could not otherwise be reached  was impossible   once more i shrunk back  and revolved with hopelessness and anguish the  necessity to which i was reduced     this interval of dreary foreboding did not last long  some motion in him  that was seated by the fire attracted my notice  i looked  and beheld  him rise from his place and go forth from the cavern  this unexpected  incident led my thoughts into a new channel  could not some advantage be  taken of his absence  could not this opportunity be seized for making my  escape  he had left his gun and hatchet on the ground  it was likely   therefore  that he had not gone far  and would speedily return  might  not these weapons be seized  and some provision be thus made against the  danger of meeting him without  or of being pursued     before a resolution could be formed  a new sound saluted my ear  it was  a deep groan  succeeded by sobs that seemed struggling for utterance but  were vehemently counteracted by the sufferer  this low and bitter  lamentation apparently proceeded from some one within the cave  it could  not be from one of this swarthy band  it must  then  proceed from a  captive  whom they had reserved for torment or servitude  and who had  seized the opportunity afforded by the absence of him that watched to  give vent to his despair     i again thrust my head forward  and beheld  lying on the ground  apart  from the rest  and bound hand and foot  a young girl  her dress was the  coarse russet garb of the country  and bespoke her to be some farmer s  daughter  her features denoted the last degree of fear and anguish  and  she moved her limbs in such a manner as showed that the ligatures by  which she was confined produced  by their tightness  the utmost degree  of pain     my wishes were now bent not only to preserve myself and to frustrate the  future attempts of these savages  but likewise to relieve this miserable  victim  this could only be done by escaping from the cavern and  returning with seasonable aid  the sobs of the girl were likely to rouse  the sleepers  my appearance before her would prompt her to testify her  surprise by some exclamation or shriek  what could hence be predicted  but that the band would start on their feet and level their unerring  pieces at my head     i know not why i was insensible to these dangers  my thirst was rendered  by these delays intolerable  it took from me  in some degree  the power  of deliberation  the murmurs which had drawn me hither continued still  to be heard  some torrent or cascade could not be far distant from the  entrance of the cavern  and it seemed as if one draught of clear water  was a luxury cheaply purchased by death itself  this  in addition to  considerations more disinterested  and which i have already mentioned   impelled me forward     the girl s cheek rested on the hard rock  and her eyes were dim with  tears  as they were turned towards me  however  i hoped that my  movements would be noticed by her gradually and without abruptness  this  expectation was fulfilled  i had not advanced many steps before she  discovered me  this moment was critical beyond all others in the course  of my existence  my life was suspended  as it were  by a spider s  thread  all rested on the effect which this discovery should make upon  this feeble victim     i was watchful of the first movement of her eye which should indicate a  consciousness of my presence  i laboured  by gestures and looks  to  deter her from betraying her emotion  my attention was  at the same  time  fixed upon the sleepers  and an anxious glance was cast towards  the quarter whence the watchful savage might appear     i stooped and seized the musket and hatchet  the space beyond the fire  was  as i expected  open to the air  i issued forth with trembling  steps  the sensations inspired by the dangers which environed me  added  to my recent horrors  and the influence of the moon  which had now  gained the zenith  and whose lustre dazzled my long benighted senses   cannot be adequately described     for a minute  i was unable to distinguish objects  this confusion was  speedily corrected  and i found myself on the verge of a steep  craggy  eminences arose on all sides  on the left hand was a space that offered  some footing  and hither i turned  a torrent was below me  and this path  appeared to lead to it  it quickly appeared in sight  and all foreign  cares were  for a time  suspended     this water fell from the upper regions of the hill  upon a flat  projecture which was continued on either side  and on part of which i  was now standing  the path was bounded on the left by an inaccessible  wall  and on the right terminated  at the distance of two or three feet  from the wall  in a precipice  the water was eight or ten paces distant   and no impediment seemed likely to rise between us  i rushed forward  with speed     my progress was quickly checked  close to the falling water  seated on  the edge  his back supported by the rock  and his legs hanging over the  precipice  i now beheld the savage who left the cave before me  the  noise of the cascade and the improbability of interruption  at least  from this quarter  had made him inattentive to my motions     i paused  along this verge lay the only road by which i could reach the  water  and by which i could escape  the passage was completely occupied  by this antagonist  to advance towards him  or to remain where i was   would produce the same effect  i should  in either case  be detected  he  was unarmed  but his outcries would instantly summon his companions to  his aid  i could not hope to overpower him  and pass him in defiance of  his opposition  but  if this were effected  pursuit would be instantly  commenced  i was unacquainted with the way  the way was unquestionably  difficult  my strength was nearly annihilated  i should be overtaken in  a moment  or their deficiency in speed would be supplied by the accuracy  of their aim  their bullets  at least  would reach me     there was one method of removing this impediment  the piece which i held  in my hand was cocked  there could be no doubt that it was loaded  a  precaution of this kind would never be omitted by a warrior of this hue   at a greater distance than this  i should not fear to reach the mark   should i not discharge it  and  at the same moment  rush forward to  secure the road which my adversary s death would open to me     perhaps you will conceive a purpose like this to have argued a  sanguinary and murderous disposition  let it be remembered  however   that i entertained no doubts about the hostile designs of these men   this was sufficiently indicated by their arms  their guise  and the  captive who attended them  let the fate of my parents be  likewise   remembered  i was not certain but that these very men were the assassins  of my family  and were those who had reduced me and my sisters to the  condition of orphans and dependants  no words can describe the torments  of my thirst  relief to these torments  and safety to my life  were  within view  how could i hesitate     yet i did hesitate  my aversion to bloodshed was not to be subdued but  by the direst necessity  i knew  indeed  that the discharge of a musket  would only alarm the enemies who remained behind  but i had another and  a better weapon in my grasp  i could rive the head of my adversary  and  cast him headlong  without any noise which should be heard  into the  cavern     still i was willing to withdraw  to re enter the cave  and take shelter  in the darksome recesses from which i had emerged  here i might remain   unsuspected  till these detested guests should depart  the hazards  attending my re entrance were to be boldly encountered  and the torments  of unsatisfied thirst were to be patiently endured  rather than imbrue  my hands in the blood of my fellowmen  but this expedient would be  ineffectual if my retreat should be observed by this savage  of that i  was bound to be incontestably assured  i retreated  therefore  but kept  my eye fixed at the same time upon the enemy     some ill fate decreed that i should not retreat unobserved  scarcely had  i withdrawn three paces when he started from his seat  and  turning  towards me  walked with a quick pace  the shadow of the rock  and the  improbability of meeting an enemy here  concealed me for a moment from  his observation  i stood still  the slightest motion would have  attracted his notice  at present  the narrow space engaged all his  vigilance  cautious footsteps  and attention to the path  were  indispensable to his safety  the respite was momentary  and i employed  it in my own defence     how otherwise could i act  the danger that impended aimed at nothing  less than my life  to take the life of another was the only method of  averting it  the means were in my hand  and they were used  in an  extremity like this  my muscles would have acted almost in defiance of  my will     the stroke was quick as lightning  and the wound mortal and deep  he had  not time to descry the author of his fate  but  sinking on the path   expired without a groan  the hatchet buried itself in his breast  and  rolled with him to the bottom of the precipice     never before had i taken the life of a human creature  on this head i  had  indeed  entertained somewhat of religious scruples  these scruples  did not forbid me to defend myself  but they made me cautious and  reluctant to decide  though they could not withhold my hand when urged  by a necessity like this  they were sufficient to make me look back upon  the deed with remorse and dismay     i did not escape all compunction in the present instance  but the tumult  of my feelings was quickly allayed  to quench my thirst was a  consideration by which all others were supplanted  i approached the  torrent  and not only drank copiously  but laved my head  neck  and  arms  in this delicious element           chapter xviii       never was any delight worthy of comparison with the raptures which i  then experienced  life  that was rapidly ebbing  appeared to return upon  me with redoubled violence  my languors  my excruciating heat  vanished  in a moment  and i felt prepared to undergo the labours of hercules   having fully supplied the demands of nature in this respect  i returned  to reflection on the circumstances of my situation  the path winding  round the hill was now free from all impediments  what remained but to  precipitate my flight  i might speedily place myself beyond all danger   i might gain some hospitable shelter  where my fatigues might be  repaired by repose  and my wounds be cured  i might likewise impart to  my protectors seasonable information of the enemies who meditated their  destruction     i thought upon the condition of the hapless girl whom i had left in the  power of the savages  was it impossible to rescue her  might i not  relieve her from her bonds  and make her the companion of my flight  the  exploit was perilous  but not impracticable  there was something  dastardly and ignominious in withdrawing from the danger  and leaving a  helpless being exposed to it  a single minute might suffice to snatch  her from death or captivity  the parents might deserve that i should  hazard or even sacrifice my life in the cause of their child     after some fluctuation  i determined to return to the cavern and attempt  the rescue of the girl  the success of this project depended on the  continuance of their sleep  it was proper to approach with wariness  and  to heed the smallest token which might bespeak their condition  i crept  along the path  bending my ear forward to catch any sound that might  arise  i heard nothing but the half stifled sobs of the girl     i entered with the slowest and most anxious circumspection  every thing  was found in its pristine state  the girl noticed my entrance with a  mixture of terror and joy  my gestures and looks enjoined upon her  silence  i stooped down  and  taking another hatchet  cut asunder the  deer skin thongs by which her wrists and ankles were tied  i then made  signs for her to rise and follow me  she willingly complied with my  directions  but her benumbed joints and lacerated sinews refused to  support her  there was no time to be lost  i therefore lifted her in my  arms  and  feeble and tottering as i was  proceeded with this burden  along the perilous steep and over a most rugged path     i hoped that some exertion would enable her to retrieve the use of her  limbs  i set her  therefore  on her feet  exhorting her to walk as well  as she was able  and promising her my occasional assistance  the poor  girl was not deficient in zeal  and presently moved along with light and  quick steps  we speedily reached the bottom of the hill     no fancy can conceive a scene more wild and desolate than that which now  presented itself  the soil was nearly covered with sharp fragments of  stone  between these  sprung brambles and creeping vines  whose twigs   crossing and intertwining with each other  added to the roughness below   made the passage infinitely toilsome  scattered over this space were  single cedars with their ragged spines and wreaths of moss  and copses  of dwarf oaks  which were only new emblems of sterility     i was wholly unacquainted with the scene before me  no marks of  habitation or culture  no traces of the footsteps of men  were  discernible  i scarcely knew in what region of the globe i was placed  i  had come hither by means so inexplicable as to leave it equally in doubt  whether i was separated from my paternal abode by a river or an ocean     i made inquiries of my companion  but she was unable to talk coherently   she answered my questions with weeping  and sobs  and entreaties to fly  from the scene of her distress  i collected from her  at length  that  her father s house had been attacked on the preceding evening  and all  the family but herself destroyed  since this disaster she had walked  very fast and a great way  but knew not how far or in what direction     in a wilderness like this  my only hope was to light upon obscure paths   made by cattle  meanwhile i endeavoured to adhere to one line  and to  burst through the vexatious obstacles which encumbered our way  the  ground was concealed by the bushes  and we were perplexed and fatigued  by a continual succession of hollows and prominences  at one moment we  were nearly thrown headlong into a pit  at another we struck our feet  against the angles of stones  the branches of the oak rebounded in our  faces or entangled our legs  and the unseen thorns inflicted on us a  thousand wounds     i was obliged  in these arduous circumstances  to support not only  myself  but my companion  her strength was overpowered by her evening  journey  and the terror of being overtaken incessantly harassed her     sometimes we lighted upon tracks which afforded us an easier footing and  inspired us with courage to proceed  these  for a time  terminated at a  brook or in a bog  and we were once more compelled to go forward at  random  one of these tracks insensibly became more beaten  and  at  length  exhibited the traces of wheels  to this i adhered  confident  that it would finally conduct us to a dwelling     on either side  the undergrowth of shrubs and brambles continued as  before  sometimes small spaces were observed  which had lately been  cleared by fire  at length a vacant space  of larger dimensions than had  hitherto occurred  presented itself to my view  it was a field of some  acres  that had  apparently  been upturned by the hoe  at the corner of  this field was a small house     my heart leaped with joy at this sight  i hastened towards it  in the  hope that my uncertainties  and toils  and dangers  were now drawing to  a close  this dwelling was suited to the poverty and desolation which  surrounded it  it consisted of a few unhewn logs laid upon each other   to the height of eight or ten feet  including a quadrangular space of  similar dimensions  and covered by a thatch  there was no window  light  being sufficiently admitted into the crevices between the logs  these  had formerly been loosely plastered with clay  but air and rain had  crumbled and washed the greater part of this rude cement away  somewhat  like a chimney  built of half burnt bricks  was perceived at one corner   the door was fastened by a leathern thong  tied to a peg     all within was silence and darkness  i knocked at the door and called   but no one moved or answered  the tenant  whoever he was  was absent   his leave could not be obtained  and i  therefore  entered without it   the autumn had made some progress  and the air was frosty and sharp  my  mind and muscles had been of late so strenuously occupied  that the cold  had not been felt  the cessation of exercise  however  quickly restored  my sensibility in this respect  but the unhappy girl complained of being  half frozen     fire  therefore  was the first object of my search  happily  some embers  were found upon the hearth  together with potato stalks and dry chips   of these  with much difficulty  i kindled a fire  by which some warmth  was imparted to our shivering limbs  the light enabled me  as i sat upon  the ground  to survey the interior of this mansion   three saplings   stripped of their branches and bound together at their ends by twigs   formed a kind of bedstead  which was raised from the ground by four  stones  ropes stretched across these  and covered by a blanket   constituted the bed  a board  of which one end rested on the bedstead  and the other was thrust between the logs that composed the wall   sustained the stale fragments of a rye loaf  and a cedar bucket kept  entire by withes instead of hoops  in the bucket was a little water   full of droppings from the roof  drowned insects  and sand  a basket or  two neatly made  and a hoe  with a stake thrust into it by way of  handle  made up all the furniture that was visible     next to cold  hunger was the most urgent necessity by which we were now  pressed  this was no time to give ear to scruples  we  therefore   unceremoniously divided the bread and water between us  i had now  leisure to bestow some regards upon the future     these remnants of fire and food convinced me that this dwelling was  usually inhabited  and that it had lately been deserted  some engagement  had probably carried the tenant abroad  his absence might be terminated  in a few minutes  or might endure through the night  on his return  i  questioned not my power to appease any indignation he might feel at the  liberties which i had taken  i was willing to suppose him one who would  readily afford us all the information and succour that we needed     if he should not return till sunrise  i meant to resume my journey  by  the comfortable meal we had made  and the repose of a few hours  we  should be considerably invigorated and refreshed  and the road would  lead us to some more hospitable tenement     my thoughts were too tumultuous  and my situation too precarious  to  allow me to sleep  the girl  on the contrary  soon sank into a sweet  oblivion of all her cares  she laid herself  by my advice  upon the bed   and left me to ruminate without interruption     i was not wholly free from the apprehension of danger  what influence  this boisterous and solitary life might have upon the temper of the  being who inhabited this hut  i could not predict  how soon the indians  might awake  and what path they would pursue  i was equally unable to  guess  it was by no means impossible that they might tread upon my  footsteps  and knock  in a few minutes  at the door of this cottage  it  behooved me to make all the preparations in my power against untoward  incidents     i had not parted with the gun which i had first seized in the cavern   nor with the hatchet which i had afterwards used to cut the bands of the  girl  these were at once my trophies and my means of defence  which it  had been rash and absurd to have relinquished  my present reliance was  placed upon these     i now  for the first time  examined the prize that i had made  other  considerations had prevented me  till now  from examining the structure  of the piece  but i could not but observe that it had two barrels  and  was lighter and smaller than an ordinary musket  the light of the fire  now enabled me to inspect it with more accuracy     scarcely had i fixed my eyes upon the stock  when i perceived marks that  were familiar to my apprehension  shape  ornaments  and ciphers  were  evidently the same with those of a piece which i had frequently handled   the marks were of a kind which could not be mistaken  this piece was  mine  and  when i left my uncle s house  it was deposited  as i  believed  in the closet of my chamber     thou wilt easily conceive the inference which this circumstance  suggested  my hairs rose and my teeth chattered with horror  my whole  frame was petrified  and i paced to and fro  hurried from the chimney to  the door  and from the door to the chimney  with the misguided fury of a  maniac     i needed no proof of my calamity more incontestable than this  my uncle  and my sisters had been murdered  the dwelling had been pillaged  and  this had been a part of the plunder  defenceless and asleep  they were  assailed by these inexorable enemies  and i  who ought to have been  their protector and champion  was removed to an immeasurable distance   and was disabled  by some accursed chance  from affording them the  succour which they needed     for a time  i doubted whether i had not witnessed and shared this  catastrophe  i had no memory of the circumstances that preceded my  awaking in the pit  had not the cause of my being cast into this abyss  some connection with the ruin of my family  had i not been dragged  hither by these savages and reduced  by their malice  to that breathless  and insensible condition  was i born to a malignant destiny never tired  of persecuting  thus had my parents and their infant offspring perished   and thus completed was the fate of all those to whom my affections  cleaved  and whom the first disaster had spared     hitherto the death of the savage  whom i had dispatched with my hatchet   had not been remembered without some remorse  now my emotions were  totally changed  i was somewhat comforted in thinking that thus much of  necessary vengeance had been executed  new and more vehement regrets  were excited by reflecting on the forbearance i had practised when so  much was in my power  all the miscreants had been at my mercy  and a  bloody retribution might  with safety and ease  have been inflicted on  their prostrate bodies     it was now too late  what of consolation or of hope remained to me  to  return to my ancient dwelling  now polluted with blood  or  perhaps   nothing but a smoking ruin  was abhorred  life  connected with the  remembrance of my misfortunes  was detestable  i was no longer anxious  for flight  no change of the scene but that which terminated all  consciousness could i endure to think of     amidst these gloomy meditations the idea was suddenly suggested of  returning  with the utmost expedition  to the cavern  it was possible  that the assassins were still asleep  he who was appointed to watch  and  to make  in due season  the signal for resuming their march  was forever  silent  without this signal it was not unlikely that they would sleep  till dawn of day  but  if they should be roused  they might be overtaken  or met  and  by choosing a proper station  two victims might at least  fall  the ultimate event to myself would surely be fatal  but my own  death was an object of desire rather than of dread  to die thus  speedily  and after some atonement was made for those who had already  been slain  was sweet     the way to the mountain was difficult and tedious  but the ridge was  distinctly seen from the door of the cottage  and i trusted that  auspicious chance would lead me to that part of it where my prey was to  be found  i snatched up the gun and tomahawk in a transport of  eagerness  on examining the former  i found that both barrels were  deeply loaded     this piece was of extraordinary workmanship  it was the legacy of an  english officer  who died in bengal  to sarsefield  it was constructed  for the purposes not of sport but of war  the artist had made it a  congeries of tubes and springs  by which every purpose of protection and  offence was effectually served  a dagger s blade was attached to it   capable of being fixed at the end  and of answering the destructive  purpose of a bayonet  on his departure from solesbury  my friend left  it  as a pledge of his affection  in my possession  hitherto i had  chiefly employed it in shooting at a mark  in order to improve my sight   now was i to profit by the gift in a different way     thus armed  i prepared to sally forth on my adventurous expedition   sober views might have speedily succeeded to the present tempest of my  passions  i might have gradually discovered the romantic and criminal  temerity of my project  the folly of revenge  and the duty of preserving  my life for the benefit of mankind  i might have suspected the propriety  of my conclusion  and have admitted some doubts as to the catastrophe  which i imagined to have befallen my uncle and sisters  i might  at  least  have consented to ascertain their condition with my own eyes  and  for this end have returned to the cottage  and have patiently waited  till the morning light should permit me to resume my journey     this conduct was precluded by a new incident  before i opened the door i  looked through a crevice of the wall  and perceived three human figures  at the farther end of the field  they approached the house  though  indistinctly seen  something in their port persuaded me that these were  the indians from whom i had lately parted  i was startled but not  dismayed  my thirst of vengeance was still powerful  and i believed that  the moment of its gratification was hastening  in a short time they  would arrive and enter the house  in what manner should they be  received     i studied not my own security  it was the scope of my wishes to kill the  whole number of my foes  but  that being done  i was indifferent to the  consequences  i desired not to live to relate or to exult in the deed     to go forth was perilous and useless  all that remained was to sit upon  the ground opposite the door  and fire at each as he entered  in the  hasty survey i had taken of this apartment  one object had been  overlooked  or imperfectly noticed  close to the chimney was an  aperture  formed by a cavity partly in the wall and in the ground  it  was the entrance of an oven  which resembled  on the outside  a mound of  earth  and which was filled with dry stalks of potatoes and other  rubbish     into this it was possible to thrust my body  a sort of screen might be  formed of the brushwood  and more deliberate and effectual execution be  done upon the enemy  i weighed not the disadvantages of this scheme  but  precipitately threw myself into this cavity  i discovered  in an  instant  that it was totally unfit for my purpose  but it was too late  to repair my miscarriage     this wall of the hovel was placed near the verge of a sand bank  the  oven was erected on the very brink  this bank  being of a loose and  mutable soil  could not sustain my weight  it sunk  and i sunk along  with it  the height of the bank was three or four feet  so that  though  disconcerted and embarrassed  i received no injury  i still grasped my  gun  and resumed my feet in a moment     what was now to be done  the bank screened me from the view of the  savages  the thicket was hard by  and  if i were eager to escape  the  way was obvious and sure  but  though single  though enfeebled by toil   by abstinence  and by disease  and though so much exceeded in number and  strength by my foes  i was determined to await and provoke the contest     in addition to the desperate impulse of passion  i was swayed by  thoughts of the danger which beset the sleeping girl  and from which my  flight would leave her without protection  how strange is the destiny  that governs mankind  the consequence of shrouding myself in this cavity  had not been foreseen  it was an expedient which courage and not  cowardice suggested  and yet it was the only expedient by which flight  had been rendered practicable  to have issued from the door would only  have been to confront  and not to elude  the danger     the first impulse prompted me to re enter the cottage by this avenue   but this could not be done with certainty and expedition  what then  remained  while i deliberated  the men approached  and  after a moment s  hesitation  entered the house  the door being partly open     the fire on the hearth enabled them to survey the room  one of them  uttered a sudden exclamation of surprise  this was easily interpreted   they had noticed the girl who had lately been their captive lying asleep  on the blanket  their astonishment at finding her here  and in this  condition  may be easily conceived     i now reflected that i might place myself  without being observed  near  the entrance  at an angle of the building  and shoot at each as he  successively came forth  i perceived that the bank conformed to two  sides of the house  and that i might gain a view of the front and of the  entrance  without exposing myself to observation     i lost no time in gaining this station  the bank was as high as my  breast  it was easy  therefore  to crouch beneath it  to bring my eye  close to the verge  and  laying my gun upon the top of it among the  grass  with its muzzles pointed to the door  patiently to wait their  forthcoming     my eye and my ear were equally attentive to what was passing  a low and  muttering conversation was maintained in the house  presently i heard a  heavy stroke descend  i shuddered  and my blood ran cold at the sound  i  entertained no doubt but that it was the stroke of a hatchet on the head  or breast of the helpless sleeper     it was followed by a loud shriek  the continuance of these shrieks  proved that the stroke had not been instantly fatal  i waited to hear it  repeated  but the sounds that now arose were like those produced by  dragging somewhat along the ground  the shrieks  meanwhile  were  incessant and piteous  my heart faltered  and i saw that mighty efforts  must be made to preserve my joints and my nerves steadfast  all depended  on the strenuous exertions and the fortunate dexterity of a moment     one now approached the door  and came forth  dragging the girl  whom he  held by the hair  after him  what hindered me from shooting at his first  appearance  i know not  this had been my previous resolution  my hand  touched the trigger  and  as he moved  the piece was levelled at his  right ear  perhaps the momentous consequences of my failure made me wait  till his ceasing to move might render my aim more sure     having dragged the girl  still piteously shrieking  to the distance of  ten feet from the house  he threw her from him with violence  she fell  upon the ground  and  observing him level his piece at her breast   renewed her supplications in a still more piercing tone  little did the  forlorn wretch think that her deliverance was certain and near  i  rebuked myself for having thus long delayed  i fired  and my enemy sunk  upon the ground without a struggle     thus far had success attended me in this unequal contest  the next shot  would leave me nearly powerless  if that  however  proved as unerring as  the first  the chances of defeat were lessened  the savages within   knowing the intentions of their associate with regard to the captive  girl  would probably mistake the report which they heard for that of his  piece  their mistake  however  would speedily give place to doubts  and  they would rush forth to ascertain the truth  it behooved me to provide  a similar reception for him that next appeared     it was as i expected  scarcely was my eye again fixed upon the entrance   when a tawny and terrific visage was stretched fearfully forth  it was  the signal of his fate  his glances  cast wildly and swiftly round   lighted upon me  and on the fatal instrument which was pointed at his  forehead  his muscles were at once exerted to withdraw his head  and to  vociferate a warning to his fellow  but his movement was too slow  the  ball entered above his ear  he tumbled headlong to the ground  bereaved  of sensation though not of life  and had power only to struggle and  mutter           chapter xix       think not that i relate these things with exultation or tranquillity   all my education and the habits of my life tended to unfit me for a  contest and a scene like this  but i was not governed by the soul which  usually regulates my conduct  i had imbibed  from the unparalleled  events which had lately happened  a spirit vengeful  unrelenting  and  ferocious     there was now an interval for flight  throwing my weapons away  i might  gain the thicket in a moment  i had no ammunition  nor would time be  afforded me to reload my piece  my antagonist would render my poniard  and my speed of no use to me  should he miss me as i fled  the girl  would remain to expiate  by her agonies and death  the fate of his  companions     these thoughts passed through my mind in a shorter time than is demanded  to express them  they yielded to an expedient suggested by the sight of  the gun that had been raised to destroy the girl  and which now lay upon  the ground  i am not large of bone  but am not deficient in agility and  strength  all that remained to me of these qualities was now exerted   and  dropping my own piece  i leaped upon the bank  and flew to seize my  prize     it was not till i snatched it from the ground  that the propriety of  regaining my former post rushed upon my apprehension  he that was still  posted in the hovel would mark me through the seams of the wall  and  render my destruction sure  i once more ran towards the bank  with the  intention to throw myself below it  all this was performed in an  instant  but my vigilant foe was aware of his advantage  and fired  through an opening between the logs  the bullet grazed my cheek  and  produced a benumbing sensation that made me instantly fall to the earth   though bereaved of strength  and fraught with the belief that i had  received a mortal wound  my caution was not remitted  i loosened not my  grasp of the gun  and the posture into which i accidentally fell enabled  me to keep an eye upon the house and a hand upon the trigger  perceiving  my condition  the savage rushed from his covert in order to complete his  work  but at three steps from the threshold he received my bullet in his  breast  the uplifted tomahawk fell from his hand  and  uttering a loud  shriek  he fell upon the body of his companion  his cries struck upon my  heart  and i wished that his better fortune had cast this evil from him  upon me     thus i have told thee a bloody and disastrous tale  when thou reflectest  on the mildness of my habits  my antipathy to scenes of violence and  bloodshed  my unacquaintance with the use of fire arms and the motives  of a soldier  thou wilt scarcely allow credit to my story  that one  rushing into these dangers  unfurnished with stratagems or weapons   disheartened and enfeebled by hardships and pain  should subdue four  antagonists trained from their infancy to the artifices and exertions of  indian warfare  will seem the vision of fancy  rather than the lesson of  truth     i lifted my head from the ground and pondered upon this scene  the  magnitude of this exploit made me question its reality  by attending to  my own sensations  i discovered that i had received no wound  or  at  least  none of which there was reason to complain  the blood flowed  plentifully from my cheek  but the injury was superficial  it was  otherwise with my antagonists  the last that had fallen now ceased to  groan  their huge limbs  inured to combat and  war worn   were useless  to their own defence  and to the injury of others     the destruction that i witnessed was vast  three beings  full of energy  and heroism  endowed with minds strenuous and lofty  poured out their  lives before me  i was the instrument of their destruction  this scene  of carnage and blood was laid by me  to this havoc and horror was i led  by such rapid footsteps     my anguish was mingled with astonishment  in spite of the force and  uniformity with which my senses were impressed by external objects  the  transition i had undergone was so wild and inexplicable  all that i had  performed  all that i had witnessed since my egress from the pit  were  so contradictory to precedent events  that i still clung to the belief  that my thoughts were confused by delirium  from these reveries i was at  length recalled by the groans of the girl  who lay near me on the  ground     i went to her and endeavoured to console her  i found that  while lying  in the bed  she had received a blow upon the side  which was still  productive of acute pain  she was unable to rise or to walk  and it was  plain that one or more of her ribs had been fractured by the blow     i knew not what means to devise for our mutual relief  it was possible  that the nearest dwelling was many leagues distant  i knew not in what  direction to go in order to find it  and my strength would not suffice  to carry my wounded companion thither in my arms  there was no expedient  but to remain in this field of blood till the morning     i had scarcely formed this resolution before the report of a musket was  heard at a small distance  at the same moment  i distinctly heard the  whistling of a bullet near me  i now remembered that  of the five  indians whom i saw in the cavern  i was acquainted with the destiny only  of four  the fifth might be still alive  and fortune might reserve for  him the task of avenging his companions  his steps might now be tending  hither in search of them     the musket belonging to him who was shot upon the threshold was still  charged  it was discreet to make all the provision in my power against  danger  i possessed myself of this gun  and  seating myself on the  ground  looked carefully on all sides  to descry the approach of the  enemy  i listened with breathless eagerness     presently voices were heard  they ascended from that part of the thicket  from which my view was intercepted by the cottage  these voices had  something in them that bespoke them to belong to friends and countrymen   as yet i was unable to distinguish words     presently my eye was attracted to one quarter  by a sound as of feet  trampling down bushes  several heads were seen moving in succession  and  at length the whole person was conspicuous  one after another leaped  over a kind of mound which bordered the field  and made towards the spot  where i sat  this band was composed of ten or twelve persons  with each  a gun upon his shoulder  their guise  the moment it was perceived   dissipated all my apprehensions     they came within the distance of a few paces before they discovered me   one stopped  and  bespeaking the attention of his followers  called to  know who was there  i answered that i was a friend  who entreated their  assistance  i shall not paint their astonishment when  on coming nearer   they beheld me surrounded by the arms and dead bodies of my enemies     i sat upon the ground  supporting my head with my left hand  and resting  on my knee the stock of a heavy musket  my countenance was wan and  haggard  my neck and bosom were dyed in blood  and my limbs  almost  stripped by the brambles of their slender covering  were lacerated by a  thousand wounds  three savages  two of whom were steeped in gore  lay at  a small distance  with the traces of recent life on their visages  hard  by was the girl  venting her anguish in the deepest groans  and  entreating relief from the new comers     one of the company  on approaching the girl  betrayed the utmost  perturbation   good god   he cried   is this a dream  can it be you   speak       ah  my father  my father   answered she   it is i indeed      the company  attracted by this dialogue  crowded round the girl  whom  her father  clasping in his arms  lifted from the ground  and pressed   in a transport of joy  to his breast  this delight was succeeded by  solicitude respecting her condition  she could only answer his inquiries  by complaining that her side was bruised to pieces   how came you  here     who hurt you     where did the indians carry you    were  questions to which she could make no reply but by sobs and plaints     my own calamities were forgotten in contemplating the fondness and  compassion of the man for his child  i derived new joy from reflecting  that i had not abandoned her  and that she owed her preservation to my  efforts  the inquiries which the girl was unable to answer were now put  to me  every one interrogated me who i was  whence i had come  and what  had given rise to this bloody contest     i was not willing to expatiate on my story  the spirit which had  hitherto sustained me began now to subside  my strength ebbed away with  my blood  tremors  lassitude  and deadly cold  invaded me  and i fainted  on the ground     such is the capricious constitution of the human mind  while dangers  were at hand  while my life was to be preserved only by zeal  and  vigilance  and courage  i was not wanting to myself  had my perils  continued  or even multiplied  no doubt my energies would have kept  equal pace with them  but the moment that i was encompassed by  protectors  and placed in security  i grew powerless and faint  my  weakness was proportioned to the duration and intensity of my previous  efforts  and the swoon into which i now sunk was  no doubt  mistaken by  the spectators for death     on recovering from this swoon  my sensations were not unlike those which  i had experienced on awaking in the pit  for a moment a mistiness  involved every object  and i was able to distinguish nothing  my sight   by rapid degrees  was restored  my painful dizziness was banished  and i  surveyed the scene before me with anxiety and wonder     i found myself stretched upon the ground  i perceived the cottage and  the neighbouring thicket  illuminated by a declining moon  my head  rested upon something  which  on turning to examine  i found to be one  of the slain indians  the other two remained upon the earth  at a small  distance  and in the attitudes in which they had fallen  their arms  the  wounded girl  and the troop who were near me when i fainted  were gone     my head had reposed upon the breast of him whom i had shot in this part  of his body  the blood had ceased to ooze from the wound  but my  dishevelled locks were matted and steeped in that gore which had  overflowed and choked up the orifice  i started from this detestable  pillow  and regained my feet     i did not suddenly recall what had lately passed  or comprehend the  nature of my situation  at length  however  late events were  recollected     that i should be abandoned in this forlorn state by these men seemed to  argue a degree of cowardice or cruelty of which i should have thought  them incapable  presently  however  i reflected that appearances might  have easily misled them into a belief of my death  on this supposition   to have carried me away  or to have stayed beside me  would be useless   other enemies might be abroad  or their families  now that their fears  were somewhat tranquillized  might require their presence and  protection     i went into the cottage  the fire still burned  and afforded me a genial  warmth  i sat before it  and began to ruminate on the state to which i  was reduced  and on the measures i should next pursue  daylight could  not be very distant  should i remain in this hovel till the morning  or  immediately resume my journey  i was feeble  indeed  but  by remaining  here  should i not increase my feebleness  the sooner i should gain some  human habitation the better  whereas watchfulness and hunger would  render me  at each minute  less able to proceed than on the former     this spot might be visited on the next day  but this was involved in  uncertainty  the visitants  should any come  would come merely to  examine and bury the dead  and bring with them neither the clothing nor  the food which my necessities demanded  the road was sufficiently  discernible  and would  unavoidably  conduct me to some dwelling  i  determined  therefore  to set out without delay  even in this state i  was not unmindful that my safety might require the precaution of being  armed  besides  the fusil which had been given me by sarsefield  and  which i had so unexpectedly recovered  had lost none of its value in my  eyes  i hoped that it had escaped the search of the troop who had been  here  and still lay below the bank in the spot where i had dropped it     in this hope i was not deceived  it was found  i possessed myself of the  powder and shot belonging to one of the savages  and loaded it  thus  equipped for defence  i regained the road  and proceeded  with alacrity   on my way  for the wound in my cheek  nature had provided a styptic  but  the soreness was extreme  and i thought of no remedy but water  with  which i might wash away the blood  my thirst likewise incommoded me  and  i looked with eagerness for the traces of a spring  in a soil like that  of the wilderness around me  nothing was less to be expected than to  light upon water  in this respect  however  my destiny was propitious  i  quickly perceived water in the ruts  it trickled hither from the thicket  on one side  and  pursuing it among the bushes  i reached the bubbling  source  though scanty and brackish  it afforded me unspeakable  refreshment     thou wilt think  perhaps  that my perils were now at an end  that the  blood i had already shed was sufficient for my safety  i fervently hoped  that no new exigence would occur compelling me to use the arms that i  bore in my own defence  i formed a sort of resolution to shun the  contest with a new enemy  almost at the expense of my own life  i was  satiated and gorged with slaughter  and thought upon a new act of  destruction with abhorrence and loathing     but  though i dreaded to encounter a new enemy  i was sensible that an  enemy might possibly be at hand  i had moved forward with caution  and  my sight and hearing were attentive to the slightest tokens  other  troops  besides that which i encountered  might be hovering near  and of  that troop i remembered that one at least had survived     the gratification which the spring had afforded me was so great  that i  was in no haste to depart  i lay upon a rock  which chanced to be shaded  by a tree behind me  from this post i could overlook the road to some  distance  and  at the same time  be shaded from the observation of  others     my eye was now caught by movements which appeared like those of a beast   in different circumstances  i should have instantly supposed it to be a  wolf  or panther  or bear  now my suspicions were alive on a different  account  and my startled fancy figured to itself nothing but a human  adversary     a thicket was on either side of the road  that opposite to my station  was discontinued at a small distance by the cultivated field  the road  continued along this field  bounded by the thicket on the one side and  the open space on the other  to this space the being who was now  described was cautiously approaching     he moved upon all fours  and presently came near enough to be  distinguished  his disfigured limbs  pendants from his ears and nose   and his shorn locks  were indubitable indications of a savage   occasionally he reared himself above the bushes  and scanned  with  suspicious vigilance  the cottage and the space surrounding it  then he  stooped  and crept along as before     i was at no loss to interpret these appearances  this was my surviving  enemy  he was unacquainted with the fate of his associates  and was now  approaching the theatre of carnage to ascertain their fate     once more was the advantage afforded me  from this spot might unerring  aim be taken  and the last of this hostile troop be made to share the  fate of the rest  should i fire  or suffer him to pass in safety     my abhorrence of bloodshed was not abated  but i had not foreseen this  occurrence  my success hitherto had seemed to depend upon a combination  of fortunate incidents  which could not be expected again to take place   but now was i invested with the same power  the mark was near  nothing  obstructed or delayed  i incurred no danger  and the event was certain     why should he be suffered to live  he came hither to murder and despoil  my friends  this work he has  no doubt  performed  nay  has he not borne  his part in the destruction of my uncle and my sisters  he will live  only to pursue the same sanguinary trade  to drink the blood and exult  in the laments of his unhappy foes and of my own brethren  fate has  reserved him for a bloody and violent death  for how long a time soever  it may be deferred  it is thus that his career will inevitably  terminate     should he be spared  he will still roam in the wilderness  and i may  again be fated to encounter him  then our mutual situation may be widely  different  and the advantage i now possess may be his     while hastily revolving these thoughts  i was thoroughly aware that one  event might take place which would render all deliberation useless   should he spy me where i lay  my fluctuations must end  my safety would  indispensably require me to shoot  this persuasion made me keep a  steadfast eye upon his motions  and be prepared to anticipate his  assault     it now most seasonably occurred to me that one essential duty remained  to be performed  one operation  without which fire arms are useless  had  been unaccountably omitted  my piece was uncocked  i did not reflect  that in moving the spring a sound would necessarily be produced  sufficient to alarm him  but i knew that the chances of escaping his  notice  should i be perfectly mute and still  were extremely slender   and that  in such a case  his movements would be quicker than the light   it behooved me  therefore  to repair my omission     the sound struck him with alarm  he turned and darted at me an inquiring  glance  i saw that forbearance was no longer in my power  but my heart  sunk while i complied with what may surely be deemed an indispensable  necessity  this faltering  perhaps  it was that made me swerve somewhat  from the fatal line  he was disabled by the wound  but not killed     he lost all power of resistance  and was  therefore  no longer to be  dreaded  he rolled upon the ground  uttering doleful shrieks  and  throwing his limbs into those contortions which bespeak the keenest  agonies to which ill fated man is subject  horror  and compassion  and  remorse  were mingled into one sentiment  and took possession of my  heart  to shut out this spectacle  i withdrew from the spot  but i  stopped before i had moved beyond hearing of his cries     the impulse that drove me from the scene was pusillanimous and cowardly   the past  however deplorable  could not be recalled  but could not i  afford some relief to this wretch  could not i at least bring his pangs  to a speedy close  thus he might continue  writhing and calling upon  death  for hours  why should his miseries be uselessly prolonged     there was but one way to end them  to kill him outright was the dictate  of compassion and of duty  i hastily returned  and once more levelled my  piece at his head  it was a loathsome obligation  and was performed with  unconquerable reluctance  thus to assault and to mangle the body of an  enemy  already prostrate and powerless  was an act worthy of abhorrence   yet it was  in this case  prescribed by pity     my faltering hand rendered this second bullet ineffectual  one  expedient  still more detestable  remained  having gone thus far  it  would have been inhuman to stop short  his heart might easily be pierced  by the bayonet  and his struggles would cease     this task of cruel lenity was at length finished  i dropped the weapon  and threw myself on the ground  overpowered by the horrors of this  scene  such are the deeds which perverse nature compels thousands of  rational beings to perform and to witness  such is the spectacle   endlessly prolonged and diversified  which is exhibited in every field  of battle  of which habit and example  the temptations of gain  and the  illusions of honour  will make us  not reluctant or indifferent  but  zealous and delighted actors and beholders     thus  by a series of events impossible to be computed or foreseen  was  the destruction of a band  selected from their fellows for an arduous  enterprise  distinguished by prowess and skill  and equally armed  against surprise and force  completed by the hand of a boy  uninured to  hostility  unprovided with arms  precipitate and timorous  i have noted  men who seemed born for no end but by their achievements to belie  experience  and baffle foresight  and outstrip belief  would to god that  i had not deserved to be numbered among these  but what power was it  that called me from the sleep of death just in time to escape the  merciless knife of this enemy  had my swoon continued till he had  reached the spot  he would have effectuated my death by new wounds and  torn away the skin from my brows  such are the subtle threads on which  hang the fate of man and of the universe     while engaged in these reflections  i perceived that the moonlight had  begun to fade before that of the sun  a dusky and reddish hue spread  itself over the east  cheered by this appearance  i once more resumed my  feet and the road  i left the savage where he lay  but made prize of  his tomahawk  i had left my own in the cavern  and this weapon added  little to my burden  prompted by some freak of fancy  i stuck his musket  in the ground  and left it standing upright in the middle of the road           chapter xx       i moved forward with as quick a pace as my feeble limbs would permit  i  did not allow myself to meditate  the great object of my wishes was a  dwelling where food and repose might be procured  i looked earnestly  forward  and on each side  in search of some token of human residence   but the spots of cultivation  the  well pole   the  worm fence    and the hayrick  were nowhere to be seen  i did not even meet with a  wild hog or a bewildered cow  the path was narrow  and on either side  was a trackless wilderness  on the right and left were the waving  lines of mountainous ridges  which had no peculiarity enabling me to  ascertain whether i had ever before seen them     at length i noticed that the tracks of wheels had disappeared from the  path that i was treading  that it became more narrow  and exhibited  fewer marks of being frequented  these appearances were discouraging  i  now suspected that i had taken a wrong direction  and  instead of  approaching  was receding from  the habitation of men     it was wisest  however  to proceed  the road could not but have some  origin as well as end  some hours passed away in this uncertainty  the  sun rose  and by noonday i seemed to be farther than ever from the end  of my toils  the path was more obscure  and the wilderness more rugged   thirst more incommoded me than hunger  but relief was seasonably  afforded by the brooks that flowed across the path     coming to one of these  and having slaked my thirst  i sat down upon the  bank  to reflect on my situation  the circuity of the path had  frequently been noticed  and i began to suspect that  though i had  travelled long  i had not moved far from the spot where i had commenced  my pilgrimage     turning my eyes on all sides  i noticed a sort of pool  formed by the  rivulet  at a few paces distant from the road  in approaching and  inspecting it  i observed the footsteps of cattle  who had retired by a  path that seemed much beaten  i likewise noticed a cedar bucket  broken  and old  lying on the margin  these tokens revived my drooping spirits   arid i betook myself to this new track  it was intricate  but  at  length  led up a steep  the summit of which was of better soil than that  of which the flats consisted  a clover field  and several  apple trees   sure attendants of man   were now discovered  from this  space i entered a corn field  and at length  to my inexpressible joy   caught a glimpse of a house     this dwelling was far different from that i had lately left  it was as  small and as low  but its walls consisted of boards  a window of four  panes admitted the light  and a chimney of brick  well burnt and neatly  arranged  peeped over the roof  as i approached  i heard the voice of  children and the hum of a spinning wheel     i cannot make thee conceive the delight which was afforded me by all  these tokens  i now found myself  indeed  among beings like myself  and  from whom hospitable entertainment might be confidently expected  i  compassed the house  and made my appearance at the door     a good woman  busy at her wheel  with two children playing on the ground  before her  were the objects that now presented themselves  the  uncouthness of my garb  my wild and weatherworn appearance  my fusil and  tomahawk  could not but startle them  the woman stopped her wheel  and  gazed as if a spectre had started into view     i was somewhat aware of these consequences  and endeavoured to elude  them by assuming an air of supplication and humility  i told her that i  was a traveller  who had unfortunately lost his way and had rambled in  this wild till nearly famished for want  i entreated her to give me some  food  any thing  however scanty or coarse  would be acceptable     after some pause she desired me  though not without some marks of fear   to walk in  she placed before me some brown bread and milk  she eyed me  while i eagerly devoured this morsel  it was  indeed  more delicious  than any i had ever tasted  at length she broke silence  and expressed  her astonishment and commiseration at my seemingly forlorn state  adding  that perhaps i was the man whom the men were looking after who had been  there some hours before     my curiosity was roused by this intimation  in answer to my  interrogations  she said that three persons had lately stopped  to  inquire if her husband had not met  within the last three days  a person  of whom their description seemed pretty much to suit my person and  dress  he was tall  slender  wore nothing but shirt and trousers  and  was wounded on the cheek      what   i asked   did they state the rank or condition of the person to  be      he lived in solesbury  he was supposed to have rambled in the mountains   and to have lost his way  or to have met with some mischance  it was  three days since he had disappeared  but had been seen by some one  the  last night  at deb s hut     what and where was deb s hut     it was a hut in the wilderness  occupied by an old indian woman  known  among her neighbours by the name of old deb  some people called her  queen mab  her dwelling was eight  long  miles from this house     a thousand questions were precluded and a thousand doubts solved by this  information   queen mab  were sounds familiar to my ears  for they  originated with myself     this woman originally belonged to the tribe of delawares  or  lenni lennapee  all these districts were once comprised within the  dominions of that nation  about thirty years ago  in consequence of  perpetual encroachments of the english colonists  they abandoned their  ancient seats and retired to the banks of the wabash and muskingum     this emigration was concerted in a general council of the tribe  and  obtained the concurrence of all but one female  her birth  talents  and  age  gave her much consideration and authority among her countrymen  and  all her zeal and eloquence were exerted to induce them to lay aside  their scheme  in this  however  she could not succeed  finding them  refractory  she declared her resolution to remain behind and maintain  possession of the land which her countrymen should impiously abandon     the village inhabited by this clan was built upon ground which now  constitutes my uncle s barnyard and orchard  on the departure of her  countrymen  this female burnt the empty wigwams and retired into the  fastnesses of norwalk  she selected a spot suitable for an indian  dwelling and a small plantation of maize  and in which she was seldom  liable to interruption and intrusion     her only companions were three dogs  of the indian or wolf species   these animals differed in nothing from their kinsmen of the forest but  in their attachment and obedience to their mistress  she governed them  with absolute sway  they were her servants and protectors  and attended  her person or guarded her threshold  agreeably to her directions  she  fed them with corn  and they supplied her and themselves with meat  by  hunting squirrels  raccoons  and rabbits     to the rest of mankind they were aliens or enemies  they never left the  desert but in company with their mistress  and  when she entered a  farm house  waited her return at a distance  they would suffer none to  approach them  but attacked no one who did not imprudently crave their  acquaintance  or who kept at a respectful distance from their wigwam   that sacred asylum they would not suffer to be violated  and no stranger  could enter it but at the imminent hazard of his life  unless  accompanied and protected by their dame     the chief employment of this woman  when at home  besides plucking the  weeds from among her corn  bruising the grain between two stones  and  setting her snares for rabbits and opossums  was to talk  though in  solitude  her tongue was never at rest but when she was asleep  but her  conversation was merely addressed to her dogs  her voice was sharp and  shrill  and her gesticulations were vehement and grotesque  a hearer  would naturally imagine that she was scolding  but  in truth  she was  merely giving them directions  having no other object of contemplation  or subject of discourse  she always found  in their postures and looks   occasion for praise  or blame  or command  the readiness with which they  understood  and the docility with which they obeyed  her movements and  words  were truly wonderful     if a stranger chanced to wander near her hut and overhear her jargon   incessant as it was  and shrill  he might speculate in vain on the  reason of these sounds  if he waited in expectation of hearing some  reply  he waited in vain  the strain  always voluble and sharp  was  never intermitted for a moment  and would continue for hours at a time     she seldom left the hut but to visit the neighbouring inhabitants and  demand from them food and clothing  or whatever her necessities  required  these were exacted as her due  to have her wants supplied was  her prerogative  and to withhold what she claimed was rebellion  she  conceived that by remaining behind her countrymen she succeeded to the  government and retained the possession of all this region  the english  were aliens and sojourners  who occupied the land merely by her  connivance and permission  and whom she allowed to remain on no terms  but those of supplying her wants     being a woman aged and harmless  her demands being limited to that of  which she really stood in need  and which her own industry could not  procure  her pretensions were a subject of mirth and good humour  and  her injunctions obeyed with seeming deference and gravity  to me she  early became an object of curiosity and speculation  i delighted to  observe her habits and humour her prejudices  she frequently came to my  uncle s house  and i sometimes visited her  insensibly she seemed to  contract an affection for me  and regarded me with more complacency and  condescension than any other received     she always disdained to speak english  and custom had rendered her  intelligible to most in her native language  with regard to a few simple  questions  i had taken some pains to study her jargon  and could make  out to discourse with her on the few ideas which she possessed  this  circumstance  likewise  wonderfully prepossessed her in my favour     the name by which she was formerly known was deb  but her pretensions to  royalty  the wildness of her aspect and garb  her shrivelled and  diminutive form  a constitution that seemed to defy the ravages of time  and the influence of the elements  her age   which some did not scruple  to affirm exceeded a hundred years   her romantic solitude and  mountainous haunts  suggested to my fancy the appellation of  queen  mab   there appeared to me some rude analogy between this personage  and her whom the poets of old time have delighted to celebrate  thou  perhaps wilt discover nothing but incongruities between them  but  be  that as it may  old deb and queen mab soon came into indiscriminate and  general use     she dwelt in norwalk upwards of twenty years  she was not forgotten by  her countrymen  and generally received from her brothers and sons an  autumnal visit  but no solicitations or entreaties could prevail on her  to return with them  two years ago  some suspicion or disgust induced  her to forsake her ancient habitation and to seek a hew one  happily she  found a more convenient habitation twenty miles to the westward  and in  a spot abundantly sterile and rude     this dwelling was of logs  and had been erected by a scottish emigrant   who  not being rich enough to purchase land  and entertaining a passion  for solitude and independence  cleared a field in the unappropriated  wilderness and subsisted on its produce  after some time he disappeared   various conjectures were formed as to the cause of his absence  none of  them were satisfactory  but that  which obtained most credit was  that  he had been murdered by the indians  who  about the same period  paid  their annual visit to the  queen   this conjecture acquired some  force by observing that the old woman shortly after took possession of  his hut  his implements of tillage  and his corn field     she was not molested in her new abode  and her life passed in the same  quiet tenor as before  her periodical rambles  her regal claims  her  guardian wolves  and her uncouth volubility  were equally remarkable   but her circuits were new  her distance made her visits to solebury more  rare  and had prevented me from ever extending my pedestrian excursions  to her present abode     these recollections were now suddenly called up by the information of my  hostess  the hut where i had sought shelter and relief was  it seems   the residence of queen mab  some fortunate occurrence had called her  away during my visit  had she and her dogs been at home  i should have  been set upon by these ferocious sentinels  and  before their dame could  have interfered  have been  together with my helpless companion  mangled  or killed  these animals never barked  i should have entered unaware of  my danger  and my fate could scarcely have been averted by my fusil     her absence at this unseasonable hour was mysterious  it was now the  time of year when her countrymen were accustomed to renew their visit   was there a league between her and the plunderers whom i had  encountered     but who were they by whom my footsteps were so industriously traced   those whom i had seen at deb s hut were strangers to me  but the wound  upon my face was known only to them  to this circumstance was now added  my place of residence and name  i supposed them impressed with the  belief that i was dead  but this mistake must have speedily been  rectified  revisiting the spot  finding me gone  and obtaining some  intelligence of my former condition  they had instituted a search after  me     but what tidings were these  i was supposed to have been bewildered in  the mountains  and three days were said to have passed since my  disappearance  twelve hours had scarcely elapsed since i emerged from  the cavern  had two days and a half been consumed in my subterranean  prison     these reflections were quickly supplanted by others  i now gained a  sufficient acquaintance with the region that was spread around me  i was  in the midst of a vale included between ridges that gradually approached  each other  and  when joined  were broken up into hollows and steeps   and  spreading themselves over a circular space  assumed the appellation  of norwalk  this vale gradually widened as it tended to the westward   and was  in this place  ten or twelve miles in breadth  my devious  footsteps had brought me to the foot of the southern barrier  the outer  basis of this was laved by the river  but  as it tended eastward  the  mountain and river receded from each other  and one of the cultivable  districts lying between them was solesbury  my natal  township    hither it was now my duty to return with the utmost expedition     there were two ways before me  one lay along the interior base of the  hill  over a sterile and trackless space  and exposed to the encounter  of savages  some of whom might possibly be lurking here  the other was  the well frequented road on the outside and along the river  and which  was to be gained by passing over this hill  the practicability of the  passage was to be ascertained by inquiries made to my hostess  she  pointed out a path that led to the rocky summit and down to the river s  brink  the path was not easy to be kept in view or to be trodden  but it  was undoubtedly to be preferred to any other     a route somewhat circuitous would terminate in the river road   thenceforward the way to solesbury was level and direct  but the whole  space which i had to traverse was not less than thirty miles  in six  hours it would be night  and to perform the journey in that time would  demand the agile boundings of a leopard and the indefatigable sinews of  an elk     my frame was in a miserable plight  my strength had been assailed by  anguish  and fear  and watchfulness  by toil  and abstinence  and  wounds  still  however  some remnant was left  would it not enable me to  reach my home by nightfall  i had delighted  from my childhood  in feats  of agility and perseverance  in roving through the maze of thickets and  precipices  i had put my energies  both moral and physical  frequently  to the test  greater achievements than this had been performed  and i  disdained to be outdone in perspicacity by the lynx  in his sure footed  instinct by the roe  or in patience under hardship  and contention with  fatigue  by the mohawk  i have ever aspired to transcend the rest of  animals in all that is common to the rational and brute  as well as in  all by which they are distinguished from each other           chapter xxi       i likewise burned with impatience to know the condition of my family  to  dissipate at once their tormenting doubts and my own with regard to our  mutual safety  the evil that i feared had befallen them was too enormous  to allow me to repose in suspense  and my restlessness and ominous  forebodings would be more intolerable than any hardship or toils to  which i could possibly be subjected during this journey     i was much refreshed and invigorated by the food that i had taken  and  by the rest of an hour  with this stock of recruited force i determined  to scale the hill  after receiving minute directions  and  returning  many thanks for my hospitable entertainment  i set out     the path was indeed intricate  and deliberate attention was obliged to  be exerted in order to preserve it  hence my progress was slower than i  wished  the first impulse was to fix my eye upon the summit  and to leap  from crag to crag till i reached it  but this my experience had taught  me was impracticable  it was only by winding through gullies  and  coasting precipices and bestriding chasms  that i could hope finally to  gain the top  and i was assured that by one way only was it possible to  accomplish even this     an hour was spent in struggling with impediments  and i seemed to have  gained no way  hence a doubt was suggested whether i had not missed the  true road  in this doubt i was confirmed by the difficulties which now  grew up before me  the brooks  the angles  and the hollows  which my  hostess had described  were not to be seen  instead of these  deeper  dells  more headlong torrents  and wider gaping rifts  were incessantly  encountered     to return was as hopeless as to proceed  i consoled myself with thinking  that the survey which my informant had made of the hill side might prove  inaccurate  and that  in spite of her predictions  the heights might be  reached by other means than by those pointed out by her  i will not  enumerate my toilsome expedients  my frequent disappointments  and my  desperate exertions  suffice it to say that i gained the upper space not  till the sun had dipped beneath the horizon     my satisfaction at accomplishing thus much was not small  and i hied   with renovated spirits  to the opposite brow  this proved to be a steep  that could not be descended  the river flowed at its foot  the opposite  bank was five hundred yards distant  and was equally towering and steep  as that on which i stood  appearances were adapted to persuade you that  these rocks had formerly joined  but by some mighty effort of nature had  been severed  that the stream might find way through the chasm  the  channel  however  was encumbered with asperities  over which the river  fretted and foamed with thundering impetuosity     i pondered for a while on these stupendous scenes  they ravished my  attention from considerations that related to myself  but this interval  was snort  and i began to measure the descent  in order to ascertain the  practicability of treading it  my survey terminated in bitter  disappointment  i turned my eye successively eastward and westward   solesbury lay in the former direction  and thither i desired to go  i  kept along the verge in this direction till i reached an impassable  rift  beyond this i saw that the steep grew lower  but it was impossible  to proceed farther  higher up the descent might be practicable  and   though more distant from solesbury  it was better to reach the road even  at that distance than never to reach it     changing my course  therefore  i explored the spaces above  the night  was rapidly advancing  the gray clouds gathered in the southeast  and a  chilling blast  the usual attendant of a night in october  began to  whistle among the pigmy cedars that scantily grew upon these heights  my  progress would quickly be arrested by darkness  and it behooved me to  provide some place of shelter and repose  no recess better than a hollow  in the rock presented itself to my anxious scrutiny     meanwhile  i would not dismiss the hope of reaching the road  which i  saw some hundred feet below  winding along the edge of the river  before  daylight should utterly fail  speedily these hopes derived new vigour  from meeting a ledge that irregularly declined from the brow of the  hill  it was wide enough to allow of cautious footing  on a similar  stratum  or ledge  projecting still farther from the body of the hill   and close to the surface of the river  was the road  this stratum  ascended from the level of the stream  while that on which i trod  rapidly descended  i hoped that they would speedily be blended  or  at  least  approach so near as to allow me to leap from one to the other  without enormous hazard     this fond expectation was frustrated  presently i perceived that the  ledge below began to descend  while that above began to tend upward and  was quickly terminated by the uppermost surface of the cliff  here it  was needful to pause  i looked over the brink  and considered whether i  might not leap from my present station without endangering my limbs  the  road into which i should fall was a rocky pavement far from being  smooth  the descent could not be less than forty or fifty feet  such an  attempt was  to the last degree  hazardous  but was it not better to  risk my life by leaping from this eminence than to remain and perish on  the top of this inhospitable mountain  the toils which i had endured in  reaching this height appeared  to my panic struck fancy  less easy to be  borne again than death     i know not but that i should have finally resolved to leap  had not  different views been suggested by observing that the outer edge of the  road was  in like manner  the brow of a steep which terminated in the  river  the surface of the road was twelve or fifteen feet above the  level of the stream  which  in this spot  was still and smooth  hence i  inferred that the water was not of inconsiderable depth  to fall upon  rocky points was  indeed  dangerous  but to plunge into water of  sufficient depth  even from a height greater than that at which i now  stood  especially to one to whom habit had rendered water almost as  congenial an element as air  was scarcely attended with inconvenience   this expedient was easy and safe  twenty yards from this spot  the  channel was shallow  and to gain the road from the stream was no  difficult exploit     some disadvantages  however  attended this scheme  the water was smooth   but this might arise from some other cause than its depth  my gun   likewise  must be left behind me  and that was a loss to which i felt  invincible repugnance  to let it fall upon the road would put it in my  power to retrieve the possession  but it was likely to be irreparably  injured by the fall     while musing upon this expedient  and weighing injuries with benefits   the night closed upon me  i now considered that  should i emerge in  safety from the stream  i should have many miles to travel before i  could reach a house  my clothes meanwhile would be loaded with wet  i  should be heart pierced by the icy blast that now blew  and my wounds  and bruises would be chafed into insupportable pain     i reasoned likewise on the folly of impatience and the necessity of  repose  by thus long continuance in one posture  my sinews began to  stiffen  and my reluctance to make new exertions to increase  my brows  were heavy  and i felt an irresistible propensity to sleep  i concluded  to seek some shelter  and resign myself  my painful recollections  and  my mournful presages  to sweet forgetfulness  for this end  i once more  ascended to the surface of the cliff  i dragged my weary feet forward   till i found somewhat that promised me the shelter that i sought     a cluster of cedars appeared  whose branches overarched a space that  might be called a bower  it was a slight cavity  whose flooring was  composed of loose stones and a few faded leaves blown from a distance  and finding a temporary lodgment here  on one side was a rock  forming a  wall rugged and projecting above  at the bottom of the rock was a rift   somewhat resembling a coffin in shape  and not much larger in  dimensions  this rift terminated  on the opposite side of the rock  in  an opening that was too small for the body of a man to pass  the  distance between each entrance was twice the length of a man     this bower was open to the southeast  whence the gale now blew  it  therefore imperfectly afforded the shelter of which i stood in need   but it was the best that the place and the time afforded  to stop the  smaller entrance of the cavity with a stone  and to heap before the  other branches lopped from the trees with my hatchet  might somewhat  contribute to my comfort     this was done  and  thrusting myself into this recess as far as i was  able  i prepared for repose  it might have been reasonably suspected to  be the den of rattlesnakes or panthers  but my late contention with  superior dangers and more formidable enemies made me reckless of these   but another inconvenience remained  in spite of my precautions  my  motionless posture and slender covering exposed me so much to the cold  that i could not sleep     the air appeared to have suddenly assumed the temperature of midwinter   in a short time  my extremities were benumbed  and my limbs shivered and  ached as if i had been seized by an ague  my bed likewise was dank and  uneven  and the posture i was obliged to assume  unnatural and painful   it was evident that my purpose could not be answered by remaining here     i therefore crept forth  and began to reflect upon the possibility of  continuing my journey  motion was the only thing that could keep me from  freezing  and my frame was in that state which allowed me to take no  repose in the absence of warmth  since warmth was indispensable  it now  occurred to me to ask whether it were not possible to kindle a fire     sticks and leaves were at hand  my hatchet and a pebble would enable me  to extract a spark  from this  by suitable care and perseverance  i  might finally procure sufficient fire to give me comfort and ease  and  even enable me to sleep  this boon was delicious  and i felt as if i  were unable to support a longer deprivation of it     i proceeded to execute this scheme  i took the driest leaves  and  endeavoured to use them as tinder  but the driest leaves were moistened  by the dews  they were only to be found in the hollows  in some of which  were pools of water and others were dank  i was not speedily  discouraged  but my repeated attempts failed  and i was finally  compelled to relinquish this expedient     all that now remained was to wander forth and keep myself in motion till  the morning  the night was likely to prove tempestuous and long  the  gale seemed freighted with ice  and acted upon my body like the points  of a thousand needles  there was no remedy  and i mustered my patience  to endure it     i returned again to the brow of the hill  i ranged along it till i  reached a place where the descent was perpendicular  and  in consequence  of affording no sustenance to trees or bushes  was nearly smooth and  bare  there was no road to be seen  and this circumstance  added to the  sounds which the rippling current produced  afforded me some knowledge  of my situation     the ledge along which the road was conducted disappeared near this spot   the opposite sides of the chasm through which flowed the river  approached nearer to each other  in the form of jutting promontories  i  now stood upon the verge of that on the northern side  the water  flowed at the foot  but  for the space of ten or twelve feet from the  rock  was so shallow as to permit the traveller and his horse to wade  through it  and thus to regain the road which the receding precipice had  allowed to be continued on the farther side     i knew the nature and dimensions of this ford  i knew that  at a few  yards from the rock  the channel was of great depth  to leap into it  in  this place  was a less dangerous exploit than at the spot where i had  formerly been tempted to leap  there i was unacquainted with the depth   but here i knew it to be considerable  still  there was some ground of  hesitation and fear  my present station was loftier  and how deeply i  might sink into this gulf  how far the fall and the concussion would  bereave me of my presence of mind  i could not determine  this  hesitation vanished  and  placing my tomahawk and fusil upon the ground   i prepared to leap     this purpose was suspended  in the moment of its execution  by a faint  sound  heard from the quarter whence i had come  it was the warning of  men  but had nothing in common with those which i had been accustomed to  hear  it was not the howling of a wolf or the yelling of a panther   these had often been overheard by night during my last year s excursion  to the lakes  my fears whispered that this was the vociferation of a  savage     i was unacquainted with the number of the enemies who had adventured  into this district  whether those whom i had encountered at  deb s  hut  were of that band whom i had met with in the cavern  was merely  a topic of conjecture  there might be a half score of troops  equally  numerous  spread over the wilderness  and the signal i had just heard  might betoken the approach of one of these  yet by what means they  should gain this nook  and what prey they expected to discover  were not  easily conceived     the sounds  somewhat diversified  nearer and rising from different  quarters  were again heard  my doubts and apprehensions were increased   what expedient to adopt for my own safety was a subject of rapid  meditation   whether to remain stretched upon the ground or to rise and  go forward  was it likely the enemy would coast along the edge of the  steep  would they ramble hither to look upon the ample scene which  spread on all sides around the base of this rocky pinnacle  in that  case  how should i conduct myself  my arms were ready for use  could i  not elude the necessity of shedding more blood  could i not anticipate  their assault by casting myself without delay into the stream     the sense of danger demanded more attention to be paid to external  objects than to the motives by which my future conduct should be  influenced  my post was on a circular prefecture  in some degree  detached from the body of the hill  the brow of which continued in a  straight line  uninterrupted by this projecture  which was somewhat  higher than the continued summit of the ridge  this line ran at the  distance of a few paces from my post  objects moving along this line  could merely be perceived to move  in the present obscurity     my scrutiny was entirely directed to this quarter  presently the  treading of many feet was heard  and several figures were discovered   following each other in that straight and regular succession which is  peculiar to the indians  they kept along the brow of the hill joining  the promontory  i distinctly marked seven figures in succession     my resolution was formed  should any one cast his eye hither  suspect or  discover an enemy  and rush towards me  i determined to start upon my  feet  fire on my foe as he advanced  throw my piece on the ground  and  then leap into the river     happily  they passed unobservant and in silence  i remained in the same  posture for several minutes  at length  just as my alarms began to  subside  the halloos  before heard  arose  and from the same quarter as  before  this convinced me that my perils were not at an end  this now  appeared to be merely the vanguard  and would speedily be followed by  others  against whom the same caution was necessary to be taken     my eye  anxiously bent the only way by which any one could approach  now  discerned a figure  which was indubitably that of a man armed  none  other appeared in company  but doubtless others were near  he  approached  stood still  and appeared to gaze steadfastly at the spot  where i lay     the optics of a  lenni lennapee  i knew to be far keener than my  own  a log or a couched fawn would never be mistaken for a man  nor a  man for a couched fawn or a log  not only a human being would be  instantly detected  but a decision be unerringly made whether it wrere  friend or foe  that my prostrate body was the object on which the  attention of this vigilant and steadfast gazer was fixed could not be  doubted  yet  since he continued an inactive gazer  there was ground for  a possibility to stand upon that i was not recognised  my fate therefore  was still in suspense     this interval was momentary  i marked a movement  which my fears  instantly interpreted to be that of levelling a gun at my head  this  action was sufficiently conformable to my prognostics  supposing me to  be detected  there was no need for him to change his post  aim might be  too fatally taken  and his prey be secured  from the distance at which  he now stood     these images glanced upon my thought  and put an end to my suspense  a  single effort placed me on my feet  i fired with a precipitation that  precluded the certainty of hitting my mark  dropped my piece upon the  ground  and leaped from this tremendous height into the river  i reached  the surface  and sunk in a moment to the bottom     plunging endlong into the water  the impetus created by my fall from  such a height would be slowly resisted by this denser element  had the  depth been less  its resistance would not perhaps have hindered me from  being mortally injured against the rocky bottom  had the depth been  greater  time enough would not have been allowed me to regain the  surface  had i fallen on my side  i should have been bereft of life or  sensibility by the shock which my frame would have received  as it was   my fate was suspended on a thread  to have lost my presence of mind  to  have forborne to counteract my sinking  for an instant  after i had  reached the water  would have made all exertions to regain the air  fruitless  to so fortunate a concurrence of events was thy friend  indebted for his safety     yet i only emerged from the gulf to encounter new perils  scarcely had i  raised my head above the surface  and inhaled the vital breath  when  twenty shots were aimed at me from the precipice above  a shower of  bullets fell upon the water  some of them did not fall farther than two  inches from my head  i had not been aware of this new danger  and  now  that it assailed me  continued gasping the air and floundering at  random  the means of eluding it did not readily occur  my case seemed  desperate  and all caution was dismissed     this state of discomfiting surprise quickly disappeared  i made myself  acquainted  at a glance  with the position of surrounding objects  i  conceived that the opposite bank of the river would afford me most  security  and thither i tended with all the expedition in my power     meanwhile  my safety depended on eluding the bullets that continued  incessantly to strike the water at an arm s length from my body  for  this end i plunged beneath the surface  and only rose to inhale fresh  air  presently the firing ceased  the flashes that lately illuminated  the bank disappeared  and a certain bustle and murmur of confused voices  gave place to solitude and silence           chapter xxii       i reached without difficulty the opposite bank  but the steep was  inaccessible  i swam along the edge in hopes of meeting with some  projection or recess where i might  at least  rest my weary limbs  and   if it were necessary to recross the river  to lay in a stock of  recruited spirits and strength for that purpose  i trusted that the  water would speedily become shoal  or that the steep would afford rest  to my feet  in both these hopes i was disappointed     there is no one to whom i would yield the superiority in swimming  but  my strength  like that of other human beings  had its limits  my  previous fatigues had been enormous  and my clothes  heavy with  moisture  greatly encumbered and retarded my movements  i had proposed  to free myself from this imprisonment  but i foresaw the inconveniences  of wandering over this scene in absolute nakedness  and was willing  therefore  at whatever hazard  to retain them  i continued to struggle  with the current and to search for the means of scaling the steeps  my  search was fruitless  and i began to meditate the recrossing of the  river     surely my fate has never been paralleled  where was this series of  hardships and perils to end  no sooner was one calamity eluded  than i  was beset by another  i had emerged from abhorred darkness in the heart  of the earth  only to endure the extremities of famine and encounter the  fangs of a wild beast  from these i was delivered only to be thrown into  the midst of savages  to wage an endless and hopeless war with adepts in  killing  with appetites that longed to feast upon my bowels and to quaff  my heart s blood  from these likewise was i rescued  but merely to  perish in the gulfs of the river  to welter on unvisited shores  or to  be washed far away from curiosity or pity     formerly water was not only my field of sport but my sofa and my bed  i  could float for hours on its surface  enjoying its delicious cool   almost without the expense of the slightest motion  it was an element as  fitted for repose as for exercise  but now the buoyant spirit seemed to  have flown  my muscles were shrunk  the air and water were equally  congealed  and my most vehement exertions were requisite to sustain me  on the surface     at first i had moved along with my wonted celerity and ease  but quickly  my forces were exhausted  my pantings and efforts were augmented  and i  saw that to cross the river again was impracticable  i must continue   therefore  to search out some accessible spot in the bank along which i  was swimming     each moment diminished my stock of strength  and it behooved me to make  good my footing before another minute should escape  i continued to  swim  to survey the bank  and to make ineffectual attempts to grasp the  rock  the shrubs which grew upon it would not uphold me  and the  fragments which  for a moment  inspired me with hope  crumbled away as  soon as they were touched     at length i noticed a pine which was rooted in a crevice near the water   the trunk  or any part of the root  was beyond my reach  but i trusted  that i could catch hold of the branch which hung lowest  and that  when  caught  it would assist me in gaining the trunk  and thus deliver me  from the death which could not be otherwise averted     the attempt was arduous  had it been made when i first reached the bank   no difficulty had attended it  but now to throw myself some feet above  the surface could scarcely be expected from one whose utmost efforts  seemed to be demanded to keep him from sinking  yet this exploit   arduous as it was  was attempted and accomplished  happily the twigs  were strong enough to sustain my weight till i caught at other branches  and finally placed myself upon the trunk     this danger was now past  but i admitted the conviction that others  no  less formidable  remained to be encountered  and that my ultimate  destiny was death  i looked upward  new efforts might enable me to gain  the summit of this steep  but perhaps i should thus be placed merely in  the situation from which i had just been delivered  it was of little  moment whether the scene of my imprisonment was a dungeon not to be  broken  or a summit from which descent was impossible     the river  indeed  severed me from a road which was level and safe  but  my recent dangers were remembered only to make me shudder at the thought  of incurring them a second time by attempting to cross it  i blush at  the recollection of this cowardice  it was little akin to the spirit  which i had recently displayed  it was  indeed  an alien to my bosom   and was quickly supplanted by intrepidity and perseverance     i proceeded to mount the hill  from root to root  and from branch to  branch  lay my journey  it was finished  and i sat down upon the highest  brow to meditate on future trials  no road lay along this side of the  river  it was rugged and sterile  and farms were sparingly dispersed  over it  to reach one of these was now the object of my wishes  i had  not lost the desire of reaching solesbury before morning  but my wet  clothes and the coldness of the night seemed to have bereaved me of the  power     i traversed this summit  keeping the river on my right hand  happily   its declinations and ascents were by no means difficult  and i was  cheered  in the midst of my vexations  by observing that every mile  brought me nearer to my uncle s dwelling  meanwhile i anxiously looked  for some tokens of a habitation  these at length presented themselves  a  wild heath  whistled over by october blasts  meagrely adorned with the  dry stalks of scented shrubs and the bald heads of the sapless mullein   was succeeded by a fenced field and a corn stack  the dwelling to which  these belonged was eagerly sought     i was not surprised that all voices were still and all lights  extinguished  for this was the hour of repose  having reached a piazza  before the house  i paused  whether  at this drowsy time  to knock for  admission  to alarm the peaceful tenants and take from them the rest  which their daily toils and their rural innocence had made so sweet  or  to retire to what shelter a haystack or barn could afford  was the theme  of my deliberations     meanwhile  i looked up at the house  it was the model of cleanliness and  comfort  it was built of wood  but the materials had undergone the  plane  as well as the axe and the saw  it was painted white  and the  windows not only had sashes  but these sashes were supplied  contrary to  custom  with glass  in most cases the aperture where glass should be is  stuffed with an old hat or a petticoat  the door had not only all its  parts entire  but was embellished with mouldings and a pediment  i  gathered from these tokens that this was the abode not only of rural  competence and innocence  but of some beings raised by education and  fortune above the intellectual mediocrity of clowns     methought i could claim consanguity with such beings  not to share their  charity and kindness would be inflicting as well as receiving injury   the trouble of affording shelter  and warmth  and wholesome diet  to a  wretch destitute as i was  would be eagerly sought by them     still  i was unwilling to disturb them  i bethought myself that their  kitchen might be entered  and all that my necessities required be  obtained without interrupting their slumber  i needed nothing but the  warmth which their kitchen hearth would afford  stretched upon the  bricks  i might dry my clothes  and perhaps enjoy some unmolested sleep   in spite of presages of ill and the horrid remembrances of what i had  performed and endured  i believed that nature would afford a short  respite to my cares     i went to the door of what appeared to be a kitchen  the door was wide  open  this circumstance portended evil  though it be not customary to  lock or to bolt  it is still less usual to have entrances unclosed  i  entered with suspicious steps  and saw enough to confirm my  apprehensions  several pieces of wood  half burned  lay in the midst of  the floor  they appeared to have been removed hither from the chimney   doubtless with a view to set fire to the whole building     the fire had made some progress on the floor  but had been seasonably  extinguished by pailfuls of water thrown upon it  the floor was still  deluged with wet  the pail  not emptied of all its contents  stood upon  the hearth  the earthen vessels and plates  whose proper place was the  dresser  were scattered in fragments in all parts of the room  i looked  around me for some one to explain this scene  but no one appeared     the last spark of fire was put out  so that  had my curiosity been idle   my purpose could not be accomplished  to retire from this scene  neither  curiosity nor benevolence would permit  that some mortal injury had been  intended was apparent  what greater mischief had befallen  or whether  greater might not  by my interposition  be averted  could only be  ascertained by penetrating farther into the house  i opened a door on  one side which led to the main body of the building and entered to a  bed chamber  i stood at the entrance and knocked  but no one answered my  signals     the sky was not totally clouded  so that some light pervaded the room  i  saw that a bed stood in the corner  but whether occupied or not its  curtains hindered me from judging  i stood in suspense a few minutes   when a motion in the bed showed me that some one was there  i knocked  again  but withdrew to the outside of the door  this roused the sleeper   who  half groaning  and puffing the air through his nostrils  grumbled  out  in the hoarsest voice that i ever heard  and in a tone of surly  impatience   who is there      i hesitated for an answer  but the voice instantly continued  in the  manner of one half asleep and enraged at being disturbed   is t you   peg  damn ye  stay away  now  i tell ye  stay away  or  by god  i will  cut your throat   i will   he continued to mutter and swear  but without  coherence or distinctness     these were the accents of drunkenness  and denoted a wild and ruffian  life  they were little in unison with the external appearances of the  mansion  and blasted all the hopes i had formed of meeting under this  roof with gentleness and hospitality  to talk with this being  to  attempt to reason him into humanity and soberness  was useless  i was at  a loss in what manner to address him  or whether it was proper to  maintain any parley  meanwhile  my silence was supplied by the  suggestions of his own distempered fancy   ay   said he   ye will  will  ye  well  come on  let s see who s the better at the oak stick  if i  part with ye before i have bared your bones   i ll teach ye to be always  dipping in my dish  ye devil s dam ye      so saying  he tumbled out of bed  at the first step  he struck his head  against the bedpost  but  setting himself upright  he staggered towards  the spot where i stood  some new obstacle occurred  he stumbled and fell  at his length upon the floor     to encounter or expostulate with a man in this state was plainly absurd   i turned and issued forth  with an aching heart  into the court before  the house  the miseries which a debauched husband or father inflicted  upon all whom their evil destiny allies to him were pictured by my  fancy  and wrung from me tears of anguish  these images  however   quickly yielded to reflections on my own state  no expedient now  remained but to seek the barn and find a covering and a bed of straw     i had scarcely set foot within the barnyard when i heard a sound as of  the crying of an infant  it appeared to issue from the barn  i  approached softly and listened at the door  the cries of the babe  continued  but were accompanied by the entreaties of a nurse or a mother  to be quiet  these entreaties were mingled with heart breaking sobs  and  exclamations of   ah  me  my babe  canst thou not sleep and afford thy  unhappy mother some peace  thou art cold  and i have not sufficient  warmth to cherish thee  what will become of us  thy deluded father cares  not if we both perish      a glimpse of the true nature of the scene seemed to be imparted by these  words  i now likewise recollected incidents that afforded additional  light  somewhere on this bank of the river there formerly resided one by  name selby  he was an aged person  who united science and taste to the  simple and laborious habits of a husbandman  he had a son who resided  several years in europe  but on the death of his father returned home   accompanied by a wife  he had succeeded to the occupation of the farm   but rumour had whispered many tales to the disadvantage of his morals   his wife was affirmed to be of delicate and polished manners  and much  unlike her companion     it now occurred to me that this was the dwelling of the selbys  and i  seemed to have gained some insight into the discord and domestic  miseries by which the unhappy lady suffered  this was no time to waste  my sympathy on others  i could benefit her nothing  selby had probably  returned from a carousal  with all his malignant passions raised into  frenzy by intoxication  he had driven his desolate wife from her bed and  house  and  to shun outrage and violence  she had fled  with her  helpless infant  to the barn  to appease his fury  to console her  to  suggest a remedy for this distress  was not in my power  to have sought  an interview would be merely to excite her terrors and alarm her  delicacy  without contributing to alleviate her calamity  here  then   was no asylum for me  a place of rest must be sought at some  neighbouring habitation  it was probable that one would be found at no  great distance  the path that led from the spot where i stood  through a  gate  into a meadow  might conduct me to the nearest dwelling  and this  path i immediately resolved to explore     i was anxious to open the gate without noise  but i could not succeed   some creaking of its hinges was unavoidably produced  which i feared  would be overheard by the lady and multiply her apprehensions and  perplexities  this inconvenience was irremediable  i therefore closed  the gate and pursued the footway before me with the utmost expedition  i  had not gained the farther end of the meadow when i lighted on something  which lay across the path  and which  on being closely inspected   appeared to be a human body  it was the corpse of a girl  mangled by a  hatchet  her head  gory and deprived of its locks  easily explained the  kind of enemies by whom she had been assailed  here was proof that this  quiet and remote habitation had been visited  in their destructive  progress  by the indians  the girl had been slain by them  and her  scalp  according to their savage custom  had been torn away to be  preserved as a trophy     the fire which had been kindled on the kitchen floor tvas now  remembered  and corroborated the inferences which were drawn from this  spectacle  and yet that the mischief had been thus limited  that the  besotted wretch who lay helpless on his bed and careless of impending  danger  and that the mother and her infant  should escape  excited some  degree of surprise  could the savages have been interrupted in their  work  and obliged to leave their vengeance unfinished     their visit had been recent  many hours had not elapsed since they  prowled about these grounds  had they wholly disappeared  and meant they  not to return  to what new danger might i be exposed in remaining thus  guideless and destitute of all defence     in consequence of these reflections  i proceeded with more caution  i  looked with suspicious glances before and on either side of me  i now  approached the fence which  on this side  bounded the meadow  something  was discerned  or imagined  stretched close to the fence  on the ground   and filling up the pathway  my apprehensions of a lurking enemy had been  previously awakened  and my fancy instantly figured to itself an armed  man lying on the ground and waiting to assail the unsuspecting  passenger     at first i was prompted to fly  but a second thought showed me that i  had already approached near enough to be endangered  notwithstanding my  pause  the form was motionless  the possibility of being misled in my  conjectures was easily supposed  what i saw might be a log  or it might  be another victim to savage ferocity  this track was that which my  safety required me to pursue  to turn aside or go back would be merely  to bewilder myself anew     urged by these motives  i went nearer  and at last was close enough to  perceive that the figure was human  he lay upon his face  near his right  hand was a musket  unclenched  this circumstance  his deathlike  attitude  and the garb and ornaments of an indian  made me readily  suspect the nature and cause of this catastrophe  here the invaders had  been encountered and repulsed  and one at least of their number had been  left upon the field     i was weary of contemplating these rueful objects  custom  likewise   even in so short a period  had inured me to spectacles of horror  i was  grown callous and immovable  i stayed not to ponder on the scene  but   snatching the musket  which was now without an owner  and which might be  indispensable to my defence  i hastened into the wood  on this side the  meadow was skirted by a forest  but a beaten road led into it  and might  therefore be attempted without danger           chapter xxiii       the road was intricate and long  it seemed designed to pervade the  forest in every possible direction  i frequently noticed cut wood piled  in heaps upon either side  and rejoiced in these tokens that the  residence of man was near  at length i reached a second fence  which  proved to be the boundary of a road still more frequented  i pursued  this  and presently beheld before me the river and its opposite  barriers     this object afforded me some knowledge of my situation  there was a ford  over which travellers used to pass  and in which the road that i was now  pursuing terminated  the stream was rapid and tumultuous  but in this  place did not rise higher than the shoulders  on the opposite side was a  highway  passable by horses and men  though not by carriages  and which  led into the midst of solesbury  should i not rush into the stream  and  still aim at reaching my uncle s house before morning  why should i  delay     thirty hours of incessant watchfulness and toil  of enormous efforts and  perils  preceded and accompanied by abstinence and wounds  were enough  to annihilate the strength and courage of ordinary men  in the course of  them  i had frequently believed myself to have reached the verge beyond  which my force would not carry me  but experience as frequently  demonstrated my error  though many miles were yet to be traversed   though my clothes were once more to be drenched and loaded with  moisture  though every hour seemed to add somewhat to the keenness of  the blast  yet how should i know  but by trial  whether my stock of  energy was not sufficient for this last exploit     my resolution to proceed was nearly formed  when the figure of a man  moving slowly across the road at some distance before me was observed   hard by this ford lived a man by name bisset  of whom i had slight  knowledge  he tended his two hundred acres with a plodding and  money doting spirit  while his son overlooked a grist mill on the river   he was a creature of gain  coarse and harmless  the man whom i saw before  me might be he  or some one belonging to his family  being armed for  defence  i less scrupled at meeting with any thing in the shape of man   i therefore called  the figure stopped and answered me without surliness  or anger  the voice was unlike that of bisset  but this person s  information i believed would be of some service     coming up to him  he proved to be a clown belonging to bisset s  habitation  his panic and surprise on seeing me made him aghast  in my  present garb i should not have easily been recognised by my nearest  kinsman  and much less easily by one who had seldom met me     it may be easily conceived that my thoughts  when allowed to wander from  the objects before me  were tormented with forebodings and inquietudes  on account of the ills which i had so much reason to believe had  befallen my family  i had no doubt that some evil had happened  but the  full extent of it was still uncertain  i desired and dreaded to discover  the truth  and was unable to interrogate this person in a direct manner   i could deal only in circuities and hints  i shuddered while i waited  for an answer to my inquiries     had not indians  i asked  been lately seen in this neighbourhood  were  they not suspected of hostile designs  had they not already committed  some mischief  some passenger  perhaps  had been attacked  or fire had  been set to some house  on which side of the river had their steps been  observed or any devastation been committed  above the ford or below it   at what distance from the river     when his attention could be withdrawn from my person and bestowed upon  my questions  he answered that some alarm had indeed been spread about  indians  and that parties from solesbury and chetasco were out in  pursuit of them  that many persons had been killed by them  and that one  house in solesbury had been rifled and burnt on the night before the  last     these tidings were a dreadful confirmation of my fears  there scarcely  remained a doubt  but still my expiring hope prompted me to inquire   to  whom did the house belong      he answered that he had not heard the name of the owner  he was a  stranger to the people on the other side of the river     were any of the inhabitants murdered     yes  all that were at home  except a girl whom they carried off  some  said that the girl had been retaken     what was the name  was it huntly     huntly  yes  no  he did not know  he had forgotten     i fixed my eyes upon the ground  an interval of gloomy meditation  succeeded  all was lost  all for whose sake i had desired to live had  perished by the hands of these assassins  that dear home  the scene of  my sportive childhood  of my studies  labours  and recreations  was  ravaged by fire and the sword   was reduced to a frightful ruin     not only all that embellished and endeared existence was destroyed  but  the means of subsistence itself  thou knowest that my sisters and i were  dependants on the bounty of our uncle  his death would make way for the  succession of his son  a man fraught with envy and malignity  who always  testified a mortal hatred to us  merely because we enjoyed the  protection of his father  the ground which furnished me with bread was  now become the property of one who  if he could have done it with  security  would gladly have mingled poison with my food     all that my imagination or my heart regarded as of value had likewise  perished  whatever my chamber  my closets  my cabinets contained  my  furniture  my books  the records of my own skill  the monuments of their  existence whom i loved  my very clothing  were involved in  indiscriminate and irretrievable destruction  why should i survive this  calamity     but did not he say that one had escaped  the only females in the family  were my sisters  one of these had been reserved for a fate worse than  death  to gratify the innate and insatiable cruelty of savages  by  suffering all the torments their invention can suggest  or to linger out  years of weary bondage and unintermitted hardship in the bosom of the  wilderness  to restore her to liberty  to cherish this last survivor of  my unfortunate race  was a sufficient motive to life and to activity     but soft  had not rumour whispered that the captive was retaken  oh  who  was her angel of deliverance  where did she now abide  weeping over the  untimely fall of her protector and her friend  lamenting and upbraiding  the absence of her brother  why should i not haste to find her   to  mingle my tears with hers  to assure her of my safety  and expatiate the  involuntary crime of my desertion by devoting all futurity to the task  of her consolation and improvement     the path was open and direct  my new motives would have trampled upon  every impediment and made me reckless of all dangers and all toils  i  broke from my reverie  and  without taking leave or expressing gratitude  to my informant  i ran with frantic expedition towards the river  and   plunging into it  gained the opposite side in a moment     i was sufficiently acquainted with the road  some twelve or fifteen  miles remained to be traversed  i did not fear that my strength would  fail in the performance of my journey  it was not my uncle s habitation  to which i directed my steps  inglefield was my friend  if my sister had  existence  or was snatched from captivity  it was here that an asylum  had been afforded to her  and here was i to seek the knowledge of my  destiny  for this reason  having reached a spot where the road divided  into two branches  one of which led to inglefield s and the other to  huntly s  i struck into the former     scarcely had i passed the angle when i noticed a building on the right  hand  at some distance from the road  in the present state of my  thoughts  it would not have attracted my attention  had not a light  gleamed from an upper window and told me that all within were not at  rest     i was acquainted with the owner of this mansion  he merited esteem and  confidence  and could not fail to be acquainted with recent events  from  him i should obtain all the information that i needed  and i should be  delivered from some part of the agonies of my suspense  i should reach  his door in a few minutes  and the window light was a proof that my  entrance at this hour would not disturb the family  some of whom were  stirring     through a gate i entered an avenue of tall oaks  that led to the house   i could not but reflect on the effect which my appearance would produce  upon the family  the sleek locks  neat apparel  pacific guise  sobriety  and gentleness of aspect by which i was customarily distinguished  would  in vain be sought in the apparition which would now present itself  before them  my legs  neck  and bosom were bare  and their native hue  was exchanged for the livid marks of bruises and scarifications  a  horrid scar upon my cheek  and my uncombed locks  hollow eyes  made  ghastly by abstinence and cold  and the ruthless passions of which my  mind had been the theatre  added to the musket which i carried in my  hand  would prepossess them with the notion of a maniac or ruffian     some inconveniences might hence arise  which  however  could not be  avoided  i must trust to the speed with which my voice and my words  should disclose my true character and rectify their mistake     i now reached the principal door of the house  it was open  and i  unceremoniously entered  in the midst of the room stood a german stove   well heated  to thaw my half frozen limbs was my first care  meanwhile i  gazed around me  and marked the appearances of things     two lighted candles stood upon the table  beside them were cider bottles  and pipes of tobacco  the furniture and room was in that state which  denoted it to have been lately filled with drinkers and smokers  yet  neither voice  nor visage  nor motion  were anywhere observable  i  listened  but neither above nor below  within nor without  could any  tokens of a human being be perceived     this vacancy and silence must have been lately preceded by noise  and  concourse  and bustle  the contrast was mysterious and ambiguous  no  adequate cause of so quick and absolute a transition occurred to me   having gained some warmth and lingered some ten or twenty minutes in  this uncertainty  i determined to explore the other apartments of the  building  i knew not what might betide in my absence  or what i might  encounter in my search to justify precaution  and  therefore  kept the  gun in my hand  i snatched a candle from the table and proceeded into  two other apartments on the first floor and the kitchen  neither was  inhabited  though chairs and tables were arranged in their usual order   and no traces of violence or hurry were apparent     having gained the foot of the staircase  i knocked  but my knocking was  wholly disregarded  a light had appeared in an upper chamber  it was  not  indeed  in one of those apartments which the family permanently  occupied  but in that which  according to rural custom  was reserved for  guests  but it indubitably betokened the presence of some being by whom  my doubts might be solved  these doubts were too tormenting to allow of  scruples and delay  i mounted the stairs     at each chamber door i knocked  but i knocked in vain  i tried to open   but found them to be locked  i at length reached the entrance of that in  which a light had been discovered  here it was certain that some one  would be found  but here  as well as elsewhere  my knocking was  unnoticed     to enter this chamber was audacious  but no other expedient was afforded  me to determine whether the house had any inhabitants  i therefore  entered  though with caution and reluctance  no one was within  but  there were sufficient traces of some person who had lately been here  on  the table stood a travelling escritoire  open  with pens and inkstand  a  chair was placed before it  and a candle on the right hand  this  apparatus was rarely seen in this country  some traveller  it seemed   occupied this room  though the rest of the mansion was deserted  the  pilgrim  as these appearances testified  was of no vulgar order  and  belonged not to the class of periodical and every day guests     it now occurred to me that the occupant of this apartment could not be  far off  and that some danger and embarrassment could not fail to accrue  from being found  thus accoutred and garbed  in a place sacred to the  study and repose of another  it was proper  therefore  to withdraw  and  either to resume my journey  or wait for the stranger s return  whom  perhaps some temporary engagement had called away  in the lower and  public room  the former now appeared to be the best expedient  as the  return of this unknown person was uncertain  as well as his power to  communicate the information which i wanted     had paper  as well as the implements of writing  lain upon the desk   perhaps my lawless curiosity would not have scrupled to have pried into  it  on the first glance nothing of that kind appeared  but now  as i  turned towards the door  somewhat  lying beside the desk  on the side  opposite the candle  caught my attention  the impulse was instantaneous  and mechanical that made me leap to the spot and lay my hand upon it   till i felt it between my fingers  till i brought it near my eyes and  read frequently the inscriptions that appeared upon it  i was doubtful  whether my senses had deceived me     few  perhaps  among mankind  have undergone vicissitudes of peril and  wonder equal to mine  the miracles of poetry  the transitions of  enchantment  are beggarly and mean compared with those which i had  experienced  passage into new forms  overleaping the bars of time and  space  reversal of the laws of inanimate and intelligent existence  had  been mine to perform and to witness     no event had been more fertile of sorrow and perplexity than the loss of  thy brother s letters  they went by means invisible  and disappeared at  a moment when foresight would have least predicted their disappearance   they now placed themselves before me  in a manner equally abrupt  in a  place and by means no less contrary to expectation  the papers which i  now seized were those letters  the parchment cover  the string that tied  and the wax that sealed them  appeared not to have been opened or  violated     the power that removed them  from my cabinet  and dropped them in this  house   a house which i rarely visited  which i had not entered during  the last year  with whose inhabitants i maintained no cordial  intercourse  and to whom my occupations and amusements  my joys and my  sorrows  were unknown   was no object even of conjecture  but they were  not possessed by any of the family  some stranger was here  by whom they  had been stolen  or into whose possession they had  by some  incomprehensible chance  fallen     that stranger was near  he had left this apartment for a moment  he  would speedily return  to go hence might possibly occasion me to miss  him  here  then  i would wait  till he should grant me an interview  the  papers were mine  and were recovered  i would never part with them  but  to know by whose force or by whose stratagems i had been bereaved of  them thus long  was now the supreme passion of my soul  i seated myself  near a table and anxiously waited for an interview  on which i was  irresistibly persuaded to believe that much of my happiness depended     meanwhile  i could not but connect this incident with the destruction of  my family  the loss of these papers had excited transports of grief  and  yet to have lost them thus was perhaps the sole expedient by which their  final preservation could be rendered possible  had they  remained in my  cabinet  they could not have escaped the destiny which overtook the  house and its furniture  savages are not accustomed to leave their  exterminating work unfinished  the house which they have plundered they  are careful to level with the ground  this not only their revenge  but  their caution  prescribes  fire may originate by accident as well as by  design  and the traces of pillage and murder are totally obliterated by  the flames     these thoughts were interrupted by the shutting of a door below  and by  footsteps ascending the stairs  my heart throbbed at the sound  my seat  became uneasy and i started on my feet  i even advanced half way to the  entrance of the room  my eyes were intensely fixed upon the door  my  impatience would have made me guess at the person of this visitant by  measuring his shadow  if his shadow were first seen  but this was  precluded by the position of the light  it was only when the figure  entered  and the whole person was seen  that my curiosity was gratified   he who stood before me was the parent and fosterer of my mind  the  companion and instructor of my youth  from whom i had been parted for  years  from whom i believed myself to be forever separated   sarsefield  himself           chapter xxiv       my deportment  at an interview so much desired and so wholly unforeseen   was that of a maniac  the petrifying influence of surprise yielded to  the impetuosities of passion  i held him in my arms  i wept upon his  bosom  i sobbed with emotion which  had it not found passage at my eyes   would have burst my heart strings  thus i  who had escaped the deaths  that had previously assailed me in so many forms  should have been  reserved to solemnize a scene like this by   dying for joy      the sterner passions and habitual austerities of my companion exempted  him from pouring out this testimony of his feelings  his feelings were   indeed  more allied to astonishment and incredulity than mine had been   my person was not instantly recognised  he shrunk from my embrace as if  i were an apparition or impostor  he quickly disengaged himself from my  arms  and  withdrawing a few paces  gazed upon me as on one whom he had  never before seen     these repulses were ascribed to the loss of his affection  i was not  mindful of the hideous guise in which i stood before him  and by which  he might justly be misled to imagine me a ruffian or a lunatic  my tears  flowed now on a new account  and i articulated  in a broken and faint  voice   my master  my friend  have you forgotten  have you ceased to  love me      the sound of my voice made him start and exclaim   am i alive  am i  awake  speak again  i beseech you  and convince me that i am not  dreaming or delirious       can you need any proof   i answered   that it is edgar huntly  your  pupil  your child  that speaks to you      he now withdrew his eyes from me and fixed them on the floor  after a  pause he resumed  in emphatic accents    well  i have lived to this age  in unbelief  to credit or trust in miraculous agency was foreign to my  nature  but now i am no longer skeptical  call me to any bar  and exact  from me an oath that you have twice been dead and twice recalled to  life  that you move about invisibly  and change your place by the force   not of muscles  but of thought  and i will give it      how came you hither  did you penetrate the wall  did you rise through  the floor      yet surely  tis an error  you could not be he whom twenty witnesses  affirmed to have beheld a lifeless and mangled corpse upon the ground   whom my own eyes saw in that condition      in seeking the spot once more to provide you a grave  you had vanished   again i met you  you plunged into a rapid stream  from a height from  which it was impossible to fall and to live  yet  as if to set the  limits of nature at defiance  to sport with human penetration  you rose  upon the surface  you floated  you swam  thirty bullets were aimed at  your head  by marksmen celebrated for the exactness of their sight  i  myself was of the number  and i never missed what i desired to hit      my predictions were confirmed by the event  you ceased to struggle  you  sunk to rise no more  and yet  after these accumulated deaths  you light  upon this floor  so far distant from the scene of your catastrophe  over  spaces only to be passed  in so short a time as has since elapsed  by  those who have wings      my eyes  my ears  bear testimony to your existence now  as they  formerly convinced me of your death  what am i to think  what proofs am  i to credit   there he stopped     every accent of this speech added to the confusion of my thoughts  the  allusions that my friend had made were not unintelligible  i gained a  glimpse of the complicated errors by which we had been mutually  deceived  i had fainted on the area before deb s hut  i was found by  sarsefield in this condition  and imagined to be dead     the man whom i had seen upon the promontory was not an indian  he  belonged to a numerous band of pursuers  whom my hostile and precipitate  deportment caused to suspect me for an enemy  they that fired from the  steep were friends  the interposition that screened me from so many  bullets was indeed miraculous  no wonder that my voluntary sinking  in  order to elude their shots  was mistaken for death  and that  having  accomplished the destruction of this foe  they resumed their pursuit of  others  but how was sarsefield apprized that it was i who plunged into  the river  no subsequent event was possible to impart to him the  incredible truth     a pause of mutual silence ensued  at length sarsefield renewed his  expressions of amazement at this interview  and besought me to explain  why i had disappeared by night from my uncle s house  and by what series  of unheard of events this interview was brought about  was it indeed  huntly whom he examined and mourned over at the threshold of deb s hut   whom he had sought in every thicket and cave in the ample circuit of  norwalk and chetasco  whom he had seen perish in the current of the  delaware     instead of noticing his questions  my soul was harrowed with anxiety  respecting the fate of my uncle and sisters  sarsefield could  communicate the tidings which would decide on my future lot and set my  portion in happiness or misery  yet i had not breath to speak my  inquiries  hope tottered  and i felt as if a single word would be  sufficient for its utter subversion  at length i articulated the name of  my uncle     the single word sufficiently imparted my fears  and these fears needed  no verbal confirmation  at that dear name my companion s features were  overspread by sorrow      your uncle   said he   is dead       dead  merciful heaven  and my sisters too  both       your sisters are alive and well       nay   resumed i  in faltering accents   jest not with my feelings  be  not cruel in your pity  tell me the truth       i have said the truth  they are well  at mr  inglefield s      my wishes were eager to assent to the truth of these tidings  the better  part of me was  then  safe  but how did they escape the fate that  overtook my uncle  how did they evade the destroying hatchet and the  midnight conflagration  these doubts were imparted in a tumultuous and  obscure manner to my friend  he no sooner fully comprehended them  than  he looked at me with some inquietude and surprise      huntly   said he   are you mad  what has filled you with these hideous  prepossessions  much havoc has indeed been committed in chetasco and the  wilderness  and a log hut has been burnt  by design or by accident  in  solesbury  but that is all  your house has not been assailed by either  firebrand or tomahawk  every thing is safe and in its ancient order  the  master indeed is gone  but the old man fell a victim to his own temerity  and hardihood  it is thirty years since he retired with three wounds  from the field of braddock  but time in no degree abated his adventurous  and military spirit  on the first alarm  he summoned his neighbours  and  led them in pursuit of the invaders  alas  he was the first to attack  them  and the only one who fell in the contest      these words were uttered in a manner that left me no room to doubt of  their truth  my uncle had already been lamented  and the discovery of  the nature of his death  so contrary to my forebodings  and of the  safety of my girls  made the state of my mind partake more of exultation  and joy than of grief or regret     but how was i deceived  had not my fusil been found in the hands of an  enemy  whence could he have plundered it but from my own chamber  it  hung against the wall of a closet  from which no stranger could have  taken it except by violence  my perplexities and doubts were not at an  end  but those which constituted my chief torment were removed  i  listened to my friend s entreaties to tell him the cause of my  elopement  and the incidents that terminated in the present interview     i began with relating my return to consciousness in the bottom of the  pit  my efforts to free myself from this abhorred prison  the acts of  horror to which i was impelled by famine  and their excruciating  consequences  my gaining the outlet of the cavern  the desperate  expedient by which i removed the impediment to my escape  and the  deliverance of the captive girl  the contest i maintained before deb s  hut  my subsequent wanderings  the banquet which hospitality afforded  me  my journey to the river bank  my meditations on the means of  reaching the road  my motives for hazarding my life by plunging into the  stream  and my subsequent perils and fears till i reached the threshold  of this habitation      thus   continued i   i have complied with your request  i have told all  that i myself know  what were the incidents between my sinking to rest  at my uncle s and my awaking in the chambers of the hill  by what means  and by whose contrivance  preternatural or human  this transition was  effected  i am unable to explain  i cannot even guess      what has eluded my sagacity may not be beyond the reach of another   your own reflections on my tale  or some facts that have fallen under  your notice  may enable you to furnish a solution  but  meanwhile  how  am i to account for your appearance on this spot  this meeting was  unexpected and abrupt to you  but it has not been less so to me  of all  mankind  sarsefield was the furthest from my thoughts when i saw these  tokens of a traveller and a stranger      you were imperfectly acquainted with my wanderings  you saw me on the  ground before deb s hut  you saw me plunge into the river  you  endeavoured to destroy me while swimming  and you knew  before my  narrative was heard  that huntly was the object of your enmity  what was  the motive of your search in the desert  and how were you apprized of my  condition  these things are not less wonderful that any of those which i  have already related      during my tale the features of sarsefield betokened the deepest  attention  his eye strayed not a moment from my face  all my perils and  forebodings were fresh in my remembrance  they had scarcely gone by   their skirts  so to speak  were still visible  no wonder that my  eloquence was vivid and pathetic  that i portrayed the past as if it  were the present scene  and that not my tongue only  but every muscle  and limb  spoke     when i had finished my relation  sarsefield sank into thoughtfulness   from this  after a time  he recovered  and said   your tale  huntly  is  true  yet  did i not see you before me  were i not acquainted with the  artlessness and rectitude of your character  and  above all  had not my  own experience  during the last three days  confirmed every incident  i  should question its truth  you have amply gratified my curiosity  and  deserve that your own should be gratified as fully  listen to me      much has happened since we parted  which shall not be now mentioned  i  promised to inform you of my welfare by letter  and did not fail to  write  but whether my letters were received  or any were written by you  in return  or if written were ever transmitted  i cannot tell  none were  ever received      some days since  i arrived  in company with a lady who is my wife  in  america  you have never been forgotten by me  i knew your situation to  be little in agreement with your wishes  and one of the benefits which  fortune has lately conferred upon me is the power of snatching you from  a life of labour and obscurity  whose goods  scanty as they are  were  transient and precarious  and affording you the suitable leisure and  means of intellectual gratification and improvement      your silence made me entertain some doubts concerning your welfare  and  even your existence  to solve these doubts  i hastened to solesbury   some delays upon the road hindered me from accomplishing my journey by  daylight  it was night before i entered the norwalk path  but my ancient  rambles with you made me familiar with it  and i was not afraid of being  obstructed or bewildered      just as i gained the southern outlet  i spied a passenger on foot   coming towards me with a quick pace  the incident was of no moment  and  yet the time of night  the seeming expedition of the walker   recollection of the mazes and obstacles which he was going to encounter   and a vague conjecture that perhaps he was unacquainted with the  difficulties that awaited him  made me eye him with attention as he  passed      he came near  and i thought i recognised a friend in this traveller   the form  the gesture  the stature  bore a powerful resemblance to those  of edgar huntly  this resemblance was so strong  that i stopped  and   after he had gone by  called him by your name  that no notice was taken  of my call proved that the person was mistaken  but  even though it were  another  that he should not even hesitate or turn at a summons which he  could not but perceive to be addressed  though erroneously  to him  was  the source of some surprise  i did not repeat my call  but proceeded on  my way      all had retired to repose in your uncle s dwelling  i did not scruple  to rouse them  and was received with affectionate and joyous greetings   that you allowed your uncle to rise before you was a new topic of  reflection  to my inquiries concerning you  answers were made that  accorded with my wishes  i was told that you were in good health and  were then in bed  that you had not heard and risen at my knocking was  mentioned with surprise  but your uncle accounted for your indolence by  saying that during the last week you had fatigued yourself by rambling   night and day  in search of some maniac or visionary who was supposed to  have retreated into norwalk      i insisted upon awakening you myself  i anticipated the effect of this  sudden and unlooked for meeting with some emotions of pride as well as  of pleasure  to find  in opening your eyes  your old preceptor standing  by your bedside and gazing in your face  would place you  i conceived   in an affecting situation      your chamber door was open  but your bed was empty  your uncle and  sisters were made acquainted with this circumstance  their surprise gave  way to conjectures that your restless and romantic spirit had tempted  you from your repose  that you had rambled abroad on some fantastic  errand  and would probably return before the dawn  i willingly  acquiesced in this opinion  and  my feelings being too thoroughly  aroused to allow me to sleep  i took possession of your chamber and  patiently awaited your return      the morning returned  but huntly made not his appearance  your uncle  became somewhat uneasy at this unseasonable absence  much speculation  and inquiry as to the possible reasons of your flight was made  in my  survey of your chamber  i noted that only part of your clothing remained  beside your bed  coat  hat  stockings and shoes lay upon the spot where  they had probably been thrown when you had disrobed yourself  but the  pantaloons  which  according to mr  huntly s report  completed your  dress  were nowhere to be found  that you should go forth on so cold a  night so slenderly apparelled  was almost incredible  your reason or  your senses had deserted you  before so rash an action could be  meditated      i now remembered the person i had met in norwalk  his resemblance to  your figure  his garb  which wanted hat  coat  stockings and shoes  and  your absence from your bed at that hour  were remarkable coincidences   but why did you disregard my call  your name  uttered by a voice that  could not be unknown  was surely sufficient to arrest your steps      each hour added to the impatience of your friends  to their  recollections and conjectures i listened with a view to extract from  them some solution of this mystery  at length a story was alluded to of  some one who  on the preceding night  had been heard walking in the long  room  to this was added the tale of your anxieties and wonders  occasioned by the loss of certain manuscripts      while ruminating upon these incidents  and endeavouring to extract from  this intelligence a clue explanatory of your present situation  a single  word  casually dropped by your uncle  instantly illuminated my darkness  and dispelled my doubts    after all   said the old man   ten to one but  edgar himself was the man whom we heard walking  but the lad was asleep   and knew not what he was about        surely   said i   this inference is just  his manuscripts could not be  removed by any hands but his own  since the rest of mankind were  unacquainted not only with the place of their concealment  but with  their existence  none but a man insane or asleep would wander forth so  slightly dressed  and none but a sleeper would have disregarded my  calls   this conclusion was generally adopted  but it gave birth in my  mind to infinite inquietudes  you had roved into norwalk  a scene of  inequalities  of prominences and pits  among which  thus destitute of  the guidance of your senses  you could scarcely fail to be destroyed   or  at least  irretrievably bewildered  i painted to myself the dangers  to which you were subjected  your careless feet would bear you into some  whirlpool or to the edge of some precipice  some internal revolution or  outward shock would recall you to consciousness at some perilous moment   surprise and fear would disable you from taking seasonable or suitable  precautions  and your destruction be made sure      the lapse of every new hour  without bringing tidings of your state   enhanced these fears  at length the propriety of searching for you  occurred  mr  huntly and i determined to set out upon this pursuit  as  well as to commission others  a plan was laid by which every accessible  part of norwalk  the wilderness beyond the flats of solesbury  and the  valley of chetasco  should be traversed and explored      scarcely had we equipped ourselves for this expedition  when a  messenger arrived  who brought the disastrous news of indians being seen  within these precincts  and on the last night a farmer was shot in his  fields  a dwelling in chetasco was burnt to the ground  and its  inhabitants murdered or made captives  rumour and inquiry had been busy   and a plausible conjecture had been formed as to the course and number  of the enemies  they were said to be divided into bands  and to amount  in the whole to thirty or forty warriors  this messenger had come to  warn us of danger which might impend  and to summon us to join in the  pursuit and extirpation of these detestable foes      your uncle  whose alacrity and vigour age had not abated  eagerly  engaged in this scheme  i was not averse to contribute my efforts to an  end like this  the road which we had previously designed to take  in  search of my fugitive pupil  was the same by which we must trace or  intercept the retreat of the savages  thus two purposes  equally  momentous  would be answered by the same means      mr  huntly armed himself with your fusil  inglefield supplied me with a  gun  during our absence the dwelling was closed and locked  and your  sisters placed under the protection of inglefield  whose age and pacific  sentiments unfitted him for arduous and sanguinary enterprises  a troop  of rustics was collected  half of whom remained to traverse solesbury   and the other  whom mr  huntly and i accompanied  hastened to chetasco            chapter xxv        it was noonday before we reached the theatre of action  fear and  revenge combined to make the people of chetasco diligent and zealous in  their own defence  the havoc already committed had been mournful  to  prevent a repetition of the same calamities  they resolved to hunt out  the hostile footsteps and exact a merciless retribution      it was likely that the enemy  on the approach of day  had withdrawn  from the valley and concealed themselves in the thickets between the  parallel ridges of the mountain  this space  which  according to the  object with which it is compared  is either a vale or the top of a hill   was obscure and desolate  it was undoubtedly the avenue by which the  robbers had issued forth  and by which they would escape to the ohio   here they might still remain  intending to emerge from their concealment  on the next night and perpetrate new horrors      a certain distribution was made of our number  so as to move in all  directions at the same time  i will not dwell upon particulars  it will  suffice to say that keen eyes and indefatigable feet brought us at last  to the presence of the largest number of these marauders  seven of them  were slain by the edge of a brook  where they sat wholly unconscious of  the danger which hung over them  five escaped  and one of these secured  his retreat by wresting your fusil from your uncle and shooting him  dead  before our companion could be rescued or revenged  the assassin   with the remnant of the troop  disappeared  and bore away with him the  fusil as a trophy of his victory      this disaster was deplored  not only on account of that life which had  thus been sacrificed  but because a sagacious guide and intrepid leader  was lost  his acquaintance with the habits of the indians  and his  experience in their wars  made him trace their footsteps with more  certainty than any of his associates      the pursuit was still continued  and parties were so stationed that the  escape of the enemy was difficult  if not impossible  our search was  unremitted  but  during twelve or fourteen hours  unsuccessful  queen  mab did not elude all suspicion  her hut was visited by different  parties  but the old woman and her dogs had disappeared      meanwhile your situation was not forgotten  every one was charged to  explore your footsteps as well as those of the savages  but this search  was no less unsuccessful than the former  none had heard of you or seen  you      this continued till midnight  three of us made a pause at a brook  and  intended to repair our fatigues by a respite of a few hours  but  scarcely had we stretched ourselves on the ground when we were alarmed  by a shot which seemed to have been fired at a short distance  we  started on our feet and consulted with each other on the measures to be  taken  a second  a third  and a fourth shot  from the same quarter   excited our attention anew  mab s hut was known to stand at the distance  and in the direction of this sound  and thither we resolved to repair      this was done with speed  but with the utmost circumspection  we  shortly gained the road that leads near this hut  and at length gained a  view of the building  many persons were discovered  in a sort of  bustling inactivity  before the hut  they were easily distinguished to  be friends  and were therefore approached without scruple      the objects that presented themselves to a nearer view were five bodies  stretched upon the ground  three of them were savages  the fourth was a  girl  who  though alive  seemed to have received a mortal wound  the  fifth  breathless and mangled  and his features almost concealed by the  blood that overspread his face  was edgar   the fugitive for whom i had  made such anxious search      about the same hour on the last night i had met you hastening into  norwalk  now were you lying in the midst of savages  at the distance of  thirty miles from your home  and in a spot which it was impossible for  you to have reached unless by an immense circuit over rocks and  thickets  that you had found a rift at the basis of a hill  and thus  penetrated its solidities  and thus precluded so tedious and circuitous  a journey as must otherwise have been made  was not to be imagined      but whence arose this scene  it was obvious to conclude that my  associates had surprised their enemies in this house  and exacted from  them the forfeit of their crimes  but how you should have been  confounded with their foes  or whence came the wounded girl  was a  subject of astonishment      you will judge how much this surprise was augmented when i was informed  that the party whom we found had been attracted hither by the same  signals by which we had been alarmed  that on reaching this spot you had  been discovered  alive  seated on the ground  and still sustaining the  gun with which you had apparently completed the destruction of so many  adversaries  in a moment after their arrival you sunk down and expired      this scene was attended with inexplicable circumstances  the musket  which lay beside you appeared to have belonged to one of the savages   the wound by which each had died was single  of the four shots we had  distinguished at a distance  three of them were therefore fatal to the  indians  and the fourth was doubtless that by which you had fallen  yet  three muskets only were discoverable      the arms were collected  and the girl carried to the nearest house in  the arms of her father  her situation was deemed capable of remedy  and  the sorrow and wonder which i felt at your untimely and extraordinary  fate did not hinder me from endeavouring to restore the health of this  unfortunate victim  i reflected  likewise  that some light might be  thrown upon transactions so mysterious by the information which might be  collected from her story  numberless questions and hints were necessary  to extract from her a consistent or intelligible tale  she had been  dragged  it seems  for miles  at the heels of her conquerors  who at  length stopped in a cavern for the sake of some repose  all slept but  one  who sat and watched  something called him away  and  at the same  moment  you appeared at the bottom of the cave  half naked and without  arms  you instantly supplied the last deficiency by seizing the gun and  tomahawk of him who had gone forth  and who had negligently left his  weapons behind  then  stepping over the bodies of the sleepers  you  rushed out of the cavern      she then mentioned your unexpected return  her deliverance and flight   and arrival at deb s hut  you watched upon the hearth  and she fell  asleep upon the blanket  from this sleep she was aroused by violent and  cruel blows  she looked up  you were gone  and the bed on which she lay  was surrounded by the men from whom she had so lately escaped  one  dragged her out of the hut and levelled his gun at her breast  at the  moment when he touched the trigger  a shot came from an unknown quarter   and he fell at her feet  of subsequent events she had an incoherent  recollection  the indians were successively slain  and you came to her   and interrogated and consoled her      in your journey to the hut you were armed  this in some degree  accounted for appearances  but where were your arms  three muskets only  were discovered  and these undoubtedly belonged to your enemies      i now had leisure to reflect upon your destiny  i had arrived soon  enough on this shore merely to witness the catastrophe of two beings  whom i most loved  both were overtaken by the same fate  nearly at the  same hour  the same hand had possibly accomplished the destruction of  uncle and nephew      now  however  i began to entertain a hope that your state might not be  irretrievable  you had walked and spoken after the firing had ceased and  your enemies had ceased to contend with you  a wound had  no doubt  been  previously received  i had hastily inferred that the wound was mortal   and that life could not be recalled  occupied with attention to the  wailings of the girl  and full of sorrow and perplexity  i had admitted  an opinion which would have never been adopted in different  circumstances  my acquaintance with wounds would have taught me to  regard sunken muscles  lividness  and cessation of the pulse  as mere  indications of a swoon  and not as tokens of death      perhaps my error was not irreparable  by hastening to the hut  i might  ascertain your condition  and at least transport your remains to some  dwelling and finally secure to you the decencies of burial      of twelve savages discovered on the preceding day  ten were now killed   two at least remained  after whom the pursuit was still zealously  maintained  attention to the wounded girl had withdrawn me from the  party  and i had now leisure to return to the scene of these disasters   the sun had risen  and  accompanied by two others  i repaired thither      a sharp turn in the road  at the entrance of a field  set before us a  startling spectacle  an indian  mangled by repeated wounds of bayonet  and bullet  was discovered  his musket was stuck in the ground  by way  of beacon attracting our attention to the spot  over this space i had  gone a few hours before  and nothing like this was then seen  the  parties abroad had hied away to a distant quarter  some invisible power  seemed to be enlisted in our defence and to preclude the necessity of  our arms      we proceeded to the hut  the savages were there  but edgar had risen  and flown  nothing now seemed to be incredible  you had slain three  foes  and the weapon with which the victory had been achieved had  vanished  you had risen from the dead  had assailed one of the surviving  enemies  had employed bullet and dagger in his destruction  with both of  which you could only be supplied by supernatural means  and had  disappeared  if any inhabitant of chetasco had done this  we should have  heard of it      but what remained  you were still alive  your strength was sufficient  to bear you from this spot  why were you still invisible  and to what  dangers might you not be exposed before you could disinvolve yourself  from the mazes of this wilderness      once more i procured indefatigable search to be made after you  it was  continued till the approach of evening  and was fruitless  inquiries  were twice made at the house where you were supplied with food and  intelligence  on the second call i was astonished and delighted by the  tidings received from the good woman  your person  and demeanour  and  arms  were described  and mention made of your resolution to cross the  southern ridge and traverse the solesbury road with the utmost  expedition      the greater part of my inquietudes were now removed  you were able to  eat and to travel  and there was little doubt that a meeting would take  place between us on the next morning  meanwhile  i determined to concur  with those who pursued the remainder of the enemy  i followed you  in  the path that you were said to have taken  and quickly joined a numerous  party who were searching for those who  on the last night  had attacked  a plantation that lies near this  and destroyed the inhabitants      i need not dwell upon our doublings and circuities  the enemy was  traced to the house of selby  they had entered  they had put fire on the  floor  but were compelled to relinquish their prey  of what number they  consisted could not be ascertained  but one  lingering behind his  fellows  was shot  at the entrance of the wood  and on the spot where  you chanced to light upon him      selby s house was empty  and before the fire had made any progress we  extinguished it  the drunken wretch whom you encountered had probably  returned from his nocturnal debauch after we had left the spot      the flying enemy was pursued with fresh diligence  they were found  by  various tokens  to have crossed the river  and to have ascended the  mountain  we trod closely on their heels  when we arrived at the  promontory described by you  the fatigues of the night and day rendered  me unqualified to proceed  i determined that this should be the bound of  my excursions  i was anxious to obtain an interview with you  and   unless i paused here  should not be able to gain inglefield s as early  in the morning as i wished  two others concurred with me in this  resolution  and prepared to return to this house  which had been  deserted by its tenants till the danger was past  and which had been  selected as the place of rendezvous      at this moment  dejected and weary  i approached the ledge which  severed the headland from the mountain  i marked the appearance of some  one stretched upon the ground where you lay  no domestic animal would  wander hither and place himself upon this spot  there was something  likewise in the appearance of the object that bespoke it to be man  but   if it were man  it was incontrovertibly a savage and a foe  i  determined  therefore  to rouse you by a bullet      my decision was perhaps absurd  i ought to have gained more certainty  before i hazarded your destruction  be that as it will  a moment s  lingering on your part would have probably been fatal  you started on  your feet  and fired  see the hole which your random shot made through  my sleeve  this surely was a day destined to be signalized by  hairbreadth escapes      your action seemed incontestably to confirm my prognostics  every one  hurried to the spot and was eager to destroy an enemy  no one hesitated  to believe that some of the shots aimed at you had reached their mark   and that you had sunk to rise no more      the gun which was fired and thrown down was taken and examined  it had  been my companion in many a toilsome expedition  it had rescued me and  my friends from a thousand deaths  in order to recognise it  i needed  only to touch and handle it  i instantly discovered that i held in my  hand the fusil which i had left with you on parting  with which your  uncle had equipped himself  and which had been ravished from him by a  savage  what was i hence to infer respecting the person of the last  possessor      my inquiries respecting you  of the woman whose milk and bread you had  eaten  were minute  you entered  she said  with a hatchet and gun in  your hand  while you ate  the gun was laid upon the table  she sat near   and the piece became the object of inquisitive attention  the stock and  barrels were described by her in such terms as left no doubt that this  was the  fusil       a comparison of incidents enabled me to trace the manner in which you  came into possession of this instrument  one of those whom you found in  the cavern was the assassin of your uncle  according to the girl s  report  on issuing from your hiding place you seized a gun that was  unoccupied  and this gun chanced to be your own      its two barrels were probably the cause of your success in that unequal  contest at mab s hut  on recovering from  deliquium   you found it where  it had been dropped by you  out of sight and unsuspected by the party  that had afterwards arrived  in your passage to the river  had it once  more fallen into hostile hands  or had you missed the way  wandered to  this promontory  and mistaken a troop of friends for a band of indian  marauders      either supposition was dreadful  the latter was the most plausible  no  motives were conceivable by which one of the fugitives could be induced  to post himself here  in this conspicuous station  whereas  the road  which led you to the summit of the hill  to that spot where descent to  the river road was practicable  could not be found but by those who were  accustomed to traverse it  the directions which you had exacted from  your hostess proved your previous unacquaintance with these tracts      i acquiesced in this opinion with a heavy and desponding heart  fate  had led us into a maze which could only terminate in the destruction of  one or of the other  by the breadth of a hair had i escaped death from  your hand  the same fortune had not befriended you  after my tedious  search  i had lighted on you  forlorn  bewildered  perishing with cold  and hunger  instead of recognising and affording you relief  i compelled  you to leap into the river  from a perilous height  and had desisted  from my persecution only when i had bereaved you of life and plunged you  to the bottom of the gulf      my motives in coming to america were numerous and mixed  among these  was the parental affection with which you had inspired me  i came with  fortune  and a better gift than fortune  in my hand  i intended to  bestow both upon you  not only to give you competence  but one who would  endear to you that competence  who would enhance  by participating   every gratification      my schemes were now at an end  you were gone  beyond the reach of my  benevolence and justice  i had robbed your two sisters of a friend and  guardian  it was some consolation to think that it was in my power to  stand  with regard to them  in your place  that i could snatch them from  the poverty  dependence  and humiliation  to which your death and that  of your uncle had reduced them      i was now doubly weary of the enterprise in which i was engaged  and  returned with speed to this rendezvous  my companions have gone to know  the state of the family who resided under this roof  and left me to  beguile the tedious moments in whatever manner i pleased      i have omitted mentioning one incident that happened between the  detection of your flight and our expedition to chetasco  having formed a  plausible conjecture as to him who walked in the long room  it was  obvious to conclude that he who purloined your manuscript  and the  walker  was the same personage  it was likewise easily inferred that the  letters were secreted in the cedar chest or in some other part of the  room  instances similar to this have heretofore occurred  men have  employed anxious months in search of that which  in a freak of  noctambulation  was hidden by their own hands      a search was immediately commenced  and your letters were found   carefully concealed between the rafters and shingles of the roof  in a  spot where  if suspicion had not been previously excited  they would  have remained till the vernal rains and the summer heats had insensibly  destroyed them  this packet i carried with me  knowing the value which  you set upon it  and there being no receptacle equally safe but your own  cabinet  which was locked      having  as i said  reached this house  and being left alone  i  bethought me of the treasure i possessed  i was unacquainted with the  reasons for which these papers were so precious  they probably had some  momentous and intimate connection with your own history  as such  they  could not be of little value to me  and this moment of inoccupation and  regrets was as suitable as any other to the task of perusing them  i  drew them forth  therefore  and laid them on the table in this chamber      the rest is known to you  during a momentary absence you entered   surely no interview of ancient friends ever took place in so unexpected  and abrupt a manner  you were dead  i mourned for you  as one whom i  loved  and whom fate had snatched forever from my sight  now  in a  blissful hour  you had risen  and my happiness in thus embracing you is  tenfold greater than would have been experienced if no uncertainties and  perils had protracted our meeting            chapter xxvi       here ended the tale of sarsefield  humiliation and joy were mingled in  my heart  the events that preceded my awakening in the cave were now  luminous and plain  what explication was more obvious  what but this  solution ought to have been suggested by the conduct i had witnessed in  clithero     clithero  was not this the man whom clithero had robbed of his friend   was not this the lover of mrs  lorimer  the object of the persecutions  of wiatte  was it not now given me to investigate the truth of that  stupendous tale  to dissipate the doubts which obstinately clung to my  imagination respecting it     but soft  had not sarsefield said that he was married  was mrs  lorimer  so speedily forgotten by him  or was the narrative of clithero the web  of imposture or the raving of insanity     these new ideas banished all personal considerations from my mind  i  looked eagerly into the face of my friend  and exclaimed  in a dubious  accent   how say you  married  when  to whom       yes  huntly  i am wedded to the most excellent of women  to her am i  indebted for happiness  and wealth  and dignity  and honour  to her do i  owe the power of being the benefactor and protector of you and your  sisters  she longs to embrace you as a son  to become truly her son will  depend upon your own choice  and that of one who was the companion of  our voyage       heavens   cried i  in a transport of exultation and astonishment   of  whom do you speak  of the mother of clarice  the sister of wiatte  the  sister of the ruffian who laid snares for her life  who pursued you and  the unhappy clithero with the bitterest animosity      my friend started at these sounds as if the earth had yawned at his  feet  his countenance was equally significant of terror and rage  as  soon as he regained the power of utterance  he spoke    clithero  curses  light upon thy lips for having uttered that detested name  thousands of  miles have i flown to shun the hearing of it  is the madman here  have  you set eyes upon him  does he yet crawl upon the face of the earth   unhappy  unparalleled  unheard of  thankless miscreant  has he told his  execrable falsehoods here  has he dared to utter names so sacred as  those of euphemia lorimer and clarice       he has  he has told a tale that had all the appearances of truth          out upon the villain  the truth  truth would prove him to be unnatural   devilish  a thing for which no language has yet provided a name  he has  called himself unhappy  no doubt  a victim to injustice  overtaken by  unmerited calamity  say  has he fooled thee with such tales       no  his tale was a catalogue of crimes and miseries of which he was the  author and sufferer  you know not his motives  his horrors            his deeds were monstrous and infernal  his motives were sordid and  flagitious  to display all their ugliness and infamy was not his  province  no  he did not tell you that he stole at midnight to the  chamber of his mistress  a woman who astonished the world by her  loftiness and magnanimity  by indefatigable beneficence and unswerving  equity  who had lavished on this wretch  whom she snatched from the  dirt  all the goods of fortune  all the benefits of education  all the  treasures of love  every provocation to gratitude  every stimulant to  justice      he did not tell you that  in recompense for every benefit  he stole  upon her sleep and aimed a dagger at her breast  there was no room for  flight  or ambiguity  or prevarication  she whom he meant to murder  stood near  saw the lifted weapon  and heard him confess and glory in  his purposes      no wonder that the shock bereft her  for a time  of life  the interval  was seized by the ruffian to effect his escape  the rebukes of justice  were shunned by a wretch conscious of his inexpiable guilt  these things  he has hidden from you  and has supplied their place by a tale specious  as false       no  among the number of his crimes  hypocrisy is not to be numbered   these things are already known to me  he spared himself too little in  the narrative  the excellencies of his lady  her claims to gratitude and  veneration  were urged beyond their true bounds  his attempts upon her  life were related  it is true that he desired and endeavoured to destroy  her       how  has he told you this       he has told me all  alas  the criminal intention has been amply  expiated       what mean you  whence and how came he hither  where is he now  i will  not occupy the same land  the same world  with him  have this woman and  her daughter lighted on the shore haunted by this infernal and  implacable enemy       alas  it is doubtful whether he exists  if he lives  he is no longer to  be feared  but he lives not  famine and remorse have utterly consumed  him       famine  remorse  you talk in riddles       he has immured himself in the desert  he has abjured the intercourse of  mankind  he has shut himself in caverns where famine must inevitably  expedite that death for which he longs as the only solace of his woes   to no imagination are his offences blacker and more odious than to his  own  i had hopes of rescuing him from this fate  but my own infirmities  and errors have afforded me sufficient occupation      sarsefield renewed his imprecations on the memory of that unfortunate  man  and his inquiries as to the circumstances that led him into this  remote district  his inquiries were not to be answered by one in my  present condition  my languors and fatigues had now gained a pitch that  was insupportable  the wound in my face had been chafed and inflamed by  the cold water and the bleak air  and the pain attending it would no  longer suffer my attention to stray  i sunk upon the floor  and  entreated him to afford me the respite of a few hours  repose     he was sensible of the deplorableness of my condition  and chid himself  for the negligence of which he had already been guilty  he lifted me to  the bed  and deliberated on the mode he should pursue for my relief   some mollifying application to my wound was immediately necessary  but   in our present lonely condition  it was not at hand  it could only be  procured from a distance  it was proper therefore to hasten to the  nearest inhabited dwelling  which belonged to one by name walton  and  supply himself with such medicines as could be found     meanwhile  there was no danger of molestation and intrusion  there was  reason to expect the speedy return of those who had gone in pursuit of  the savages  this was their place of rendezvous  and hither they  appointed to reassemble before the morrow s dawn  the distance of the  neighbouring farm was small  and sarsefield promised to be expeditious   he left me to myself and my own ruminations     harassed by fatigue and pain  i had yet power to ruminate on that series  of unparalleled events that had lately happened  i wept  but my tears  flowed from a double source  from sorrow  on account of the untimely  fate of my uncle  and from joy  that my sisters were preserved  that  sarsefield had returned and was not unhappy     i reflected on the untoward destiny of clithero  part of his calamity  consisted in the consciousness of having killed his patroness  but it  now appeared  though by some infatuation i had not previously suspected   that the first impulse of sorrow in the lady had been weakened by  reflection and by time  that the prejudice persuading her that her life  and that of her brother were to endure and to terminate together was  conquered by experience or by argument  she had come  in company with  sarsefield and clarice  to america  what influence might these events  have upon the gloomy meditations of clithero  was it possible to bring  them together  to win the maniac from his solitude  wrest from him his  fatal purposes  and restore him to communion with the beings whose  imagined indignation is the torment of his life     these musings were interrupted by a sound from below  which was easily  interpreted into tokens of the return of those with whom sarsefield had  parted at the promontory  voices were confused and busy  but not  turbulent  they entered the lower room  and the motion of chairs and  tables showed that they were preparing to rest themselves after their  toils     few of them were unacquainted with me  since they probably were  residents in this district  no inconvenience  therefore  would follow  from an interview  though  on their part  wholly unexpected  besides   sarsefield would speedily return  and none of the present visitants  would be likely to withdraw to this apartment     meanwhile  i lay upon the bed  with my face turned towards the door  and  languidly gazing at the ceiling and walls  just then a musket was  discharged in the room below  the shock affected me mechanically  and  the first impulse of surprise made me almost start upon my feet     the sound was followed by confusion and bustle  some rushed forth and  called on each other to run different ways  and the words   that is  he     stop him   were spoken in a tone of eagerness and rage  my  weakness and pain were for a moment forgotten  and my whole attention  was bent to discover the meaning of this hubbub  the musket which i had  brought with me to this chamber lay across the bed  unknowing of the  consequences of this affray with regard to myself  i was prompted  by a  kind of self preserving instinct  to lay hold of the gun and prepare to  repel any attack that might be made upon me     a few moments elapsed  when i thought i heard light footsteps in the  entry leading to this room  i had no time to construe these signals   but  watching fearfully the entrance  i grasped my weapon with new  force  and raised it so as to be ready at the moment of my danger  i did  not watch long  a figure cautiously thrust itself forward  the first  glance was sufficient to inform me that this intruder was an indian   and  of consequence  an enemy  he was unarmed  looking eagerly on all  sides  he at last spied me as i lay  my appearance threw him into  consternation  and  after the fluctuation of an instant  he darted to  the window  threw up the sash  and leaped out upon the ground     his flight might have been easily arrested by my shot  but surprise   added to my habitual antipathy to bloodshed unless in cases of absolute  necessity  made me hesitate  he was gone  and i was left to mark the  progress of the drama  the silence was presently broken by firing at a  distance  three shots  in quick succession  were followed by the deepest  pause     that the party  recently arrived  had brought with them one or more  captives  and that by some sudden effort the prisoners had attempted to  escape  was the only supposition that i could form  by wrhat motives  either of them could be induced to seek concealment in my chamber could  not be imagined     i now heard a single step on the threshold below  some one entered the  common room  he traversed the floor during a few minutes  and then   ascending the staircase  he entered my chamber  it was sarsefield   trouble and dismay were strongly written on his countenance  he seemed  totally unconscious of my presence  his eyes were fixed upon the floor   and  as he continued to move across the room  he heaved forth deep  sighs     this deportment was mournful and mysterious  it was little in unison  with those appearances which he wore at our parting  and must have been  suggested by some event that had since happened  my curiosity impelled  me to recall him from his reverie  i rose  and  seizing him by the arm   looked at him with an air of inquisitive anxiety  it was needless to  speak     he noticed my movement  and  turning towards me  spoke in a tone of some  resentment    why did you deceive me  did you not say clithero was  dead       i said so because it was my belief  know you any thing to the contrary   heaven grant that he is still alive  and that our mutual efforts may  restore him to peace       heaven grant   replied my friend  with a vehemence that bordered upon  fury    heaven grant that he may live thousands of years  and know not   in their long course  a moment s respite from remorse and from anguish   but this prayer is fruitless  he is not dead  but death hovers over him   should he live  he will live only to defy justice and perpetrate new  horrors  my skill might perhaps save him  but a finger shall not be  moved to avert his fate      little did i think that the wretch whom my friends rescued from the  power of the savages  and brought wounded and expiring hither  was  clithero  they sent for me in haste to afford him surgical assistance  i  found him stretched upon the floor below  deserted  helpless  and  bleeding  the moment i beheld him  he was recognised  the last of evils  was to look upon the face of this assassin  but that evil is past  and  shall never be endured again      rise  and come with me  accommodation is prepared for you at walcot s   let us leave this house  and  the moment you are able to perform a  journey  abandon forever this district      i could not readily consent to this proposal  clithero had been  delivered from captivity  but was dying for want of that aid which  sarsefield was able to afford  was it not inhuman to desert him in this  extremity  what offence had he committed that deserved such implacable  vengeance  nothing i had heard from sarsefield was in contradiction to  his own story  his deed  imperfectly observed  would appear to be  atrocious and detestable  but the view of all its antecedent and  accompanying events and motives would surely place it in the list  not  of crimes  but of misfortunes     but wrhat is that guilt which no penitence can expiate  had not  clithero s remorse been more than adequate to crimes far more deadly and  enormous than this  this  however  was no time to argue with the  passions of sarsefield  nothing but a repetition of clithero s tale  could vanquish his prepossessions and mollify his rage  but this  repetition was impossible to be given by me  till a moment of safety and  composure     these thoughts made me linger  but hindered me from attempting to change  the determination of my friend  he renewed his importunities for me to  fly with him  he dragged me by the arm  and  wavering and reluctant  i  followed where he chose to lead  he crossed the common room  with  hurried steps  and eyes averted from a figure which instantly fastened  my attention     it was indeed clithero whom i now beheld  supine  polluted with blood   his eyes closed  and apparently insensible  this object was gazed at  with emotions that rooted me to the spot  sarsefield  perceiving me  determined to remain where i was  rushed out of the house  and  disappeared           chapter xxvii       i hung over the unhappy wretch  whose emaciated form and rueful features  sufficiently bespoke that savage hands had only completed that  destruction which his miseries had begun  he was mangled by the tomahawk  in a shocking manner  and there was little hope that human skill could  save his life     i was sensible of nothing but compassion  i acted without design  when   seating myself on the floor  i raised his head and placed it on my  knees  this movement awakened his attention  and  opening his eyes  he  fixed them on my countenance  they testified neither insensibility  nor  horror  nor distraction  a faint emotion of surprise gave way to an  appearance of tranquillity  having perceived these tokens of a state  less hopeless than i at first imagined  i spoke to him    my friend  how  do you feel  can any thing be done for you      he answered me in a tone more firm and with more coherence of ideas  than previous appearances had taught me to expect   no   said he   thy  kindness  good youth  can avail me nothing  the end of my existence here  is at hand  may my guilt be expiated by the miseries that i have  suffered  and my good deeds only attend me to the presence of my divine  judge      i am waiting  not with trembling or dismay  for this close of my  sorrows  i breathed but one prayer  and that prayer has been answered  i  asked for an interview with thee  young man  but  feeling as i now feel   this interview  so much desired  was beyond my hope  now thou art come   in due season  to hear the last words that i shall need to utter      i wanted to assure thee that thy efforts for my benefit were not  useless  they have saved me from murdering myself  a guilt more  inexpiable than any which it was in my power to commit      i retired to the innermost recess of norwalk  and gained the summit of  a hill  by subterranean paths  this hill i knew to be on all sides  inaccessible to human footsteps  and the subterranean passages were  closed up by stones  here i believed my solitude exempt from  interruption  and my death  in consequence of famine  sure      this persuasion was not taken away by your appearance on the opposite  steep  the chasm which severed us i knew to be impassable  i withdrew  from your sight      some time after  awakening from a long sleep  i found victuals beside  me  he that brought it was invisible  for a time  i doubted whether some  messenger of heaven had not interposed for my salvation  how other than  by supernatural means my retreat should be explored  i was unable to  conceive  the summit was encompassed by dizzy and profound gulfs  and  the subterranean passages were still closed      this opinion  though corrected by subsequent reflection  tended to  change the course of my desperate thoughts  my hunger  thus  importunately urged  would not abstain  and i ate of the food that was  provided  henceforth i determined to live  to resume the path of  obscurity and labour which i had relinquished  and wait till my god  should summon me to retribution  to anticipate his call is only to  redouble our guilt      i designed not to return to inglefield s service  but to choose some  other and remoter district  meanwhile  i had left in his possession a  treasure  which my determination to die had rendered of no value  but  which my change of resolution restored  enclosed in a box at  inglefield s were the memoirs of euphemia lorimer  by which  in all my  vicissitudes  i had been hitherto accompanied  and from which i  consented to part only because i had refused to live  my existence was  now to be prolonged  and this manuscript was once more to constitute the  torment and the solace of my being      i hastened to inglefield s by night  there was no need to warn him of  my purpose  i desired that my fate should be an eternal secret to my  ancient master and his neighbours  the apartment containing my box was  well known  and easily accessible      the box was found  but broken and rifled of its treasure  my transports  of astonishment  and indignation  and grief  yielded to the resumption  of my fatal purpose  i hastened back to the hill  and determined anew to  perish      this mood continued to the evening of the ensuing day  wandering over  rocks and pits  i discovered the manuscript lying under a jutting  precipice  the chance that brought it hither was not less propitious and  miraculous than that by which i had been supplied with food  it produced  a similar effect upon my feelings  and  while in possession of this  manuscript  i was reconciled to the means of life  i left the mountain   and  traversing the wilderness  stopped in chetasco  that kind of  employment which i sought was instantly procured  but my new vocation  was scarcely assumed when a band of savages invaded our security      rambling in the desert by moonlight  i encountered these foes  they  rushed upon me  and  after numerous wounds  which for the present  neither killed nor disabled me  they compelled me to keep pace with them  in their retreat  some hours have passed since the troop was overtaken  and my liberty redeemed  hardships  and repeated wounds  inflicted at  the moment when the invaders were surprised and slain  have brought me  to my present condition  i rejoice that my course is about to  terminate      here the speaker was interrupted by the tumultuous entrance of the party  by whom he had been brought hither  their astonishment at seeing me  sustaining the head of the dying man may be easily conceived  their  surprise was more strongly excited by the disappearance of the captive  whom they had left in this apartment  bound hand and foot  it now  appeared that  of the savage troop who had adventured thus far in search  of pillage and blood  all had been destroyed but two  who had been led  hither as prisoners  on their entrance into this house  one of the party  had been sent to walcot s to summon sarsefield to the aid of the wounded  man  while others had gone in search of cords to secure the arms and  legs of the captives  who had hitherto been manacled imperfectly     the cords were brought and one of them was bound  but the other  before  the same operation was begun upon him  broke  by a sudden effort  the  feeble ligatures by which he was at present constrained  and  seizing a  musket that lay near him  fired on his enemies  and then rushed out of  doors  all eagerly engaged in the pursuit  the savage was fleet as a  deer  and finally eluded his pursuers     while their attention was thus engaged abroad  he that remained found  means to extricate his wrists and ankles from his bonds  and  betaking  himself to the stairs  escaped  as i before described  through the  window of the room which i had occupied  they pestered me with their  curiosity and wonder  for i was known to all of them  but  waiving the  discussion of my own concerns  i entreated their assistance to carry  clithero to the chamber and the bed which i had just deserted     i now  in spite of pain  fatigue  and watchfulness  set out to go to  walton s  sarsefield was ready to receive me at the door  and the  kindness and compassion of the family were active in my behalf  i was  conducted to a chamber and provided with suitable attendance and  remedies     i was not unmindful of the more deplorable condition of clithero  i  incessantly meditated on the means for his relief  his case stood in  need of all the vigilance and skill of a physician  and sarsefield was  the only one of that profession whose aid could be seasonably  administered  sarsefield  therefore  must be persuaded to bestow this  aid     there was but one mode of conquering his abhorrence of this man   to  prepossess my friend with the belief of the innocence of clithero  or to  soothe him into pity by a picture of remorse and suffering  this could  be done  and in the manner most conformable to truth  by a simple  recital of the incidents that had befallen  and by repeating the  confession which had been extorted from clithero     i requested all but my friend to leave my chamber  and then  soliciting  a patient hearing  began the narrative of waldegrave s death  of the  detection of clithero beneath the shade of the elm  of the suspicions  which were thence produced  and of the forest interview to which these  suspicions gave birth  i then repeated  without variation or addition   the tale which was then told  i likewise mentioned my subsequent  transactions in norwalk  so far as they illustrated the destiny of  clithero     during this recital  i fixed my eyes upon the countenance of sarsefield   and watched every emotion as it arose or declined  with the progress of  my tale  his indignation and his fury grew less  and at length gave  place to horror and compassion     his seat became uneasy  his pulse throbbed with new vehemence  when i  came to the motives which prompted the unhappy man to visit the chamber  of his mistress  he started from his seat  and sometimes strode across  the floor in a troubled mood  and sometimes stood before me  with his  breath almost suspended in the eagerness of his attention  when i  mentioned the lifted dagger  the shriek from behind  and the apparition  that interposed  he shuddered and drew back  as if a dagger had been  aimed at his breast     when the tale was done  some time elapsed in mutual and profound  silence  my friend s thoughts were involved in a mournful and  indefinable reverie  from this he at length recovered and spoke        it is true  a tale like this could never be the fruit of invention  or  be invented to deceive  he has done himself injustice  his character was  spotless and fair  all his moral properties seemed to have resolved  themselves into gratitude  fidelity  and honour      we parted at the door  late in the evening  as he mentioned  and he  guessed truly that subsequent reflection had induced me to return and to  disclose the truth to mrs  lorimer  clarice  relieved by the sudden  death of her friend  and unexpectedly by all  arrived at the same hour      these tidings astonished  afflicted  and delighted the lady  her  brother s death had been long believed by all but herself  to find her  doubts verified  and his existence ascertained  was the dearest  consolation that he ever could bestow  she was afflicted at the proofs  that had been noted of the continuance of his depravity  but she dreaded  no danger to herself from his malignity or vengeance      the ignorance and prepossessions of this woman were remarkable  on this  subject only she was perverse  headstrong  obstinate  her anxiety to  benefit this archruffian occupied her whole thoughts  and allowed her no  time to reflect upon the reasonings or remonstrances of others  she  could not be prevailed on to deny herself to his visits  and i parted  from her in the utmost perplexity      a messenger came to me at midnight  entreating my immediate presence   some disaster had happened  but of what kind the messenger was unable to  tell  my fears easily conjured up the image of wiatte  terror scarcely  allowed me to breathe  when i entered the house of mrs  lorimer  i was  conducted to her chamber  she lay upon the bed in a state of  stupefaction  that arose from some mental cause  clarice sat by her   wringing her hands  and pouring forth her tears without intermission   neither could explain to me the nature of the scene  i made inquiries of  the servants and attendants  they merely said that the family as usual  had retired to rest  but their lady s bell rung with great violence  and  called them in haste to her chamber  where they found her in a swoon  upon the floor  and the young lady in the utmost affright and  perturbation      suitable means being used  mrs  lorimer had  at length  recovered  but  was still nearly insensible  i went to clithero s apartments  but he was  not to be found  and the domestics informed me that  since he had gone  with me  he had not returned  the doors between this chamber and the  court were open  hence  that some dreadful interview had taken place   perhaps with wiatte  was an unavoidable conjecture  he had withdrawn   however  without committing any personal injury      i need not mention my reflections upon this scene  all was tormenting  doubt and suspense  till the morning arrived  and tidings were received  that wiatte had been killed in the streets  this event was antecedent to  that which had occasioned mrs  lorimer s distress and alarm  i now  remembered that fatal prepossession by which the lady was governed  and  her frantic belief that her death and that of her brother were to fall  out at the same time  could some witness of his death have brought her  tidings of it  had he penetrated  unexpected and unlicensed  to her  chamber  and were these the effects produced by the intelligence      presently i knew that not only wiatte was dead  but that clithero had  killed him  clithero had not been known to return  and was nowhere to be  found  he  then  was the bearer of these tidings  for none but he could  have found access or egress without disturbing the servants      these doubts were at length at an end  in a broken and confused manner   and after the lapse of some days  the monstrous and portentous truth was  disclosed  after our interview  the lady and her daughter had retired to  the same chamber  the former had withdrawn to her closet  and the latter  to bed  some one s entrance alarmed the lady  and  coming forth after a  moment s pause  the spectacle which clithero has too faithfully  described presented itself      what could i think  a life of uniform hypocrisy  or a sudden loss of  reason  were the only suppositions to be formed  clithero was the parent  of fury and abhorrence in my heart  in either case i started at the  name  i shuddered at the image of the apostate or the maniac      what  kill the brother whose existence was interwoven with that of his  benefactress and his friend  then hasten to her chamber  and attempt her  life  lift a dagger to destroy her who had been the author of his being  and his happiness      he that could meditate a deed like this was no longer man  an agent  from hell had mastered his faculties  he was become the engine of  infernal malice  against whom it was the duty of all mankind to rise up  in arms and never to desist till  by shattering it to atoms  its power  to injure was taken away      all inquiries to discover the place of his retreat were vain  no  wonder  methought  that he wrapped himself in the folds of impenetrable  secrecy  curbed  checked  baffled in the midst of his career  no wonder  that he shrunk into obscurity  that he fled from justice and revenge   that he dared not meet the rebukes of that eye which  dissolving in  tenderness or flashing with disdain  had ever been irresistible      but how shall i describe the lady s condition  clithero she had  cherished from his infancy  he was the stay  the consolation  the pride  of her life  his projected alliance with her daughter made him still  more dear  her eloquence was never tired of expatiating on his purity  and rectitude  no wonder that she delighted in this theme  for he was  her own work  his virtues were the creatures of her bounty      how hard to be endured was this sad reverse  she can be tranquil  but  never more will she be happy  to promote her forgetfulness of him  i  persuaded her to leave her country  which contained a thousand memorials  of past calamity  and which was lapsing fast into civil broils  clarice  has accompanied us  and time may effect the happiness of others by her  means  though she can never remove the melancholy of her mother      i have listened to your tale  not without compassion  what would you  have me to do  to prolong his life would be merely to protract his  misery      he can never be regarded with complacency by my wife  he can never be  thought of without shuddering by clarice  common ills are not without a  cure less than death  but here all remedies are vain  consciousness  itself is the malady  the pest  of which he only is cured who ceases to  think      i could not but assent to this mournful conclusion  yet  though death  was better to clithero than life  could not some of his mistakes be  rectified  euphemia lorimer  contrary to his belief  was still alive  he  dreamed that she was dead  and a thousand evils were imagined to flow  from that death  this death  and its progeny of ills  haunted his fancy   and added keenness to his remorse  was it not our duty to rectify this  error     sarsefield reluctantly assented to the truth of my arguments on this  head  he consented to return  and afford the dying man the consolation  of knowing that the being whom he adored as a benefactor and parent had  not been deprived of existence  though bereft of peace by his act     during sarsefield s absence my mind was busy in revolving the incidents  that had just occurred  i ruminated on the last words of clithero  there  was somewhat in his narrative that was obscure and contradictory  he had  left the manuscript  which he so much and so justly prized  in his  cabinet  he entered the chamber in my absence  and found the cabinet  unfastened and the manuscript gone  it was i by whom the cabinet was  opened  but the manuscript supposed to be contained in it was buried in  the earth beneath the elm  how should clithero be unacquainted with its  situation  since none but clithero could have dug for it this grave     this mystery vanished when i reflected on the history of my own  manuscript  clithero had buried his treasure with his own hands  as mine  had been secreted by myself  but both acts had been performed during  sleep  the deed was neither prompted by the will nor noticed by the  senses of him by whom it was done  disastrous and humiliating is the  state of man  by his own hands is constructed the mass of misery and  error in which his steps are forever involved     thus it was with thy friend  hurried on by phantoms too indistinct to be  now recalled  i wandered from my chamber to the desert  i plunged into  some unvisited cavern  and easily proceeded till i reached the edge of a  pit  there my step was deceived  and i tumbled headlong from the  precipice  the fall bereaved me of sense  and i continued breathless and  motionless during the remainder of the night and the ensuing day     how little cognizance have men over the actions and motives of each  other  how total is our blindness with regard to our own performances   who would have sought me in the bowels of this mountain  ages might have  passed away  before my bones would be discovered in this tomb by some  traveller whom curiosity had prompted to explore it     i was roused from these reflections by sarsefield s return  inquiring  into clithero s condition  he answered that the unhappy man was  insensible  but that  notwithstanding numerous and dreadful gashes in  different parts of his body  it was possible that  by submitting to the  necessary treatment  he might recover     encouraged by this information  i endeavoured to awaken the zeal and  compassion of my friend in clithero s behalf  he recoiled with  involuntary shuddering from any task which would confine him to the  presence of this man  time and reflection  he said  might introduce  different sentiments and feelings  but at present he could not but  regard this person as a maniac  whose disease was irremediable  and  whose existence could not be protracted but to his own misery and the  misery of others     finding him irreconcilably averse to any scheme connected with the  welfare of clithero  i began to think that his assistance as a surgeon  was by no means necessary  he had declared that the sufferer needed  nothing more than common treatment  and to this the skill of a score of  aged women in this district  furnished with simples culled from the  forest  and pointed out  of old time  by indian  leeches   was no  less adequate than that of sarsefield  these women were ready and  officious in their charity  and none of them were prepossessed against  the sufferer by a knowledge of his genuine story     sarsefield  meanwhile  was impatient for my removal to inglefield s  habitation  and that venerable friend was no less impatient to receive  me  my hurts were superficial  and my strength sufficiently repaired by  a night s repose  next day i went thither  leaving clithero to the care  of his immediate neighbours     sarsefield s engagements compelled him to prosecute his journey into  virginia  from which he had somewhat deviated in order to visit  solesbury  he proposed to return in less than a month  and then to take  me in his company to new york  he has treated me with paternal  tenderness  and insists upon the privilege of consulting for my interest  as if he were my real father  meanwhile these views have been disclosed  to inglefield  and it is with him that i am to remain  with my sisters   until his return     my reflections have been various and tumultuous  they have been busy in  relation to you  to weymouth  and especially to clithero  the latter   polluted with gore and weakened by abstinence  fatigue  and the loss of  blood  appeared in my eyes to be in a much more dangerous condition than  the event proved him to be  i was punctually informed of the progress of  his cure  and proposed in a few days to visit him  the duty of  explaining the truth  respecting the present condition of mrs  lorimer   had devolved upon me  by imparting this intelligence  i hoped to work  the most auspicious revolutions in his feelings  and prepared   therefore  with alacrity  for an interview     in this hope i was destined to be disappointed  on the morning on which  i intended to visit him  a messenger arrived from the house in which he  was entertained  and informed us that the family  on entering the sick  man s apartment  had found it deserted  it appeared that clithero had   during the night  risen from his bed and gone secretly forth  no traces  of his flight have since been discovered     but  oh  my friend  the death of waldegrave  thy brother  is at length  divested of uncertainty and mystery  hitherto  i had been able to form  no conjecture respecting it  but the solution was found shortly after  this time     queen mab  three days after my adventure  was seized in her hut on  suspicion of having aided and counselled her countrymen in their late  depredations  she was not to be awed or intimidated by the treatment she  received  but readily confessed and gloried in the mischief she had  done  and accounted for it by enumerating the injuries which she had  received from her neighbours     these injuries consisted in contemptuous or neglectful treatment  and in  the rejection of groundless and absurd claims  the people of chetasco  were less obsequious to her humours than those of solesbury  her ancient  neighbourhood  and her imagination brooded for a long time over nothing  but schemes of revenge  she became sullen  irascible  and spent more of  her time in solitude than ever     a troop of her countrymen at length visited her hut  their intentions  being hostile  they concealed from the inhabitants their presence in  this quarter of the country  some motives induced them to withdraw and  postpone  for the present  the violence which they meditated  one of  them  however  more sanguinary and audacious than the rest  would not  depart without some gratification of his vengeance  he left his  associates and penetrated by night into solesbury  resolving to attack  the first human being whom he should meet  it was the fate of thy  unhappy brother to encounter this ruffian  whose sagacity made him  forbear to tear away the usual trophy from the dead  lest he should  afford grounds for suspicion as to the authors of the evil     satisfied with this exploit  he rejoined his companions  and  after an  interval of three weeks  returned with a more numerous party  to execute  a more extensive project of destruction  they were counselled and  guided  in all their movements  by queen mab  who now explained these  particulars and boldly defied her oppressors  her usual obstinacy and  infatuation induced her to remain in her ancient dwelling and prepare to  meet the consequences     this disclosure awakened anew all the regrets and anguish which flowed  from that disaster  it has been productive  however  of some benefit   suspicions and doubts  by which my soul was harassed  and which were  injurious to the innocent  are now at an end  it is likewise some  imperfect consolation to reflect that the assassin has himself been  killed  and probably by my own hand  the shedder of blood no longer  lives to pursue his vocation  and justice is satisfied     thus have i fulfilled my promise to compose a minute relation of my  sufferings  i remembered my duty to thee  and  as soon as i was able to  hold a pen  employed it to inform thee of my welfare  i could not at  that time enter into particulars  but reserved a more copious narrative  till a period of more health and leisure     on looking back  i am surprised at the length to which my story has run   i thought that a few days would suffice to complete it  but one page has  insensibly been added to another  till i have consumed weeks and filled  volumes  here i will draw to a close  i will send you what i have  written  and discuss with you in conversation my other immediate  concerns  and my schemes for the future  as soon as i have seen  sarsefield  i will visit you  farewell  e  h     solesbury  november              letter i      to mr  sarsefield          philadelphia     i came hither but ten minutes ago  and write this letter in the bar of  the stage house  i wish not to lose a moment in informing you of what  has happened  i cannot do justice to my own feelings when i reflect upon  the rashness of which i have been guilty     i will give you the particulars to morrow  at present  i shall only say  that clithero is alive  is apprized of your wife s arrival and abode in  new york  and has set out with mysterious intentions to visit her     may heaven avert the consequences of such a design  may you be enabled   by some means  to prevent their meeting  if you cannot prevent it  but i  must not reason on such an event  nor lengthen out this letter     e  h           letter ii      to the same          i will now relate the particulars which i yesterday promised to send  you  you heard through your niece of my arrival at inglefield s  in  solesbury  my inquiries  you may readily suppose  would turn upon the  fate of my friend s servant clithero  whose last disappearance was so  strange and abrupt  and of whom  since that time  i had heard nothing   you are indifferent to his fate  and are anxious only that his existence  and misfortunes may be speedily forgotten  i confess that it is somewhat  otherwise with me  i pity him  i wish to relieve him  and cannot admit  the belief that his misery is without a cure  i want to find him out  i  want to know his condition  and  if possible  to afford him comfort and  inspire him with courage and hope     inglefield replied to my questions    oh yes  he has appeared  the  strange being is again upon the stage  shortly after he left his  sick bed  i heard from philip beddington  of chetasco  that deb s hut had  found a new tenant  at first i imagined that the scotsman who built it  had returned  but  making closer inquiries  i found that the new tenant  was my servant  i had no inclination to visit him myself  but frequently  inquired respecting him of those who lived or passed that way  and find  that he still lives there       but how   said i   what is his mode of subsistence  the winter has been  no time for cultivation  and he found  i presume  nothing in the  ground       deb s hut   replied my friend   is his lodging and his place of  retirement  but food and clothing he procures by labouring on a  neighbouring farm  this farm is next to that of beddington  who  consequently knows something of his present situation  i find little or  no difference in his present deportment and those appearances which he  assumed while living with me  except that he retires every night to his  hut  and holds as little intercourse as possible with the rest of  mankind  he dines at his employer s table  but his supper  which is  nothing but rye bread  he carries home with him  and  at all those times  when disengaged from employment  he secludes himself in his hut  or  wanders nobody knows whither      this was the substance of inglefield s intelligence  i gleaned from it  some satisfaction  it proved the condition of clithero to be less  deplorable and desperate than i had previously imagined  his fatal and  gloomy thoughts seemed to have somewhat yielded to tranquillity     in the course of my reflections  however  i could not but perceive that  his condition  though eligible when compared with what it once was  was  likewise disastrous and humiliating  compared with his youthful hopes  and his actual merits  for such a one to mope away his life in this  unsocial and savage state was deeply to be deplored  it was my duty  if  possible  to prevail on him to relinquish his scheme  and what would be  requisite  for that end  but to inform him of the truth     the source of his dejection was the groundless belief that he had  occasioned the death of his benefactress  it was this alone that could  justly produce remorse or grief  it was a distempered imagination both  in him and in me that had given birth to this opinion  since the terms  of his narrative  impartially considered  were far from implying that  catastrophe  to him  however  the evidence which he possessed was  incontestable  no deductions from probability could overthrow his  belief  this could only be effected by similar and counter evidence  to  apprize him that she was now alive  in possession of some degree of  happiness  the wife of sarsefield  and an actual resident on this shore   would dissipate the sanguinary apparition that haunted him  cure his  diseased intellects  and restore him to those vocations for which his  talents  and that rank in society for which his education  had qualified  him  influenced by these thoughts  i determined to visit his retreat   being obliged to leave solesbury the next day  i resolved to set out the  same afternoon  and  stopping in chetasco for the night  seek his  habitation at the hour when he had probably retired to it     this was done  i arrived at beddington s at nightfall  my inquiries  respecting clithero obtained for me the same intelligence from him which  i had received from inglefield  deb s hut was three miles from this  habitation  and thither  when the evening had somewhat advanced  i  repaired  this was the spot which had witnessed so many perils during  the last year  and my emotions  on approaching it  were awful  with  palpitating heart and quick steps i traversed the road  skirted on each  side by thickets  and the area before the house  the dwelling was by no  means in so ruinous a state as when i last visited it  the crannies  between the logs had been filled up  and the light within was  perceivable only at a crevice in the door     looking through this crevice  i perceived a fire in the chimney  but the  object of my visit was nowhere to be seen  i knocked and requested  admission  but no answer was made  at length i lifted the latch and  entered  nobody was there     it was obvious to suppose that clithero had gone abroad for a short  time  and would speedily return  or perhaps some engagement had detained  him at his labour later than usual  i therefore seated myself on some  straw near the fire  which  with a woollen rug  appeared to constitute  his only bed  the rude bedstead which i formerly met was gone  the  slender furniture  likewise  which had then engaged my attention  had  disappeared  there was nothing capable of human use but a heap of fagots  in the corner  which seemed intended for fuel  how slender is the  accommodation which nature has provided for man  and how scanty is the  portion which our physical necessities require     while ruminating upon this scene  and comparing past events with the  objects before me  the dull whistling of the gale without gave place to  the sound of footsteps  presently the door opened  and clithero entered  the apartment  his aspect and guise were not essentially different from  those which he wore when an inhabitant of solesbury     to find his hearth occupied by another appeared to create the deepest  surprise  he looked at me without any tokens of remembrance  his  features assumed a more austere expression  and  after scowling on my  person for a moment  he withdrew his eyes  and  placing in a corner a  bundle which he bore in his hand  he turned and seemed preparing to  withdraw     i was anxiously attentive to his demeanour  and  as soon as i perceived  his purpose to depart  leaped on my feet to prevent it  i took his hand   and  affectionately pressing it  said   do you not know me  have you so  soon forgotten me  who is truly your friend      he looked at me with some attention  but again withdrew his eyes  and  placed himself in silence on the seat which i had left  i seated myself  near him  and a pause of mutual silence ensued     my mind was full of the purpose that brought me hither  but i knew not  in what manner to communicate my purpose  several times i opened my lips  to speak  but my perplexity continued  and suitable words refused to  suggest themselves  at length i said  in a confused tone        i came hither with a view to benefit a man with whose misfortunes his  own lips have made me acquainted  and who has awakened in my breast the  deepest sympathy  i know the cause and extent of his dejection  i know  the event which has given birth to horror and remorse in his heart  he  believes that  by his means  his patroness and benefactress has found an  untimely death      these words produced a visible shock in my companion  which evinced that  i had at least engaged his attention  i proceeded        this unhappy lady was cursed with a wicked and unnatural brother  she  conceived a disproportionate affection for this brother  and erroneously  imagined that her fate was blended with his  that their lives would  necessarily terminate at the same period  and that  therefore  whoever  was the contriver of his death was likewise  by a fatal and invincible  necessity  the author of her own      clithero was her servant  but was raised by her bounty to the station  of her son and the rank of her friend  clithero  in self defence  took  away the life of that unnatural brother  and  in that deed  falsely but  cogently believed that he had perpetrated the destruction of his  benefactress      to ascertain the truth  he sought her presence  she was found  the  tidings of her brother s death were communicated  and she sank  breathless at his feet      at these words clithero started from the ground  and cast upon me looks  of furious indignation   and come you hither   he muttered   for this  end   to recount my offences and drive me again to despair       no   answered i  with quickness   i come to outroot a fatal but  powerful illusion  i come to assure you that the woman with whose  destruction you charge yourself is  not dead       these words  uttered with the most emphatical solemnity  merely produced  looks in which contempt was mingled with anger  he continued silent      i perceive   resumed i   that my words are disregarded  would to heaven  i were able to conquer your incredulity  could show you not only the  truth but the probability of my tale  can you not confide in me  that  euphemia lorimer is now alive  is happy  is the wife of sarsefield  that  her brother is forgotten and his murderer regarded without enmity or  vengeance      he looked at me with a strange expression of contempt   come   said he   at length   make out thy assertion to be true  fall on thy knees  and  invoke the thunder of heaven to light on thy head if thy words be false   swear that euphemia lorimer is alive  happy  forgetful of wiatte and  compassionate of me  swear that thou hast seen her  talked with her   received from her own lips the confession of her pity for him who aimed  a dagger at her bosom  swear that she is sarsefield s wife      i put my hands together  and  lifting my eyes to heaven  exclaimed   i  comply with your conditions  i call the omniscient god to witness that  euphemia lorimer is alive  that i have seen her with these eyes  have  talked with her  have inhabited the same house for months      these asseverations were listened to with shuddering  he laid not aside   however  an air of incredulity and contempt   perhaps   said he   thou  canst point out the place of her abode   canst guide me to the city  the  street  the very door of her habitation       i can  she resides at this moment in the city of new york  in broadway   in a house contiguous to the          tis well   exclaimed my companion  in a tone loud  abrupt  and in the  utmost degree vehement    tis well  rash and infatuated youth  thou hast  ratified  beyond appeal or forgiveness  thy own doom  thou hast once  more let loose my steps  and sent me on a fearful journey  thou hast  furnished the means of detecting thy imposture  i will fly to the spot  which thou describest  i will ascertain thy falsehood with my own eyes   if she be alive  then am i reserved for the performance of a new crime   my evil destiny will have it so  if she be dead  i shall make thee  expiate      so saying  he darted through the door  and was gone in a moment beyond  my sight and my reach  i ran to the road  looked on every side  and  called  but my calls were repeated in vain  he had fled with the  swiftness of a deer     my own embarrassment  confusion  and terror were inexpressible  his last  words were incoherent  they denoted the tumult and vehemence of frenzy   they intimated his resolution to seek the presence of your wife  i had  furnished a clue which could not fail to conduct him to her presence   what might not be dreaded from the interview  clithero is a maniac  this  truth cannot be concealed  your wife can with difficulty preserve her  tranquillity when his image occurs to her remembrance  what must it be  when he starts up before her in his neglected and ferocious guise  and  armed with purposes perhaps as terrible as those which had formerly led  him to her secret chamber and her bedside     his meaning was obscurely conveyed  he talked of a deed for the  performance of which his malignant fate had reserved him  which was to  ensue their meeting  and which was to afford disastrous testimony of the  infatuation which had led me hither     heaven grant that some means may suggest themselves to you of  intercepting his approach  yet i know not what means can be conceived   some miraculous chance may befriend you  yet this is scarcely to be  hoped  it is a visionary and fantastic base on which to rest our  security     i cannot forget that my unfortunate temerity has created this evil  yet  who could foresee this consequence of my intelligence  i imagined that  clithero was merely a victim of erroneous gratitude  a slave of the  errors of his education and the prejudices of his rank  that his  understanding was deluded by phantoms in the mask of virtue and duty   and not  as you have strenuously maintained  utterly subverted     i shall not escape your censure  but i shall  likewise  gain your  compassion  i have erred  not through sinister or malignant intentions   but from the impulse of misguided  indeed  but powerful  benevolence           letter iii      to edgar huntly          new york     edgar       after the fatigues of the day  i returned home  as i entered  my wife  was breaking the seal of a letter  but  on seeing me  she forbore  and  presented the letter to me      i saw   said she   by the superscription of this letter  who the writer  was  so  agreeably to your wishes  i proceeded to open it  but you have  come just time enough to save me the trouble      this letter was from you  it contained information relative to clithero   see how imminent a chance it was that saved my wife from a knowledge of  its contents  it required all my efforts to hide my perturbation from  her and excuse myself from showing her the letter     i know better than you the character of clithero  and the consequences  of a meeting between him and my wife  you may be sure that i would exert  myself to prevent a meeting     the method for me to pursue was extremely obvious  clithero is a madman   whose liberty is dangerous  and who requires to be fettered and  imprisoned as the most atrocious criminal     i hastened to the chief magistrate  who is my friend  and  by proper  representations  obtained from him authority to seize clithero wherever  i should meet with him  and effectually debar him from the perpetration  of new mischiefs     new york does not afford a place of confinement for lunatics as suitable  to his case as pennsylvania  i was desirous of placing him as far as  possible from the place of my wife s residence  fortunately  there was a  packet for philadelphia on the point of setting out on her voyage  this  vessel i engaged to wait a day or two  for the purpose of conveying him  to pennsylvania hospital  meanwhile  proper persons were stationed at  powles hook  and at the quays where the various stage boats from jersey  arrive     these precautions were effectual  not many hours after the receipt of  your intelligence  this unfortunate man applied for a passage at  elizabethtown  was seized the moment he set his foot on shore  and was  forthwith conveyed to the packet  which immediately set sail     i designed that all these proceedings should be concealed from the  women  but unfortunately neglected to take suitable measures for  hindering the letter  which you gave me reason to expect on the ensuing  day  from coming into their hands  it was delivered to my wife in my  absence  and opened immediately by her     you know what is  at present  her personal condition  you know what  strong reasons i had to prevent any danger or alarm from approaching  her  terror could not assume a shape more ghastly than this  the effects  have been what might have been easily predicted  her own life has been  imminently endangered  and an untimely birth has blasted my fondest  hope  her infant  with whose future existence so many pleasures were  entwined  is dead     i assure you  edgar  my philosophy has not found itself lightsome and  active under this burden  i find it hard to forbear commenting on your  rashness in no very mild terms  you acted in direct opposition to my  counsel and to the plainest dictates of propriety  be more circumspect  and more obsequious for the future     you knew the liberty that would be taken of opening my letters  you knew  of my absence from home during the greatest part of the day  and the  likelihood  therefore  that your letters would fall into my wife s hands  before they came into mine  these considerations should have prompted  you to send them under cover to whitworth or harvey  with directions to  give them immediately to me     some of these events happened in my absence  for i determined to  accompany the packet myself  and see the madman safely delivered to the  care of the hospital     i will not torture your sensibility by recounting the incidents of his  arrest and detention  you will imagine that his strong but perverted  reason exclaimed loudly against the injustice of his treatment  it was  easy for him to out reason his antagonist  and nothing but force could  subdue his opposition  on me devolved the province of his jailer and his  tyrant   a province which required a heart more steeled by spectacles of  suffering and the exercise of cruelty than mine had been     scarcely had we passed the narrows  when the lunatic  being suffered to  walk the deck   as no apprehensions were entertained of his escape in  such circumstances   threw himself overboard  with a seeming intention  to gain the shore  the boat was immediately manned  the fugitive was  pursued  but  at the moment when his flight was overtaken  he forced  himself beneath the surface  and was seen no more     with the life of this wretch  let our regrets and our forebodings  terminate  he has saved himself from evils for which no time would have  provided a remedy  from lingering for years in the noisome dungeon of a  hospital  having no reason to continue my voyage  i put myself on board  a coasting sloop  and regained this city in a few hours  i persuade  myself that my wife s indisposition will be temporary  it was impossible  to hide from her the death of clithero  and its circumstances  may this  be the last arrow in the quiver of adversity  farewell                       the herd  he shall          offer a male without blemish   he shall offer it at the door          of the tent of meeting  that he may be

offering made by fire  of a sweet          savor to yahweh             if his offering to yahweh is a burnt offering of birds           then he shall offer his offering of turtledoves           or of young pigeons           the priest shall bring it to the altar  and wring off its head           and burn it on the altar  and its blood shall be drained          out on the side of the altar

neither fat nor blood             yahweh spoke to moses  saying            speak to the children of israel  saying   if anyone          sins unintentionally  in any of the things which yahweh has          commanded not to be done  and does any one of them           if the anointed priest sins so as to bring guilt on the people           then let him offer for his sin  which he has sinned  a young

 where the ashes are poured out it          shall be burned             if the whole congregation of israel sins  and the thing          is hidden from the eyes of the assembly  and they have done          any of the things which yahweh has commanded not to be done           and are guilty           when the sin in which they have sinned is known  then the assembly          shall offer a young bull for a sin offering  and bring it          before the tent of meeting           the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands on          the head of the bull before yahweh  and the bull shall be          killed before yahweh           the anointed priest shall bring of the blood of the bull          to the tent of meeting           and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood  and sprinkle          it seven times before yahweh  before the veil           he shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar          which is before yahweh  that is in the tent of meeting

it for a wave offering          before yahweh   it was moses  portion of the ram of consecration           as yahweh commanded moses           moses took some of the anointing oil  and some of the blood which          was on the altar  and sprinkled it on aaron  on his garments           and on his sons  and on his sons  garments with him           and sanctified aaron  his garments  and his sons  and his sons           garments with him           moses said to aaron and to his sons   boil the flesh at the door          of the tent of meeting  and there eat it and the bread that          is in the basket of consecration  as i commanded  saying            aaron and his sons shall eat it            what remains of the flesh and of the bread you shall          burn with fire           you shall not go out from the door of the tent of meeting          seven days  until the days of your consecration are fulfilled           for he shall consecrate you seven days           what has been done this day  so yahweh has commanded to do           to make atonement for you           at the door of the tent of meeting you shall stay day and night          seven days  and keep the charge of yahweh  that you don t die           for so i am commanded            aaron and his sons did all the things which yahweh          commanded by moses           it happened on the eighth day  that moses called aaron and his sons           and the elders of israel           and he said to aaron   take a calf from the herd for a sin offering           and a ram for a burnt offering  without blemish  and offer          them before yahweh           you shall speak to the children of israel  saying   take a male          goat for a sin offering  and a calf and a lamb  both a year old           without blemish  for a burnt offering           and an ox and a ram for peace offerings  to sacrifice          before yahweh  and a meal offering mixed with oil           for today yahweh appears to you             they brought what moses commanded before the tent of meeting           and all the congregation drew near and stood before yahweh           moses said   this is the thing which yahweh commanded that you          should do   and the glory of yahweh shall appear to you            moses said to aaron   draw near to the altar  and offer          your sin offering  and your burnt offering  and make          atonement for yourself  and for the people  and offer          the offering of the people  and make atonement for them           as yahweh commanded            so aaron drew near to the altar  and killed the calf of          the sin offering  which was for himself           the sons of aaron presented the blood to him  and he dipped          his finger in the blood  and put it on the horns of the altar           and poured out the blood at the base of the altar           but the fat  and the kidneys  and the cover from          the liver of the sin offering  he burned upon the altar           as yahweh commanded moses           the flesh and the skin he burned with fire outside the camp           he killed the burnt offering  and aaron s sons delivered the blood          to him  and he sprinkled it on the altar round about           they delivered the burnt offering to him  piece by piece           and the head   and he burned them upon the altar           he washed the innards and the legs  and burned them on the burnt          offering on the altar           he presented the people s offering  and took the goat of          the sin offering which was for the people  and killed it           and offered it for sin  like the first           he presented the burnt offering  and offered it according          to the ordinance           he presented the meal offering  and filled his hand from there           and burned it upon the altar  besides the burnt offering          of the morning           he also killed the ox and the ram  the sacrifice of peace offerings           which was for the people   and aaron s sons delivered to him          the blood  which he sprinkled on the altar round about           and the fat of the ox and of the ram  the fat tail  and that          which covers the innards  and the kidneys  and the cover          of the liver           and they put the fat upon the breasts  and he burned the fat          on the altar           and the breasts and the right thigh aaron waved for a wave          offering before yahweh  as moses commanded           aaron lifted up his hands toward the people  and blessed them           and he came down from offering the sin offering  and the          burnt offering  and the peace offerings           moses and aaron went into the tent of meeting  and came out           and blessed the people   and the glory of yahweh appeared          to all the people           there came forth fire from before yahweh  and consumed the burnt          offering and the fat upon the altar   and when all the people          saw it  they shouted  and fell on their faces           nadab and abihu  the sons of aaron  each took his censer           and put fire in it  and laid incense on it  and offered strange          fire before yahweh  which he had not commanded them           and fire came forth from before yahweh  and devoured them           and they died before yahweh           then moses said to aaron   this is what yahweh spoke of           saying   i will show myself holy to those who come near me           and before all the people i will be glorified             aaron held his peace           moses called mishael and elzaphan  the sons of uzziel the uncle          of aaron  and said to them   draw near  carry your brothers          from before the sanctuary out of the camp            so they drew near  and carried them in their coats out of the camp           as moses had said           moses said to aaron  and to eleazar and to ithamar  his sons            don t let the hair of your heads go loose  neither tear          your clothes  that you don t die  and that he not be angry          with all the congregation   but let your brothers  the whole          house of israel  bewail the burning which yahweh has kindled           you shall not go out from the door of the tent of meeting           lest you die  for the anointing oil of yahweh is on you            they did according to the word of moses           yahweh spoke to aaron  saying            drink no wine nor strong drink  you  nor your sons with you           when you go into the tent of meeting  that you don t die           it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations           and that you are to make a distinction between the holy          and the common  and between the unclean and the clean           and that you are to teach the children of israel all the statutes          which yahweh has spoken to them by moses            moses spoke to aaron  and to eleazar and to ithamar           his sons who were left   take the meal offering that remains          of the offerings of yahweh made by fire  and eat it without          yeast beside the altar  for it is most holy           and you shall eat it in a holy place  because it is your portion           and your sons  portion  of the offerings of yahweh made by fire           for so i am commanded           the waved breast and the heaved thigh you shall eat in a          clean place  you  and your sons  and your daughters with you           for they are given as your portion  and your sons  portion  out of          the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the children of israel           the heaved thigh and the waved breast they shall bring with          the offerings made by fire of the fat  to wave it for a wave          offering before yahweh   and it shall be yours  and your sons           with you  as a portion forever  as yahweh has commanded            moses diligently inquired about the goat of the sin offering           and  behold  it was burned   and he was angry with eleazar          and with ithamar  the sons of aaron who were left  saying            why haven t you eaten the sin offering in the place of          the sanctuary  seeing it is most holy  and he has given it you          to bear the iniquity of the congregation  to make atonement          for them before yahweh           behold  its blood was not brought into the inner part of          the sanctuary   you certainly should have eaten it in the sanctuary           as i commanded            aaron spoke to moses   behold  this day they have offered          their sin offering and their burnt offering before yahweh           and such things as these have happened to me   and if i had          eaten the sin offering today  would it have been pleasing          in the sight of yahweh            when moses heard that  it was pleasing in his sight           yahweh spoke to moses and to aaron  saying to them            speak to the children of israel  saying   these are the living          things which you may eat among all the animals that are          on the earth           whatever parts the hoof  and is cloven footed  and chews          the cud among the animals  that you may eat             nevertheless these you shall not eat of those that chew          the cud  or of those who part

      yahweh spoke to moses and to aaron  saying            when a man shall have a rising in his body s skin  or a scab           or a bright spot  and it becomes in the skin of his body          the

the priest           and the priest shall examine him   behold  if there is a white          rising in the skin  and it has turned the hair white           and there is raw flesh in the rising           it is a chronic leprosy in the skin of his body  and the priest          shall pronounce him unclean   he shall not isolate him           for he is unclean            if the leprosy breaks out all over the skin  and the leprosy          covers all the skin of the infected person from his head          even to his feet  as far as it appears to the priest           then the priest shall examine him  and  behold  if the leprosy has          covered all his flesh  he shall pronounce him clean of the plague           it has all turned white   he is clean           but whenever raw flesh appears in him  he shall be unclean           the priest shall examine the raw flesh  and pronounce him unclean           the raw flesh is unclean   it is leprosy           or if the raw flesh turns again  and is changed to white           then he shall come to the priest           and the priest shall examine him  and  behold  if the plague          has turned white  then the priest shall pronounce him clean          of the plague   he is clean            when the body has a boil on its skin  and it has healed           and in the place of the boil there is a white rising           or a bright spot  reddish white  then it shall be shown          to the priest           and the priest shall examine it  and behold  if the appearance          of it is lower than the skin  and the hair of it has

one in the tent of meeting when he enters          to make atonement in the holy place  until he comes out           and has made atonement for himself and for his household           and for all the assembly of israel            he shall go out to the altar that is before yahweh and make          atonement for it  and shall take some of the bull s blood           and some of the goat s blood  and

shall put them on the head of the goat  and shall          send him away into the wilderness by the hand of a man          who is in readiness           the goat shall carry all their iniquities on himself to a          solitary land  and he shall let the goat go in the wilderness            aaron shall come into the tent of meeting  and shall take          off the linen garments  which he put on when he went into          the holy place  and shall leave them there           then he shall bathe himself in water in a holy place  and put          on his garments  and come out and offer his burnt offering          and the burnt offering of the people  and make atonement          for himself and for the people           the fat of the sin offering he shall burn on the altar            he who lets the goat go for the scapegoat shall wash his clothes           and bathe his flesh in water  and afterward he shall come          into the camp           the bull for the sin offering  and the goat for the sin offering           whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place           shall be carried forth outside the camp  and they shall burn          their skins  their flesh  and their dung with fire           he who burns them shall wash his clothes  and bathe his flesh          in water  and afterward he shall come into the camp            it shall be a statute to you forever   in the seventh month           on the tenth day of the month  you shall afflict your souls           and shall do no manner of work  the native born  or the stranger

solemn rest to you  and you shall afflict          your souls  it is a statute forever           the priest  who is anointed and who is consecrated to be          priest in his father s place  shall make the atonement           and shall put on the linen garments  even the holy garments           then he shall make atonement for the holy sanctuary  and he shall          make atonement for the tent of meeting and for the altar           and he shall make atonement for the priests and for all          the people of the assembly            this shall be an everlasting statute for you  to make atonement for          the children of israel once in the year because of all their sins            it was done as yahweh commanded moses           yahweh spoke to moses  saying            speak to aaron  and to his sons  and to all the children of israel           and say to them    this is the thing which yahweh has commanded           whatever man there is of the house of israel  who kills an ox           or lamb  or goat  in the camp  or who kills it outside the camp           and hasn t brought it to the door of the tent of meeting  to offer          it as an offering to yahweh before the tabernacle of yahweh           blood shall be imputed to that man   he has shed blood           and that man shall be cut off from among his people           this is to the end that the children of israel may bring          their sacrifices  which they sacrifice in the open field           that they may bring them to yahweh  to the door of the tent          of meeting  to the priest  and sacrifice them for sacrifices          of peace offerings to yahweh           the priest shall sprinkle the blood on the altar of yahweh at          the door of the tent of meeting  and burn the fat for a sweet          savor to yahweh           they shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices to the goat idols           after which they play the prostitute   this shall be a statute          forever to them throughout their generations             you shall say to them   any man there is of the house of israel           or of the strangers who live as foreigners among them           who offers a burnt offering or sacrifice           and doesn t bring it to the door of the tent of meeting           to sacrifice it to yahweh  that man shall be cut off          from his people             any man of the house of israel  or of the strangers who live          as foreigners among them  who eats any kind of blood           i will set my face against that soul who eats blood           and will cut him off from among his people           for the life of the flesh is in the blood  and i have given          it to you on the altar to make atonement for your souls           for it is the blood that makes atonement by reason of the life           therefore i have said to the children of israel   no person          among you shall eat blood  neither shall any stranger who lives          as a foreigner among you eat blood              whatever man there is of the children of israel           or of the strangers who live as foreigners among them           who takes in hunting any animal or bird that may be eaten           he shall pour out its blood  and cover it with dust           for as to the life of all flesh  its blood is with its life           therefore i said to the children of israel   you shall not eat          the blood of any kind of flesh  for the life of all flesh          is its blood   whoever eats it shall be cut off              every person that eats what dies of itself  or that which is          torn by animals  whether he is native born or a foreigner           he shall wash his clothes  and bathe himself in water           and be unclean until the evening   then he shall be clean           but if he doesn t wash them  or bathe his flesh  then he shall          bear his iniquity             yahweh said to moses            speak to the children of israel  and say to them   i am          yahweh your god           you shall not do as they do in the land of egypt  where you lived           and you shall not do as they do in the land of canaan  where i          am bringing you  neither shall you walk in their statutes           you shall do my ordinances  and you shall keep my statutes           and walk in them   i am yahweh your god           you shall therefore keep my statutes and my ordinances           which if a man does  he shall live in them   i am yahweh             none of you shall approach anyone who are his close relatives           to uncover their nakedness   i am yahweh             you shall not uncover the nakedness of your father           nor the nakedness of your mother   she is your mother           you shall not uncover her nakedness             you shall not uncover the nakedness of your father s wife           it is your father s nakedness             you shall not uncover the nakedness of your sister           the daughter of your father  or the daughter of your mother           whether born at home  or born abroad             you shall not uncover the nakedness of your son s daughter           or of your daughter s daughter  even their nakedness           for theirs is your own nakedness             you shall not uncover the nakedness of your father s          wife s daughter  conceived by your father  since she          is your sister             you shall not uncover the nakedness of your father s sister           she is your father s near kinswoman             you shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother s sister           for she is your mother s near kinswoman             you shall not uncover the nakedness of your father s brother           you shall not approach his wife   she is your aunt             you shall not uncover the nakedness of your daughter in law           she is your son s wife   you shall not uncover her nakedness             you shall not uncover the nakedness

daughter s daughter           to uncover her nakedness  they are near kinswomen           it is wickedness             you shall not take a wife to her sister  to be a rival           to uncover her nakedness  while her sister is yet alive             you shall not approach a woman to uncover her nakedness           as long as she is impure by her uncleanness             you shall not lie carnally with your neighbor s wife           and defile yourself with her             you shall not give any of your children to sacrifice to molech           neither shall you profane the name of your god   i am yahweh             you shall not lie with a man  as with a woman           that is detestable             you shall not lie with any animal to defile yourself with it           neither shall any woman give herself to an animal  to lie          down with it   it is a perversion             don t defile yourselves in any of these things           for in all these the nations which i am casting out before          you were defiled           the land was defiled   therefore i punished its iniquity           and the land vomited out her inhabitants           you therefore shall keep my statutes and my ordinances  and shall          not do any of these abominations  neither the native born           nor the stranger who lives as a foreigner among you            for all these abominations have the men of the land done           that were before you  and the land became defiled            that the land not vomit you out also  when you defile it           as it vomited out the nation that was before you             for whoever shall do any of these abominations  even the souls          that do them shall be cut off from among their people           therefore you shall keep my charge  that you do not practice          any of these abominable customs  which were practiced          before you  and that you do not defile yourselves with them           i am yahweh your god             yahweh spoke to moses  saying            speak to all the congregation of the children of israel           and tell them   you shall be holy  for i yahweh your god am holy

yahweh your god             when you offer a sacrifice of peace offerings to yahweh           you shall offer it so that you may be accepted           it shall be eaten the same day you offer it  and on the next day           and if anything remains until the third day  it shall be          burned with fire           if it is eaten at all on the third day  it is an abomination           it will not be accepted           but everyone who eats it shall bear his iniquity  because he has          profaned the holy thing of yahweh  and that soul shall be cut          off from his people             when you reap the harvest of your land  you shall not wholly          reap the corners of your field  neither shall you gather          the gleanings of your harvest           you shall not glean

her freedom  they shall be punished   they shall          not be put to death  because she was not free           he shall bring his trespass offering to yahweh  to the door          of the tent of meeting  even a ram for a trespass offering           the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the trespass          offering before yahweh for his sin which he has committed           and the sin which he has committed shall be forgiven him             when you come into the land  and have planted all kinds of trees          for food  then you shall count their fruit as forbidden  literally            uncircumcised   three years shall they be forbidden to you           it shall not be eaten           but in the fourth year all its fruit shall be holy  for giving          praise

him off          from among his people because he has given of his seed to molech           to defile my sanctuary  and to profane my holy name           if the people of the land all hide their eyes from that person           when he gives of his seed to molech  and don t put him to death           then i will set my face against that man  and against his family           and will cut him off

children of their people           he has uncovered his sister s nakedness  he shall bear his iniquity             if a man lies with a woman having her monthly period           and uncovers her nakedness  he has made naked her fountain           and she has uncovered the fountain of her blood           and both of them shall be cut off from among their people             you shall not

   and you shall not make yourselves abominable by animal           or by bird  or by anything with which the ground teems           which i have separated from you as unclean for you           you shall be holy to me   for i  yahweh  am holy  and have set          you apart from the peoples  that you should be mine             a man or a woman that is a medium  or is a wizard           shall surely be put to death   they shall stone them with stones           their blood shall be upon them             yahweh said to moses   speak to the priests  the sons of aaron           and say to them   a priest shall not defile himself for the dead          among his people           except for his relatives that are near to him   for his mother           for his father  for his son  for his

their flesh           they shall be holy to their god  and not profane the name of          their god  for they offer the offerings of yahweh made by fire           the bread of their god  therefore they shall be holy             they shall not marry a woman who is a prostitute  or profane           neither shall they marry a woman divorced from her husband           for he is holy to his god           you shall sanctify him therefore  for he offers the bread          of your god   he shall be holy to you   for i yahweh           who sanctify you  am holy             the daughter of any priest  if she profanes herself          by playing the prostitute  she profanes her father           she shall be burned with fire             he who is the high priest among his brothers  upon whose head

in to any dead body  nor defile himself          for his father  or for his mother           neither shall he go out of the sanctuary  nor profane          the sanctuary of his god  for the crown of the anointing oil          of his god is upon him   i am yahweh             he shall take a wife in her virginity           a widow  or one divorced  or a woman who has been defiled           or a prostitute  these he shall not marry   but a virgin          of his own people shall he take as a wife           he shall not profane his seed among his people           for i am yahweh who sanctifies him             yahweh spoke to moses  saying            say to aaron   none of your seed throughout their generations          who has a blemish  may approach to offer the bread of his god           for whatever man he is that has a blemish  he shall not draw near           a blind man  or a lame  or he who has a flat nose           or any deformity           or a man who has an injured foot  or an injured hand           or hunchbacked  or a dwarf  or one who has a defect in his eye           or an itching disease  or scabs  or who has damaged testicles           no man of the seed of aaron the priest  who has a blemish           shall come near to offer the offerings of yahweh made by fire           since has a blemish  he shall not come near to offer the bread          of his god           he shall eat the bread of his god  both of the most holy           and of the holy           he shall not come near to the veil  nor come near to the altar           because he has a blemish  that he may not profane my sanctuaries           for i am yahweh who sanctifies them             so moses spoke to aaron  and to his sons  and to all the          children of israel           yahweh spoke to moses  saying            tell aaron and his sons to separate themselves from the holy          things of the children of israel  which they make holy to me           and that they not profane my holy name   i am yahweh            tell them   if anyone of all your seed throughout your          generations approaches the holy things  which the children          of israel make holy to yahweh  having his uncleanness          on him  that soul shall be cut off from before me           i am yahweh             whoever of the seed of aaron is a leper or has an issue           he shall not eat of the holy things  until he is clean           whoever touches anything that is unclean by the dead           or a man whose seed goes from him           or whoever touches any creeping thing  whereby he may be          made unclean  or a man of whom he may take uncleanness           whatever uncleanness he has           the person that touches any such shall be unclean until the evening           and shall not eat of the holy things  unless he bathe his          body in water           when the sun is down  he shall be clean  and afterward he shall          eat of the holy things  because it is his bread           that which dies of itself  or is torn by animals  he shall          not eat  defiling himself by it   i am yahweh             they shall therefore keep my charge  lest they bear          sin for it  and die therein  if they profane it           i am yahweh who sanctifies them             no stranger shall eat of the holy thing   a foreigner          living with the priests  or a hired servant  shall not eat          of the holy thing           but if a priest buys a slave  purchased by his money           he shall eat of it  and such as are born in his house           they shall eat of his bread           if a priest s daughter is married to an outsider  she shall          not eat of the heave offering of the holy things           but if a priest s daughter is a widow  or divorced           and has no child  and has returned to her father s house           as in her youth  she may eat of her father s bread           but no stranger shall eat any of it             if a man eats something holy unwittingly  then he shall add          the fifth part of its value to it  and shall give the holy          thing to the priest           the priests shall not profane the holy things of the children          of israel  which they offer to yahweh           and so cause them to bear the iniquity that brings guilt           when they eat their holy things   for i am yahweh          who sanctifies them             yahweh spoke to moses  saying            speak to aaron  and to his sons  and to all the children          of israel  and say to them   whoever is of the house of israel           or of the foreigners in israel  who offers his offering           whether it be any of their vows  or any of their freewill offerings           which they offer to yahweh for a burnt offering           that you may be accepted  you shall offer a male without blemish           of the bulls  of the sheep  or of the goats           but whatever has a blemish  that you shall not offer           for it shall not be acceptable for you           whoever offers a sacrifice of peace offerings to yahweh          to accomplish a vow  or for a freewill offering  of the herd          or of the flock  it shall be perfect to be accepted           there shall be no blemish therein           blind  injured  maimed  having a wart  festering  or having          a running sore  you shall not offer these to yahweh  nor make          an offering by fire of them on the altar to yahweh           either a bull or a lamb that has any deformity or lacking          in his parts  that you may offer for a freewill offering           but for a vow it shall not be accepted           that which has its testicles bruised  crushed  broken  or cut           you shall not offer to yahweh  neither shall you do thus          in your land           neither from the hand of a foreigner shall you offer the bread          of your god of any of these  because their corruption is in them           there is a blemish in them   they shall not be accepted for you             yahweh spoke to moses  saying            when a bull  or a sheep  or a goat  is born  then it shall          remain seven days with its mother  and from the eighth          day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for the offering          of an offering made by fire to yahweh           whether it is a cow or ewe  you shall not kill it and its young          both in one day            when you sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving to yahweh           you shall sacrifice it so that you may be accepted           it shall be eaten on the same day  you shall leave none of it          until the morning   i am yahweh            therefore you shall keep my commandments  and do them           i am yahweh           you shall not profane my holy name  but i will be made holy          among the children of israel   i am yahweh who makes you holy           who brought you out of the land of egypt  to be your god           i am yahweh            yahweh spoke to moses  saying            speak to the children of israel  and tell them   the set feasts          of yahweh  which you

and sells some of his possessions           then his kinsman who is next to him shall come  and redeem          that which his brother has sold           if a man has no one to redeem it  and he becomes prosperous          and finds sufficient means to redeem it           then let him reckon the years since the sale of it           and restore the surplus to the man to whom he sold it           and he shall return to his property           but if he isn t able to get it back for himself  then what he has          sold shall remain in the hand of him who has bought it until          the year of jubilee   and in the jubilee it shall be released           and he shall return to his property             if a man sells a dwelling house in a walled city  then he may          redeem it within a whole year after it has been sold           for a full year he shall have the right of redemption           if it isn t redeemed within the space of a full year           then the house that is in the walled city shall be made sure          in perpetuity to him who bought it  throughout his generations           it shall not be released in the jubilee           but the houses of the villages which have no wall round          about them shall be reckoned with the fields of the country           they may be redeemed  and they shall be released in the jubilee             nevertheless the cities of the levites  the houses in the cities          of their possession  the levites may redeem at any time           the levites may redeem the house that was sold  and the city          of his possession  and it shall be released in the jubilee           for the houses of the cities of the levites are their possession          among the children of israel           but the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold           for it is their perpetual possession             if your brother has become poor  and his hand can t          support him among you  then you shall uphold him           as a stranger and a sojourner he shall live with you           take no interest from him or profit  but fear your god           that your brother may live among you           you shall not lend him your money at interest  nor give him          your food for profit           i am yahweh your god  who brought you forth out of the land          of egypt  to give you the land of canaan  and to be your god             if your brother has grown poor among you  and sells himself          to you  you shall not make him to serve as a slave           as a hired servant  and as a sojourner  he shall be with you           he shall serve with you until the year of jubilee           then he shall go out from you  he and his children with him           and shall return to his own family  and to the possession          of his fathers           for they are my servants  whom i brought forth out of the land          of egypt   they shall not be sold as slaves           you shall not rule over him with harshness  but shall          fear your god             as for your male and your female slaves  whom you may have           of the nations that are around you  from them you may buy          male and female slaves           moreover of the children of the strangers who sojourn among you           of them you may buy  and of their families who are with you           which they have conceived in your land  and they will          be your property           you may make them an inheritance for your children after you           to hold for a possession  of them may you take your slaves forever           but over your brothers the children of israel you shall not rule           one over another  with harshness             if a stranger or sojourner with you becomes rich           and your brother beside him has grown poor  and sells himself          to the stranger or foreigner living among you  or to a member          of the stranger s family           after he is sold he may be redeemed   one of his brothers          may redeem him           or his uncle  or his uncle s son  may redeem him  or any          who is a close relative to him of his family may redeem him           or if he has grown rich  he may redeem himself           he shall reckon with him who bought him from the year          that he sold himself to him to the year of jubilee           and the price of his sale shall be according to the number          of years  according to the time of a hired servant shall          he be with him           if there are yet many years  according to them he shall          give back the price of his redemption out of the money          that he was bought for           if there remain but a few years to the year of jubilee           then he shall reckon with him  according to his years of service          he shall give back the price of his redemption           as a servant hired year by year shall he be with him           he shall not rule with harshness over him in your sight           if he isn t redeemed by these means  then he shall be released          in the year of jubilee  he  and his children with him           for to me the children of israel are servants  they are my          servants whom i brought forth out of the land of egypt           i am yahweh your god             you shall make for yourselves no idols  neither shall you          raise up an engraved image or a pillar  neither shall you          place any figured stone in your land  to bow down to it           for i am yahweh your god             you shall keep my sabbaths  and have reverence for my sanctuary           i am yahweh             if you walk in my statutes  and keep my commandments           and do them           then i will give you your rains in their season  and the land          shall yield its increase  and the trees of the field shall          yield their fruit           your threshing shall reach to the vintage  and the vintage          shall reach to the sowing time  and you shall eat your bread          to the full  and dwell in your land safely             i will give peace in the land  and you shall lie down           and no one will make you afraid  and i will remove evil animals          out of the land  neither shall the sword go through your land           you shall chase your enemies  and they shall fall before you          by the sword           five of you shall chase a hundred  and a hundred of you shall          chase ten thousand  and your enemies shall fall before you          by the sword             i will have respect for you  and make you fruitful           and multiply you  and will establish my covenant with you           you shall eat old store long kept  and you shall move out          the old because of the new           i will set my tent among you   and my soul won t abhor you           i will walk among you  and will be your god  and you will          be my people           i am yahweh your god  who brought you forth out of the land          of egypt  that you should not be their slaves  and i have          broken the bars of your yoke  and made you go upright             but if you will not listen to me  and will not do          all these commandments           and if you shall reject my statutes  and if your soul abhors          my ordinances  so that you will not do all my commandments           but break my covenant           i also will do this to you   i will appoint terror over you           even consumption and fever  that shall consume the eyes           and make the soul to pine away  and you will sow your seed          in vain  for your enemies will eat it           i will set my face against you  and you will be struck          before your enemies   those who hate you will rule over you           and you will flee when no one pursues you             if you in spite of these things will not listen to me           then i will chastise you seven times more for your sins           i will break the pride of your power  and i will make your sky          like iron  and your soil like brass           and your strength will be spent in vain  for your land won t          yield its increase  neither will the trees of the land          yield their fruit             if you walk contrary to me  and won t listen to me           then i will bring seven times more plagues on you according          to your sins           i will send the wild animals among you  which will rob you          of your children  destroy your livestock  and make you few          in number  and your roads will become desolate             if by these things you won t be reformed to me  but will walk          contrary to me           then i will also walk contrary to you  and i will strike you           even i  seven times for your sins           i will bring a sword upon you  that will execute the vengeance          of the covenant  and you will be gathered together within          your cities   and i will send the pestilence among you           and you will be delivered into the hand of the enemy           when i break your staff of bread  ten women shall bake your bread          in one oven  and they shall deliver your bread again by weight           and you shall eat  and not be satisfied             if you in spite of this won t listen to me  but walk          contrary to me           then i will walk contrary to you in wrath  and i also will          chastise you seven times for your sins           you will eat the flesh of your sons  and you will eat the flesh          of your daughters           i will destroy your high places  and cut down your incense altars           and cast your dead bodies upon the bodies of your idols           and my soul will abhor you           i will lay your cities waste  and will bring your sanctuaries          to desolation  and i will not take delight in the sweet          fragrance of your offerings           i will bring the land into desolation  and your enemies          that dwell therein will be astonished at it           i will scatter you among the nations  and i will draw out          the sword after you   and your land will be a desolation           and your cities shall be a waste           then the land will enjoy its sabbaths as long as it lies          desolate and you are in your enemies  land   even then the land          will rest and enjoy its sabbaths           as long as it lies desolate it shall have rest  even the rest          which it didn t have in your sabbaths  when you lived on it             as for those of you who are left  i will send a faintness          into their hearts in the lands of their enemies           and the sound of a driven leaf will put them to flight           and they shall flee  as one flees from the sword  and they          will fall when no one pursues           they will stumble over one another  as it were before the sword           when no one pursues   and you will have no power to stand          before your enemies           you will perish among the nations  and the land of your enemies          will eat you up           those of you who are left will pine away in their iniquity          in your enemies  lands  and also in the iniquities of their          fathers shall they pine away with them             if they confess their iniquity  and the iniquity of their fathers           in their trespass which they trespassed against me  and also that           because they walked contrary to me           i also walked contrary to them  and brought them into the land          of their enemies   if then their uncircumcised heart is humbled           and they then accept the punishment of their iniquity           then i will remember my covenant with jacob  and also my          covenant with isaac  and also my covenant with abraham           and i will remember the land           the land also will be left by them  and will enjoy its sabbaths          while it lies desolate without them   and they will accept          the punishment of their iniquity  because  even because they          rejected my ordinances  and their soul abhorred my statutes           yet for all that  when they are in the land of their enemies           i will not reject them  neither will i abhor them           to destroy them utterly  and to break my covenant with them           for i am yahweh their god           but i will for their sake remember the covenant of their          ancestors  whom i brought forth out of the land of egypt          in the sight of the nations  that i might be their god           i am yahweh             these are the statutes  ordinances and laws  which yahweh made          between him and the children of israel in mount sinai by moses           yahweh spoke to moses  saying            speak to the children of israel  and say to them   when a man          makes a vow  the persons shall be for yahweh by your valuation           your valuation shall be of a male from twenty years old even          to sixty years old  even your valuation shall be fifty shekels          of silver  after the shekel of the sanctuary           if it is a female  then your valuation shall be thirty shekels           if the person is from five years old even to twenty years old           then your valuation shall be for a male twenty shekels           and for a female ten shekels           if the person is from a month old even to five years old           then your valuation shall be for a male five shekels of silver           and for a female your valuation shall be three shekels of silver           if the person is from sixty years old and upward  if it          is a male  then your valuation shall be fifteen shekels           and for a female ten shekels           but if he is poorer than your valuation  then he shall be set          before the priest  and the priest shall value him  according to          the ability of him who vowed shall the priest value him             if it is an animal  of which men offer an offering to yahweh           all that any man gives of such to yahweh becomes holy           he shall not alter it  nor change it  a good for a bad  or a bad          for a good   and if he shall at all change animal for animal           then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy           if it is any unclean animal  of which they do not offer          as an offering to yahweh  then he shall set the animal          before the priest           and the priest shall value it  whether it is good or bad           as you the priest values it  so shall it be           but if he will indeed redeem it  then he shall add the fifth          part of it to its valuation             when a man dedicates his house to be holy to yahweh           then the priest shall evaluate it  whether it is good or bad           as the priest shall evaluate it  so shall it stand           if he who dedicates it will redeem his house  then he shall          add the fifth part of the money of your valuation to it           and it shall be his             if a man dedicates to yahweh part of the field of his possession           then your valuation shall be according to the seed for it           the sowing of a homer of barley shall be valued at fifty          shekels of silver           if he dedicates his field from the year of jubilee           according to your valuation it shall stand           but if he dedicates his field after the jubilee  then the priest          shall reckon to him the money according to the years that          remain to the year of jubilee  and an abatement shall be made          from your valuation           if he who dedicated the field will indeed redeem it  then he shall          add the fifth part of the money of your valuation to it           and it shall remain his           if he will not redeem the field  or if he has sold the field          to another man  it shall not be redeemed any more           but the field  when it goes out in the jubilee  shall be holy          to yahweh  as a field devoted  it shall be owned by the priests             if he dedicates to yahweh a field which he has bought           which is not of the field of his possession           then the priest shall reckon to him the worth of your valuation          up to the year of jubilee  and he shall give your valuation          on that day  as a holy thing to yahweh           in the year of jubilee the field shall return to him from          whom it was bought  even to him to whom the possession          of the land belongs           all your valuations shall be according to the shekel of          the sanctuary   twenty gerahs to the shekel             only the firstborn among animals  which is made a firstborn          to yahweh  no man may dedicate it  whether an ox or sheep           it is yahweh s           if it is an unclean animal  then he shall buy it back according          to your valuation  and shall add to it the fifth part of it           or if it isn t redeemed  then it shall be sold according          to your valuation             notwithstanding  no devoted thing  that a man shall devote          to yahweh of all that he has  whether of man or animal           or of the field of his possession  shall be sold or redeemed           every devoted thing is most holy to yahweh             no one devoted  who shall be devoted from among men           shall be ransomed  he shall surely be put to death             all the tithe of the land  whether of the seed of the land          or of the fruit of the trees  is yahweh s  it is holy to yahweh           if a man redeems anything of his tithe  he shall add a fifth          part to it           all the tithe of the herds or the flocks  whatever passes          under the rod  the tenth shall be holy to yahweh           he shall not search whether it is good or bad           neither shall he change it   and if he changes it at all           then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy           it shall not be redeemed             these are the commandments which yahweh commanded moses          for the children of israel on mount sinai               that he fell to the earth           and did obeisance           david said to him  from whence come you   he said to him           out of the camp of israel am i escaped           david said to him  how went the matter   please tell me           he answered  the people are fled from the battle  and many          of the people also are fallen and dead  and saul and jonathan          his son are dead also           david said to the young man who told him  how know you that saul          and jonathan his son are dead           the young man who told him said  as i happened by chance on          mount gilboa  behold  saul was leaning on his spear  and behold           the chariots and the horsemen followed hard after him           when he looked behind him  he saw me  and called to me           i answered  here am i           he said to me  who are you   i answered him  i am an amalekite           he said to me  stand  i pray you  beside me  and kill me           for anguish has taken hold of me  because my life is yet          whole in me           so i stood beside him  and killed him  because i was          sure that he could not live after that he was fallen           and i took the crown that was on his head  and the bracelet          that was on his arm  and have brought them here to my lord           then david took hold on his clothes  and tore them           and likewise all the men who were with him           and they mourned  and wept  and fasted until even  for saul           and for jonathan his son  and for the people of yahweh           and for the house of israel  because they were fallen          by the sword           david said to the young man who told him  whence are you           he answered  i am the son of a foreigner  an amalekite           david said to him  how were you not afraid to put forth your          hand to destroy yahweh s anointed           david called one of the young men  and said  go near           and fall on him   he struck him  so that he died           david said to him  your blood be on your head  for your mouth has          testified against you  saying  i have slain yahweh s anointed           david lamented with this lamentation over saul and over          jonathan his son           and he bade them teach the children of judah  the song of           the bow   behold  it is written in the book of jashar            your glory  israel  is slain on your high places           how the mighty have fallen           don t tell it in gath   don t publish it in the streets          of ashkelon  lest the daughters of the philistines rejoice           lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph           you mountains of gilboa  let there be no dew nor rain on you           neither fields of offerings  for there the shield of          the mighty was vilely cast away  the shield of saul was not          anointed with oil           from the blood of the slain  from the fat of the mighty           jonathan s bow didn t turn back   saul s sword didn t return empty           saul and jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives           in their death  they were not divided   they were swifter          than eagles   they were stronger than lions           you daughters of israel  weep over saul  who clothed you in          scarlet delicately  who put ornaments of gold on your clothing           how are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle           jonathan is slain on your high places           i am distressed for you  my brother jonathan   you have          been very pleasant to me   your love to me was wonderful           passing the love of women           how are the mighty fallen  and the weapons of war perished           it happened after this  that david inquired of yahweh  saying           shall i go up into any of the cities of judah   yahweh said          to him  go up   david said  where shall i go up           he said  to hebron           so david went up there  and his two wives also  ahinoam          the jezreelitess  and abigail the wife of nabal the carmelite           his men who were with him did david bring up  every man          with his household   and they lived in the cities of hebron           the men of judah came  and there they anointed david king          over the house of judah   they told david  saying  the men          of jabesh gilead were those who buried saul           david sent messengers to the men of jabesh gilead  and said          to them  blessed be you of yahweh  that you have shown this          kindness to your lord  even to saul  and have buried him           now yahweh show loving kindness and truth to you           and i also will requite you this kindness  because you have          done this thing           now therefore let your hands be strong  and be you valiant           for saul your lord is dead  and also the house of judah          have anointed me king over them           now abner the son of ner  captain of saul s army  had taken          ishbosheth the son of saul  and brought him over to mahanaim           and he made him king over gilead  and over the ashurites           and over jezreel  and over ephraim  and over benjamin           and over all israel           ishbosheth  saul s son  was forty years old when he began          to reign over israel  and he reigned two years           but the house of judah followed david           the time that david was king in hebron over the house of judah          was seven years and six months           abner the son of ner  and the servants of ishbosheth the son          of saul  went out from mahanaim to gibeon           joab the son of zeruiah  and the servants of david  went out           and met them by the pool of gibeon  and they sat down           the one on the one side of the pool  and the other on the other          side of the pool           abner said to joab  please let the young men arise and play          before us   joab said  let them arise           then they arose and went over by number   twelve for benjamin           and for ishbosheth the son of saul  and twelve of the          servants of david           they caught everyone his fellow by the head  and  thrust           his sword in his fellow s side  so they fell down together           therefore that place was called helkath hazzurim           which is in gibeon           the battle was very severe that day   and abner was beaten           and the men of israel  before the servants of david           the three sons of zeruiah were there  joab  and abishai  and asahel           and asahel was as light of foot as a wild gazelle           asahel pursued after abner  and in going he didn t turn          to the right hand nor to the left from following abner           then abner looked behind him  and said  is it you  asahel           he answered  it is i           abner said to him  turn you aside to your right hand or to your left           and lay you hold on one of the young men  and take you his armor           but asahel would not turn aside from following him           abner said again to asahel  turn you aside from following me           why should i strike you to the ground  how then should i hold          up my face to joab your brother           however he refused to turn aside   therefore abner with the hinder          end of the spear struck him in the body  so that the spear came          out behind him  and he fell down there  and died in the same place           and it happened  that as many as came to the place where asahel          fell down and died stood still           but joab and abishai pursued after abner   and the sun went          down when they were come to the hill of ammah  that lies          before giah by the way of the wilderness of gibeon           the children of benjamin gathered themselves together after abner           and became one band  and stood on the top of a hill           then abner called to joab  and said   shall the sword devour forever           don t you know that it will be bitterness in the latter end           how long shall it be then  before you bid the people return          from following their brothers            joab said  as god lives  if you had not spoken  surely then          in the morning the people had gone away  nor followed          everyone his brother           so joab blew the trumpet  and all the people stood still           and pursued after israel no more  neither fought they any more           abner and his men went all that night through the arabah           and they passed over the jordan  and went through all bithron           and came to mahanaim           joab returned from following abner   and when he had gathered          all the people together  there lacked of david s servants          nineteen men and asahel           but the servants of david had struck of benjamin  and of abner s men            so that  three hundred sixty men died           they took up asahel  and buried him in the tomb of his father           which was in bethlehem   joab and his men went all night           and the day broke on them at hebron           now there was long war between the house of saul and the house          of david   and david grew stronger and stronger  but the house          of saul grew weaker and weaker           to david were sons born in hebron   and his firstborn was amnon           of ahinoam the jezreelitess           and his second  chileab  of abigail the wife of nabal the carmelite           and the third  absalom the son of maacah the daughter of talmai          king of geshur           and the fourth  adonijah the son of haggith  and the fifth           shephatiah the son of abital           and the sixth  ithream  of eglah  david s wife           these were born to david in hebron           it happened  while there was war between the house of saul          and the house of david  that abner made himself strong          in the house of saul           now saul had a concubine  whose name was rizpah  the daughter          of aiah   and  ishbosheth  said to abner  why have you gone          in to my father s concubine           then was abner very angry for the words of ishbosheth  and said           am i a dog s head that belongs to judah   this day do i show          kindness to the house of saul your father  to his brothers           and to his friends  and have not delivered you into the hand          of david  and yet you charge me this day with a fault          concerning this woman           god do so to abner  and more also  if  as yahweh has sworn          to david  i don t do even so to him           to transfer the kingdom from the house of saul  and to set          up the throne of david over israel and over judah  from dan          even to beersheba           he could not answer abner another word  because he feared him           abner sent messengers to david on his behalf  saying  whose is          the land  saying  also   make your league with me  and behold           my hand shall be with you  to bring about all israel to you           he said  well  i will make a league with you  but one thing          i require of you   that is  you shall not see my face           except you first bring michal  saul s daughter  when you come          to see my face           david sent messengers to ishbosheth  saul s son  saying           deliver me my wife michal  whom i pledged to be married to me          for one hundred foreskins of the philistines           ishbosheth sent  and took her from her husband  even from          paltiel the son of laish           her husband went with her  weeping as he went  and followed          her to bahurim   then said abner to him  go  return           and he returned           abner had communication with the elders of israel  saying           in times past you sought for david to be king over you           now then do it  for yahweh has spoken of david  saying  by the hand          of my servant david i will save my people israel out of the hand          of the philistines  and out of the hand of all their enemies           abner also spoke in the ears of benjamin   and abner went          also to speak in the ears of david in hebron all that seemed          good to israel  and to the whole house of benjamin           so abner came to david to hebron  and twenty men with him           david made abner and the men who were with him a feast           abner said to david  i will arise and go  and will gather all israel          to my lord the king  that they may make a covenant with you           and that you may reign over all that your soul desires           david sent abner away  and he went in peace           behold  the servants of david and joab came from a foray           and brought in a great spoil with them   but abner was not          with david in hebron  for he had sent him away  and he was          gone in peace           when joab and all the army who was with him had come           they told joab  saying  abner the son of ner came to the king           and he has sent him away  and he is gone in peace           then joab came to the king  and said  what have you done  behold           abner came to you  why is it that you have sent him away           and he is quite gone           you know abner the son of ner  that he came to deceive you           and to know your going out and your coming in  and to know          all that you do           when joab was come out from david  he sent messengers          after abner  and they brought him back from the well of sirah           but david didn t know it           when abner was returned to hebron  joab took him aside into          the midst of the gate to speak with him quietly  and struck          him there in the body  so that he died  for the blood          of asahel his brother           afterward  when david heard it  he said  i and my kingdom          are guiltless before yahweh forever of the blood of abner          the son of ner           let it fall on the head of joab  and on all his father s house           and let there not fail from the house of joab one who has          an issue  or who is a leper  or who leans on a staff           or who falls by the sword  or who lacks bread           so joab and abishai his brother killed abner  because he had          killed their brother asahel at gibeon in the battle           david said to joab  and to all the people who were with him           tear your clothes  and gird you with sackcloth  and mourn          before abner   king david followed the bier           they buried abner in hebron   and the king lifted up his voice           and wept at the grave of abner  and all the people wept           the king lamented for abner  and said  should abner die          as a fool dies           your hands were not bound  nor your feet put into fetters           as a man falls before the children of iniquity  so you fell           all the people wept again over him           all the people came to cause david to eat bread while it was yet day           but david swore  saying  god do so to me  and more also           if i taste bread  or anything else  until the sun be down           all the people took notice of it  and it pleased them           as whatever the king did pleased all the people           so all the people and all israel understood that day that it          was not of the king to kill abner the son of ner           the king said to his servants   don t you know that there          a prince and a great man has fallen this day in israel           i am this day weak  though anointed king  and these men          the sons of zeruiah are too hard for me   may yahweh reward          the evil doer according to his wickedness            when  ishbosheth   saul s son  heard that abner was dead in hebron           his hands became feeble  and all the israelites were troubled            ishbosheth   saul s son   had  two men who were captains of bands           the name of the one was baanah  and the name of the other rechab           the sons of rimmon the beerothite  of the children of benjamin           for beeroth also is reckoned to benjamin           and the beerothites fled to gittaim  and have lived as foreigners          there until this day            now jonathan  saul s son  had a son who was lame of his feet           he was five years old when the news came of saul and jonathan          out of jezreel  and his nurse took him up  and fled           and it happened  as she made haste to flee  that he fell           and became lame   his name was mephibosheth           the sons of rimmon the beerothite  rechab and baanah  went           and came about the heat of the day to the house of ishbosheth           as he took his rest at noon           they came there into the midst of the house  as though they          would have fetched wheat  and they struck him in the body           and rechab and baanah his brother escaped           now when they came into the house  as he lay on his bed          in his bedchamber  they struck him  and killed him           and beheaded him  and took his head  and went by the way          of the arabah all night           they brought the head of ishbosheth to david to hebron           and said to the king  behold  the head of ishbosheth           the son of saul  your enemy  who sought your life           and yahweh has avenged my lord the king this day of saul           and of his seed           david answered rechab and baanah his brother  the sons          of rimmon the beerothite  and said to them  as yahweh lives           who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity           when one told me  saying  behold  saul is dead  thinking to have          brought good news  i took hold of him  and killed him in ziklag           which was the reward i gave him for his news           how much more  when wicked men have slain a righteous person          in his own house on his bed  shall i not now require his blood          of your hand  and take you away from the earth           david commanded his young men  and they killed them  and cut          off their hands and their feet  and hanged them up beside          the pool in hebron   but they took the head of ishbosheth           and buried it in the grave of abner in hebron           then came all the tribes of israel to david to hebron           and spoke  saying  behold  we are your bone and your flesh           in times past  when saul was king over us  it was you          who led out and brought in israel   and yahweh said to you           you shall be shepherd of my people israel  and you shall          be prince over israel           so all the elders of israel came to the king to hebron           and king david made a covenant with them in hebron before yahweh           and they anointed david king over israel           david was thirty years old when he began to reign           and he reigned forty years           in hebron he reigned over judah seven years and six months           and in jerusalem he reigned thirty three years over all          israel and judah           the king and his men went to jerusalem against the jebusites           the inhabitants of the land  who spoke to david  saying           except you take away the blind and the lame  you shall not          come in here  thinking  david can t come in here           nevertheless david took the stronghold of zion  the same is          the city of david           david said on that day  whoever strikes the jebusites           let him get up to the watercourse  and  strike           the lame and the blind  who are hated of david s soul           therefore they say  there are the blind and the lame           he can t come into the house           david lived in the stronghold  and called it the city of david           david built round about from millo and inward           david grew greater and greater  for yahweh  the god of armies           was with him           hiram king of tyre sent messengers to david  and cedar trees           and carpenters  and masons  and they built david a house           david perceived that yahweh had established him king over israel           and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people israel s sake           david took him more concubines and wives out of jerusalem           after he was come from hebron  and there were yet sons          and daughters born to david           these are the names of those who were born to him          in jerusalem   shammua  and shobab  and nathan  and solomon           and ibhar  and elishua  and nepheg  and japhia           and elishama  and eliada  and eliphelet           when the philistines heard that they had anointed david king          over israel  all the philistines went up to seek david           and david heard of it  and went down to the stronghold           now the philistines had come and spread themselves in the          valley of rephaim           david inquired of yahweh  saying  shall i go up against          the philistines  will you deliver them into my hand           yahweh said to david  go up  for i will certainly deliver          the philistines into your hand           david came to baal perazim  and david struck them there  and he said           yahweh has broken my enemies before me  like the breach of waters           therefore he called the name of that place baal perazim           they left their images there  and david and his men took them away           the philistines came up yet again  and spread themselves          in the valley of rephaim           when david inquired of yahweh  he said  you shall not go up           make a circuit behind them  and come on them over against          the mulberry trees           it shall be  when you hear the sound of marching in the tops          of the mulberry trees  that then you shall bestir yourself           for then is yahweh gone out before you to strike the army          of the philistines           david did so  as yahweh commanded him  and struck the philistines          from geba until you come to gezer           david again gathered together all the chosen men of israel           thirty thousand           david arose  and went with all the people who were with him           from baale judah  to bring up from there the ark of god           which is called by the name  even the name of yahweh of armies          who sits  above  the cherubim           they set the ark of god on a new cart  and brought it          out of the house of abinadab that was in the hill           and uzzah and ahio  the sons of abinadab  drove the new cart           they brought it out of the house of abinadab  which was in the hill           with the ark of god   and ahio went before the ark           david and all the house of israel played before yahweh with all          manner of  instruments made of  fir wood  and with harps           and with stringed instruments  and with tambourines           and with castanets  and with cymbals           when they came to the threshing floor of nacon  uzzah put          forth  his hand  to the ark of god  and took hold of it           for the oxen stumbled           the anger of yahweh was kindled against uzzah  and god struck          him there for his error  and there he died by the ark of god           david was displeased  because yahweh had broken forth on uzzah           and he called that place perez uzzah  to this day           david was afraid of yahweh that day  and he said  how shall          the ark of yahweh come to me           so david would not remove the ark of yahweh to him into          the city of david  but david carried it aside into the house          of obed edom the gittite           the ark of yahweh remained in the house of obed edom          the gittite three months   and yahweh blessed obed edom           and all his house           it was told king david  saying  yahweh has blessed the house          of obed edom  and all that pertains to him  because of the ark          of god   david went and brought up the ark of god from the house          of obed edom into the city of david with joy           it was so  that  when those who bore the ark of yahweh had gone          six paces  he sacrificed an ox and a fattened calf           david danced before yahweh with all his might  and david was          girded with a linen ephod           so david and all the house of israel brought up the ark of yahweh          with shouting  and with the sound of the trumpet           it was so  as the ark of yahweh came into the city of david           that michal the daughter of saul looked out at the window           and saw king david leaping and dancing before yahweh           and she despised him in her heart           they brought in the ark of yahweh  and set it in its place           in the midst of the tent that david had pitched for it  and david          offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before yahweh           when david had made an end of offering the burnt offering          and the peace offerings  he blessed the people in the name          of yahweh of armies           he dealt among all the people  even among the whole multitude          of israel  both to men and women  to everyone a cake          of bread  and a portion  of flesh   and a cake of raisins           so all the people departed everyone to his house           then david returned to bless his household           michal the daughter of saul came out to meet david  and said           how glorious was the king of israel today  who uncovered          himself today in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants           as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovers himself           david said to michal   it was  before yahweh  who chose me          above your father  and above all his house  to appoint          me prince over the people of yahweh  over israel           therefore will i play before yahweh           i will be yet more vile than this  and will be base in my          own sight   but of the handmaids of whom you have spoken           they shall honor me           michal the daughter of saul had no child to the day of her death           it happened  when the king lived in his house  and yahweh          had given him rest from all his enemies round about           that the king said to nathan the prophet  see now  i dwell          in a house of cedar  but the ark of god dwells within curtains           nathan said to the king  go  do all that is in your heart           for yahweh is with you           it happened the same night  that the word of yahweh came          to nathan  saying           go and tell my servant david  thus says yahweh  shall you          build me a house for me to dwell in           for i have not lived in a house since the day that i brought          up the children of israel out of egypt  even to this day           but have moved around in a tent and in a tabernacle           in all places in which i have walked with all the children          of israel  spoke i a word with any of the tribes of israel           whom i commanded to be shepherd of my people israel  saying           why have you not built me a house of cedar           now therefore thus shall you tell my servant david  thus says          yahweh of armies  i took you from the sheep pen  from following          the sheep  that you should be prince over my people  over israel           and i have been with you wherever you went  and have cut off all          your enemies from before you  and i will make you a great name           like the name of the great ones who are in the earth           i will appoint a place for my people israel  and will plant them           that they may dwell in their own place  and be moved no more           neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more           as at the first           and  as  from the day that i commanded judges to be over my          people israel  and i will cause you to rest from all your enemies           moreover yahweh tells you that yahweh will make you a house           when your days are fulfilled  and you shall sleep with your fathers           i will set up your seed after you  who shall proceed out          of your bowels  and i will establish his kingdom           he shall build a house for my name  and i will establish          the throne of his kingdom forever           i will be his father  and he shall be my son           if he commit iniquity  i will chasten him with the rod of men           and with the stripes of the children of men           but my loving kindness shall not depart from him  as i took          it from saul  whom i put away before you           your house and your kingdom shall be made sure for ever before you           your throne shall be established forever           according to all these words  and according to all this vision           so did nathan speak to david           then david the king went in  and sat before yahweh           and he said  who am i  lord yahweh  and what is my house           that you have brought me thus far           this was yet a small thing in your eyes  lord yahweh  but you have          spoken also of your servant s house for a great while to come           and this  too  after the manner of men  lord yahweh           what can david say more to you  for you know your servant           lord yahweh           for your word s sake  and according to your own heart  have you          worked all this greatness  to make your servant know it           therefore you are great  yahweh god   for there is none like you           neither is there any god besides you  according to all that we          have heard with our ears           what one nation in the earth is like your people  even like israel           whom god went to redeem to himself for a people  and to make          him a name  and to do great things for you  and awesome things          for your land  before your people  whom you redeem to you          out of egypt   from  the nations and their gods           you did establish to yourself your people israel to be a people          to you forever  and you  yahweh  became their god           now  yahweh god  the word that you have spoken concerning          your servant  and concerning his house  confirm you it forever           and do as you have spoken           let your name be magnified forever  saying  yahweh of armies          is god over israel  and the house of your servant david shall          be established before you           for you  yahweh of armies  the god of israel  have revealed          to your servant  saying  i will build you a house           therefore has your servant found in his heart to pray this          prayer to you           now  o lord yahweh  you are god  and your words are truth           and you have promised this good thing to your servant           now therefore let it please you to bless the house of your servant           that it may continue forever before you  for you  lord yahweh           have spoken it   and with your blessing let the house of your          servant be blessed forever           after this it happened that david struck the philistines           and subdued them   and david took the bridle of the mother          city out of the hand of the philistines           he struck moab  and measured them with the line           making them to lie down on the ground  and he measured two          lines to put to death  and one full line to keep alive           the moabites became servants to david  and brought tribute           david struck also hadadezer the son of rehob  king of zobah           as he went to recover his dominion at the river           david took from him one thousand seven hundred horsemen  and twenty          thousand footmen   and david hamstrung all the chariot horses           but reserved of them for one hundred chariots           when the syrians of damascus came to help hadadezer king          of zobah  david struck of the syrians two and twenty thousand men           then david put garrisons in syria of damascus  and the          syrians became servants to david  and brought tribute           yahweh gave victory to david wherever he went           david took the shields of gold that were on the servants          of hadadezer  and brought them to jerusalem           from betah and from berothai  cities of hadadezer  king david          took exceeding much brass           when toi king of hamath heard that david had struck all          the army of hadadezer           then toi sent joram his son to king david  to greet him           and to bless him  because he had fought against hadadezer          and struck him   for hadadezer had wars with toi            joram  brought with him vessels of silver  and vessels of gold           and vessels of brass           these also did king david dedicate to yahweh  with the silver          and gold that he dedicated of all the nations which he subdued           of syria  and of moab  and of the children of ammon  and of          the philistines  and of amalek  and of the spoil of hadadezer           son of rehob  king of zobah           david got him a name when he returned from smiting the syrians          in the valley of salt  even eighteen thousand men           he put garrisons in edom  throughout all edom put he garrisons           and all the edomites became servants to david           yahweh gave victory to david wherever he went           david reigned over all israel  and david executed justice          and righteousness to all his people           joab the son of zeruiah was over the army  and jehoshaphat          the son of ahilud was recorder           and zadok the son of ahitub  and ahimelech the son of abiathar           were priests  and seraiah was scribe           and benaiah the son of jehoiada  was over  the cherethites          and the pelethites  and david s sons were chief ministers           david said  is there yet any who is left of the house of saul           that i may show him kindness for jonathan s sake           there was of the house of saul a servant whose name was ziba           and they called him to david  and the king said to him           are you ziba   he said  your servant is he           the king said  is there not yet any of the house of saul  that i          may show the kindness of god to him   ziba said to the king           jonathan has yet a son  who is lame of his feet           the king said to him  where is he   ziba said to the king           behold  he is in the house of machir the son of ammiel           in lo debar           then king david sent  and fetched him out of the house of machir          the son of ammiel  from lo debar           mephibosheth  the son of jonathan  the son of saul           came to david  and fell on his face  and did obeisance           david said  mephibosheth   he answered  behold  your servant           david said to him   don t be afraid of him  for i will          surely show you kindness for jonathan your father s sake           and will restore you all the land of saul your father           and you shall eat bread at my table continually            he did obeisance  and said   what is your servant  that you          should look on such a dead dog as i am            then the king called to ziba  saul s servant  and said to him            all that pertained to saul and to all his house have i given          to your master s son           you shall till the land for him  you  and your sons           and your servants  and you shall bring in  the fruits            that your master s son may have bread to eat   but mephibosheth          your master s son shall eat bread always at my table            now ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants           then said ziba to the king  according to all that my lord          the king commands his servant  so shall your servant do           as for mephibosheth   said the king   he shall eat at my table           as one of the king s sons           mephibosheth had a young son  whose name was mica           all that lived in the house of ziba were servants to mephibosheth           so mephibosheth lived in jerusalem  for he ate continually          at the king s table   he was lame in both his feet           it happened after this  that the king of the children of ammon died           and hanun his son reigned in his place           david said  i will show kindness to hanun the son of nahash           as his father shown kindness to me   so david sent          by his servants to comfort him concerning his father           david s servants came into the land of the children of ammon           but the princes of the children of ammon said to hanun          their lord  do you think that david honors your father           in that he has sent comforters to you   hasn t david sent          his servants to you to search the city  and to spy it out           and to overthrow it           so hanun took david s servants  and shaved off the one half          of their beards  and cut off their garments in the middle           even to their buttocks  and sent them away           when they told it to david  he sent to meet them  for the men          were greatly ashamed   the king said  wait at jericho until          your beards be grown  and then return           when the children of ammon saw that they were become odious          to david  the children of ammon sent and hired the syrians          of beth rehob  and the syrians of zobah  twenty thousand footmen           and the king of maacah with one thousand men  and the men          of tob twelve thousand men           when david heard of it  he sent joab  and all the army          of the mighty men           the children of ammon came out  and put the battle in array          at the entrance of the gate   and the syrians of zobah and          of rehob  and the men of tob and maacah  were by themselves          in the field           now when joab saw that the battle was set against him          before and behind  he chose of all the choice men of israel           and put them in array against the syrians           the rest of the people he committed into the hand of abishai          his brother  and he put them in array against the children of ammon           he said  if the syrians be too strong for me  then you shall          help me  but if the children of ammon be too strong for you           then i will come and help you           be of good courage  and let us play the man for our people           and for the cities of our god   and yahweh do that which          seems him good           so joab and the people who were with him drew near to the battle          against the syrians   and they fled before him           when the children of ammon saw that the syrians were fled           they likewise fled before abishai  and entered into the city           then joab returned from the children of ammon           and came to jerusalem           when the syrians saw that they were put to the worse before israel           they gathered themselves together           hadarezer sent  and brought out the syrians who were beyond          the river   and they came to helam  with shobach the captain          of the army of hadarezer at their head           it was told david  and he gathered all israel together           and passed over the jordan  and came to helam   the syrians          set themselves in array against david  and fought with him           the syrians fled before israel  and david killed of the syrians           the men of  seven hundred chariots  and forty thousand horsemen           and struck shobach the captain of their army  so that          he died there           when all the kings who were servants to hadarezer saw that they          were put to the worse before israel  they made peace with israel           and served them   so the syrians feared to help the children          of ammon any more           it happened  at the return of the year  at the time when kings go          out  to battle   that david sent joab  and his servants with him           and all israel  and they destroyed the children of ammon           and besieged rabbah   but david stayed at jerusalem           it happened at evening  that david arose from off his bed           and walked on the roof of the king s house   and from the roof          he saw a woman bathing  and the woman was very beautiful          to look on           david send and inquired after the woman   one said           is not this bathsheba  the daughter of eliam  the wife          of uriah the hittite           david sent messengers  and took her  and she came in to him           and he lay with her  for she was purified from her uncleanness            and she returned to her house           the woman conceived  and she sent and told david  and said           i am with child           david sent to joab   saying   send me uriah the hittite           joab sent uriah to david           when uriah was come to him  david asked of him how joab did           and how the people fared  and how the war prospered           david said to uriah  go down to your house  and wash your feet           uriah departed out of the king s house  and there followed          him a mess  of food  from the king           but uriah slept at the door of the king s house with all          the servants of his lord  and didn t go down to his house           when they had told david  saying  uriah didn t go down to his house           david said to uriah  haven t you come from a journey  why          did you not go down to your house           uriah said to david  the ark  and israel  and judah           abide in booths  and my lord joab  and the servants of my lord           are encamped in the open field  shall i then go into my house           to eat and to drink  and to lie with my wife  as you live           and as your soul lives  i will not do this thing           david said to uriah  stay here today also  and tomorrow i          will let you depart   so uriah abode in jerusalem that day           and the next day           when david had called him  he ate and drink before him           and he made him drunk   and at even he went out to lie on          his bed with the servants of his lord  but didn t go down          to his house           it happened in the morning  that david wrote a letter to joab           and sent it by the hand of uriah           he wrote in the letter  saying  set uriah in the forefront          of the hottest battle  and retire you from him  that he may          be struck  and die           it happened  when joab kept watch on the city  that he assigned          uriah to the place where he knew that valiant men were           the men of the city went out  and fought with joab           and there fell some of the people  even of the servants of david           and uriah the hittite died also           then joab sent and told david all the things concerning the war           and he charged the messenger  saying   when you have made an end          of telling all the things concerning the war to the king           it shall be that  if the king s wrath arise  and he tells you            why did you go so near to the city to fight   didn t you          know that they would shoot from the wall           who struck abimelech the son of jerubbesheth   didn t a woman          cast an upper millstone on him from the wall  so that he died          at thebez   why did you go so near the wall   then shall you say            your servant uriah the hittite is dead also             so the messenger went  and came and shown david all that joab          had sent him for           the messenger said to david  the men prevailed against us           and came out to us into the field  and we were on them even          to the entrance of the gate           the shooters shot at your servants from off the wall           and some of the king s servants are dead  and your servant          uriah the hittite is dead also           then david said to the messenger  thus shall you tell joab  don t let          this thing displease you  for the sword devours one as well          as another  make your battle more strong against the city           and overthrow it   and encourage you him           when the wife of uriah heard that uriah her husband was dead           she made lamentation for her husband           when the mourning was past  david sent and took her home          to his house  and she became his wife  and bore him a son           but the thing that david had done displeased yahweh           yahweh sent nathan to david   he came to him  and said          to him   there were two men in one city  the one rich           and the other poor           the rich man had very many flocks and herds           but the poor man had nothing  except one little ewe lamb           which he had bought and raised   it grew up together with him           and with his children   it ate of his own food  drank of his          own cup  and lay in his bosom  and was to him like a daughter           a traveler came to the rich man  and he spared to take of his          own flock and of his own herd  to dress for the wayfaring          man who had come to him  but took the poor man s lamb           and dressed it for the man who had come to him            david s anger was greatly kindled against the man  and he said          to nathan   as yahweh lives  the man who has done this is          worthy to die           he shall restore the lamb fourfold  because he did this thing           and because he had no pity            nathan said to david   you are the man   this is what yahweh           the god of israel  says    i anointed you king over israel           and i delivered you out of the hand of saul           i gave you your master s house  and your master s wives into          your bosom  and gave you the house of israel and of judah           and if that would have been too little  i would have added          to you many more such things           why have you despised the word of yahweh  to do that which          is evil in his sight   you have struck uriah the hittite          with the sword  and have taken his wife to be your wife           and have slain him with the sword of the children of ammon           now therefore the sword will never depart from your house           because you have despised me  and have taken the wife of uriah          the hittite to be your wife            this is what yahweh says    behold  i will raise up evil          against you out of your own house  and i will take your          wives before your eyes  and give them to your neighbor           and he will lie with your wives in the sight of this sun           for you did it secretly  but i will do this thing before all israel           and before the sun             david said to nathan   i have sinned against yahweh            nathan said to david   yahweh also has put away your sin           you will not die           however  because by this deed you have given great occasion          to yahweh s enemies to blaspheme  the child also who is born          to you shall surely die            nathan departed to his house   yahweh struck the child that          uriah s wife bore to david  and it was very sick           david therefore begged god for the child  and david fasted           and went in  and lay all night on the earth           the elders of his house arose   and stood  beside him           to raise him up from the earth   but he would not  neither did          he eat bread with them           it happened on the seventh day  that the child died           the servants of david feared to tell him that the child was dead           for they said  behold  while the child was yet alive           we spoke to him  and he didn t listen to our voice           how will he then vex himself  if we tell him that the          child is dead           but when david saw that his servants were whispering together           david perceived that the child was dead  and david said          to his servants  is the child dead   they said  he is dead           then david arose from the earth  and washed  and anointed himself           and changed his clothing  and he came into the house          of yahweh  and worshiped   then he came to his own house           and when he required  they set bread before him  and he ate           then said his servants to him  what thing is this that you have          done  you did fast and weep for the child  while it was alive           but when the child was dead  you did rise and eat bread           he said  while the child was yet alive  i fasted and wept           for i said  who knows whether yahweh will not be gracious to me           that the child may live           but now he is dead  why should i fast  can i bring him back again           i shall go to him  but he will not return to me           david comforted bathsheba his wife  and went in to her  and lay          with her   and she bore a son  and he called his name solomon           yahweh loved him           and he sent by the hand of nathan the prophet  and he named          him jedidiah  for yahweh s sake           now joab fought against rabbah of the children of ammon           and took the royal city           joab sent messengers to david  and said  i have fought          against rabbah  yes  i have taken the city of waters           now therefore gather the rest of the people together           and encamp against the city  and take it  lest i take the city           and it be called after my name           david gathered all the people together  and went to rabbah           and fought against it  and took it           he took the crown of their king from off his head           and the weight of it was a talent of gold  and  in it          were  precious stones  and it was set on david s head           he brought forth the spoil of the city  exceeding much           he brought forth the people who were therein  and put them          under saws  and under harrows of iron  and under axes          of iron  and made them pass through the brick kiln           and thus did he to all the cities of the children of ammon           david and all the people returned to jerusalem           it happened after this  that absalom the son of david had          a beautiful sister  whose name was tamar  and amnon the son          of david loved her           amnon was so vexed that he fell sick because of his sister tamar           for she was a virgin  and it seemed hard to amnon to do          anything to her           but amnon had a friend  whose name was jonadab  the son          of shimeah  david s brother  and jonadab was a very subtle man           he said to him  why  son of the king  are you thus lean from day          to day   won t you tell me   amnon said to him  i love tamar           my brother absalom s sister           jonadab said to him  lay you down on your bed  and feign          yourself sick   and when your father comes to see you           tell him  please let my sister tamar come and give me bread          to eat  and dress the food in my sight  that i may see it           and eat it from her hand           so amnon lay down  and feigned himself sick   and when the king          was come to see him  amnon said to the king  please let her          sister tamar come  and make me a couple of cakes in my sight           that i may eat from her hand           then david sent home to tamar  saying  go now to your brother          amnon s house  and dress him food           so tamar went to her brother amnon s house  and he was laid down           she took dough  and kneaded it  and made cakes in his sight           and did bake the cakes           she took the pan  and poured them out before him           but he refused to eat   amnon said  have out all men from me           they went out every man from him           amnon said to tamar  bring the food into the chamber  that i may          eat from your hand   tamar took the cakes which she had made           and brought them into the chamber to amnon her brother           when she had brought them near to him to eat  he took hold of her           and said to her  come  lie with me  my sister           she answered him  no  my brother  do not force me  for no such          thing ought to be done in israel   don t you do this folly           i  where shall i carry my shame  and as for you  you will be          as one of the fools in israel   now therefore  please speak          to the king  for he will not withhold me from you           however he would not listen to her voice  but being stronger          than she  he forced her  and lay with her           then amnon hated her with exceeding great hatred  for the hatred          with which he hated her was greater than the love with which          he had loved her   amnon said to her  arise  be gone           she said to him  not so  because this great wrong in putting          me forth is  worse  than the other that you did to me           but he would not listen to her           then he called his servant who ministered to him  and said           put now this woman out from me  and bolt the door after her           she had a garment of various colors on her  for with such          robes were the king s daughters who were virgins dressed           then his servant brought her out  and bolted the door after her           tamar put ashes on her head  and tore her garment of various          colors that was on her  and she laid her hand on her head           and went her way  crying aloud as she went           absalom her brother said to her  has amnon your brother          been with you  but now hold your peace  my sister           he is your brother  don t take this thing to heart           so tamar remained desolate in her brother absalom s house           but when king david heard of all these things  he was very angry           absalom spoke to amnon neither good nor bad  for absalom          hated amnon  because he had forced his sister tamar           it happened after two full years  that absalom had          sheepshearers in baal hazor  which is beside ephraim           and absalom invited all the king s sons           absalom came to the king  and said  see now  your servant          has sheepshearers  let the king  i pray you  and his servants          go with your servant           the king said to absalom  no  my son  let us not all go           lest we be burdensome to you   he pressed him           however he would not go  but blessed him           then said absalom  if not  please let my brother amnon go with us           the king said to him  why should he go with you           but absalom pressed him  and he let amnon and all the king s          sons go with him           absalom commanded his servants  saying  mark you now           when amnon s heart is merry with wine  and when i tell you           smite amnon  then kill him  don t be afraid  haven t i          commanded you  be courageous  and be valiant           the servants of absalom did to amnon as absalom had commanded           then all the king s sons arose  and every man got him up          on his mule  and fled           it happened  while they were in the way  that the news came          to david  saying  absalom has slain all the king s sons           and there is not one of them left           then the king arose  and tore his garments  and lay on the earth           and all his servants stood by with their clothes torn           jonadab  the son of shimeah  david s brother  answered  don t let          my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men          the king s sons  for amnon only is dead  for by the appointment          of absalom this has been determined from the day that he forced          his sister tamar           now therefore don t let my lord the king take the thing          to his heart  to think that all the king s sons are dead           for amnon only is dead           but absalom fled   the young man who kept the watch lifted up          his eyes  and looked  and behold  many people were coming          by way of the hillside behind him           jonadab said to the king  behold  the king s sons are come           as your servant said  so it is           it happened  as soon as he had made an end of speaking  that behold           the king s sons came  and lifted up their voice  and wept           and the king also and all his servants wept very sore           but absalom fled  and went to talmai the son of ammihur           king of geshur    david  mourned for his son every day           so absalom fled  and went to geshur  and was there three years            the soul of  king david longed to go forth to absalom           for he was comforted concerning amnon  seeing he was dead           now joab the son of zeruiah perceived that the king s heart          was toward absalom           joab sent to tekoa  and fetched there a wise woman           and said to her  please act like a mourner  and put on          mourning clothing  please  and don t anoint yourself with oil           but be as a woman who has a long time mourned for the dead           and go in to the king  and speak on this manner to him           so joab put the words in her mouth           when the woman of tekoa spoke to the king  she fell on her face          to the ground  and did obeisance  and said  help  o king           the king said to her  what ails you   she answered  of a truth          i am a widow  and my husband is dead           your handmaid had two sons  and they two strove together in the field           and there was none to part them  but the one struck the other           and killed him           behold  the whole family is risen against your handmaid           and they say  deliver him who struck his brother  that we          may kill him for the life of his brother whom he killed           and so destroy the heir also   thus will they quench my coal          which is left  and will leave to my husband neither name nor          remainder on the surface of the earth           the king said to the woman  go to your house  and i will give          charge concerning you           the woman of tekoa said to the king  my lord  o king           the iniquity be on me  and on my father s house  and the king          and his throne be guiltless           the king said  whoever says anything to you  bring him to me           and he shall not touch you any more           then said she  please let the king remember yahweh your god           that the avenger of blood destroy not any more  lest they          destroy my son   he said  as yahweh lives  there shall not          one hair of your son fall to the earth           then the woman said  please let your handmaid speak a word          to my lord the king   he said  say on           the woman said  why then have you devised such a thing against          the people of god  for in speaking this word the king is          as one who is guilty  in that the king does not bring home          again his banished one           for we must needs die  and are as water split on the ground           which can t be gathered up again  neither does god take          away life  but devises means  that he who is banished not be          an outcast from him           now therefore seeing that i have come to speak this word to my          lord the king  it is because the people have made me afraid           and your handmaid said  i will now speak to the king           it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant           for the king will hear  to deliver his servant out of the hand          of the man who would destroy me and my son together out          of the inheritance of god           then your handmaid said  please let the word of my lord the king          be comfortable  for as an angel of god  so is my lord the king          to discern good and bad   and yahweh your god be with you           then the king answered the woman  please don t hide anything          from me that i shall ask you   the woman said  let my lord          the king now speak           the king said  is the hand of joab with you in all this           the woman answered  as your soul lives  my lord the king           none can turn to the right hand or to the left from anything          that my lord the king has spoken  for your servant joab           he bade me  and he put all these words in the mouth          of your handmaid           to change the face of the matter has your servant joab done          this thing   and my lord is wise  according to the wisdom          of an angel of god  to know all things that are in the earth           the king said to joab  behold now  i have done this thing           go therefore  bring the young man absalom back           joab fell to the ground on his face  and did obeisance           and blessed the king   and joab said  today your servant knows          that i have found favor in your sight  my lord  king  in that          the king has performed the request of his servant           so joab arose and went to geshur  and brought absalom to jerusalem           the king said  let him turn to his own house  but let him          not see my face   so absalom turned to his own house           and didn t see the king s face           now in all israel there was none to be so much praised as absalom          for his beauty   from the sole of his foot even to the crown          of his head there was no blemish in him           when he cut the hair of his head  now it was at every year s end          that he cut it  because it was heavy on him  therefore he cut it            he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels           after the king s weight           to absalom there were born three sons  and one daughter           whose name was tamar   she was a woman of a beautiful face           absalom lived two full years in jerusalem  and he didn t see          the king s face           then absalom sent for joab  to send him to the king           but he would not come to him   and he sent again a second time           but he would not come           therefore he said to his servants  behold  joab s field is          near mine  and he has barley there  go and set it on fire           absalom s servants set the field on fire           then joab arose  and came to absalom to his house  and said          to him  why have your servants set my field on fire           absalom answered joab  behold  i sent to you  saying  come here           that i may send you to the king  to say  why am i come          from geshur  it were better for me to be there still           now therefore let me see the king s face  and if there be          iniquity in me  let him kill me           so joab came to the king  and told him  and when he had called          for absalom  he came to the king  and bowed himself on his face          to the ground before the king   and the king kissed absalom           it happened after this  that absalom prepared him a chariot          and horses  and fifty men to run before him           absalom rose up early  and stood beside the way of the gate           and it was so  that when any man had a suit which should          come to the king for judgment  then absalom called to him           and said  of what city are you   he said  your servant is          of one of the tribes of israel           absalom said to him  behold  your matters are good and right           but there is no man deputized of the king to hear you           absalom said moreover  oh that i were made judge in the land           that every man who has any suit or cause might come to me           and i would do him justice           it was so  that when any man came near to do him obeisance           he put forth his hand  and took hold of him  and kissed him           in this manner absalom did to all israel who came to the king          for judgment   so absalom stole the hearts of the men of israel           it happened at the end of forty years  that absalom said          to the king  please let me go and pay my vow  which i have          vowed to yahweh  in hebron           for your servant vowed a vow while i abode at geshur in syria           saying  if yahweh shall indeed bring me again to jerusalem           then i will serve yahweh           the king said to him  go in peace   so he arose  and went to hebron           but absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of israel           saying  as soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet           then you shall say  absalom is king in hebron           with absalom went two hundred men out of jerusalem  who were invited           and went in their simplicity  and they didn t know anything           absalom sent for ahithophel the gilonite  david s counselor           from his city  even from giloh  while he was offering          the sacrifices   the conspiracy was strong  for the people          increased continually with absalom           there came a messenger to david  saying  the hearts of the men          of israel are after absalom           david said to all his servants who were with him at jerusalem  arise           and let us flee  for else none of us shall escape from absalom           make speed to depart  lest he overtake us quickly  and bring          down evil on us  and strike the city with the edge of the sword           the king s servants said to the king  behold  your servants          are ready to do whatever my lord the king shall choose           the king went forth  and all his household after him           the king left ten women  who were concubines  to keep the house           the king went forth  and all the people after him  and they          stayed in beth merhak           all his servants passed on beside him  and all the cherethites           and all the pelethites  and all the gittites  six hundred men          who came after him from gath  passed on before the king           then said the king to ittai the gittite  why go you also with          us  return  and abide with the king   for you are a foreigner           and also an exile   return  to your own place           whereas you came but yesterday  should i this day make you go          up and down with us  seeing i go where i may  return you           and take back your brothers  mercy and truth be with you           ittai answered the king  and said  as yahweh lives  and as my          lord the king lives  surely in what place my lord the king          shall be  whether for death or for life  even there also will          your servant be           david said to ittai  go and pass over   ittai the gittite          passed over  and all his men  and all the little ones who          were with him           all the country wept with a loud voice  and all the people          passed over   the king also himself passed over the brook kidron           and all the people passed over  toward the way of the wilderness           behold  zadok also  came   and all the levites with him           bearing the ark of the covenant of god  and they set down          the ark of god  and abiathar went up  until all the people          had done passing out of the city           the king said to zadok  carry back the ark of god into the city           if i shall find favor in the eyes of yahweh  he will bring          me again  and show me both it  and his habitation           but if he say thus  i have no delight in you  behold  here am i           let him do to me as seems good to him           the king said also to zadok the priest   aren t you a seer           return into the city in peace  and your two sons with you           ahimaaz your son  and jonathan the son of abiathar           behold  i will stay at the fords of the wilderness  until word          comes from you to inform me            zadok therefore and abiathar carried the ark of god again          to jerusalem   and they abode there           david went up by the ascent of the  mount of  olives  and wept          as he went up  and he had his head covered  and went barefoot           and all the people who were with him covered every man his head           and they went up  weeping as they went up           one told david  saying  ahithophel is among the conspirators          with absalom   david said  yahweh  please turn the counsel          of ahithophel into foolishness           it happened that when david had come to the top  of the ascent            where god was worshiped  behold  hushai the archite came          to meet him with his coat torn  and earth on his head           david said to him  if you pass on with me  then you will be          a burden to me           but if you return to the city  and tell absalom  i will be          your servant  o king  as i have been your father s servant          in time past  so will i now be your servant  then will you          defeat for me the counsel of ahithophel           don t you have zadok and abiathar the priests there with you           therefore it shall be  that whatever thing you shall hear          out of the king s house  you shall tell it to zadok and          abiathar the priests           behold  they have there with them their two sons           ahimaaz  zadok s son  and jonathan  abiathar s son  and by them          you shall send to me everything that you shall hear           so hushai  david s friend  came into the city  and absalom          came into jerusalem           when david was a little past the top  of the ascent   behold           ziba the servant of mephibosheth met him  with a couple          of donkeys saddled  and on them two hundred loaves of bread           and one hundred clusters of raisins  and one hundred summer fruits           and a bottle of wine           the king said to ziba  what do you mean by these           ziba said  the donkeys are for the king s household to ride on           and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat           and the wine  that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink           the king said  where is your master s son   ziba said          to the king  behold  he abides at jerusalem  for he said           today will the house of israel restore me the kingdom          of my father           then said the king to ziba  behold  all that pertains          to mephibosheth is yours   ziba said  i do obeisance           let me find favor in your sight  my lord  o king           when king david came to bahurim  behold  a man of the family of          the house of saul came out  whose name was shimei  the son of gera           he came out  and cursed still as he came           he cast stones at david  and at all the servants of king david           and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right          hand and on his left           thus said shimei when he cursed  be gone  be gone  you man          of blood  and base fellow           yahweh has returned on you all the blood of the house of saul           in whose place you have reigned  and yahweh has delivered          the kingdom into the hand of absalom your son  and behold           you are  taken  in your own mischief  because you are a          man of blood           then said abishai the son of zeruiah to the king            why should this dead dog curse my lord the king           please let me go over and take off his head            the king said  what have i to do with you  you sons          of zeruiah   because he curses  and because yahweh has said          to him  curse david  who then shall say  why have you done so           david said to abishai  and to all his servants  behold           my son  who came forth from my bowels  seeks my life           how much more  may  this benjamite now  do it   let him alone           and let him curse  for yahweh has invited him           it may be that yahweh will look on the wrong done to me           and that yahweh will requite me good for  his  cursing          of me this day           so david and his men went by the way  and shimei went along          on the hillside over against him  and cursed as he went           and threw stones at him  and cast dust           the king  and all the people who were with him  came weary           and he refreshed himself there           absalom  and all the people  the men of israel  came to jerusalem           and ahithophel with him           it happened  when hushai the archite  david s friend  was come          to absalom  that hushai said to absalom   long  live the king            long  live the king           absalom said to hushai  is this your kindness to your friend           why didn t you go with your friend           hushai said to absalom  no  but whom yahweh  and this people           and all the men of israel have chosen  his will i be           and with him will i abide           again  whom should i serve   shouldn t i serve in the presence          of his son  as i have served in your father s presence           so will i be in your presence           then said absalom to ahithophel  give your counsel what          we shall do           ahithophel said to absalom  go in to your father s concubines           that he has left to keep the house  and all israel will hear          that you are abhorred of your father   then will the hands          of all who are with you be strong           so they spread absalom a tent on the top of the house           and absalom went in to his father s concubines in the sight          of all israel           the counsel of ahithophel  which he gave in those days           was as if a man inquired at the oracle of god   so was all          the counsel of ahithophel both with david and with absalom           moreover ahithophel said to absalom  let me now choose          out twelve thousand men  and i will arise and pursue after          david this night           and i will come on him while he is weary and exhausted  and will          make him afraid  and all the people who are with him shall flee           and i will strike the king only           and i will bring back all the people to you   the man whom          you seek is as if all returned    so  all the people shall          be in peace           the saying pleased absalom well  and all the elders of israel           then said absalom  call now hushai the archite also  and let          us hear likewise what he says           when hushai was come to absalom  absalom spoke to him           saying  ahithophel has spoken after this manner           shall we do  after  his saying  if not  speak up           hushai said to absalom  the counsel that ahithophel has given          this time is not good           hushai said moreover  you know your father and his men           that they are mighty men  and they are fierce in their minds           as a bear robbed of her cubs in the field  and your father          is a man of war  and will not lodge with the people           behold  he is hid now in some pit  or in some  other  place           and it will happen  when some of them are fallen at the first           that whoever hears it will say  there is a slaughter among          the people who follow absalom           even he who is valiant  whose heart is as the heart of a lion           will utterly melt  for all israel knows that your father          is a mighty man  and those who are with him are valiant men           but i counsel that all israel be gathered together to you           from dan even to beersheba  as the sand that is by the sea          for multitude  and that you go to battle in your own person           so shall we come on him in some place where he shall be found           and we will light on him as the dew falls on the ground           and of him and of all the men who are with him we will not          leave so much as one           moreover  if he be gotten into a city  then shall all israel          bring ropes to that city  and we will draw it into the river           until there not be one small stone found there           absalom and all the men of israel said  the counsel of hushai          the archite is better than the counsel of ahithophel           for yahweh had ordained to defeat the good counsel of ahithophel           to the intent that yahweh might bring evil on absalom           then said hushai to zadok and to abiathar the priests  thus and          thus did ahithophel counsel absalom and the elders of israel           and thus and thus have i counseled           now therefore send quickly  and tell david  saying  don t lodge          this night at the fords of the wilderness  but by all means          pass over  lest the king be swallowed up  and all the people          who are with him           now jonathan and ahimaaz were staying by en rogel  and a female          servant used to go and tell them  and they went and told king david           for they might not be seen to come into the city           but a boy saw them  and told absalom   and they went both of them          away quickly  and came to the house of a man in bahurim           who had a well in his court  and they went down there           the woman took and spread the covering over the well s mouth           and strewed bruised grain thereon  and nothing was known           absalom s servants came to the woman to the house  and they said           where are ahimaaz and jonathan   the woman said to them           they have gone over the brook of water   when they had sought          and could not find them  they returned to jerusalem           it happened  after they had departed  that they came up          out of the well  and went and told king david  and they          said to david  arise you  and pass quickly over the water           for thus has ahithophel counseled against you           then david arose  and all the people who were with him           and they passed over the jordan   by the morning light there          lacked not one of them who had not gone over the jordan           when ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed           he saddled his donkey  and arose  and got him home  to his city           and set his house in order  and hanged himself  and he died           and was buried in the tomb of his father           then david came to mahanaim   absalom passed over the jordan           he and all the men of israel with him           absalom set amasa over the army instead of joab           now amasa was the son of a man  whose name was ithra          the israelite  who went in to abigail the daughter of nahash           sister to zeruiah  joab s mother           israel and absalom encamped in the land of gilead           it happened  when david was come to mahanaim  that shobi          the son of nahash of rabbah of the children of ammon           and machir the son of ammiel of lodebar  and barzillai          the gileadite of rogelim           brought beds  and basins  and earthen vessels  and wheat           and barley  and meal  and parched  grain   and beans           and lentils  and parched  pulse            and honey  and butter  and sheep  and cheese of the herd           for david  and for the people who were with him  to eat           for they said  the people are hungry  and weary  and thirsty           in the wilderness           david numbered the people who were with him  and set captains          of thousands and captains of hundreds over them           david sent forth the people  a third part under the hand          of joab  and a third part under the hand of abishai the son          of zeruiah  joab s brother  and a third part under the hand          of ittai the gittite   the king said to the people  i will          surely go forth with you myself also           but the people said  you shall not go forth   for if we flee away           they will not care for us  neither if half of us die           will they care for us   but you are worth ten thousand of us           therefore now it is better that you are ready to help us          out of the city           the king said to them  what seems you best i will do           the king stood beside the gate  and all the people went out          by hundreds and by thousands           the king commanded joab and abishai and ittai  saying  deal          gently for my sake with the young man  even with absalom           all the people heard when the king gave all the captains          charge concerning absalom           so the people went out into the field against israel           and the battle was in the forest of ephraim           the people of israel were struck there before the servants          of david  and there was a great slaughter there that day          of twenty thousand men           for the battle was there spread over the surface of all          the country  and the forest devoured more people that day          than the sword devoured           absalom happened to meet the servants of david           absalom was riding on his mule  and the mule went under          the thick boughs of a great oak  and his head caught hold          of the oak  and he was taken up between the sky and earth           and the mule that was under him went on           a certain man saw it  and told joab  and said  behold  i saw          absalom hanging in an oak           joab said to the man who told him  behold  you saw it           and why didn t you strike him there to the ground  and i          would have given you ten  pieces of  silver  and a sash           the man said to joab  though i should receive a thousand           pieces of  silver in my hand  i still wouldn t put forth          my hand against the king s son  for in our hearing the king          charged you and abishai and ittai  saying  beware that none          touch the young man absalom           otherwise if i had dealt falsely against his life  and there          is no matter hid from the king   then you yourself would          have set yourself against  me            then said joab  i may not wait thus with you   he took three darts          in his hand  and thrust them through the heart of absalom           while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak           ten young men who bore joab s armor compassed about and          struck absalom  and killed him           joab blew the trumpet  and the people returned from pursuing          after israel  for joab held back the people           they took absalom  and cast him into the great pit in the forest           and raised over him a very great heap of stones           and all israel fled everyone to his tent           now absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up          for himself the pillar  which is in the king s dale           for he said  i have no son to keep my name in memory           and he called the pillar after his own name  and it is called          absalom s monument  to this day           then said ahimaaz the son of zadok  let me now run  and bear          the king news  how that yahweh has avenged him of his enemies           joab said to him  you shall not be the bearer of news this day           but you shall bear news another day  but this day you shall          bear no news  because the king s son is dead           then said joab to the cushite  go  tell the king what you have seen           the cushite bowed himself to joab  and ran           then said ahimaaz the son of zadok yet again to joab  but come          what may  please let me also run after the cushite           joab said  why will you run  my son  seeing that you will          have no reward for the news           but come what may   said he   i will run   he said to him  run           then ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain  and outran the cushite           now david was sitting between the two gates   and the watchman          went up to the roof of the gate to the wall  and lifted up          his eyes  and looked  and  behold  a man running alone           the watchman cried  and told the king   the king said           if he be alone  there is news in his mouth   he came apace           and drew near           the watchman saw another man running  and the watchman called          to the porter  and said  behold   another  man running alone           the king said  he also brings news           the watchman said  i think the running of the foremost is          like the running of ahimaaz the son of zadok   the king said           he is a good man  and comes with good news           ahimaaz called  and said to the king  all is well           he bowed himself before the king with his face to the earth           and said  blessed be yahweh your god  who has delivered up          the men who lifted up their hand against my lord the king           the king said  is it well with the young man absalom           ahimaaz answered  when joab sent the king s servant           even me your servant  i saw a great tumult  but i don t know          what it was           the king said  turn aside  and stand here   he turned aside           and stood still           behold  the cushite came  and the cushite said  news for my          lord the king  for yahweh has avenged you this day of all          those who rose up against you           the king said to the cushite  is it well with the young          man absalom   the cushite answered  the enemies of my lord          the king  and all who rise up against you to do you hurt           be as that young man is           the king was much moved  and went up to the chamber over the gate           and wept   and as he went  thus he said  my son absalom           my son  my son absalom  would i had died for you  absalom           my son  my son           it was told joab  behold  the king weeps and mourns for absalom           the victory that day was turned into mourning to all the people           for the people heard say that day  the king grieves for his son           the people got them by stealth that day into the city           as people who are ashamed steal away when they flee in battle           the king covered his face  and the king cried with a loud voice           my son absalom  absalom  my son  my son           joab came into the house to the king  and said  you have shamed          this day the faces of all your servants  who this day have saved          your life  and the lives of your sons and of your daughters           and the lives of your wives  and the lives of your concubines           in that you love those who hate you  and hate those who love you           for you have declared this day  that princes and servants are          nothing to you   for this day i perceive that if absalom had lived           and all we had died this day  then it had pleased you well           now therefore arise  go forth  and speak comfortably          to your servants  for i swear by yahweh  if you don t          go forth  there will not stay a man with you this night           and that will be worse to you than all the evil that has          happened to you from your youth until now           then the king arose  and sat in the gate   they told to all          the people  saying  behold  the king is sitting in the gate           and all the people came before the king   now israel had fled          every man to his tent           all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes          of israel  saying  the king delivered us out of the hand of          our enemies  and he saved us out of the hand of the philistines           and now he is fled out of the land from absalom           absalom  whom we anointed over us  is dead in battle           now therefore why don t you speak a word of bringing          the king back           king david sent to zadok and to abiathar the priests  saying           speak to the elders of judah  saying  why are you the last          to bring the king back to his house  seeing the speech of all          israel is come to the king   to bring him  to his house           you are my brothers  you are my bone and my flesh           why then are you the last to bring back the king           say you to amasa  aren t you my bone and my flesh           god do so to me  and more also  if you aren t captain          of the army before me continually in the room of joab           he bowed the heart of all the men of judah  even as  the heart of           one man  so that they sent to the king   saying   return you           and all your servants           so the king returned  and came to the jordan   judah came to gilgal           to go to meet the king  to bring the king over the jordan           shimei the son of gera  the benjamite  who was of bahurim           hurried and came down with the men of judah to meet king david           there were a thousand men of benjamin with him  and ziba          the servant of the house of saul  and his fifteen sons and his          twenty servants with him  and they went through the jordan          in the presence of the king           a ferry boat went to bring over the king s household           and to do what he thought good   shimei the son of gera fell          down before the king  when he was come over the jordan           he said to the king  don t let my lord impute iniquity to me           neither do you remember that which your servant did perversely          the day that my lord the king went out of jerusalem           that the king should take it to his heart           for your servant does know that i have sinned   therefore  behold           i am come this day the first of all the house of joseph to go          down to meet my lord the king           but abishai the son of zeruiah answered  shall shimei not be          put to death for this  because he cursed yahweh s anointed           david said  what have i to do with you  you sons of zeruiah           that you should this day be adversaries to me  shall there          any man be put to death this day in israel  for don t i know          that i am this day king over israel           the king said to shimei  you shall not die   the king          swore to him           mephibosheth the son of saul came down to meet the king           and he had neither dressed his feet  nor trimmed his beard           nor washed his clothes  from the day the king departed until          the day he came home in peace           it happened  when he was come to jerusalem to meet the king           that the king said to him  why didn t you go with me  mephibosheth           he answered  my lord  o king  my servant deceived me           for your servant said  i will saddle me a donkey  that i may          ride thereon  and go with the king  because your servant is lame           he has slandered your servant to my lord the king  but my lord          the king is as an angel of god   do therefore what is good          in your eyes           for all my father s house were but dead men before my lord the king           yet you set your servant among those who ate at your own table           what right therefore have i yet that i should cry any more          to the king           the king said to him  why speak you any more of your matters           i say  you and ziba divide the land           mephibosheth said to the king  yes  let him take all           because my lord the king is come in peace to his own house           barzillai the gileadite came down from rogelim  and he went          over the jordan with the king  to conduct him over the jordan           now barzillai was a very aged man  even eighty years old           and he had provided the king with sustenance while he lay          at mahanaim  for he was a very great man           the king said to barzillai  come you over with me  and i          will sustain you with me in jerusalem           barzillai said to the king  how many are the days of the years          of my life  that i should go up with the king to jerusalem           i am this day eighty years old   can i discern between good          and bad  can your servant taste what i eat or what i drink           can i hear any more the voice of singing men and singing          women  why then should your servant be yet a burden to my          lord the king           your servant would but just go over the jordan with the king           and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward           please let your servant turn back again  that i may die          in my own city  by the grave of my father and my mother           but behold  your servant chimham  let him go over with my lord          the king  and do to him what shall seem good to you           the king answered  chimham shall go over with me           and i will do to him that which shall seem good to you           and whatever you shall require of me  that will i do for you           all the people went over the jordan  and the king went over           and the king kissed barzillai  and blessed him  and he returned          to his own place           so the king went over to gilgal  and chimham went over with him           and all the people of judah brought the king over  and also half          the people of israel           behold  all the men of israel came to the king  and said to the king           why have our brothers the men of judah stolen you away           and brought the king  and his household  over the jordan           and all david s men with him           all the men of judah answered the men of israel  because the king          is a close relative to us   why then are you angry for this          matter  have we eaten at all at the king s cost  or has          he given us any gift           the men of israel answered the men of judah  and said           we have ten parts in the king  and we have also more  right           in david than you   why then did you despise us  that our          advice should not be first had in bringing back our king           the words of the men of judah were fiercer than the words          of the men of israel           there happened to be there a base fellow  whose name was sheba           the son of bichri  a benjamite   and he blew the trumpet           and said  we have no portion in david  neither have we inheritance          in the son of jesse   every man to his tents  israel           so all the men of israel went up from following david           and followed sheba the son of bichri  but the men of judah          joined with their king  from the jordan even to jerusalem           david came to his house at jerusalem  and the king took the ten          women his concubines  whom he had left to keep the house           and put them in custody  and provided them with sustenance           but didn t go in to them   so they were shut up to the day          of their death  living in widowhood           then said the king to amasa  call me the men of judah together          within three days  and be here present           so amasa went to call  the men of  judah together  but he stayed          longer than the set time which he had appointed him           david said to abishai  now will sheba the son of bichri do us          more harm than did absalom   take your lord s servants           and pursue after him  lest he get him fortified cities           and escape out of our sight           there went out after him joab s men  and the cherethites          and the pelethites  and all the mighty men  and they went          out of jerusalem  to pursue after sheba the son of bichri           when they were at the great stone which is in gibeon  amasa came          to meet them   joab was girded with his apparel of war that          he had put on  and thereon was a sash with a sword fastened          on his waist in its sheath  and as he went forth it fell out           joab said to amasa  is it well with you  my brother           joab took amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him           but amasa took no heed to the sword that was in joab s hand           so he struck him therewith in the body  and shed out his bowels          to the ground  and didn t strike him again  and he died           joab and abishai his brother pursued after sheba the son of bichri           there stood by him one of joab s young men  and said  he who          favors joab  and he who is for david  let him follow joab           amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the midst of the highway           when the man saw that all the people stood still  he carried amasa          out of the highway into the field  and cast a garment over him           when he saw that everyone who came by him stood still           when he was removed out of the highway  all the people went          on after joab  to pursue after sheba the son of bichri           he went through all the tribes of israel to abel  and to beth maacah           and all the berites   and they were gathered together           and went also after him           they came and besieged him in abel of beth maacah  and they cast          up a mound against the city  and it stood against the rampart           and all the people who were with joab battered the wall           to throw it down           then cried a wise woman out of the city   hear  hear           please say to joab   come near here  that i may speak with you             he came near to her  and the woman said  are you joab   he answered           i am   then she said to him  hear the words of your handmaid           he answered  i do hear           then she spoke  saying  they were wont to speak in          old time  saying  they shall surely ask  counsel  at abel           and so they ended  the matter            i am of those who are peaceable and faithful in israel           you seek to destroy a city and a mother in israel           why will you swallow up the inheritance of yahweh           joab answered  far be it  far be it from me  that i should          swallow up or destroy           the matter is not so   but a man of the hill country          of ephraim  sheba the son of bichri by name  has lifted          up his hand against the king  even against david           deliver him only  and i will depart from the city           the woman said to joab  behold  his head shall be thrown          to you over the wall           then the woman went to all the people in her wisdom           they cut off the head of sheba the son of bichri           and threw it out to joab   he blew the trumpet  and they          were dispersed from the city  every man to his tent           joab returned to jerusalem to the king           now joab was over all the army of israel  and benaiah the son          of jehoiada was over the cherethites and over the pelethites           and adoram was over the men subject to forced labor           and jehoshaphat the son of ahilud was the recorder           and sheva was scribe  and zadok and abiathar were priests           and also ira the jairite was chief minister to david           there was a famine in the days of david three years           year after year  and david sought the face of yahweh           yahweh said  it is for saul  and for his bloody house           because he put to death the gibeonites           the king called the gibeonites  and said to them  now the gibeonites          were not of the children of israel  but of the remnant of          the amorites  and the children of israel had sworn to them           and saul sought to kill them in his zeal for the children          of israel and judah            and david said to the gibeonites  what shall i do for you           and with what shall i make atonement  that you may bless          the inheritance of yahweh           the gibeonites said to him  it is no matter of silver or gold          between us and saul  or his house  neither is it for us to put          any man to death in israel   he said  what you shall say           that will i do for you           they said to the king  the man who consumed us  and who devised          against us   that  we should be destroyed from remaining          in any of the borders of israel           let seven men of his sons be delivered to us  and we will hang          them up to yahweh in gibeah of saul  the chosen of yahweh           the king said  i will give them           but the king spared mephibosheth  the son of jonathan the son          of saul  because of yahweh s oath that was between them           between david and jonathan the son of saul           but the king took the two sons of rizpah the daughter of aiah           whom she bore to saul  armoni and mephibosheth  and the five          sons of michal the daughter of saul  whom she bore to adriel          the son of barzillai the meholathite           he delivered them into the hands of the gibeonites  and they          hanged them in the mountain before yahweh  and they fell  all           seven together   they were put to death in the days of harvest           in the first days  at the beginning of barley harvest           rizpah the daughter of aiah took sackcloth  and spread it          for her on the rock  from the beginning of harvest until water          was poured on them from the sky  and she allowed neither          the birds of the sky to rest on them by day  nor the animals          of the field by night           it was told david what rizpah the daughter of aiah  the concubine          of saul  had done           david went and took the bones of saul and the bones of jonathan          his son from the men of jabesh gilead  who had stolen them from          the street of beth shan  where the philistines had hanged them           in the day that the philistines killed saul in gilboa           and he brought up from there the bones of saul and the bones          of jonathan his son   and they gathered the bones of those          who were hanged           they buried the bones of saul and jonathan his son in the country          of benjamin in zela  in the tomb of kish his father           and they performed all that the king commanded           after that god was entreated for the land           the philistines had war again with israel  and david went down           and his servants with him  and fought against the philistines           david grew faint           and ishbibenob  who was of the sons of the giant  the weight          of whose spear was three hundred  shekels  of brass in weight           he being girded with a new  sword   thought to have slain david           but abishai the son of zeruiah helped him  and struck          the philistine  and killed him   then the men of david swore          to him  saying  you shall go no more out with us to battle           that you don t quench the lamp of israel           it came to pass after this  that there was again war with the          philistines at gob   then sibbecai the hushathite killed saph           who was of the sons of the giant           there was again war with the philistines at gob  and elhanan          the son of jaareoregim the bethlehemite killed goliath          the gittite s brother  the staff of whose spear was like          a weaver s beam           there was again war at gath  where was a man of great stature           who had on every hand six fingers  and on every foot six toes           four and twenty in number  and he also was born to the giant           when he defied israel  jonathan the son of shimei  david s brother           killed him           these four were born to the giant in gath  and they fell          by the hand of david  and by the hand of his servants           david spoke to yahweh the words of this song in the day          that yahweh delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies           and out of the hand of saul           and he said  yahweh is my rock  my fortress  and my deliverer           even mine           god  my rock  in him i will take refuge  my shield           and the horn of my salvation  my high tower  and my refuge           my savior  you save me from violence           i will call on yahweh  who is worthy to be praised           so shall i be saved from my enemies           for the waves of death surrounded me   the floods of ungodliness          made me afraid           the cords of sheol were around me   the snares of death caught me           in my distress i called on yahweh   yes  i called to my god           he heard my voice out of his temple   my cry  came  into his ears           then the earth shook and trembled   the foundations of heaven          quaked and were shaken  because he was angry           smoke went up out of his nostrils   fire out of his mouth devoured           coals were kindled by it           he bowed the heavens also  and came down   thick darkness          was under his feet           he rode on a cherub  and flew   yes  he was seen on the wings          of the wind           he made darkness pavilions around himself   gathering of waters           and thick clouds of the skies           at the brightness before him  coals of fire were kindled           yahweh thundered from heaven   the most high uttered his voice           he sent out arrows  and scattered them  lightning  and confused them           then the channels of the sea appeared   the foundations of          the world were laid bare by the rebuke of yahweh  at the blast          of the breath of his nostrils           he sent from on high and he took me   he drew me out          of many waters           he delivered me from my strong enemy  from those who hated me           for they were too mighty for me           they came on me in the day of my calamity  but yahweh          was my support           he also brought me out into a large place   he delivered me           because he delighted in me           yahweh rewarded me according to my righteousness           he rewarded me according to the cleanness of my hands           for i have kept the ways of yahweh  and have not wickedly          departed from my god           for all his ordinances were before me   as for his statutes           i did not depart from them           i was also perfect toward him   i kept myself from my iniquity           therefore yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness           according to my cleanness in his eyesight           with the merciful you will show yourself merciful           with the perfect man you will show yourself perfect           with the pure you will show yourself pure   with the crooked          you will show yourself shrewd           you will save the afflicted people  but your eyes are on          the haughty  that you may bring them down           for you are my lamp  yahweh   yahweh will light up my darkness           for by you  i run against a troop   by my god  i leap over a wall           as for god  his way is perfect   the word of yahweh is tested           he is a shield to all those who take refuge in him           for who is god  besides yahweh   who is a rock  besides our god           god is my strong fortress   he makes my way perfect           he makes his feet like hinds   feet   and sets me on          my high places           he teaches my hands to war  so that my arms bend a bow of brass           you have also given me the shield of your salvation           your gentleness has made me great           you have enlarged my steps under me   my feet have not slipped           i have pursued my enemies and destroyed them   i didn t turn          again until they were consumed           i have consumed them  and struck them through  so that they          can t arise   yes  they have fallen under my feet           for you have armed me with strength for the battle           you have subdued under me those who rose up against me           you have also made my enemies turn their backs to me  that i          might cut off those who hate me           they looked  but there was none to save  even to yahweh           but he didn t answer them           then i beat them as small as the dust of the earth           i crushed them as the mire of the streets  and spread them abroad           you also have delivered me from the strivings of my people           you have kept me to be the head of the nations           a people whom i have not known will serve me           the foreigners will submit themselves to me   as soon as they          hear of me  they will obey me           the foreigners will fade away  and will come trembling out          of their close places           yahweh lives   blessed be my rock   exalted be god  the rock          of my salvation           even the god who executes vengeance for me  who brings down          peoples under me           who brings me away from my enemies   yes  you lift me up          above those who rise up against me   you deliver me from          the violent man           therefore i will give thanks to you  yahweh  among the nations           will sing praises to your name           he gives great deliverance to his king  and shows loving kindness          to his anointed  to david and to his seed  forevermore           now these are the last words of david   david the son of jesse says           the man who was raised on high says  the anointed of the god          of jacob  the sweet psalmist of israel           the spirit of yahweh spoke by me   his word was on my tongue           the god of israel said  the rock of israel spoke to me           one who rules over men righteously  who rules in the fear of god            he shall be  as the light of the morning  when the sun rises           a morning without clouds   when  the tender grass  springs           out of the earth  through clear shining after rain           most certainly my house is not so with god  yet he has made          with me an everlasting covenant  ordered in all things           and sure  for it is all my salvation  and all  my  desire           although he doesn t make it grow           but all of the ungodly shall be as thorns to be thrust away           because they can t be taken with the hand           but the man who touches them must be armed with iron and          the staff of a spear   they shall be utterly burned with fire          in  their  place           these are the names of the mighty men whom david had           josheb basshebeth a tahchemonite  chief of the captains           the same was adino the eznite  against eight hundred slain          at one time           after him was eleazar the son of dodai the son of an ahohite           one of the three mighty men with david  when they defied          the philistines who were there gathered together to battle           and the men of israel were gone away           he arose  and struck the philistines until his hand was weary           and his hand froze to the sword  and yahweh worked a great          victory that day  and the people returned after him only          to take spoil           after him was shammah the son of agee a hararite           the philistines were gathered together into a troop           where was a plot of ground full of lentils  and the people          fled from the philistines           but he stood in the midst of the plot  and defended it           and killed the philistines  and yahweh worked a great victory           three of the thirty chief men went down  and came to david          in the harvest time to the cave of adullam  and the troop          of the philistines was encamped in the valley of rephaim           david was then in the stronghold  and the garrison of the          philistines was then in bethlehem           david longed  and said  oh that one would give me water to drink          of the well of bethlehem  which is by the gate           the three mighty men broke through the army of the philistines           and drew water out of the well of bethlehem  that was          by the gate  and took it  and brought it to david           but he would not drink of it  but poured it out to yahweh           he said  be it far from me  yahweh  that i should do this            shall i drink  the blood of the men who went in jeopardy          of their lives  therefore he would not drink it           these things did the three mighty men           abishai  the brother of joab  the son of zeruiah  was chief          of the three   he lifted up his spear against three hundred          and killed them  and had a name among the three           wasn t he most honorable of the three  therefore he was made          their captain   however he didn t attain to the  first  three           benaiah the son of jehoiada  the son of a valiant man of kabzeel           who had done mighty deeds  he killed the two  sons of  ariel          of moab   he went down also and killed a lion in the midst          of a pit in time of snow           he killed an egyptian  a goodly man   and the egyptian had          a spear in his hand  but he went down to him with a staff           and plucked the spear out of the egyptian s hand  and killed          him with his own spear           these things did benaiah the son of jehoiada  and had a name          among the three mighty men           he was more honorable than the thirty  but he didn t attain          to the  first  three   david set him over his guard           asahel the brother of joab was one of the thirty  elhanan the son          of dodo of bethlehem           shammah the harodite  elika the harodite           helez the paltite  ira the son of ikkesh the tekoite           abiezer the

zeruiah           ira the ithrite  gareb the ithrite           uriah the hittite   thirty seven in all           again the anger of yahweh was kindled against israel  and he moved          david against them  saying  go  number israel and judah           the king said to joab the captain of the army  who was with him           go now back and forth through all the tribes of israel           from dan even to beersheba  and number you the people           that i may know the sum of the people           joab said to the king  now yahweh your god add to the people           however many they may be  one hundred times  and may the eyes          of my lord the king see it   but why does my lord the king          delight in this thing           notwithstanding  the king s word prevailed against joab           and against the captains of the army   joab and the captains          of the army went out from the presence of the king  to number          the people of israel           they passed over the jordan  and encamped in aroer  on the right          side of the city that is in the middle of the valley of gad           and to jazer           then they came to gilead  and to the land of tahtim hodshi           and they came to dan jaan  and round about to sidon           and came to the stronghold of tyre  and to all the cities          of the hivites  and of the canaanites  and they went out          to the south of judah  at beersheba           so when they had gone back and forth through all the land           they came to jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days           joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to the king           and there were in israel eight hundred thousand valiant          men who drew the sword  and the men of judah were five          hundred thousand men           david s heart struck him after that he had numbered the people           david said to yahweh  i have sinned greatly in that which i          have done   but now  yahweh  put away  i beg you  the iniquity          of your servant  for i have done very foolishly           when david rose up in the morning  the word of yahweh came          to the prophet gad  david s seer  saying           go and speak to david  thus says yahweh  i offer you three things           choose you one of them  that i may do it to you           so gad came to david  and told him  and said to him  shall seven          years of famine come to you in your land  or will you flee          three months before your foes while they pursue you  or shall          there be three days  pestilence in your land  now advise you           and consider what answer i shall return to him who sent me           david said to gad  i am in a great strait   let us fall          now into the hand of yahweh  for his mercies are great           and let me not fall into the hand of man           so yahweh sent a pestilence on israel from the morning even          to the time appointed  and there died of the people from dan          even to beersheba seventy thousand men           when the angel stretched out his hand toward jerusalem          to destroy it  yahweh repented him of the evil  and said          to the angel who destroyed the people  it is enough           now stay your hand   the angel of yahweh was by the threshing          floor of araunah the jebusite           david spoke to yahweh when he saw the angel who struck the people           and said  behold  i have sinned  and i have done perversely           but these sheep  what have they done   please let your hand          be against me  and against my father s house           gad came that day to david  and said to him  go up  rear an altar          to yahweh in the threshing floor of araunah the jebusite           david went up according to the saying of gad  as yahweh commanded           araunah looked forth  and saw the king and his servants coming          on toward him   and araunah went out  and bowed himself          before the king with his face to the ground           araunah said  why is my lord the king come to his servant           david said  to buy the threshing floor of you  to build an altar          to yahweh  that the plague may be stayed from the people           araunah said to david  let my lord the king take and offer up          what seems good to him   behold  the oxen for the burnt offering           and the threshing instruments and the yokes of the oxen          for the wood           all this  king  does araunah give to the king   araunah said          to the king  yahweh your god accept you           the king said to araunah  no  but i will most certainly          buy it of you at a price   neither will i offer burnt          offerings to yahweh my god which cost me nothing           so david bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty          shekels of silver           david built there an altar to yahweh  and offered burnt offerings          and peace offerings   so yahweh was entreated for the land           and the plague was stayed from israel               all his          princes and his servants  the power of persia and media           the nobles and princes of the provinces  being before him           he displayed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honor          of his excellent majesty many days  even one hundred eighty days           when these days were fulfilled  the king made a seven day          feast for all the people who were present in shushan          the palace  both great and small  in the court of the garden          of the king s palace           there were hangings of white  green  and blue material           fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings          and marble pillars   the couches were of gold and silver           on a pavement of red  white  yellow  and black marble           they gave them drinks in golden vessels of various kinds           including royal wine in abundance  according to the bounty          of the king           in accordance with the law  the drinking was not compulsory           for so the king had instructed all the officials of his house           that they should do according to every man s pleasure           also vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal          house which belonged to king ahasuerus           on the seventh day  when the heart of the king was merry          with wine  he commanded mehuman  biztha  harbona  bigtha           and abagtha  zethar  and carcass  the seven eunuchs who served          in the presence of ahasuerus the king           to bring vashti the queen before the king with the royal crown           to show the people and the princes her beauty           for she was beautiful           but the queen vashti refused to come at the king s commandment          by the eunuchs   therefore the king was very angry  and his          anger burned in him           then the king said to the wise men  who knew the times            for it was the king s custom to consult those who knew          law and judgment           and the next to him were carshena  shethar  admatha  tarshish           meres  marsena  and memucan  the seven princes of persia and media           who saw the king s face  and sat first in the kingdom             what shall we do to the queen vashti according to law           because she has not done the bidding of the king ahasuerus          by the eunuchs            memucan answered before the king and the princes            vashti the queen has not done wrong to just the king           but also to all the princes  and to all the people who are          in all the provinces of the king ahasuerus           for this deed of the queen will become known to all women           causing them to show contempt for their husbands  when it          is reported   king ahasuerus commanded vashti the queen          to be brought in before him  but she didn t come            today  the princesses of persia and media who have heard          of the queen s deed will tell all the king s princes           this will cause much contempt and wrath           if it please the king  let a royal commandment go from him           and let it be written among the laws of the persians and the medes           so that it cannot be altered  that vashti may never again          come before king ahasuerus  and let the king give her royal          estate to another who is better than she           when the king s decree which he shall make is published          throughout all his kingdom  for it is great   all the wives          will give their husbands honor  both great and small            this advice pleased the king and the princes  and the king          did according to the word of memucan           for he sent letters into all the king s provinces  into every          province according to its writing  and to every people          in their language  that every man should rule his own house           speaking in the language of his own people           after these things  when the wrath of king ahasuerus was pacified           he remembered vashti  and what she had done  and what was          decreed against her           then the king s servants who served him said   let beautiful          young virgins be sought for the king           let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom           that they may gather together all the beautiful young          virgins to the citadel of susa  to the women s house           to the custody of hegai the king s eunuch  keeper of the women           let cosmetics be given them           and let the maiden who pleases the king be queen instead of vashti            the thing pleased the king  and he did so           there was a certain jew in the citadel of susa  whose name          was mordecai  the son of jair  the son of shimei  the son          of kish  a benjamite           who had been carried away from jerusalem with the captives          who had been carried away with jeconiah king of judah           whom nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon had carried away           he brought up hadassah  that is  esther  his uncle s daughter           for she had neither father nor mother   the maiden was fair          and beautiful  and when her father and mother were dead           mordecai took her for his own daughter           so it happened  when the king s commandment and his decree          was heard  and when many maidens were gathered together          to the citadel of susa  to the custody of hegai  that esther          was taken into the king s house  to the custody of hegai           keeper of the women           the maiden pleased him  and she obtained kindness from him           he quickly gave her cosmetics and her portions of food           and the seven choice maidens who were to be given her out          of the king s house   he moved her and her maidens to the best          place in the women s house           esther had not made known her people nor her relatives           because mordecai had instructed her that she should not          make it known           mordecai walked every day in front of the court of the women s house           to find out how esther did  and what would become of her           each young woman s turn came to go in to king ahasuerus after          her purification for twelve months  for so were the days of          their purification accomplished  six months with oil of myrrh           and six months with sweet fragrances and with preparations          for beautifying women            the young woman then came to the king like this   whatever she          desired was given her to go with her out of the women s house          to the king s house           in the evening she went  and on the next day she returned          into the second women s house  to the custody of shaashgaz           the king s eunuch  who kept the concubines   she came          in to the king no more  unless the king delighted in her           and she was called by name           now when the turn of esther  the daughter of abihail the uncle          of mordecai  who had taken her for his daughter  came to go in to          the king  she required nothing but what hegai the king s eunuch           the keeper of the women  advised   esther obtained favor          in the sight of all those who looked at her           so esther was taken to king ahasuerus into his royal house          in the tenth month  which is the month tebeth  in the seventh          year of his reign           the king loved esther more than all the women  and she obtained          favor and kindness in his sight more than all the virgins           so that he set the royal crown on her head  and made her queen          instead of vashti           then the king made a great feast for all his princes and his servants           even esther s feast  and he proclaimed a holiday in the provinces           and gave gifts according to the king s bounty           when the virgins were gathered together the second time           mordecai was sitting in the king s gate           esther had not yet made known her relatives nor her people           as mordecai had charged her  for esther obeyed mordecai           like she did when she was brought up by him           in those days  while mordecai was sitting in the king s gate           two of the king s eunuchs  bigthan and teresh  who were doorkeepers           were angry  and sought to lay hands on the king ahasuerus           this thing became known to mordecai  who informed esther the queen           and esther informed the king in mordecai s name           when this matter was investigated  and it was found to be so           they were both hanged on a tree  and it was written in the book          of the chronicles in the king s presence           after these things king ahasuerus promoted haman the son          of hammedatha the agagite  and advanced him  and set his seat          above all the princes who were with him           all the king s servants who were in the king s gate bowed down           and paid homage to haman  for the king had so commanded          concerning him   but mordecai didn t bow down or pay him homage           then the king s servants  who were in the king s gate           said to mordecai   why do you disobey the king s commandment            now it came to pass  when they spoke daily to him  and he didn t          listen to them  that they told haman  to see whether mordecai s          reason would stand  for he had told them that he was a jew           when haman saw that mordecai didn t bow down  nor pay him homage           haman was full of wrath           but he scorned the thought of laying hands on mordecai alone           for they had made known to him mordecai s people           therefore haman sought to destroy all the jews who were throughout          the whole kingdom of ahasuerus  even the mordecai s people           in the first month  which is the month nisan  in the twelfth          year of king ahasuerus  they cast pur  that is  the lot           before haman from day to day  and from month to month           and chose the twelfth month  which is the month adar           haman said to king ahasuerus   there is a certain people          scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all          the provinces of your kingdom  and their laws are different          than other people s  they don t keep the king s laws           therefore it is not for the king s profit to allow them to remain           if it pleases the king  let it be written that they be destroyed           and i will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands          of those who are in charge of the king s business  to bring          it into the king s treasuries            the king took his ring from his hand  and gave it to haman          the son of hammedatha the agagite  the jews  enemy           the king said to haman   the silver is given to you           the people also  to do with them as it seems good to you            then the king s scribes were called in on the first month           on the thirteenth day of the month  and all that haman commanded          was written to the king s satraps  and to the governors who          were over every province  and to the princes of every people           to every province according its writing  and to every people          in their language   it was written in the name of king ahasuerus           and it was sealed with the king s ring           letters were sent by couriers into all the king s provinces           to destroy  to kill  and to cause to perish  all jews           both young and old  little children and women  in one day           even on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month  which is          the month adar  and to plunder their possessions           a copy of the letter  that the decree should be given          out in every province  was published to all the peoples           that they should be ready against that day           the couriers went forth in haste by the king s commandment           and the decree was given out in the citadel of susa           the king and haman sat down to drink  but the city of          shushan was perplexed           now when mordecai found out all that was done  mordecai tore          his clothes  and put on sackcloth with ashes  and went out          into the midst of the city  and wailed loudly and a bitterly           he came even before the king s gate  for no one is allowed          inside the king s gate clothed with sackcloth           in every province  wherever the king s commandment and his          decree came  there was great mourning among the jews  and fasting           and weeping  and wailing  and many lay in sackcloth and ashes           esther s maidens and her eunuchs came and told her this           and the queen was exceedingly grieved   she sent clothing          to mordecai  to replace his sackcloth  but he didn t receive it           then esther called for hathach  one of the king s eunuchs           whom he had appointed to attend her  and commanded him to go          to mordecai  to find out what this was  and why it was           so hathach went out to mordecai  to city square which was          before the king s gate           mordecai told him of all that had happened to him  and the exact          sum of the money that haman had promised to pay to the king s          treasuries for the destruction of the jews           he also gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was          given out in shushan to destroy them  to show it to esther           and to declare it to her  and to urge her to go in to the king           to make supplication to him  and to make request before him           for her people           hathach came and told esther the words of mordecai           then esther spoke to hathach  and gave him a message to mordecai            all the king s servants  and the people of the king s provinces           know  that whoever  whether man or woman  comes to the king          into the inner court without being called  there is one law          for him  that he be put to death  except those to whom          the king might hold out the golden scepter  that he may live           i have not been called to come in to the king these thirty days            they told to mordecai esther s words           then mordecai asked them return answer to esther   don t think          to yourself that you will escape in the king s house any more          than all the jews           for if you remain silent now  then relief and deliverance          will come to the jews from another place  but you and your          father s house will perish   who knows if you haven t come          to the kingdom for such a time as this            then esther asked them to answer mordecai            go  gather together all the jews who are present in shushan           and fast for me  and neither eat nor drink three days           night or day   i and my maidens will also fast the same way           then i will go in to the king  which is against the law           and if i perish  i perish            so mordecai went his way  and did according to all that esther          had commanded him           now it happened on the third day that esther put on her          royal clothing  and stood in the inner court of the king s house           next to the king s house   the king sat on his royal throne          in the royal house  next to the entrance of the house           when the king saw esther the queen standing in the court           she obtained favor in his sight  and the king held          out to esther the golden scepter that was in his hand           so esther came near  and touched the top of the scepter           then the king asked her   what would you like  queen esther   what is          your request   it shall be given you even to the half          of the kingdom            esther said   if it seems good to the king  let the king and haman          come today to the banquet that i have prepared for him            then the king said   bring haman quickly  so that it may be done          as esther has said    so the king and haman came to the banquet          that esther had prepared           the king said to esther at the banquet of wine   what is          your petition   it shall be granted you   what is your request           even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed            then esther answered and said   my petition and my request is this           if i have found favor in the sight of the king  and if it please          the king to grant my petition and to perform my request           let the king and haman come to the banquet that i will prepare          for them  and i will do tomorrow as the king has said            then haman went out that day joyful and glad of heart  but when          haman saw mordecai in the king s gate  that he didn t stand up          nor move for him  he was filled with wrath against mordecai           nevertheless haman restrained himself  and went home           there  he sent and called for his friends and zeresh his wife           haman recounted to them the glory of his riches  the multitude          of his children  all the things in which the king had promoted him           and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants          of the king           haman also said   yes  esther the queen let no man come in with          the king to the banquet that she had prepared but myself           and tomorrow i am also invited by her together with the king           yet all this avails me nothing  so long as i see mordecai          the jew sitting at the king s gate            then zeresh his wife and all his friends said to him            let a gallows be made fifty cubits high  and in the          morning speak to the king about hanging mordecai on it           then go in merrily with the king to the banquet            this pleased haman  so he had the gallows made           on that night  the king couldn t sleep   he commanded the book          of records of the chronicles to be brought  and they were read          to the king           it was found written that mordecai had told of bigthana          and teresh  two of the king s eunuchs  who were doorkeepers           who had tried to lay hands on the king ahasuerus           the king said   what honor and dignity has been bestowed on          mordecai for this    then the king s servants who attended          him said   nothing has been done for him            the king said   who is in the court    now haman had come into          the outer court of the king s house  to speak to the king about          hanging mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him           the king s servants said to him   behold  haman stands in the court            the king said   let him come in            so haman came in   the king said to him   what shall          be done to the man whom the king delights to honor            now haman said in his heart   who would the king delight          to honor more than myself            haman said to the king   for the man whom the king delights to honor           let royal clothing be brought which the king uses to wear           and the horse that the king rides on  and on the head          of which a crown royal is set           let the clothing and the horse be delivered to the hand          of one of the king s most noble princes  that they may          array the man whom the king delights to honor with them           and have him ride on horseback through the city square           and proclaim before him   thus shall it be done to the man          whom the king delights to honor             then the king said to haman   hurry and take the clothing and          the horse  as you have said  and do this for mordecai the jew           who sits at the king s gate   let nothing fail of all that          you have spoken            then haman took the clothing and the horse  and arrayed mordecai           and had him ride through the city square  and proclaimed          before him   thus shall it be done to the man whom the king          delights to honor            mordecai came back to the king s gate  but haman hurried          to his house  mourning and having his head covered           haman recounted to zeresh his wife and all his friends everything          that had happened to him   then his wise men and zeresh his wife          said to him   if mordecai  before whom you have begun to fall           is of jewish descent  you will not prevail against him           but you will surely fall before him            while they were yet talking with him  the king s eunuchs came           and hurried to bring haman to the banquet that esther had prepared           so the king and haman came to banquet with esther the queen           the king said again to esther on the second day at the banquet          of wine   what is your petition  queen esther   it shall          be granted you   what is your request   even to the half          of the kingdom it shall be performed            then esther the queen answered   if i have found favor in your sight           o king  and if it please the king  let my life be given me          at my petition  and my people at my request           for we are sold  i and my people  to be destroyed  to be slain           and to perish   but if we had been sold for bondservants          and bondmaids  i would have held my peace  although the adversary          could not have compensated for the king s loss            then king ahasuerus said to esther the queen   who is he           and where is he who dared presume in his heart to do so            esther said   an adversary and an enemy  even this          wicked haman    then haman was afraid before the king          and the queen           the king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine and went          into the palace garden   haman stood up to make request          for his life to esther the queen  for he saw that there was          evil determined against him by the king           then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place          of the banquet of wine  and haman had fallen on the couch          where esther was   then the king said   will he even assault          the queen in front of me in the house    as the word went          out of the king s mouth  they covered haman s face           then harbonah  one of the eunuchs who were with the king said            behold  the gallows fifty cubits high  which haman has          made for mordecai  who spoke good for the king  is standing          at haman s house    the king said   hang him on it            so they hanged haman on the gallows that he had prepared          for mordecai   then was the king s wrath pacified           on that day  king ahasuerus gave the house of haman  the jews           enemy  to esther the queen   mordecai came before the king           for esther had told what he was to her           the king took off his ring  which he had taken from haman           and gave it to mordecai   esther set mordecai over the          house of haman           esther spoke yet again before the king  and fell down at his feet           and begged him with tears to put away the mischief of haman          the agagite  and his device that he had devised against the jews           then the king held out to esther the golden scepter           so esther arose  and stood before the king           she said   if it pleases the king  and if i have found favor          in his sight  and the thing seem right to the king  and i am          pleasing in his eyes  let it be written to reverse the letters          devised by haman  the son of hammedatha the agagite  which he wrote          to destroy the jews who are in all the king s provinces           for how can i endure to see the evil that would come to my people           how can i endure to see the destruction of my relatives            then king ahasuerus said to esther the queen and to mordecai          the jew   see  i have given esther the house of haman           and him they have hanged on the gallows  because he laid          his hand on the jews           write also to the jews  as it pleases you  in the king s name           and seal it with the king s ring  for the writing which is          written in the king s name  and sealed with the king s ring           may not be reversed by any man            then the king s scribes were called at that time  in the third          month sivan  on the twenty third day of the month           and it was written according to all that mordecai commanded          to the jews  and to the satraps  and the governors and          princes of the provinces which are from india to ethiopia           one hundred twenty seven provinces  to every province according          to its writing  and to every people in their language           and to the jews in their writing  and in their language           he wrote in the name of king ahasuerus  and sealed it with          the king s ring  and sent letters by courier on horseback           riding on royal horses that were bread from swift steeds           in those letters  the king granted the jews who were in every          city to gather themselves together  and to defend their life           to destroy  to kill  and to cause to perish  all the power          of the people and province that would assault them  their little          ones and women  and to plunder their possessions           on one day in all the provinces of king ahasuerus  on the thirteenth          day of the twelfth month  which is the month adar           a copy of the letter  that the decree should be given          out in every province  was published to all the peoples           that the jews should be ready for that day to avenge themselves          on their enemies           so the couriers who rode on royal horses went out           hastened and pressed on by the king s commandment           the decree was given out in the citadel of susa           mordecai went out of the presence of the king in royal          clothing of blue and white  and with a great crown of gold           and with a robe of fine linen and purple  and the city of susa          shouted and was glad           the jews had light  gladness  joy  and honor           in every province  and in every city  wherever the king s commandment          and his decree came  the jews had gladness  joy  a feast           and a good day   many from among the peoples of the land          became jews  for the fear of the jews was fallen on them           now in the twelfth month  which is the month adar           on the thirteenth day of the month  when the king s          commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution           on the day that the enemies of the jews hoped to conquer them            but it was turned out the opposite happened  that the jews          conquered those who hated them            the jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout          all the provinces of the king ahasuerus  to lay hands on          those who wanted to harm them   no one could withstand them           because the fear of them had fallen on all the people           all the princes of the provinces  the satraps  the governors           and those who did the king s business helped the jews           because the fear of mordecai had fallen on them           for mordecai was great in the king s house  and his fame went          out throughout all the provinces  for the man mordecai grew          greater and greater           the jews struck all their enemies with the stroke of the sword           and with slaughter and destruction  and did what they wanted          to those who hated them           in the citadel of susa  the jews killed and destroyed          five hundred men           they killed parshandatha  dalphon  aspatha           poratha  adalia  aridatha           parmashta  arisai  aridai  and vaizatha           the ten sons of haman the son of hammedatha  the jew s enemy           but they didn t lay their hand on the plunder           on that day  the number of those who were slain in the citadel          of susa was brought before the king           the king said to esther the queen   the jews have slain          and destroyed five hundred men in the citadel of susa           including the ten sons of haman  what then have they done in          the rest of the king s provinces   now what is your petition           it shall be granted you   what is your further request           it shall be done            then esther said   if it pleases the king  let it be granted          to the jews who are in shushan to do tomorrow also according          to this day s decree  and let haman s ten sons be hanged          on the gallows            the king commanded this to be done   a decree was given out          in shushan  and they hanged haman s ten sons           the jews who were in shushan gathered themselves together          on the fourteenth day also of the month adar  and killed          three hundred men in shushan  but they didn t lay their hand          on the spoil           the other jews who were in the king s provinces gathered themselves          together  defended their lives  had rest from their enemies           and killed seventy five thousand of those who hated them           but they didn t lay their hand on the plunder           this was done on the thirteenth day of the month adar           and on the fourteenth day of that month they rested and made          it a day of feasting and gladness           but the jews who were in shushan assembled together on          the thirteenth and on the fourteenth days of the month           and on the fifteenth day of that month  they rested           and made it a day of feasting and gladness           therefore the jews of the villages  who live in the unwalled towns           make the fourteenth day of the month adar a day of gladness          and feasting  a good day  and a day of sending presents          of food to one another           mordecai wrote these things  and sent letters to all the jews          who were in all the provinces of the king ahasuerus           both near and far           to enjoin them that they should keep the fourteenth and fifteenth          days of the month adar yearly           as the days in which the jews had rest from their enemies           and the month which was turned to them from sorrow to gladness           and from mourning into a good day  that they should make          them days of feasting and gladness  and of sending presents          of food to one another  and gifts to the needy           the jews accepted the custom that they had begun  as mordecai          had written to them           because haman the son of hammedatha  the agagite  the enemy          of all the jews  had plotted against the jews to destroy them           and had cast  pur   that is the lot  to consume them           and to destroy them           but when this became known to the king  he commanded by letters          that his wicked device  which he had devised against the jews           should return on his own head  and that he and his sons          should be hanged on the gallows           therefore they called these days  purim  purim is the hebrew          plural for pur  which means lot    from the word  pur            therefore because of all the words of this letter           and of that which they had seen concerning this matter           and that which had come to them           the jews established  and imposed on themselves  and on          their descendants  and on all those who joined themselves          to them  so that it should not fail  that they would keep          these two days according to what was written  and according          to its appointed time  every year           and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout          every generation  every family  every province  and every city           and that these days of purim should not fail from among the jews           nor the memory of them perish from their seed           then esther the queen  the daughter of abihail  and mordecai          the jew  wrote with all authority to confirm this second          letter of purim           he sent letters to all the jews  to the hundred twenty seven          provinces of the kingdom of ahasuerus  with words of          peace and truth           to confirm these days of purim in their appointed times           as mordecai the jew and esther the queen had decreed           and as they had imposed upon themselves and their descendants           in the matter of the fastings and their cry           the commandment of esther confirmed these matters of purim           and it was written in the book           king ahasuerus laid a tribute on the land  and on the islands          of the sea           all the acts of his power and of his might  and the full account          of the greatness of mordecai  to which the king advanced him           aren t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings          of media and persia           for mordecai the jew was next to king ahasuerus  and great among          the jews  and accepted by the multitude of his brothers           seeking the good of his people  and speaking peace to          all his descendants               end of the eleventh year of zedekiah           the son of josiah  king of judah  to the carrying away          of jerusalem captive in the fifth month           now the word of yahweh came to me  saying           before i formed you in the belly i knew you  and before you          came forth out of the womb i sanctified you  i have appointed          you a prophet to the nations           then said i  ah  lord yahweh  behold  i don t know how to speak           for i am a child           but yahweh said to me  don t say  i am a child  for to whoever i          shall send you  you shall go  and whatever i shall command you           you shall speak           don t be afraid because of them  for i am with you to          deliver you  says yahweh           then yahweh put forth his hand  and touched my mouth  and yahweh          said to me  behold  i have put my words in your mouth           behold  i have this day set you over the nations and over          the kingdoms  to pluck up and to break down and to destroy          and to overthrow  to build and to plant           moreover the word of yahweh came to me  saying  jeremiah           what see you   i said  i see a rod of an almond tree           then said yahweh to me  you have well seen   for i watch          over my word to perform it           the word of yahweh came to me the second time  saying  what see you           i said  i see a boiling caldron  and the face of it is          from the north           then yahweh said to me  out of the north evil shall break          forth on all the inhabitants of the land           for  behold  i will call all the families of the kingdoms          of the north  says yahweh  and they shall come  and they          shall set everyone his throne at the entrance of the gates          of jerusalem  and against all the walls of it round about           and against all the cities of judah           i will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness           in that they have forsaken me  and have burned incense          to other gods  and worshiped the works of their own hands           you therefore gird up your waist  and arise  and speak          to them all that i command you   don t be dismayed at them           lest i dismay you before them           for  behold  i have made you this day a fortified city           and an iron pillar  and bronze walls  against the whole land           against the kings of judah  against the princes of it           against the priests of it  and against the people of the land           they shall fight against you  but they shall not prevail against you           for i am with you  says yahweh  to deliver you           the word of yahweh came to me  saying           go  and cry in the ears of jerusalem  saying  thus says          yahweh  i remember for you the kindness of your youth  the love          of your weddings  how you went after me in the wilderness           in a land that was not sown           israel  was  holiness to yahweh  the first fruits of his increase           all who devour him shall be held guilty  evil shall come          on them  says yahweh           hear you the word of yahweh  o house of jacob  and all the families          of the house of israel           thus says yahweh  what unrighteousness have your fathers found in me           that they have gone far from me  and have walked after vanity           and are become vain           neither said they  where is yahweh who brought us up out          of the land of egypt  who led us through the wilderness           through a land of deserts and of pits  through a land of          drought and of the shadow of death  through a land that none          passed through  and where no man lived           i brought you into a plentiful land  to eat the fruit of it and          the goodness of it  but when you entered  you defiled my land           and made my heritage an abomination           the priests didn t say  where is yahweh  and those who handle          the law didn t know me   the rulers also transgressed against me           and the prophets prophesied by baal  and walked after things          that do not profit           therefore i will yet contend with you  says yahweh  and with          your children s children will i contend           for pass over to the islands of kittim  and see  and send          to kedar  and consider diligently  and see if there has been          such a thing           has a nation changed  its  gods  which yet are no gods  but my          people have changed their glory for that which does not profit           be astonished  you heavens  at this  and be horribly afraid           be you very desolate  says yahweh           for my people have committed two evils   they have forsaken me           the spring of living waters  and hewed them out cisterns           broken cisterns  that can hold no water           is israel a servant  is he a native born  slave   why is          he become a prey           the young lions have roared on him  and yelled  and they have made          his land waste   his cities are burned up  without inhabitant           the children also of memphis and tahpanhes have broken the crown          of your head           haven t you procured this to yourself  in that you have forsaken          yahweh your god  when he led you by the way           now what have you to do in the way to egypt  to drink the waters          of the shihor  or what have you to do in the way to assyria           to drink the waters of the river           your own wickedness shall correct you  and your backsliding          shall reprove you   know therefore and see that it is an evil          thing and a bitter  that you have forsaken yahweh your god           and that my fear is not in you  says the lord  yahweh of armies           for of old time i have broken your yoke  and burst your bonds           and you said  i will not serve  for on every high hill and under          every green tree you did bow yourself  playing the prostitute           yet i had planted you a noble vine  wholly a right seed           how then are you turned into the degenerate branches of a          foreign vine to me           for though you wash yourself with lye  and use much soap           yet your iniquity is marked before me  says the lord yahweh           how can you say  i am not defiled  i have not gone after          the baals  see your way in the valley  know what you have done            you are  a swift dromedary traversing her ways           a wild donkey used to the wilderness  that snuffs up the wind          in her desire  in her occasion who can turn her away  all          those who seek her will not weary themselves  in her month          they shall find her           withhold your foot from being unshod  and your throat from thirst           but you said  it is in vain  no  for i have loved strangers           and after them will i go           as the thief is ashamed when he is found  so is the house          of israel ashamed  they  their kings  their princes           and their priests  and their prophets           who tell a stock  you are my father  and to a stone  you have          brought me forth   for they have turned their back to me           and not their face  but in the time of their trouble they          will say  arise  and save us           but where are your gods that you have made you  let them arise           if they can save you in the time of your trouble           for according to the number of your cities are your gods  judah           why will you contend with me  you all have transgressed          against me  says yahweh           in vain have i struck your children  they received no correction           your own sword has devoured your prophets  like a destroying lion           generation  see the word of yahweh   have i been a wilderness          to israel  or a land of thick darkness  why say my people           we are broken loose  we will come no more to you           can a virgin forget her ornaments  or a bride her attire  yet          my people have forgotten me days without number           how trimmest you your way to seek love  therefore even the wicked          women have you taught your ways           also in your skirts is found the blood of the souls          of the innocent poor   you did not find them breaking in           but it is because of all these things           yet you said  i am innocent  surely his anger is turned away          from me   behold  i will enter into judgment with you           because you say  i have not sinned           why go you about so much to change your way  you shall be          ashamed of egypt also  as you were ashamed of assyria           from there also shall you go forth  with your hands on your head           for yahweh has rejected those in whom you trust  and you          shall not prosper with them           they say  if a man put away his wife  and she go from him           and become another man s  will he return to her again           won t that land be greatly polluted   but you have played          the prostitute with many lovers  yet return again          to me  says yahweh           lift up your eyes to the bare heights  and see  where have          you not been lain with   by the ways have you sat for them           as an arabian in the wilderness  and you have polluted the land          with your prostitution and with your wickedness           therefore the showers have been withheld  and there has          been no latter rain  yet you have a prostitute s forehead           you refused to be ashamed           will you not from this time cry to me  my father  you are          the guide of my youth           will he retain  his anger  forever  will he keep it to the end           behold  you have spoken and have done evil things  and have          had your way           moreover yahweh said to me in the days of josiah the king           have you seen that which backsliding israel has done  she          is gone up on every high mountain and under every green tree           and there has played the prostitute           i said after she had done all these things  she will return to me           but she didn t return   and her treacherous sister judah saw it           i saw  when  for this very cause that backsliding israel had          committed adultery  i had put her away and given her a bill          of divorce  yet treacherous judah  her sister  didn t fear           but she also went and played the prostitute           it happened through the lightness of her prostitution           that the land was polluted  and she committed adultery          with stones and with stocks           yet for all this her treacherous sister judah has not returned          to me with her whole heart  but only in pretense  says yahweh           yahweh said to me  backsliding israel has shown herself more          righteous than treacherous judah           go  and proclaim these words toward the north  and say           return  you backsliding israel  says yahweh  i will not look          in anger on you  for i am merciful  says yahweh  i will not          keep  anger  forever           only acknowledge your iniquity  that you have transgressed          against yahweh your god  and have scattered your ways to          the strangers under every green tree  and you have not obeyed          my voice  says yahweh           return  backsliding children  says yahweh  for i am a husband to you           and i will take you one of a city  and two of a family           and i will bring you to zion           and i will give you shepherds according to my heart  who shall          feed you with knowledge and understanding           it shall come to pass  when you are multiplied and increased          in the land  in those days  says yahweh  they shall say no more           the ark of the covenant of yahweh  neither shall it come to mind           neither shall they remember it  neither shall they miss it           neither shall it be made any more           at that time they shall call jerusalem the throne of yahweh           and all the nations shall be gathered to it  to the name          of yahweh  to jerusalem   neither shall they walk any more          after the stubbornness of their evil heart           in those days the house of judah shall walk with the house          of israel  and they shall come together out of the land          of the north to the land that i gave for an inheritance          to your fathers           but i said  how i will put you among the children  and give          you a pleasant land  a goodly heritage of the armies          of the nations  and i said  you shall call me my father           and shall not turn away from following me           surely as a wife treacherously departs from her husband  so have          you dealt treacherously with me  house of israel  says yahweh           a voice is heard on the bare heights  the weeping  and           the petitions of the children of israel  because they have          perverted their way  they have forgotten yahweh their god           return  you backsliding children  i will heal your backsliding           behold  we are come to you  for you are yahweh our god           truly in vain is  the help that is looked for  from the hills           the tumult on the mountains   truly in yahweh our god is          the salvation of israel           but the shameful thing has devoured the labor of our fathers          from our youth  their flocks and their herds  their sons          and their daughters           let us lie down in our shame  and let our confusion cover us           for we have sinned against yahweh our god  we and our fathers           from our youth even to this day  and we have not obeyed          the voice of yahweh our god           if you will return  israel  says yahweh  if you will return to me           and if you will put away your abominations out of my sight           then you shall not be removed           and you shall swear  as yahweh lives  in truth  in justice           and in righteousness  and the nations shall bless themselves          in him  and in him shall they glory           for thus says yahweh to the men of judah and to jerusalem  break up          your fallow ground  and don t sow among thorns           circumcise yourselves to yahweh  and take away the foreskins          of your heart  you men of judah and inhabitants of jerusalem           lest my wrath go forth like fire  and burn so that none can          quench it  because of the evil of your doings           declare you in judah  and publish in jerusalem  and say           blow you the trumpet in the land   cry aloud and say           assemble yourselves  and let us go into the fortified cities           set up a standard toward zion   flee for safety  don t stay           for i will bring evil from the north  and a great destruction           a lion is gone up from his thicket  and a destroyer of nations           he is on his way  he is gone forth from his place  to make your          land desolate  that your cities be laid waste  without inhabitant           for this gird you with sackcloth  lament and wail           for the fierce anger of yahweh hasn t turned back from us           it shall happen at that day  says yahweh  that the heart          of the king shall perish  and the heart of the princes           and the priests shall be astonished  and the prophets shall wonder           then said i  ah  lord yahweh  surely you have greatly deceived          this people and jerusalem  saying  you shall have peace           whereas the sword reaches to the life           at that time shall it be said to this people and to jerusalem  a hot          wind from the bare heights in the wilderness toward the daughter          of my people  not to winnow  nor to cleanse           a full wind from these shall come for me   now will i also utter          judgments against them           behold  he shall come up as clouds  and his chariots  shall          be  as the whirlwind   his horses are swifter than eagles           woe to us  for we are ruined           jerusalem  wash your heart from wickedness  that you may be saved           how long shall your evil thoughts lodge within you           for a voice declares from dan  and publishes evil from          the hills of ephraim           make you mention to the nations  behold  publish against jerusalem            that  watchers come from a far country  and give out their          voice against the cities of judah           as keepers of a field are they against her round about           because she has been rebellious against me  says yahweh           your way and your doings have procured these things to you           this is your wickedness  for it is bitter  for it reaches          to your heart           my anguish  my anguish   i am pained at my very heart           my heart is disquieted in me  i can t hold my peace           because you have heard  o my soul  the sound of the trumpet           the alarm of war           destruction on destruction is cried  for the whole land is          laid waste   suddenly are my tents destroyed   and  my curtains          in a moment           how long shall i see the standard  and hear the sound          of the trumpet           for my people are foolish  they don t know me  they are          foolish children  and they have no understanding  they are          wise to do evil  but to do good they have no knowledge           i saw the earth  and  behold  it was waste and void           and the heavens  and they had no light           i saw the mountains  and behold  they trembled  and all the hills          moved back and forth           i saw  and behold  there was no man  and all the birds          of the sky were fled           i saw  and behold  the fruitful field was a wilderness  and all          the cities of it were broken down at the presence of yahweh            and  before his fierce anger           for thus says yahweh  the whole land shall be a desolation           yet will i not make a full end           for this shall the earth mourn  and the heavens above be black           because i have spoken it  i have purposed it  and i have          not repented  neither will i turn back from it           every city flees for the noise of the horsemen and archers           they go into the thickets  and climb up on the rocks           every city is forsaken  and not a man dwells therein           you  when you are made desolate  what will you do           though you clothe yourself with scarlet  though you deck you          with ornaments of gold  though you enlarge your eyes with paint           in vain do you make yourself beautiful   your  lovers despise you           they seek your life           for i have heard a voice as of a woman in travail           the anguish as of her who brings forth her first child           the voice of the daughter of zion  who gasps for breath           who spreads her hands   saying   woe is me now  for my soul          faints before the murderers           run you back and forth through the streets of jerusalem           and see now  and know  and seek in the broad places of it           if you can find a man  if there are any who does justly           who seeks truth  and i will pardon her           though they say  as yahweh lives  surely they swear falsely           o yahweh  don t your eyes look on truth  you have stricken them           but they were not grieved  you have consumed them  but they          have refused to receive correction   they have made their faces          harder than a rock  they have refused to return           then i said  surely these are poor  they are foolish  for they          don t know the way of yahweh  nor the law of their god           i will get me to the great men  and will speak to them           for they know the way of yahweh  and the law of their god           but these with one accord have broken the yoke           and burst the bonds           therefore a lion out of the forest shall kill them  a wolf          of the evenings shall destroy them  a leopard shall watch          against their cities  everyone who goes out there shall          be torn in pieces  because their transgressions are many            and  their backsliding is increased           how can i pardon you  your children have forsaken me  and sworn          by them that are no gods   when i had fed them to the full           they committed adultery  and assembled themselves in troops          at the prostitutes  houses           they were as fed horses roaming at large  everyone neighed          after his neighbor s wife           shall i not visit for these things  says yahweh  and shall          not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this           go up on her walls  and destroy  but don t make a full end           take away her branches  for they are not yahweh s           for the house of israel and the house of judah have dealt          very treacherously against me  says yahweh           they have denied yahweh  and said  it is not he  neither shall          evil come on us  neither shall we see sword nor famine           and the prophets shall become wind  and the word is not in them           thus shall it be done to them           therefore thus says yahweh  the god of armies  because you speak          this word  behold  i will make my words in your mouth fire           and this people wood  and it shall devour them           behold  i will bring a nation on you from far  house of israel           says yahweh   it is a mighty nation  it is an ancient nation           a nation whose language you don t know  neither understand          what they say           their quiver is an open tomb  they are all mighty men           they shall eat up your harvest  and your bread   which  your sons          and your daughters should eat  they shall eat up your flocks          and your herds  they shall eat up your vines and your fig trees           they shall beat down your fortified cities  in which you trust           with the sword           but even in those days  says yahweh  i will not make a full          end with you           it shall happen  when you shall say  why has yahweh our god          done all these things to us  then shall you say to them           like as you have forsaken me  and served foreign gods in your land           so shall you serve strangers in a land that is not yours           declare you this in the house of jacob  and publish it          in judah  saying           hear now this  foolish people  and without understanding           who have eyes  and don t see  who have ears  and don t hear           don t you fear me  says yahweh   won t you tremble at my presence           who have placed the sand for the bound of the sea           by a perpetual decree  that it can t pass it  and though          the waves of it toss themselves  yet they can t prevail           though they roar  yet they can t pass over it           but this people has a revolting and a rebellious heart           they are revolted and gone           neither say they in their heart  let us now fear yahweh our god           who gives rain  both the former and the latter  in its season           who preserves to us the appointed weeks of the harvest           your iniquities have turned away these things  and your sins          have withheld good from you           for among my people are found wicked men   they watch           as fowlers lie in wait  they set a trap  they catch men           as a cage is full of birds  so are their houses full of deceit           therefore they are become great  and grew rich           they are grew fat  they shine   yes  they overpass in deeds          of wickedness  they don t plead the cause  the cause          of the fatherless  that they may prosper  and the right          of the needy they don t judge           shall i not visit for these things  says yahweh  shall not my          soul be avenged on such a nation as this           a wonderful and horrible thing is happen in the land           the prophets prophesy falsely  and the priests bear rule          by their means  and my people love to have it so           and what will you do in the end of it           flee for safety  you children of benjamin  out of the midst          of jerusalem  and blow the trumpet in tekoa  and raise up          a signal on beth haccherem  for evil looks forth from the north           and a great destruction           the comely and delicate one  the daughter of zion  will i cut off           shepherds with their flocks shall come to her  they shall          pitch their tents against her round about  they shall feed          everyone in his place           prepare you war against her  arise  and let us go up at noon           woe to us  for the day declines  for the shadows of the evening          are stretched out           arise  and let us go up by night  and let us destroy her palaces           for thus has yahweh of armies said  hew you down trees  and cast          up a mound against jerusalem   this is the city to be visited           she is wholly oppression in the midst of her           as a well casts forth its waters  so she casts forth her wickedness           violence and destruction is heard in her  before me continually          is sickness and wounds           be instructed  jerusalem  lest my soul be alienated from you           lest i make you a desolation  a land not inhabited           thus says yahweh of armies  they shall thoroughly glean          the remnant of israel as a vine   turn again your hand          as a grape gatherer into the baskets           to whom shall i speak and testify  that they may hear  behold           their ear is uncircumcised  and they can t listen           behold  the word of yahweh is become to them a reproach           they have no delight in it           therefore i am full of the wrath of yahweh  i am weary          with holding in   pour it out on the children in the street           and on the assembly of young men together  for even the husband          with the wife shall be taken  the aged with him who is          full of days           their houses shall be turned to others  their fields and their          wives together  for i will stretch out my hand on the inhabitants          of the land  says yahweh           for from the least of them even to the greatest of them          everyone is given to covetousness  and from the prophet          even to the priest everyone deals falsely           they have healed also the hurt of my people slightly           saying  peace  peace  when there is no peace           were they ashamed when they had committed abomination  nay           they were not at all ashamed  neither could they blush           therefore they shall fall among those who fall  at the time          that i visit them they shall be cast down  says yahweh           thus says yahweh  stand you in the ways and see  and ask          for the old paths  where is the good way  and walk therein           and you shall find rest for your souls   but they said           we will not walk  therein            i set watchmen over you   saying   listen to the sound of the trumpet           but they said  we will not listen           therefore hear  you nations  and know  congregation           what is among them           hear  earth   behold  i will bring evil on this people           even the fruit of their thoughts  because they have not listened          to my words  and as for my law  they have rejected it           to what purpose comes there to me frankincense from sheba           and the sweet cane from a far country  your burnt offerings          are not acceptable  nor your sacrifices pleasing to me           therefore thus says yahweh  behold  i will lay stumbling blocks          before this people  and the fathers and the sons together shall          stumble against them  the neighbor and his friend shall perish           thus says yahweh  behold  a people comes from the north country           and a great nation shall be stirred up from the uttermost          parts of the earth           they lay hold on bow and spear  they are cruel  and have no mercy           their voice roars like the sea  and they ride on horses           everyone set in array  as a man to the battle  against you           daughter of zion           we have heard the report of it  our hands wax feeble           anguish has taken hold of us   and  pangs as of a woman in travail           don t go forth into the field  nor walk by the way           for the sword of the enemy   and  terror  are on every side           daughter of my people  gird you with sackcloth  and wallow          yourself in ashes   make you mourning  as for an only son           most bitter lamentation  for the destroyer shall suddenly          come on us           i have made you a tester of metals  and  a fortress among my people           that you may know and try their way           they are all grievous rebels  going about with slanders           they are brass and iron   they all of them deal corruptly           the bellows blow fiercely  the lead is consumed of the fire           in vain do they go on refining  for the wicked are          not plucked away           refuse silver shall men them  because yahweh has rejected them           the word that came to jeremiah from yahweh  saying           stand in the gate of yahweh s house  and proclaim there          this word  and say  hear the word of yahweh  all you of judah           who enter in at these gates to worship yahweh           thus says yahweh of armies  the god of israel  amend your ways          and your doings  and i will cause you to dwell in this place           don t you trust in lying words  saying  the temple of yahweh           the temple of yahweh  the temple of yahweh  are these           for if you thoroughly amend your ways and your doings           if you thoroughly execute justice between a man and his neighbor           if you don t oppress the foreigner  the fatherless           and the widow  and don t shed innocent blood in this place           neither walk after other gods to your own hurt           then will i cause you to dwell in this place  in the land          that i gave to your fathers  from of old even forevermore           behold  you trust in lying words  that can t profit           will you steal  murder  and commit adultery  and swear falsely           and burn incense to baal  and walk after other gods that you          have not known           and come and stand before me in this house  which is called          by my name  and say  we are delivered  that you may do          all these abominations           is this house  which is called by my name  become a den of robbers          in your eyes   behold  i  even i  have seen it  says yahweh           but go you now to my place which was in shiloh  where i caused          my name to dwell at the first  and see what i did to it          for the wickedness of my people israel           now  because you have done all these works  says yahweh  and i          spoke to you  rising up early and speaking  but you didn t hear           and i called you  but you didn t answer           therefore will i do to the house which is called by my name           in which you trust  and to the place which i gave to you          and to your fathers  as i did to shiloh           i will cast you out of my sight  as i have cast out all          your brothers  even the whole seed of ephraim           therefore don t you pray for this people  neither lift up          a cry nor prayer for them  neither make intercession to me           for i will not hear you           don t you see what they do in the cities of judah and in          the streets of jerusalem           the children gather wood  and the fathers kindle the fire           and the women knead the dough  to make cakes to the queen          of the sky  and to pour out drink offerings to other gods           that they may provoke me to anger           do they provoke me to anger  says yahweh   do they  not           provoke  themselves  to the confusion of their own faces           therefore thus says the lord yahweh   behold  my anger and my          wrath shall be poured out on this place  on man  and on animal           and on the trees of the field  and on the fruit of the ground           and it shall burn  and shall not be quenched           thus says yahweh of armies  the god of israel   add your burnt          offerings to your sacrifices  and eat meat           for i didn t speak to your fathers  nor command them in the day          that i brought them out of the land of egypt  concerning burnt          offerings or sacrifices           but this thing i commanded them  saying  listen to my voice           and i will be your god  and you shall be my people           and walk you in all the way that i command you  that it may          be well with you           but they didn t listen nor turn their ear  but walked in  their          own  counsels  and  in the stubbornness of their evil heart           and went backward  and not forward           since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of egypt          to this day  i have sent to you all my servants the prophets           daily rising up early and sending them           yet they didn t listen to me  nor inclined their ear  but made          their neck stiff   they did worse than their fathers           you shall speak all these words to them  but they will not          listen to you   you shall also call to them  but they will          not answer you           you shall tell them  this is the nation that has not listened          to the voice of yahweh their god  nor received instruction           truth is perished  and is cut off from their mouth           cut off your hair   jerusalem   and cast it away  and take up          a lamentation on the bare heights  for yahweh has rejected          and forsaken the generation of his wrath           for the children of judah have done that which is evil in my sight           says yahweh   they have set their abominations in the house          which is called by my name  to defile it           they have built the high places of topheth  which is          in the valley of the son of hinnom  to burn their sons          and their daughters in the fire  which i didn t command           nor did it come into my mind           therefore  behold  the days come  says yahweh  that it shall          no more be called topheth  nor the valley of the son of hinnom           but the valley of slaughter   for they shall bury in topheth           until there be no place  to bury            the dead bodies of this people shall be food for the birds          of the sky  and for the animals of the earth  and none shall          frighten them away           then will i cause to cease from the cities of judah  and from          the streets of jerusalem  the voice of mirth and the voice          of gladness  the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride           for the land shall become a waste           at that time  says yahweh  they shall bring out the bones          of the kings of judah  and the bones of his princes           and the bones of the priests  and the bones of the prophets           and the bones of the inhabitants of jerusalem  out of their graves           and they shall spread them before the sun  and the moon           and all the army of the sky  which they have loved           and which they have served  and after which they have walked           and which they have sought  and which they have worshiped           they shall not be gathered  nor be buried  they shall be          for dung on the surface of the earth           death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue          that remain of this evil family  that remain in all the places          where i have driven them  says yahweh of armies           moreover you shall tell them  thus says yahweh   shall men fall           and not rise up again   shall one turn away  and not return           why then is this people of jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual          backsliding  they hold fast deceit  they refuse to return           i listened and heard  but they didn t speak aright           no man repents him of his wickedness  saying  what have i          done  everyone turns to his course  as a horse that rushes          headlong in the battle           yes  the stork in the sky knows her appointed times           and the turtledove and the swallow and the crane observe the time          of their coming  but my people don t know yahweh s law           how do you say  we are wise  and the law of yahweh is with us           but  behold  the false pen of the scribes has worked falsely           the wise men are disappointed  they are dismayed and taken           behold  they have rejected the word of yahweh  and what manner          of wisdom is in them           therefore will i give their wives to others  and their          fields to those who shall possess them   for everyone from          the least even to the greatest is given to covetousness           from the prophet even to the priest every one deals falsely           they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly           saying  peace  peace  when there is no peace           were they ashamed when they had committed abomination  nay           they were not at all ashamed  neither could they blush           therefore shall they fall among those who fall  in the time          of their visitation they shall be cast down  says yahweh           i will utterly consume them  says yahweh   there shall be no          grapes on the vine  nor figs on the fig tree  and the leaf          shall fade  and  the things that  i have given them shall          pass away from them           why do we sit still   assemble yourselves  and let us enter          into the fortified cities  and let us be silent there           for yahweh our god has put us to silence  and given us water          of gall to drink  because we have sinned against yahweh           we looked for peace  but no good came   and  for a time of healing           and behold  dismay           the snorting of his horses is heard from dan   at the sound          of the neighing of his strong ones the whole land trembles           for they are come  and have devoured the land and all that is in it           the city and those who dwell therein           for  behold  i will send serpents  adders  among you  which will          not be charmed  and they shall bite you  says yahweh           oh that i could comfort myself against sorrow   my heart          is faint within me           behold  the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people from a land          that is very far off   isn t yahweh in zion   isn t her king in her           why have they provoked me to anger with their engraved images           and with foreign vanities           the harvest is past  the summer is ended  and we are not saved           for the hurt of the daughter of my people am i hurt           i mourn  dismay has taken hold on me           is there no balm in gilead  is there no physician there  why          then isn t the health of the daughter of my people recovered           oh that my head were waters  and my eyes a spring of tears           that i might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter          of my people           oh that i had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men           that i might leave my people  and go from them  for they          are all adulterers  an assembly of treacherous men           they bend their tongue   as it were  their bow  for falsehood           and they are grown strong in the land  but not for truth           for they proceed from evil to evil  and they don t          know me  says yahweh           take you heed everyone of his neighbor  and don t you trust          in any brother  for every brother will utterly supplant           and every neighbor will go about with slanders           they will deceive everyone his neighbor  and will not speak          the truth   they have taught their tongue to speak lies           they weary themselves to commit iniquity           your habitation is in the midst of deceit  through deceit they          refuse to know me  says yahweh           therefore thus says yahweh of armies  behold  i will melt them           and try them  for how  else  should i do  because of the daughter          of my people           their tongue is a deadly arrow  it speaks deceit           one speaks peaceably to his neighbor with his mouth           but in his heart he lays wait for him           shall i not visit them for these things  says yahweh           shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this           for the mountains will i take up a weeping and wailing           and for the pastures of the wilderness a lamentation           because they are burned up  so that none passes through           neither can men hear the voice of the livestock  both the birds          of the sky and the animals are fled  they are gone           i will make jerusalem heaps  a dwelling place of jackals  and i          will make the cities of judah a desolation  without inhabitant           who is the wise man  that may understand this  and  who is           he to whom the mouth of yahweh has spoken  that he may declare          it  why is the land perished and burned up like a wilderness           so that none passes through           yahweh says  because they have forsaken my law which i set          before them  and have not obeyed my voice  neither walked therein           but have walked after the stubbornness of their own heart           and after the baals  which their fathers taught them           therefore thus says yahweh of armies  the god of israel  behold  i          will feed them  even this people  with wormwood  and give          them water of gall to drink           i will scatter them also among the nations  whom neither they nor          their fathers have known  and i will send the sword after them           until i have consumed them           thus says yahweh of armies  consider you  and call for the mourning          women  that they may come  and send for the skillful women           that they may come           and let them make haste  and take up a wailing for us           that our eyes may run down with tears  and our eyelids gush          out with waters           for a voice of wailing is heard out of zion  how are we ruined           we are greatly confounded  because we have forsaken the land           because they have cast down our dwellings           yet hear the word of yahweh  you women  and let your ear receive          the word of his mouth  and teach your daughters wailing           and everyone her neighbor lamentation           for death is come up into our windows  it is entered into our palaces           to cut off the children from outside   and  the young men          from the streets           speak  thus says yahweh  the dead bodies of men shall fall as dung          on the open field  and as the handful after the harvester           and none shall gather  them            thus says yahweh  don t let the wise man glory in his wisdom           neither let the mighty man glory in his might  don t let          the rich man glory in his riches           but let him who glories glory in this  that he has understanding           and knows me  that i am yahweh who exercises loving          kindness  justice  and righteousness  in the earth           for in these things i delight  says yahweh           behold  the days come  says yahweh  that i will punish all          those who are circumcised in  their  uncircumcision           egypt  and judah  and edom  and the children of ammon  and moab           and all that have the corners  of their hair  cut off  who dwell          in the wilderness  for all the nations are uncircumcised           and all the house of israel are uncircumcised in heart           hear the word which yahweh speaks to you  house of israel           thus says yahweh   don t learn the way of the nations           and don t be dismayed at the signs of the sky  for the nations          are dismayed at them           for the customs of the peoples are vanity  for one cuts a tree          out of the forest  the work of the hands of the workman          with the axe           they deck it with silver and with gold  they fasten it with nails          and with hammers  that it not move           they are like a palm tree  of turned work  and don t speak           they must be carried  because they can t go   don t be afraid          of them  for they can t do evil  neither is it in them          to do good            there is none like you  yahweh  you are great  and your name          is great in might           who should not fear you  king of the nations  for to you does          it appertain  because among all the wise men of the nations           and in all their royal estate  there is none like you           but they are together brutish and foolish   the instruction          of idols  it is but a stock           there is silver beaten into plates  which is brought from tarshish           and gold from uphaz  the work of the artificer and of the hands          of the goldsmith  blue and purple for their clothing           they are all the work of skillful men           but yahweh is the true god  he is the living god           and an everlasting king   at his wrath the earth trembles           and the nations are not able to abide his indignation           thus shall you say to them  the gods that have not made          the heavens and the earth  these shall perish from the earth           and from under the heavens           he has made the earth by his power  he has established the world          by his wisdom  and by his understanding has he stretched          out the heavens           when he utters his voice  there is a tumult of waters in the heavens           and he causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth           he makes lightnings for the rain  and brings forth the wind          out of his treasuries           every man is become brutish  and is  without knowledge           every goldsmith is disappointed by his engraved image           for his molten image is falsehood  and there is no breath in them           they are vanity  a work of delusion   in the time of their          visitation they shall perish           the portion of jacob is not like these  for he is the former          of all things  and israel is the tribe of his inheritance           yahweh of armies is his name           gather up your wares out of the land  you who abide in the siege           for thus says yahweh  behold  i will sling out the inhabitants          of the land at this time  and will distress them  that they          may feel  it            woe is me because of my hurt  my wound is grievous           but i said  truly this is  my  grief  and i must bear it           my tent is destroyed  and all my cords are broken           my children are gone forth from me  and they are no more           there is none to spread my tent any more  and to set          up my curtains           for the shepherds are become brutish  and have not inquired          of yahweh   therefore they have not prospered  and all their          flocks are scattered           the voice of news  behold  it comes  and a great commotion out          of the north country  to make the cities of judah a desolation           a dwelling place of jackals           yahweh  i know that the way of man is not in himself           it is not in man who walks to direct his steps           yahweh  correct me  but in measure   not in your anger           lest you bring me to nothing           pour out your wrath on the nations that don t know you           and on the families that don t call on your name           for they have devoured jacob  yes  they have devoured him          and consumed him  and have laid waste his habitation           the word that came to jeremiah from yahweh  saying           hear you the words of this covenant  and speak to the men of judah           and to the inhabitants of jerusalem           and say you to them  thus says yahweh  the god of israel   cursed be          the man who doesn t hear the words of this covenant           which i commanded your fathers in the day that i brought them          forth out of the land of egypt  out of the iron furnace  saying           obey my voice  and do them  according to all which i command you           so shall you be my people  and i will be your god           that i may establish the oath which i swore to your fathers           to give them a land flowing with milk and honey  as at this day           then answered i  and said  amen  yahweh           yahweh said to me  proclaim all these words in the cities of judah           and in the streets of jerusalem  saying  hear you the words          of this covenant  and do them           for i earnestly protested to your fathers in the day that i          brought them up out of the land of egypt  even to this day           rising early and protesting  saying  obey my voice           yet they didn t obey  nor turn their ear  but walked          everyone in the stubbornness of their evil heart           therefore i brought on them all the words of this covenant           which i commanded them to do  but they didn t do them           yahweh said to me  a conspiracy is found among the men of judah           and among the inhabitants of jerusalem           they are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers           who refused to hear my words  and they are gone after other gods          to serve them   the house of israel and the house of judah          have broken my covenant which i made with their fathers           therefore thus says yahweh  behold  i will bring evil on them           which they shall not be able to escape  and they shall cry to me           but i will not listen to them           then shall the cities of judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem          go and cry to the gods to which they offer incense           but they will not save them at all in the time of their trouble           for according to the number of your cities are your gods  judah           and according to the number of the streets of jerusalem have          you set up altars to the shameful thing  even altars to burn          incense to baal           therefore don t you pray for this people  neither lift up cry          nor prayer for them  for i will not hear them in the time          that they cry to me because of their trouble           what has my beloved to do in my house  seeing she has worked          lewdness  with  many  and the holy flesh is passed from you           when you do evil  then you rejoice           yahweh called your name  a green olive tree  beautiful with          goodly fruit   with the noise of a great tumult he has kindled          fire on it  and the branches of it are broken           for yahweh of armies  who planted you  has pronounced evil          against you  because of the evil of the house of israel and          of the house of judah  which they have worked for themselves          in provoking me to anger by offering incense to baal           yahweh gave me knowledge of it  and i knew it   then you shown          me their doings           but i was like a gentle lamb that is led to the slaughter           and i didn t know that they had devised devices against me            saying   let us destroy the tree with the fruit of it           and let us cut him off from the land of the living  that his          name may be no more remembered           but  yahweh of armies  who judges righteously  who tests          the heart and the mind  i shall see your vengeance on them           for to you have i revealed my cause           therefore thus says yahweh concerning the men of anathoth           who seek your life  saying  you shall not prophesy in the name          of yahweh  that you not die by our hand           therefore thus says yahweh of armies  behold  i will punish them           the young men shall die by the sword  their sons and their          daughters shall die by famine           and there shall be no remnant to them   for i will bring evil          on the men of anathoth  even the year of their visitation           righteous are you  yahweh  when i contend with you  yet would          i reason the cause with you   why does the way of the wicked          prosper  why are all they at ease who deal very treacherously           you have planted them  yes  they have taken root  they grow           yes  they bring forth fruit   you are near in their mouth           and far from their heart           but you  yahweh  know me  you see me  and try my heart toward you           pull them out like sheep for the slaughter  and prepare them          for the day of slaughter           how long shall the land mourn  and the herbs of the whole          country wither  for the wickedness of those who dwell therein           the animals are consumed  and the birds  because they said           he shall not see our latter end           if you have run with the footmen  and they have wearied you           then how can you contend with horses  and though in a land          of peace you are secure  yet how will you do in the pride          of the jordan           for even your brothers  and the house of your father  even they          have dealt treacherously with you  even they have cried aloud          after you   don t believe them  though they speak beautiful          words to you           i have forsaken my house  i have cast off my heritage           i have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand          of her enemies           my heritage is become to me as a lion in the forest           she has uttered her voice against me  therefore i have hated her           is my heritage to me as a speckled bird of prey  are the birds          of prey against her round about  go you  assemble all the animals          of the field  bring them to devour           many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard  they have trodden          my portion under foot  they have made my pleasant portion          a desolate wilderness           they have made it a desolation  it mourns to me  being desolate           the whole land is made desolate  because no man lays it to heart           destroyers are come on all the bare heights in the wilderness           for the sword of yahweh devours from the one end of the land          even to the other end of the land   no flesh has peace           they have sown wheat  and have reaped thorns           they have put themselves to pain  and profit nothing           and you shall be ashamed of your fruits  because of the fierce          anger of yahweh           thus says yahweh against all my evil neighbors  who touch          the inheritance which i have caused my people israel to inherit           behold  i will pluck them up from off their land  and will          pluck up the house of judah from among them           it shall happen  after that i have plucked them up  i will return          and have compassion on them  and i will bring them again           every man to his heritage  and every man to his land           it shall happen  if they will diligently learn the ways          of my people  to swear by my name  as yahweh lives           even as they taught my people to swear by baal  then shall          they be built up in the midst of my people           but if they will not hear  then will i pluck up that nation           plucking up and destroying it  says yahweh           thus says yahweh to me  go  and buy you a linen belt  and put          it on your waist  and don t put it in water           so i bought a belt according to the word of yahweh  and put          it on my waist           the word of yahweh came to me the second time  saying           take the belt that you have bought  which is on your waist           and arise  go to the euphrates  and hide it there in a cleft          of the rock           so i went  and hid it by the euphrates  as yahweh commanded me           it happened after many days  that yahweh said to me  arise           go to the euphrates  and take the belt from there  which i          commanded you to hide there           then i went to the euphrates  and dug  and took the belt from          the place where i had hid it  and behold  the belt was marred           it was profitable for nothing           then the word of yahweh came to me  saying           thus says yahweh  after this manner will i mar the pride of judah           and the great pride of jerusalem           this evil people  who refuse to hear my words  who walk in          the stubbornness of their heart  and are gone after other gods          to serve them  and to worship them  shall even be as this belt           which is profitable for nothing           for as the belt cleaves to the waist of a man  so have i caused          to cleave to me the whole house of israel and the whole house          of judah  says yahweh  that they may be to me for a people           and for a name  and for a praise  and for a glory           but they would not hear           therefore you shall speak to them this word   thus says yahweh           the god of israel  every bottle shall be filled with wine           and they shall tell you  do we not certainly know that every          bottle shall be filled with wine           then shall you tell them  thus says yahweh  behold  i will fill          all the inhabitants of this land  even the kings who sit          on david s throne  and the priests  and the prophets           and all the inhabitants of jerusalem  with drunkenness           i will dash them one against another  even the fathers and          the sons together  says yahweh   i will not pity  nor spare           nor have compassion  that i should not destroy them           hear you  and give ear  don t be proud  for yahweh has spoken           give glory to yahweh your god  before he cause darkness           and before your feet stumble on the dark mountains  and           while you look for light  he turn it into the shadow of death           and make it gross darkness           but if you will not hear it  my soul shall weep in secret          for  your  pride  and my eye shall weep sore  and run down          with tears  because yahweh s flock is taken captive           say you to the king and to the queen mother  humble yourselves           sit down  for your headdresses are come down  even the crown          of your glory           the cities of the south are shut up  and there is none to open them           judah is carried away captive  all of it  it is wholly          carried away captive           lift up your eyes  and see those who come from the north           where is the flock that was given you  your beautiful flock           what will you say  when he shall set over you as head those          whom you have yourself taught to be friends to you  shall          not sorrows take hold of you  as of a woman in travail           if you say in your heart  why are these things come on me           for the greatness of your iniquity are your skirts uncovered           and your heels suffer violence           can the ethiopian change his skin  or the leopard his spots           then may you also do good  who are accustomed to do evil           therefore will i scatter them  as the stubble that passes away           by the wind of the wilderness           this is your lot  the portion measured to you from me  says yahweh           because you have forgotten me  and trusted in falsehood           therefore will i also uncover your skirts on your face           and your shame shall appear           i have seen your abominations  even your adulteries           and your neighing  the lewdness of your prostitution           on the hills in the field   woe to you  jerusalem  you will          not be made clean  how long shall it yet be           the word of yahweh that came to jeremiah concerning the drought           judah mourns  and the gates of it languish  they sit in black          on the ground  and the cry of jerusalem is gone up           their nobles send their little ones to the waters           they come to the cisterns  and find no water  they return          with their vessels empty  they are disappointed and confounded           and cover their heads           because of the ground which is cracked  because no rain          has been in the land  the plowmen are disappointed           they cover their heads           yes  the hind also in the field calves  and forsakes  her young            because there is no grass           the wild donkeys stand on the bare heights  they pant for air          like jackals  their eyes fail  because there is no herbage           though our iniquities testify against us  work you for          your name s sake  yahweh  for our backslidings are many           we have sinned against you           you hope of israel  the savior of it in the time of trouble           why should you be as a foreigner in the land  and as a wayfaring          man who turns aside to stay for a night           why should you be like a scared man  as a mighty man who can t          save  yet you  yahweh  are in the midst of us  and we are          called by your name  don t leave us           thus says yahweh to this people  even so have they loved to wander           they have not refrained their feet   therefore yahweh does          not accept them  now he will remember their iniquity           and visit their sins           yahweh said to me  don t pray for this people for  their  good           when they fast  i will not hear their cry  and when they offer          burnt offering and meal offering  i will not accept them           but i will consume them by the sword  and by the famine           and by the pestilence           then said i  ah  lord yahweh  behold  the prophets tell them           you shall not see the sword  neither shall you have famine           but i will give you assured peace in this place           then yahweh said to me  the prophets prophesy lies in my name           i didn t send them  neither have i commanded them  neither spoke          i to them   they prophesy to you a lying vision  and divination           and a thing of nothing  and the deceit of their own heart           therefore thus says yahweh concerning the prophets          who prophesy in my name  and i didn t send them           yet they say  sword and famine shall not be in this land           by sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed           the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the          streets of jerusalem because of the famine and the sword           and they shall have none to bury them  them  their wives           nor their sons  nor their daughters   for i will pour their          wickedness on them           you shall say this word to them  let my eyes run down with          tears night and day  and let them not cease  for the virgin          daughter of my people is broken with a great breach           with a very grievous wound           if i go forth into the field  then  behold  the slain with          the sword  and if i enter into the city  then  behold  those who          are sick with famine  for both the prophet and the priest go          about in the land  and have no knowledge           have you utterly rejected judah  has your soul loathed zion           why have you struck us  and there is no healing for us           we looked for peace  but no good came  and for a time of healing           and behold  dismay           we acknowledge  yahweh  our wickedness  and the iniquity          of our fathers  for we have sinned against you           do not abhor  us   for your name s sake  do not disgrace the throne          of your glory   remember  don t break your covenant with us           are there any among the vanities of the nations that can          cause rain  or can the sky give showers   aren t you he           yahweh our god  therefore we will wait for you  for you          have made all these things           then said yahweh to me  though moses and samuel stood          before me  yet my mind would not be toward this people           cast them out of my sight  and let them go forth           it shall happen  when they tell you  where shall we go          forth  then you shall tell them  thus says yahweh   such as          are for death  to death  and such as are for the sword           to the sword  and such as are for the famine  to the famine           and such as are for captivity  to captivity           i will appoint over them four kinds  says yahweh           the sword to kill  and the dogs to tear  and the birds of the sky           and the animals of the earth  to devour and to destroy           i will cause them to be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms          of the earth  because of manasseh  the son of hezekiah           king of judah  for that which he did in jerusalem           for who will have pity on you  jerusalem  or who will bemoan          you  or who will turn aside to ask of your welfare           you have rejected me  says yahweh  you are gone backward           therefore have i stretched out my hand against you           and destroyed you  i am weary with repenting           i have winnowed them with a fan in the gates of the land           i have bereaved  them  of children  i have destroyed my people           they didn t return from their ways           their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas           i have brought on them against the mother of the young men          a destroyer at noonday   i have caused anguish and terrors          to fall on her suddenly           she who has borne seven languishes  she has given up the spirit           her sun is gone down while it was yet day  she has been          disappointed and confounded   and the residue of them will i          deliver to the sword before their enemies  says yahweh           woe is me  my mother  that you have borne me a man          of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth           i have not lent  neither have men lent to me   yet  everyone          of them does curse me           yahweh said  most certainly i will strengthen you for good           most certainly i will cause the enemy to make supplication          to you in the time of evil and in the time of affliction           can one break iron  even iron from the north  and brass           your substance and your treasures will i give for a spoil          without price  and that for all your sins  even in all your borders           i will make  them  to pass with your enemies into a land          which you don t know  for a fire is kindled in my anger           which shall burn on you           yahweh  you know  remember me  and visit me  and avenge me          of my persecutors  don t take me away in your longsuffering           know that for your sake i have suffered reproach           your words were found  and i ate them  and your words were          to me a joy and the rejoicing of my heart   for i am called          by your name  yahweh  god of armies           i didn t sit in the assembly of those who make merry  nor rejoiced           i sat alone because of your hand  for you have filled          me with indignation           why is my pain perpetual  and my wound incurable  which refuses          to be healed  will you indeed be to me as a deceitful  brook            as waters that fail           therefore thus says yahweh  if you return  then will i bring          you again  that you may stand before me  and if you take          forth the precious from the vile  you shall be as my mouth           they shall return to you  but you shall not return to them           i will make you to this people a fortified bronze wall  and they          shall fight against you  but they shall not prevail against you           for i am with you to save you and to deliver you  says yahweh           i will deliver you out of the hand of the wicked  and i will          redeem you out of the hand of the terrible           the word of yahweh came also to me  saying           you shall not take a wife  neither shall you have sons or daughters           in this place           for thus says yahweh concerning the sons and concerning          the daughters who are born in this place  and concerning          their mothers who bore them  and concerning their fathers          who became the father of them in this land           they shall die grievous deaths   they shall not be lamented           neither shall they be buried  they shall be as dung on the surface          of the ground  and they shall be consumed by the sword           and by famine  and their dead bodies shall be food for the birds          of the sky  and for the animals of the earth           for thus says yahweh  don t enter into the house of mourning           neither go to lament  neither bemoan them  for i have taken          away my peace from this people  says yahweh  even loving          kindness and tender mercies           both great and small shall die in this land  they shall not          be buried  neither shall men lament for them  nor cut themselves           nor make themselves bald for them           neither shall men break  bread  for them in mourning           to comfort them for the dead  neither shall men give them the cup          of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother           you shall not go into the house of feasting to sit with them           to eat and to drink           for thus says yahweh of armies  the god of israel   behold  i will          cause to cease out of this place  before your eyes and in          your days  the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness           the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride           it shall happen  when you shall show this people all these words           and they shall tell you  why has yahweh pronounced all this          great evil against us  or what is our iniquity  or what is          our sin that we have committed against yahweh our god           then shall you tell them  because your fathers have forsaken me           says yahweh  and have walked after other gods  and have          served them  and have worshiped them  and have forsaken me           and have not kept my law           and you have done evil more than your fathers  for  behold           you walk every one after the stubbornness of his evil heart           so that you don t listen to me           therefore will i cast you forth out of this land into the land          that you have not known  neither you nor your fathers           and there shall you serve other gods day and night           for i will show you no favor           therefore  behold  the days come  says yahweh  that it shall          no more be said  as yahweh lives  who brought up the children          of israel out of the land of egypt           but  as yahweh lives  who brought up the children of israel          from the land of the north  and from all the countries where          he had driven them   i will bring them again into their land          that i gave to their fathers           behold  i will send for many fishermen  says yahweh  and they          shall fish them up  and afterward i will send for many hunters           and they shall hunt them from every mountain  and from every hill           and out of the clefts of the rocks           for my eyes are on all their ways  they are not hidden from          my face  neither is their iniquity concealed from my eyes           first i will recompense their iniquity and their sin double           because they have polluted my land with the carcasses          of their detestable things  and have filled my inheritance          with their abominations           yahweh  my strength  and my stronghold  and my refuge in the day          of affliction  to you shall the nations come from the ends          of the earth  and shall say  our fathers have inherited          nothing but lies   even  vanity and things in which there          is no profit           shall a man make to himself gods  which yet are no gods           therefore  behold  i will cause them to know  this once will i          cause them to know my hand and my might  and they shall know          that my name is yahweh           the sin of judah is written with a pen of iron   and  with the point          of a diamond   it is engraved on the tablet of their heart           and on the horns of your altars           while their children remember their altars and their asherim          by the green trees on the high hills           my mountain in the field  i will give your substance and all your          treasures for a spoil   and  your high places  because of sin           throughout all your borders           you  even of yourself  shall discontinue from your heritage          that i gave you  and i will cause you to serve your enemies          in the land which you don t know   for you have kindled a fire          in my anger which shall burn forever           thus says yahweh   cursed is the man who trusts in man           and makes flesh his arm  and whose heart departs from yahweh           for he shall be like the heath in the desert  and shall not          see when good comes  but shall inhabit the parched places          in the wilderness  a salt land and not inhabited           blessed is the man who trusts in yahweh  and whose trust yahweh is           for he shall be as a tree planted by the waters  who spreads          out its roots by the river  and shall not fear when heat comes           but its leaf shall be green  and shall not be careful in the year          of drought  neither shall cease from yielding fruit           the heart is deceitful above all things  and it is          exceedingly corrupt   who can know it           i  yahweh  search the mind  i try the heart  even to give          every man according to his ways  according to the fruit          of his doings           as the partridge that sits on  eggs  which she has not laid           so is he who gets riches  and not by right  in the midst          of his days they shall leave him  and at his end he shall          be a fool           a glorious throne   set  on high from the beginning           is the place of our sanctuary           yahweh  the hope of israel  all who forsake you shall          be disappointed   those who depart from me shall be written          in the earth  because they have forsaken yahweh  the spring          of living waters           heal me  o yahweh  and i shall be healed  save me  and i shall          be saved   for you are my praise           behold  they tell me  where is the word of yahweh  let          it come now           as for me  i have not hurried from being a shepherd after you           neither have i desired the woeful day  you know           that which came out of my lips was before your face           don t be a terror to me   you are my refuge in the day of evil           let them be disappointed who persecute me  but let not me          be disappointed  let them be dismayed  but don t let me          be dismayed  bring on them the day of evil  and destroy them          with double destruction           thus said yahweh to me   go  and stand in the gate of the children          of the people  through which the kings of judah come in           and by which they go out  and in all the gates of jerusalem           and tell them  hear you the word of yahweh  you kings of judah           and all judah  and all the inhabitants of jerusalem           that enter in by these gates           thus says yahweh  take heed to yourselves  and bear no burden          on the sabbath day  nor bring it in by the gates of jerusalem           neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath          day holy  neither do any work   but make the sabbath day           as i commanded your fathers           but they didn t listen  neither turn their ear  but made          their neck stiff  that they might not hear  and might          not receive instruction           it shall happen  if you diligently listen to me  says yahweh           to bring in no burden through the gates of this city          on the sabbath day  but to make the sabbath day holy           to do no work therein           then shall there enter in by the gates of this city          kings and princes sitting on the throne of david           riding in chariots and on horses  they  and their princes           the men of judah  and the inhabitants of jerusalem           and this city shall remain forever           they shall come from the cities of judah  and from the places          round about jerusalem  and from the land of benjamin  and from          the lowland  and from the hill country  and from the south           bringing burnt offerings  and sacrifices  and meal offerings           and frankincense  and bringing  sacrifices of  thanksgiving           to the house of yahweh           but if you will not listen to me to make the sabbath day holy           and not to bear a burden and enter in at the gates of jerusalem          on the sabbath day  then will i kindle a fire in the gates of it           and it shall devour the palaces of jerusalem  and it shall          not be quenched           the word which came to jeremiah from yahweh  saying           arise  and go down to the potter s house  and there i will cause          you to hear my words           then i went down to the potter s house  and behold  he was          making a work on the wheels           when the vessel that he made of the clay was marred in the hand          of the potter  he made it again another vessel  as seemed          good to the potter to make it           then the word of yahweh came to me  saying           house of israel  can t i do with you as this potter  says yahweh           behold  as the clay in the potter s hand  so are you in my hand           house of israel           at what instant i shall speak concerning a nation  and concerning          a kingdom  to pluck up and to break down and to destroy it           if that nation  concerning which i have spoken  turn from their evil           i will repent of the evil that i thought to do to them           at what instant i shall speak concerning a nation  and concerning          a kingdom  to build and to plant it           if they do that which is evil in my sight  that they not obey          my voice  then i will repent of the good  with which i said          i would benefit them           now therefore  speak to the men of judah  and to the inhabitants          of jerusalem  saying  thus says yahweh   behold  i frame          evil against you  and devise a device against you           return you now everyone from his evil way  and amend your ways          and your doings           but they say  it is in vain  for we will walk after our          own devices  and we will do everyone after the stubbornness          of his evil heart           therefore thus says yahweh   ask you now among the nations           who has heard such things  the virgin of israel has done          a very horrible thing           shall the snow of lebanon fail from the rock of the field   or           shall the cold waters that flow down from afar be dried up           for my people have forgotten me  they have burned incense to          false  gods   and they have been made to stumble in their ways           in the ancient paths  to walk in byways  in a way not built up           to make their land an astonishment  and a perpetual hissing           everyone who passes thereby shall be astonished           and shake his head           i will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy           i will show them the back  and not the face  in the day          of their calamity           then said they  come  and let us devise devices against jeremiah           for the law shall not perish from the priest  nor counsel          from the wise  nor the word from the prophet   come  and let          us strike him with the tongue  and let us not give heed          to any of his words           give heed to me  yahweh  and listen to the voice of those who          contend with me           shall evil be recompensed for good  for they have dug a pit          for my soul   remember how i stood before you to speak good          for them  to turn away your wrath from them           therefore deliver up their children to the famine  and give          them over to the power of the sword  and let their wives          become childless  and widows  and let their men be slain of death            and  their young men struck of the sword in battle           let a cry be heard from their houses  when you shall bring          a troop suddenly on them  for they have dug a pit to take me           and hid snares for my feet           yet  yahweh  you know all their counsel against me to kill me           don t forgive their iniquity  neither blot out their sin          from your sight  but let them be overthrown before you           deal you with them in the time of your anger           thus said yahweh  go  and buy a potter s earthen bottle           and  take  of the elders of the people  and of the elders          of the priests           and go forth to the valley of the son of hinnom  which is by          the entry of the gate harsith  and proclaim there the words          that i shall tell you           and say  hear you the word of yahweh  kings of judah           and inhabitants of jerusalem   thus says yahweh of armies           the god of israel  behold  i will bring evil on this place           which whoever hears  his ears shall tingle           because they have forsaken me  and have estranged this place           and have burned incense in it to other gods  that they          didn t know  they and their fathers and the kings of judah           and have filled this place with the blood of innocents           and have built the high places of baal  to burn their sons          in the fire for burnt offerings to baal  which i didn t command           nor spoke it  neither came it into my mind           therefore  behold  the days come  says yahweh  that this place          shall no more be called topheth  nor the valley of the son          of hinnom  but the valley of slaughter           i will make void the counsel of judah and jerusalem in this place           and i will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies           and by the hand of those who seek their life   and their dead          bodies will i give to be food for the birds of the sky           and for the animals of the earth           i will make this city an astonishment  and a hissing           everyone who passes thereby shall be astonished and hiss          because of all the plagues of it           i will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and          the flesh of their daughters  and they shall eat everyone          the flesh of his friend  in the siege and in the distress           with which their enemies  and those who seek their life           shall distress them           then shall you break the bottle in the sight of the men          who go with you           and shall tell them  thus says yahweh of armies   even so will i          break this people and this city  as one breaks a potter s vessel           that can t be made whole again  and they shall bury in topheth           until there be no place to bury           thus will i do to this place  says yahweh  and to the inhabitants          of it  even making this city as topheth           and the houses of jerusalem  and the houses of the kings          of judah  which are defiled  shall be as the place of topheth           even all the houses on whose roofs they have burned incense          to all the army of the sky  and have poured out drink offerings          to other gods           then came jeremiah from topheth  where yahweh had sent him          to prophesy  and he stood in the court of yahweh s house           and said to all the people           thus says yahweh of armies  the god of israel  behold  i will          bring on this city and on all its towns all the evil that i have          pronounced against it  because they have made their neck stiff           that they may not hear my words           now pashhur  the son of immer the priest  who was chief officer          in the house of yahweh  heard jeremiah prophesying these things           then pashhur struck jeremiah the prophet  and put him          in the stocks that were in the upper gate of benjamin           which was in the house of yahweh           it happened on the next day  that pashhur brought forth          jeremiah out of the stocks   then said jeremiah to him           yahweh has not called your name pashhur  but magormissabib           for thus says yahweh  behold  i will make you a terror          to yourself  and to all your friends  and they shall fall          by the sword of their enemies  and your eyes shall see it           and i will give all judah into the hand of the king of babylon           and he shall carry them captive to babylon  and shall kill          them with the sword           moreover i will give all the riches of this city  and all the gains          of it  and all the precious things of it  yes  all the treasures          of the kings of judah will i give into the hand of their enemies           and they shall make them a prey  and take them  and carry          them to babylon           you  pashhur  and all who dwell in your house shall go into captivity           and you shall come to babylon  and there you shall die           and there shall you be buried  you  and all your friends           to whom you have prophesied falsely           yahweh  you have persuaded me  and i was persuaded           you are stronger than i  and have prevailed   i am become          a laughing stock all the day  every one mocks me           for as often as i speak  i cry out  i cry  violence and          destruction  because the word of yahweh is made a reproach to me           and a derision  all the day           if i say  i will not make mention of him  nor speak any more          in his name  then there is in my heart as it were a burning          fire shut up in my bones  and i am weary with forbearing           and i can t  contain            for i have heard the defaming of many  terror on every side           denounce  and we will denounce him   say  all my familiar friends           those who watch for my fall  peradventure he will be persuaded           and we shall prevail against him  and we shall take our          revenge on him           but yahweh is with me as an awesome mighty one   therefore my          persecutors shall stumble  and they shall not prevail           they shall be utterly disappointed  because they have not          dealt wisely  even with an everlasting dishonor which shall          never be forgotten           but  yahweh of armies  who tests the righteous  who sees          the heart and the mind  let me see your vengeance on them           for to you have i revealed my cause           sing to yahweh  praise you yahweh  for he has delivered the soul          of the needy from the hand of evil doers           cursed be the day in which i was born   don t let the day          in which my mother bore me be blessed           cursed be the man who brought news to my father  saying  a boy          is born to you  making him very glad           let that man be as the cities which yahweh overthrew           and didn t repent   and let him hear a cry in the morning           and shouting at noontime           because he didn t kill me from the womb  and so my mother          would have been my grave  and her womb always great           why came i forth out of the womb to see labor and sorrow           that my days should be consumed with shame           the word which came to jeremiah from yahweh  when king zedekiah          sent to him pashhur the son of malchijah  and zephaniah          the son of maaseiah  the priest  saying           please inquire of yahweh for us  for nebuchadnezzar king          of babylon makes war against us   peradventure yahweh          will deal with us according to all his wondrous works           that he may go up from us           then said jeremiah to them  thus shall you tell zedekiah           thus says yahweh  the god of israel  behold  i will turn back          the weapons of war that are in your hands  with which you          fight against the king of babylon  and against the chaldeans          who besiege you  without the walls  and i will gather them          into the midst of this city           i myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand          and with a strong arm  even in anger  and in wrath           and in great indignation           i will strike the inhabitants of this city  both man and animal           they shall die of a great pestilence           afterward  says yahweh  i will deliver zedekiah king of judah           and his servants  and the people  even such as are left in this          city from the pestilence  from the sword  and from the famine           into the hand of nebuchadnezzar king of babylon  and into the hand          of their enemies  and into the hand of those who seek their life           and he shall strike them with the edge of the sword           he shall not spare them  neither have pity  nor have mercy           to this people you shall say  thus says yahweh   behold  i set          before you the way of life and the way of death           he who remains in this city shall die by the sword           and by the famine  and by the pestilence  but he who goes out           and passes over to the chaldeans who besiege you  he shall live           and his life shall be to him for a prey           for i have set my face on this city for evil  and not for good           says yahweh   it shall be given into the hand of the king          of babylon  and he shall burn it with fire           touching the house of the king of judah  hear you the word of yahweh           house of david  thus says yahweh  execute justice in the morning           and deliver him who is robbed out of the hand of the oppressor           lest my wrath go forth like fire  and burn so that none can          quench it  because of the evil of your doings           behold  i am against you  o inhabitant of the valley            and  of the rock of the plain  says yahweh  you that say           who shall come down against us  or who shall enter          into our habitations           i will punish you according to the fruit of your doings           says yahweh  and i will kindle a fire in her forest  and it          shall devour all that is round about her           thus said yahweh   go down to the house of the king of judah           and speak there this word           say  hear the word of yahweh  king of judah  who sits on          the throne of david  you  and your servants  and your people          who enter in by these gates           thus says yahweh   execute you justice and righteousness           and deliver him who is robbed out of the hand of the oppressor           and do no wrong  do no violence  to the foreigner  the fatherless           nor the widow  neither shed innocent blood in this place           for if you do this thing indeed  then shall there enter in by          the gates of this house kings sitting on the throne of david           riding in chariots and on horses  he  and his servants           and his people           but if you will not hear these words  i swear by myself           says yahweh  that this house shall become a desolation           for thus says yahweh concerning the house of the king          of judah   you are gilead to me   and  the head of lebanon            yet  surely i will make you a wilderness   and  cities          which are not inhabited           i will prepare destroyers against you  everyone with his weapons           and they shall cut down your choice cedars  and cast them          into the fire           many nations shall pass by this city  and they shall say every man          to his neighbor  why has yahweh done thus to this great city           then they shall answer  because they forsook the covenant          of yahweh their god  and worshiped other gods  and served them           don t you weep for the dead  neither bemoan him  but weep          sore for him who goes away  for he shall return no more           nor see his native country           for thus says yahweh touching shallum the son of josiah           king of judah  who reigned instead of josiah his father            and  who went forth out of this place   he shall not return          there any more           but in the place where they have led him captive  there shall          he die  and he shall see this land no more           woe to him who builds his house by unrighteousness  and his chambers          by injustice  who uses his neighbor s service without wages           and doesn t give him his hire           who says  i will build me a wide house and spacious chambers           and cuts him out windows  and it is ceiling with cedar           and painted with vermilion           shall you reign  because you strive to excel in cedar           didn t your father eat and drink  and do justice and righteousness           then it was well with him           he judged the cause of the poor and needy  then it was well           wasn t this to know me  says yahweh           but your eyes and your heart are not but for your covetousness           and for shedding innocent blood  and for oppression           and for violence  to do it           therefore thus says yahweh concerning jehoiakim the son of josiah           king of judah   they shall not lament for him   saying   ah my          brother  or  ah sister   they shall not lament for him            saying  ah lord  or  ah his glory           he shall be buried with the burial of a donkey  drawn and cast          forth beyond the gates of jerusalem           go up to lebanon  and cry  and lift up your voice in bashan           and cry from abarim  for all your lovers are destroyed           i spoke to you in your prosperity  but you said  i will not hear           this has been your manner from your youth  that you didn t          obey my voice           the wind shall feed all your shepherds  and your lovers          shall go into captivity   surely then shall you be ashamed          and confounded for all your wickedness           inhabitant of lebanon  who makes your nest in the cedars           how greatly to be pitied shall you be when pangs come on you           the pain as of a woman in travail           as i live  says yahweh  though coniah the son of jehoiakim          king of judah were the signet on my right hand  yet would i          pluck you there           and i will give you into the hand of those who seek your life           and into the hand of them of whom you are afraid  even into          the hand of nebuchadnezzar king of babylon  and into the hand          of the chaldeans           i will cast you out  and your mother who bore you           into another country  where you were not born  and there          shall you die           but to the land whereunto their soul longs to return           there shall they not return           is this man coniah a despised broken vessel  is he a vessel          in which none delights  why are they cast out  he and his seed           and are cast into the land which they don t know           o earth  earth  earth  hear the word of yahweh           thus says yahweh  write you this man childless  a man          who shall not prosper in his days  for no more shall a man          of his seed prosper  sitting on the throne of david           and ruling in judah           woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my          pasture  says yahweh           therefore thus says yahweh  the god of israel  against the          shepherds who feed my people   you have scattered my flock           and driven them away  and have not visited them  behold  i will          visit on you the evil of your doings  says yahweh           i will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries          where i have driven them  and will bring them again to their folds           and they shall be fruitful and multiply           i will set up shepherds over them  who shall feed them           and they shall fear no more  nor be dismayed  neither shall          any be lacking  says yahweh           behold  the days come  says yahweh  that i will raise to david          a righteous branch  and he shall reign as king and deal wisely           and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land           in his days judah shall be saved  and israel shall dwell safely           and this is his name by which he shall be called           yahweh our righteousness           therefore  behold  the days come  says yahweh  that they shall          no more say  as yahweh lives  who brought up the children          of israel out of the land of egypt           but  as yahweh lives  who brought up and who led the seed          of the house of israel out of the north country           and from all the countries where i had driven them           they shall dwell in their own land           concerning the prophets   my heart within me is broken           all my bones shake  i am like a drunken man  and like a man          whom wine has overcome  because of yahweh  and because of          his holy words           for the land is full of adulterers  for because of swearing          the land mourns  the pastures of the wilderness are dried up           their course is evil  and their might is not right           for both prophet and priest are profane  yes  in my house          have i found their wickedness  says yahweh           therefore their way shall be to them as slippery places          in the darkness   they shall be driven on  and fall therein           for i will bring evil on them  even the year of their          visitation  says yahweh           i have seen folly in the prophets of samaria  they prophesied          by baal  and caused my people israel to err           in the prophets of jerusalem also i have seen a horrible thing           they commit adultery  and walk in lies  and they strengthen the hands          of evil doers  so that none does return from his wickedness           they are all of them become to me as sodom  and the inhabitants          of it as gomorrah           therefore thus says yahweh of armies concerning the prophets           behold  i will feed them with wormwood  and make them drink          the water of gall  for from the prophets of jerusalem is          ungodliness gone forth into all the land           thus says yahweh of armies  don t listen to the words of          the prophets who prophesy to you   they teach you vanity           they speak a vision of their own heart  and not out of          the mouth of yahweh           they say continually to those who despise me  yahweh has said           you shall have peace  and to everyone who walks in the stubbornness          of his own heart they say  no evil shall come on you           for who has stood in the council of yahweh  that he should          perceive and hear his word  who has marked my word           and heard it           behold  the storm of yahweh   even his  wrath  is gone forth  yes           a whirling storm   it shall burst on the head of the wicked           the anger of yahweh shall not return  until he has executed           and until he have performed the intents of his heart           in the latter days you shall understand it perfectly           i sent not these prophets  yet they ran   i didn t speak to them           yet they prophesied           but if they had stood in my council  then had they caused my people          to hear my words  and had turned them from their evil way           and from the evil of their doings           am i a god at hand  says yahweh  and not a god afar off           can any hide himself in secret places so that i shall not see          him  says yahweh   don t i fill heaven and earth  says yahweh           i have heard what the prophets have said  who prophesy lies          in my name  saying  i have dreamed  i have dreamed           how long shall this be in the heart of the prophets who prophesy lies           even the prophets of the deceit of their own heart           who think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams          which they tell every man to his neighbor  as their fathers          forgot my name for baal           the prophet who has a dream  let him tell a dream           and he who has my word  let him speak my word faithfully           what is the straw to the wheat  says yahweh           isn t my word like fire  says yahweh  and like a hammer          that breaks the rock in pieces           therefore  behold  i am against the prophets  says yahweh           who steal my words everyone from his neighbor           behold  i am against the prophets  says yahweh  who use          their tongues  and say  he says           behold  i am against those who prophesy lying dreams  says yahweh           and do tell them  and cause my people to err by their lies           and by their vain boasting   yet i didn t send them           nor commanded them  neither do they profit this people          at all  says yahweh           when this people  or the prophet  or a priest  shall ask you           saying  what is the burden of yahweh  then shall you tell them           what burden   i will cast you off  says yahweh           as for the prophet  and the priest  and the people  who shall say           the burden of yahweh  i will even punish that man and his house           thus shall you say everyone to his neighbor  and everyone to          his brother  what has yahweh answered  and  what has yahweh spoken           the burden of yahweh shall you mention no more   for every          man s own word shall be his burden  for you have perverted          the words of the living god  of yahweh of armies our god           thus shall you say to the prophet  what has yahweh answered          you  and  what has yahweh spoken           but if you say  the burden of yahweh  therefore thus          says yahweh   because you say this word  the burden of yahweh           and i have sent to you  saying  you shall not say           the burden of yahweh           therefore  behold  i will utterly forget you  and i will cast          you off  and the city that i gave to you and to your fathers           away from my presence           and i will bring an everlasting reproach on you  and a          perpetual shame  which shall not be forgotten           yahweh shown me  and behold  two baskets of figs set before          the temple of yahweh  after that nebuchadnezzar king of babylon          had carried away captive jeconiah the son of jehoiakim           king of judah  and the princes of judah  with the craftsmen          and smiths  from jerusalem  and had brought them to babylon           one basket had very good figs  like the figs that are first ripe           and the other basket had very bad figs  which could not be eaten           they were so bad           then said yahweh to me  what see you  jeremiah   i said  figs           the good figs  very good  and the bad  very bad  that can t          be eaten  they are so bad           the word of yahweh came to me  saying           thus says yahweh  the god of israel   like these good figs           so will i regard the captives of judah  whom i have sent          out of this place into the land of the chaldeans  for good           for i will set my eyes on them for good  and i will bring them again          to this land   and i will build them  and not pull them down           and i will plant them  and not pluck them up           i will give them a heart to know me  that i am yahweh           and they shall be my people  and i will be their god           for they shall return to me with their whole heart           as the bad figs  which can t be eaten  they are so bad           surely thus says yahweh  so will i give up zedekiah the king          of judah  and his princes  and the residue of jerusalem           who remain in this land  and those who dwell in the land of egypt           i will even give them up to be tossed back and forth among          all the kingdoms of the earth for evil  to be a reproach          and a proverb  a taunt and a curse  in all places where i          shall drive them           i will send the sword  the famine  and the pestilence           among them  until they be consumed from off the land that i          gave to them and to their fathers           the word that came to jeremiah concerning all the people of judah           in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah  king of judah           the same was the first year of nebuchadnezzar king of babylon            which jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of judah           and to all the inhabitants of jerusalem  saying           from the thirteenth year of josiah the son of amon           king of judah  even to this day  these twenty three years           the word of yahweh has come to me  and i have spoken to you           rising up early and speaking  but you have not listened           yahweh has sent to you all his servants the prophets           rising up early and sending them   but you have not listened           nor inclined your ear to hear            saying  return you now everyone from his evil way  and from the evil          of your doings  and dwell in the land that yahweh has given          to you and to your fathers  from of old and even forevermore           and don t go after other gods to serve them or worship them           and don t provoke me to anger with the work of your hands           and i will do you no harm           yet you have not listened to me  says yahweh  that you may provoke          me to anger with the work of your hands to your own hurt           therefore thus says yahweh of armies   because you have not          heard my words           behold  i will send and take all the families of the north           says yahweh  and  i will send  to nebuchadnezzar the king          of babylon  my servant  and will bring them against this land           and against the inhabitants of it  and against all these nations          round about  and i will utterly destroy them  and make them          an astonishment  and a hissing  and perpetual desolations           moreover i will take from them the voice of mirth and the voice          of gladness  the voice of the bridegroom and the voice          of the bride  the sound of the millstones  and the light          of the lamp           this whole land shall be a desolation  and an astonishment           and these nations shall serve the king of babylon seventy years           it shall happen  when seventy years are accomplished           that i will punish the king of babylon  and that nation           says yahweh  for their iniquity  and the land of the chaldeans           and i will make it desolate forever           i will bring on that land all my words which i have pronounced          against it  even all that is written in this book           which jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations           for many nations and great kings shall make bondservants of them           even of them  and i will recompense them according to their deeds           and according to the work of their hands           for thus says yahweh  the god of israel  to me   take this cup          of the wine of wrath at my hand  and cause all the nations           to whom i send you  to drink it           they shall drink  and reel back and forth  and be mad           because of the sword that i will send among them           then took i the cup at yahweh s hand  and made all the nations          to drink  to whom yahweh had sent me            to wit   jerusalem  and the cities of judah  and the kings          of it  and the princes of it  to make them a desolation           an astonishment  a hissing  and a curse  as it is this day           pharaoh king of egypt  and his servants  and his princes           and all his people           and all the mixed people  and all the kings of the land of the uz           and all the kings of the philistines  and ashkelon  and gaza           and ekron  and the remnant of ashdod           edom  and moab  and the children of ammon           and all the kings of tyre  and all the kings of sidon           and the kings of the isle which is beyond the sea           dedan  and tema  and buz  and all who have the corners  of          their hair  cut off           and all the kings of arabia  and all the kings of the mixed          people who dwell in the wilderness           and all the kings of zimri  and all the kings of elam           and all the kings of the medes           and all the kings of the north  far and near  one with another           and all the kingdoms of the world  which are on the surface          of the earth   and the king of sheshach shall drink after them           you shall tell them  thus says yahweh of armies  the god          of israel   drink you  and be drunken  and spew  and fall           and rise no more  because of the sword which i will          send among you           it shall be  if they refuse to take the cup at your hand          to drink  then shall you tell them  thus says yahweh          of armies   you shall surely drink           for  behold  i begin to work evil at the city which is          called by my name  and should you be utterly unpunished           you shall not be unpunished  for i will call for a sword          on all the inhabitants of the earth  says yahweh of armies           therefore prophesy you against them all these words  and tell them           yahweh will roar from on high  and utter his voice from his          holy habitation  he will mightily roar against his fold           he will give a shout  as those who tread  the grapes            against all the inhabitants of the earth           a noise shall come even to the end of the earth  for yahweh          has a controversy with the nations  he will enter into          judgment with all flesh   as for the wicked  he will give          them to the sword  says yahweh           thus says yahweh of armies  behold  evil shall go forth          from nation to nation  and a great storm shall be raised up          from the uttermost parts of the earth           the slain of yahweh shall be at that day from one end          of the earth even to the other end of the earth           they shall not be lamented  neither gathered  nor buried           they shall be dung on the surface of the ground           wail  you shepherds  and cry  and wallow  in ashes            you principal of the flock  for the days of your slaughter          and of your dispersions are fully come  and you shall fall          like a goodly vessel           the shepherds shall have no way to flee  nor the principal          of the flock to escape           a voice of the cry of the shepherds  and the wailing of the          principal of the flock  for yahweh lays waste their pasture           the peaceable folds are brought to silence because of the fierce          anger of yahweh           he has left his covert  as the lion  for their land is become an          astonishment because of the fierceness of the oppressing  sword            and because of his fierce anger           in the beginning of the reign of jehoiakim the son of josiah           king of judah  came this word from yahweh  saying           thus says yahweh   stand in the court of yahweh s house           and speak to all the cities of judah  which come to worship          in yahweh s house  all the words that i command you to speak          to them  don t diminish a word           it may be they will listen  and turn every man from his evil way           that i may repent me of the evil which i purpose to do to them          because of the evil of their doings           you shall tell them  thus says yahweh   if you will not listen          to me  to walk in my law  which i have set before you           to listen to the words of my servants the prophets           whom i send to you  even rising up early and sending them           but you have not listened           then will i make this house like shiloh  and will make this          city a curse to all the nations of the earth           the priests and the prophets and all the people heard jeremiah          speaking these words in the house of yahweh           it happened  when jeremiah had made an end of speaking all          that yahweh had commanded him to speak to all the people           that the priests and the prophets and all the people laid          hold on him  saying  you shall surely die           why have you prophesied in the name of yahweh  saying  this house          shall be like shiloh  and this city shall be desolate           without inhabitant   all the people were gathered to jeremiah          in the house of yahweh           when the princes of judah heard these things  they came up          from the king s house to the house of yahweh  and they sat          in the entry of the new gate of yahweh s  house            then spoke the priests and the prophets to the princes          and to all the people  saying  this man is worthy of death           for he has prophesied against this city  as you have heard          with your ears           then spoke jeremiah to all the princes and to all the people           saying  yahweh sent me to prophesy against this house and          against this city all the words that you have heard           now therefore amend your ways and your doings  and obey the voice          of yahweh your god  and yahweh will repent him of the evil          that he has pronounced against you           but as for me  behold  i am in your hand   do with me as is          good and right in your eyes           only know for certain that  if you put me to death           you will bring innocent blood on yourselves  and on this city           and on the inhabitants of it  for of a truth yahweh has sent          me to you to speak all these words in your ears           then said the princes and all the people to the priests          and to the prophets   this man is not worthy of death           for he has spoken to us in the name of yahweh our god           then rose up certain of the elders of the land  and spoke          to all the assembly of the people  saying           micah the morashtite prophesied in the days of hezekiah king          of judah  and he spoke to all the people of judah  saying           thus says yahweh of armies   zion shall be plowed as a field           and jerusalem shall become heaps  and the mountain of the house          as the high places of a forest           did hezekiah king of judah and all judah put him to death           didn t he fear yahweh  and entreat the favor of yahweh  and yahweh          repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them           thus should we commit great evil against our own souls           there was also a man who prophesied in the name          of yahweh  uriah the son of shemaiah of kiriath jearim           and he prophesied against this city and against this land          according to all the words of jeremiah           and when jehoiakim the king  with all his mighty men           and all the princes  heard his words  the king sought to put          him to death  but when uriah heard it  he was afraid  and fled           and went into egypt           and jehoiakim the king sent men into egypt   namely   elnathan          the son of achbor  and certain men with him  into egypt           and they fetched forth uriah out of egypt  and brought him          to jehoiakim the king  who killed him with the sword           and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people           but the hand of ahikam the son of shaphan was with jeremiah           that they should not give him into the hand of the people          to put him to death           in the beginning of the reign of jehoiakim the son of josiah           king of judah  came this word to jeremiah from yahweh  saying           thus says yahweh to me   make you bonds and bars  and put them          on your neck           and send them to the king of edom  and to the king of moab           and to the king of the children of ammon  and to the king of tyre           and to the king of sidon  by the hand of the messengers          who come to jerusalem to zedekiah king of judah           and give them a charge to their masters  saying  thus says yahweh          of armies  the god of israel  thus shall you tell your masters           i have made the earth  the men and the animals that are on the surface          of the earth  by my great power and by my outstretched arm           and i give it to whom it seems right to me           now have i given all these lands into the hand of nebuchadnezzar          the king of babylon  my servant  and the animals of the field          also have i given him to serve him           all the nations shall serve him  and his son  and his son s son           until the time of his own land come   and then many nations          and great kings shall make him their bondservant           it shall happen  that the nation and the kingdom which will not          serve the same nebuchadnezzar king of babylon  and that will          not put their neck under the yoke of the king of babylon           that nation will i punish  says yahweh  with the sword           and with the famine  and with the pestilence  until i have          consumed them by his hand           but as for you  don t you listen to your prophets  nor to          your diviners  nor to your dreams  nor to your soothsayers           nor to your sorcerers  who speak to you  saying  you shall          not serve the king of babylon           for they prophesy a lie to you  to remove you far from your land           and that i should drive you out  and you should perish           but the nation that shall bring their neck under the yoke          of the king of babylon  and serve him  that  nation  will i let          remain in their own land  says yahweh  and they shall till it           and dwell therein           i spoke to zedekiah king of judah according to all these words           saying  bring your necks under the yoke of the king of babylon           and serve him and his people  and live           why will you die  you and your people  by the sword  by the famine           and by the pestilence  as yahweh has spoken concerning          the nation that will not serve the king of babylon           don t listen to the words of the prophets who speak          to you  saying  you shall not serve the king of babylon           for they prophesy a lie to you           for i have not sent them  says yahweh  but they prophesy          falsely in my name  that i may drive you out  and that you          may perish  you  and the prophets who prophesy to you           also i spoke to the priests and to all this people  saying           thus says yahweh   don t listen to the words of your prophets          who prophesy to you  saying  behold  the vessels of yahweh s          house shall now shortly be brought again from babylon           for they prophesy a lie to you           don t listen to them  serve the king of babylon  and live           why should this city become a desolation           but if they be prophets  and if the word of yahweh be with them           let them now make intercession to yahweh of armies           that the vessels which are left in the house of yahweh           and in the house of the king of judah  and at jerusalem           don t go to babylon           for thus says yahweh of armies concerning the pillars           and concerning the sea  and concerning the bases  and concerning          the residue of the vessels that are left in this city           which nebuchadnezzar king of babylon didn t take           when he carried away captive jeconiah the son of jehoiakim           king of judah  from jerusalem to babylon  and all the nobles          of judah and jerusalem           yes  thus says yahweh of armies  the god of israel           concerning the vessels that are left in the house of yahweh           and in the house of the king of judah  and at jerusalem           they shall be carried to babylon  and there shall they be           until the day that i visit them  says yahweh  then will i          bring them up  and restore them to this place           it happened the same year  in the beginning of the reign of          zedekiah king of judah  in the fourth year  in the fifth month           that hananiah the son of azzur  the prophet  who was of gibeon           spoke to me in the house of yahweh  in the presence of the priests          and of all the people  saying           thus speaks yahweh of armies  the god of israel  saying  i have          broken the yoke of the king of babylon           within two full years will i bring again into this place          all the vessels of yahweh s house  that nebuchadnezzar king          of babylon took away from this place  and carried to babylon           and i will bring again to this place jeconiah the son          of jehoiakim  king of judah  with all the captives of judah           who went to babylon  says yahweh  for i will break the yoke          of the king of babylon           then the prophet jeremiah said to the prophet hananiah          in the presence of the priests  and in the presence of all          the people who stood in the house of yahweh           even the prophet jeremiah said  amen   yahweh do so           yahweh perform your words which you have prophesied           to bring again the vessels of yahweh s house  and all them          of the captivity  from babylon to this place           nevertheless hear you now this word that i speak in your ears           and in the ears of all the people           the prophets who have been before me and before you of old          prophesied against many countries  and against great kingdoms           of war  and of evil  and of pestilence           the prophet who prophesies of peace  when the word of the prophet          shall happen  then shall the prophet be known  that yahweh          has truly sent him           then hananiah the prophet took the bar from off the prophet          jeremiah s neck  and broke it           hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people  saying  thus          says yahweh   even so will i break the yoke of nebuchadnezzar          king of babylon within two full years from off the neck          of all the nations   the prophet jeremiah went his way           then the word of yahweh came to jeremiah  after that hananiah          the prophet had broken the bar from off the neck of the          prophet jeremiah  saying           go  and tell hananiah  saying  thus says yahweh   you have          broken the bars of wood  but you have made in their place          bars of iron           for thus says yahweh of armies  the god of israel   i have put          a yoke of iron on the neck of all these nations  that they may          serve nebuchadnezzar king of babylon  and they shall serve him           and i have given him the animals of the field also           then said the prophet jeremiah to hananiah the prophet           hear now  hananiah   yahweh has not sent you  but you make          this people to trust in a lie           therefore thus says yahweh  behold  i will send you away          from off the surface of the earth   this year you shall die           because you have spoken rebellion against yahweh           so hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month           now these are the words of the letter that jeremiah          the prophet sent from jerusalem to the residue of the elders          of the captivity  and to the priests  and to the prophets           and to all the people  whom nebuchadnezzar had carried away          captive from jerusalem to babylon            after that jeconiah the king  and the queen mother  and the eunuchs            and  the princes of judah and jerusalem  and the craftsmen           and the smiths  were departed from jerusalem            by the hand of elasah the son of shaphan  and gemariah the son          of hilkiah   whom zedekiah king of judah sent to babylon          to nebuchadnezzar king of babylon   saying           thus says yahweh of armies  the god of israel  to all          the captivity  whom i have caused to be carried away captive          from jerusalem to babylon           build you houses  and dwell in them  and plant gardens           and eat the fruit of them           take wives  and father sons and daughters  and take wives          for your sons  and give your daughters to husbands           that they may bear sons and daughters  and multiply you there           and don t be diminished           seek the peace of the city where i have caused you to be carried          away captive  and pray to yahweh for it  for in the peace          of it shall you have peace           for thus says yahweh of armies  the god of israel   don t let          your prophets who are in the midst of you  and your diviners           deceive you  neither listen you to your dreams which you          cause to be dreamed           for they prophesy falsely to you in my name   i have not          sent them  says yahweh           for thus says yahweh  after seventy years are accomplished          for babylon  i will visit you  and perform my good word          toward you  in causing you to return to this place           for i know the thoughts that i think toward you  says yahweh           thoughts of peace  and not of evil  to give you hope in          your latter end           you shall call on me  and you shall go and pray to me           and i will listen to you           you shall seek me  and find me  when you shall search for me          with all your heart           i will be found by you  says yahweh  and i will turn again          your captivity  and i will gather you from all the nations           and from all the places where i have driven you  says yahweh           and i will bring you again to the place from where i caused          you to be carried away captive           because you have said  yahweh has raised us up prophets in babylon           thus says yahweh concerning the king who sits on the throne          of david  and concerning all the people who dwell in this city           your brothers who haven t gone forth with you into captivity           thus says yahweh of armies  behold  i will send on them the sword           the famine  and the pestilence  and will make them like vile figs           that can t be eaten  they are so bad           i will pursue after them with the sword  with the famine           and with the pestilence  and will deliver them to be tossed back          and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth  to be an object          of horror  and an astonishment  and a hissing  and a reproach           among all the nations where i have driven them           because they have not listened to my words  says yahweh           with which i sent to them my servants the prophets  rising up          early and sending them  but you would not hear  says yahweh           hear you therefore the word of yahweh  all you of the captivity           whom i have sent away from jerusalem to babylon           thus says yahweh of armies  the god of israel  concerning ahab          the son of kolaiah  and concerning zedekiah the son of maaseiah           who prophesy a lie to you in my name   behold  i will deliver          them into the hand of nebuchadnezzar king of babylon           and he shall kill them before your eyes           and of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captives of judah          who are in babylon  saying  yahweh make you like zedekiah          and like ahab  whom the king of babylon roasted in the fire           because they have worked folly in israel  and have committed          adultery with their neighbors  wives  and have spoken          words in my name falsely  which i didn t command them           and i am he who knows  and am witness  says yahweh           concerning shemaiah the nehelamite you shall speak  saying           thus speaks yahweh of armies  the god of israel  saying           because you have sent letters in your own name to all the people          who are at jerusalem  and to zephaniah the son of maaseiah           the priest  and to all the priests  saying           yahweh has made you priest in the place of jehoiada the priest           that there may be officers in the house of yahweh           for every man who is mad  and makes himself a prophet           that you should put him in the stocks and in shackles           now therefore  why have you not rebuked jeremiah of anathoth           who makes himself a prophet to you           because he has sent to us in babylon  saying   the captivity           is long   build you houses  and dwell in them  and plant gardens           and eat the fruit of them           zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of          jeremiah the prophet           then came the word of yahweh to jeremiah  saying           send to all them of the captivity  saying  thus says yahweh          concerning shemaiah the nehelamite   because shemaiah has          prophesied to you  and i didn t send him  and he has caused          you to trust in a lie           therefore thus says yahweh  behold  i will punish shemaiah          the nehelamite  and his seed  he shall not have a man to dwell          among this people  neither shall he see the good that i          will do to my people  says yahweh  because he has spoken          rebellion against yahweh           the word that came to jeremiah from yahweh  saying           thus speaks yahweh  the god of israel  saying  write you all          the words that i have spoken to you in a book           for  behold  the days come  says yahweh  that i will turn again          the captivity of my people israel and judah  says yahweh           and i will cause them to return to the land that i gave          to their fathers  and they shall possess it           these are the words that yahweh spoke concerning israel          and concerning judah           for thus says yahweh   we have heard a voice of trembling           of fear  and not of peace           ask now  and see whether a man does travail with child           why do i see every man with his hands on his waist  as a woman          in travail  and all faces are turned into paleness           alas  for that day is great  so that none is like it           it is even the time of jacob s trouble  but he shall be saved          out of it           it shall come to pass in that day  says yahweh of armies  that i          will break his yoke from off your neck  and will burst your bonds           and strangers shall no more make him their bondservant           but they shall serve yahweh their god  and david their king           whom i will raise up to them           therefore don t you be afraid  o jacob my servant  says yahweh           neither be dismayed  israel   for  behold  i will save you          from afar  and your seed from the land of their captivity           and jacob shall return  and shall be quiet and at ease           and none shall make him afraid           for i am with you  says yahweh  to save you   for i will make          a full end of all the nations where i have scattered you           but i will not make a full end of you  but i will correct          you in measure  and will in no way leave you unpunished           for thus says yahweh  your hurt is incurable           and your wound grievous           there is none to plead your cause  that you may be bound up           you have no healing medicines           all your lovers have forgotten you  they don t seek you           for i have wounded you with the wound of an enemy  with the          chastisement of a cruel one  for the greatness of your iniquity           because your sins were increased           why cry you for your hurt  your pain is incurable           for the greatness of your iniquity  because your sins          were increased  i have done these things to you           therefore all those who devour you shall be devoured  and all          your adversaries  everyone of them  shall go into captivity           and those who despoil you shall be a spoil  and all who prey          on you will i give for a prey           for i will restore health to you  and i will heal you          of your wounds  says yahweh  because they have called you          an outcast   saying   it is zion  whom no man seeks after           thus says yahweh   behold  i will turn again the captivity          of jacob s tents  and have compassion on his dwelling places           and the city shall be built on its own hill  and the palace          shall be inhabited after its own manner           out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of those who          make merry   and i will multiply them  and they shall not be few           i will also glorify them  and they shall not be small           their children also shall be as before  and their congregation          shall be established before me  and i will punish all          who oppress them           their prince shall be of themselves  and their ruler shall proceed          from the midst of them  and i will cause him to draw near           and he shall approach to me   for who is he who has had boldness          to approach to me  says yahweh           you shall be my people  and i will be your god           behold  the storm of yahweh   even his  wrath  is gone forth           a sweeping storm   it shall burst on the head of the wicked           the fierce anger of yahweh shall not return  until he has executed           and until he have performed the intents of his heart           in the latter days you shall understand it           at that time  says yahweh  will i be the god of all the families          of israel  and they shall be my people           thus says yahweh  the people who were left of the sword found          favor in the wilderness  even israel  when i went to cause          him to rest           yahweh appeared of old to me   saying   yes  i have loved you          with an everlasting love   therefore with loving kindness          have i drawn you           again will i build you  and you shall be built  o virgin of israel           again shall you be adorned with your tambourines  and shall          go forth in the dances of those who make merry           again shall you plant vineyards on the mountains of samaria           the planters shall plant  and shall enjoy  the fruit of it            for there shall be a day  that the watchmen on the hills          of ephraim shall cry  arise you  and let us go up to zion          to yahweh our god           for thus says yahweh  sing with gladness for jacob  and shout          for the chief of the nations   publish you  praise you           and say  yahweh  save your people  the remnant of israel           behold  i will bring them from the north country           and gather them from the uttermost parts of the earth            and  with them the blind and the lame  the woman          with child and her who travails with child together           a great company shall they return here           they shall come with weeping  and with petitions will i lead them           i will cause them to walk by rivers of waters  in a straight way          in which they shall not stumble  for i am a father to israel           and ephraim is my firstborn           hear the word of yahweh  you nations  and declare it in the islands          afar off  and say  he who scattered israel will gather him           and keep him  as shepherd does his flock           for yahweh has ransomed jacob  and redeemed him from the hand          of him who was stronger than he           they shall come and sing in the height of zion  and shall flow          to the goodness of yahweh  to the grain  and to the new wine           and to the oil  and to the young of the flock and of the herd           and their soul shall be as a watered garden  and they shall          not sorrow any more at all           then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance  and the young men          and the old together  for i will turn their mourning into joy           and will comfort them  and make them rejoice from their sorrow           i will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness  and my          people shall be satisfied with my goodness  says yahweh           thus says yahweh   a voice is heard in ramah  lamentation           and bitter weeping  rachel weeping for her children           she refuses to be comforted for her children  because they          are no more           thus says yahweh   refrain your voice from weeping  and your          eyes from tears  for your work shall be rewarded  says yahweh           and they shall come again from the land of the enemy           there is hope for your latter end  says yahweh  and  your           children shall come again to their own border           i have surely heard ephraim bemoaning himself  thus            you have chastised me  and i was chastised  as a calf          unaccustomed  to the yoke   turn you me  and i shall be turned           for you are yahweh my god           surely after that i was turned  i repented  and after that i          was instructed  i struck on my thigh   i was ashamed  yes           even confounded  because i did bear the reproach of my youth           is ephraim my dear son  is he a darling child  for as often          as i speak against him  i do earnestly remember him still           therefore my heart yearns for him  i will surely have mercy          on him  says yahweh           set up road signs  make guideposts  set your heart toward          the highway  even the way by which you went   turn again           virgin of israel  turn again to these your cities           how long will you go here and there  you backsliding          daughter  for yahweh has created a new thing in the earth           a woman shall encompass a man           thus says yahweh of armies  the god of israel  yet again shall they          use this speech in the land of judah and in the cities of it           when i shall bring again their captivity   yahweh bless you           habitation of righteousness  mountain of holiness           judah and all the cities of it shall dwell therein together           the farmers  and those who go about with flocks           for i have satiated the weary soul  and every sorrowful soul          have i replenished           on this i awakened  and saw  and my sleep was sweet to me           behold  the days come  says yahweh  that i will sow the house          of israel and the house of judah with the seed of man           and with the seed of animal           it shall happen that  like as i have watched over them to pluck up          and to break down and to overthrow and to destroy and to afflict           so will i watch over them to build and to plant  says yahweh           in those days they shall say no more  the fathers have eaten          sour grapes  and the children s teeth are set on edge           but everyone shall die for his own iniquity   every man who eats          the sour grapes  his teeth shall be set on edge           behold  the days come  says yahweh  that i will make a new          covenant with the house of israel  and with the house of judah           not according to the covenant that i made with their fathers          in the day that i took them by the hand to bring them          out of the land of egypt  which my covenant they broke           although i was a husband to them  says yahweh           but this is the covenant that i will make with the house          of israel after those days  says yahweh   i will put my law          in their inward parts  and in their heart will i write it           and i will be their god  and they shall be my people           and they shall teach no more every man his neighbor  and every man          his brother  saying  know yahweh  for they shall all know me           from the least of them to the greatest of them  says yahweh           for i will forgive their iniquity  and their sin will i          remember no more           thus says yahweh  who gives the sun for a light by day           and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light          by night  who stirs up the sea  so that the waves of it roar           yahweh of armies is his name           if these ordinances depart from before me  says yahweh           then the seed of israel also shall cease from being a nation          before me forever           thus says yahweh   if heaven above can be measured           and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath           then will i also cast off all the seed of israel for all          that they have done  says yahweh           behold  the days come  says yahweh  that the city shall be built          to yahweh from the tower of hananel to the gate of the corner           the measuring line shall go out further straight onward          to the hill gareb  and shall turn about to goah           the whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes           and all the fields to the brook kidron  to the corner          of the horse gate toward the east  shall be holy to yahweh           it shall not be plucked up  nor thrown down any more forever           the word that came to jeremiah from yahweh in the tenth          year of zedekiah king of judah  which was the eighteenth          year of nebuchadnezzar           now at that time the king of babylon s army was besieging jerusalem           and jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard           which was in the king of judah s house           for zedekiah king of judah had shut him up  saying  why do          you prophesy  and say  thus says yahweh  behold  i will          give this city into the hand of the king of babylon           and he shall take it           and zedekiah king of judah shall not escape out of the hand          of the chaldeans  but shall surely be delivered into the hand          of the king of babylon  and shall speak with him mouth to mouth           and his eyes shall see his eyes           and he shall bring zedekiah to babylon  and there shall he be until          i visit him  says yahweh   though you fight with the chaldeans           you shall not prosper           jeremiah said  the word of yahweh came to me  saying           behold  hanamel the son of shallum your uncle shall come          to you  saying  buy you my field that is in anathoth           for the right of redemption is yours to buy it           so hanamel my uncle s son came to me in the court of the guard          according to the word of yahweh  and said to me  please buy          my field that is in anathoth  which is in the land of benjamin           for the right of inheritance is yours  and the redemption          is yours  buy it for yourself   then i knew that this was          the word of yahweh           i bought the field that was in anathoth of hanamel my uncle s son           and weighed him the money  even seventeen shekels of silver           i subscribed the deed  and sealed it  and called witnesses           and weighed him the money in the balances           so i took the deed of the purchase  both that which was sealed           containing the terms and conditions  and that which was open           and i delivered the deed of the purchase to baruch the son of neriah           the son of mahseiah  in the presence of hanamel my uncle s son           and in the presence of the witnesses who subscribed the deed          of the purchase  before all the jews who sat in the court          of the guard           i charged baruch before them  saying           thus says yahweh of armies  the god of israel   take these deeds           this deed of the purchase which is sealed  and this deed          which is open  and put them in an earthen vessel  that they          may continue many days           for thus says yahweh of armies  the god of israel   houses and          fields and vineyards shall yet again be bought in this land           now after i had delivered the deed of the purchase to baruch          the son of neriah  i prayed to yahweh  saying           ah lord yahweh  behold  you have made the heavens and          the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm           there is nothing too hard for you           who show loving kindness to thousands  and recompense the iniquity          of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them           the great  the mighty god  yahweh of armies is his name           great in counsel  and mighty in work  whose eyes are open on          all the ways of the sons of men  to give everyone according          to his ways  and according to the fruit of his doings           who performed signs and wonders in the land of egypt           even to this day  both in israel and among  other  men           and made you a name  as in this day           and brought forth your people israel out of the land of egypt          with signs  and with wonders  and with a strong hand           and with an outstretched arm  and with great terror           and gave them this land  which you did swear to their fathers          to give them  a land flowing with milk and honey           and they came in  and possessed it  but they didn t          obey your voice  neither walked in your law  they have          done nothing of all that you commanded them to do           therefore you have caused all this evil to come on them           behold  the mounds  they are come to the city to take it           and the city is given into the hand of the chaldeans who          fight against it  because of the sword  and of the famine           and of the pestilence  and what you have spoken has happened           and behold  you see it           you have said to me  lord yahweh  buy you the field for money           and call witnesses  whereas the city is given into the hand          of the chaldeans           then came the word of yahweh to jeremiah  saying           behold  i am yahweh  the god of all flesh   is there anything          too hard for me           therefore thus says yahweh   behold  i will give this city into          the hand of the chaldeans  and into the hand of nebuchadnezzar          king of babylon  and he shall take it           and the chaldeans  who fight against this city  shall come          and set this city on fire  and burn it  with the houses           on whose roofs they have offered incense to baal  and poured          out drink offerings to other gods  to provoke me to anger           for the children of israel and the children of judah have          done only that which was evil in my sight from their youth           for the children of israel have only provoked me to anger          with the work of their hands  says yahweh           for this city has been to me a provocation of my anger and of          my wrath from the day that they built it even to this day           that i should remove it from before my face           because of all the evil of the children of israel and of the children          of judah  which they have done to provoke me to anger  they           their kings  their princes  their priests  and their prophets           and the men of judah  and the inhabitants of jerusalem           they have turned to me the back  and not the face           and though i taught them  rising up early and teaching them           yet they have not listened to receive instruction           but they set their abominations in the house which is called          by my name  to defile it           they built the high places of baal  which are in the valley          of the son of hinnom  to cause their sons and their daughters          to pass through  the fire  to molech  which i didn t          command them  neither did it come into my mind  that they          should do this abomination  to cause judah to sin           now therefore thus says yahweh  the god of israel           concerning this city  about which you say  it is given into          the hand of the king of babylon by the sword  and by the famine           and by the pestilence           behold  i will gather them out of all the countries           where i have driven them in my anger  and in my wrath  and in          great indignation  and i will bring them again to this place           and i will cause them to dwell safely           and they shall be my people  and i will be their god           and i will give them one heart and one way  that they          may fear me forever  for the good of them  and of their          children after them           and i will make an everlasting covenant with them  that i          will not turn away from following them  to do them good           and i will put my fear in their hearts  that they may not          depart from me           yes  i will rejoice over them to do them good  and i will plant          them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with          my whole soul           for thus says yahweh   like as i have brought all this great evil          on this people  so will i bring on them all the good that i          have promised them           fields shall be bought in this land  about which you say           it is desolate  without man or animal  it is given into the hand          of the chaldeans           men shall buy fields for money  and subscribe the deeds           and seal them  and call witnesses  in the land of benjamin           and in the places about jerusalem  and in the cities of judah           and in the cities of the hill country  and in the cities          of the lowland  and in the cities of the south           for i will cause their captivity to return  says yahweh           moreover the word of yahweh came to jeremiah the second time           while he was yet shut up in the court of the guard  saying           thus says yahweh who does it  yahweh who forms it to establish it           yahweh is his name           call to me  and i will answer you  and will show you great things           and difficult  which you don t know           for thus says yahweh  the god of israel  concerning the houses          of this city  and concerning the houses of the kings of judah           which are broken down  to make a defense  against the mounds          and against the sword           while  men  come to fight with the chaldeans  and to fill them          with the dead bodies of men  whom i have killed in my anger          and in my wrath  and for all whose wickedness i have hid          my face from this city           behold  i will bring it health and cure  and i will cure them           and i will reveal to them abundance of peace and truth           i will cause the captivity of judah and the captivity of israel          to return  and will build them  as at the first           i will cleanse them from all their iniquity  by which they          have sinned against me  and i will pardon all their iniquities           by which they have sinned against me  and by which they          have transgressed against me            this city  shall be to me for a name of joy  for a praise          and for a glory  before all the nations of the earth           which shall hear all the good that i do to them  and shall          fear and tremble for all the good and for all the peace that i          procure to it           thus says yahweh   yet again there shall be heard in this place           about which you say  it is waste  without man and without animal           even in the cities of judah  and in the streets of jerusalem           that are desolate  without man and without inhabitant          and without animal           the voice of joy and the voice of gladness  the voice of          the bridegroom and the voice of the bride  the voice of those          who say  give thanks to yahweh of armies  for yahweh is good           for his loving kindness endures forever   and of them  who          bring  sacrifices of  thanksgiving into the house of yahweh           for i will cause the captivity of the land to return as at          the first  says yahweh           thus says yahweh of armies   yet again shall there be in          this place  which is waste  without man and without animal           and in all the cities of it  a habitation of shepherds causing          their flocks to lie down           in the cities of the hill country  in the cities of the lowland           and in the cities of the south  and in the land of benjamin           and in the places about jerusalem  and in the cities of judah           shall the flocks again pass under the hands of him who          numbers them  says yahweh           behold  the days come  says yahweh  that i will perform that          good word which i have spoken concerning the house of israel          and concerning the house of judah           in those days  and at that time  will i cause a branch          of righteousness to grow up to david  and he shall execute          justice and righteousness in the land           in those days shall judah be saved  and jerusalem shall dwell safely           and this is  the name  by which she shall be called           yahweh our righteousness           for thus says yahweh   david shall never want a man to sit          on the throne of the house of israel           neither shall the priests the levites want a man before me          to offer burnt offerings  and to burn meal offerings           and to do sacrifice continually           the word of yahweh came to jeremiah  saying           thus says yahweh   if you can break my covenant of the day           and my covenant of the night  so that there shall not be day          and night in their season           then may also my covenant be broken with david my servant           that he shall not have a son to reign on his throne           and with the levites the priests  my ministers           as the army of the sky can t be numbered  neither the sand          of the sea measured  so will i multiply the seed of david          my servant  and the levites who minister to me           the word of yahweh came to jeremiah  saying           don t you consider what this people has spoken  saying  the two          families which yahweh did choose  he has cast them off           thus do they despise my people  that they should be no more          a nation before them           thus says yahweh   if my covenant of day and night fails           if i have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth           then will i also cast away the seed of jacob  and of david          my servant  so that i will not take of his seed to be          rulers over the seed of abraham  isaac  and jacob           for i will cause their captivity to return  and will have          mercy on them           the word which came to jeremiah from yahweh  when nebuchadnezzar          king of babylon  and all his army  and all the kingdoms of          the earth that were under his dominion  and all the peoples           were fighting against jerusalem  and against all the cities          of it  saying           thus says yahweh  the god of israel  go  and speak to zedekiah          king of judah  and tell him  thus says yahweh  behold  i will          give this city into the hand of the king of babylon           and he shall burn it with fire           and you shall not escape out of his hand  but shall surely          be taken  and delivered into his hand  and your eyes shall see          the eyes of the king of babylon  and he shall speak with you          mouth to mouth  and you shall go to babylon           yet hear the word of yahweh  o zedekiah king of judah           thus says yahweh concerning you  you shall not die by the sword           you shall die in peace  and with the burnings of your fathers           the former kings who were before you  so shall they make          a burning for you  and they shall lament you   saying   ah lord           for i have spoken the word  says yahweh           then jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to zedekiah          king of judah in jerusalem           when the king of babylon s army was fighting against jerusalem           and against all the cities of judah that were left           against lachish and against azekah  for these  alone  remained          of the cities of judah  as  fortified cities           the word that came to jeremiah from yahweh  after that the king          zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people who were          at jerusalem  to proclaim liberty to them           that every man should let his male servant  and every man          his female servant  who is a hebrew or a hebrewess  go free           that none should make bondservants of them   to wit            of a jew his brother           all the princes and all the people obeyed  who had entered          into the covenant  that everyone should let his male servant           and everyone his female servant  go free  that none should make          bondservants of them any more  they obeyed  and let them go           but afterwards they turned  and caused the servants and the handmaids           whom they had let go free  to return  and brought them into          subjection for servants and for handmaids           therefore the word of yahweh came to jeremiah from yahweh  saying           thus says yahweh  the god of israel   i made a covenant          with your fathers in the day that i brought them forth out          of the land of egypt  out of the house of bondage  saying           at the end of seven years you shall let go every man his          brother who is a hebrew  who has been sold to you  and has          served you six years  you shall let him go free from you           but your fathers didn t listen to me  neither inclined their ear           you were now turned  and had done that which is right in my eyes           in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbor  and you          had made a covenant before me in the house which is called          by my name           but you turned and profaned my name  and caused every man          his servant  and every man his handmaid  whom you had let          go free at their pleasure  to return  and you brought them          into subjection  to be to you for servants and for handmaids           therefore thus says yahweh   you have not listened to me           to proclaim liberty  every man to his brother  and every          man to his neighbor   behold  i proclaim to you a liberty           says yahweh  to the sword  to the pestilence  and to the famine           and i will make you to be tossed back and forth among all          the kingdoms of the earth           i will give the men who have transgressed my covenant           who have not performed the words of the covenant which they          made before me  when they cut the calf in two and passed          between the parts of it           the princes of judah  and the princes of jerusalem  the eunuchs           and the priests  and all the people of the land  who passed          between the parts of the calf           i will even give them into the hand of their enemies           and into the hand of those who seek their life  and their          dead bodies shall be for food to the birds of the sky           and to the animals of the earth           zedekiah king of judah and his princes will i give into          the hand of their enemies  and into the hand of those who seek          their life  and into the hand of the king of babylon s army           who have gone away from you           behold  i will command  says yahweh  and cause them to return          to this city  and they shall fight against it  and take it           and burn it with fire   and i will make the cities of judah          a desolation  without inhabitant           the word which came to jeremiah from yahweh in the days          of jehoiakim the son of josiah  king of judah  saying           go to the house of the rechabites  and speak to them  and bring          them into the house of yahweh  into one of the chambers           and give them wine to drink           then i took jaazaniah the son of jeremiah  the son of habazziniah           and his brothers  and all his sons  and the whole house          of the rechabites           and i brought them into the house of yahweh  into the chamber          of the sons of hanan the son of igdaliah  the man of god           which was by the chamber of the princes  which was above          the chamber of maaseiah the son of shallum  the keeper          of the threshold           i set before the sons of the house of the rechabites bowls          full of wine  and cups  and i said to them  drink you wine           but they said  we will drink no wine  for jonadab the son of rechab           our father  commanded us  saying  you shall drink no wine           neither you  nor your sons  forever           neither shall you build house  nor sow seed  nor plant vineyard           nor have any  but all your days you shall dwell in tents           that you may live many days in the land in which you sojourn           we have obeyed the voice of jonadab the son of rechab           our father  in all that he charged us  to drink no wine all          our days  we  our wives  our sons  or our daughters           nor to build houses for us to dwell in  neither have we vineyard           nor field  nor seed           but we have lived in tents  and have obeyed  and done according          to all that jonadab our father commanded us           but it happened  when nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came up          into the land  that we said  come  and let us go to jerusalem          for fear of the army of the chaldeans  and for fear of the army          of the syrians  so we dwell at jerusalem           then came the word of yahweh to jeremiah  saying           thus says yahweh of armies  the god of israel   go  and tell          the men of judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem  will you          not receive instruction to listen to my words  says yahweh           the words of jonadab the son of rechab  that he commanded          his sons  not to drink wine  are performed  and to this day          they drink none  for they obey their father s commandment           but i have spoken to you  rising up early and speaking           and you have not listened to me           i have sent also to you all my servants the prophets           rising up early and sending them  saying  return you          now every man from his evil way  and amend your doings           and don t go after other gods to serve them  and you shall dwell          in the land which i have given to you and to your fathers           but you have not inclined your ear  nor listened to me           because the sons of jonadab the son of rechab have performed          the commandment of their father which he commanded them           but this people has not listened to me           therefore thus says yahweh  the god of armies  the god          of israel   behold  i will bring on judah and on all the inhabitants          of jerusalem all the evil that i have pronounced against them           because i have spoken to them  but they have not heard           and i have called to them  but they have not answered           jeremiah said to the house of the rechabites  thus says yahweh          of armies  the god of israel   because you have obeyed the          commandment of jonadab your father  and kept all his precepts           and done according to all that he commanded you           therefore thus says yahweh of armies  the god of israel   jonadab the          son of rechab shall not want a man to stand before me forever           it happened in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah           king of judah  that this word came to jeremiah from yahweh  saying           take a scroll of a book  and write therein all the words          that i have spoken to you against israel  and against judah           and against all the nations  from the day i spoke to you           from the days of josiah  even to this day           it may be that the house of judah will hear all the evil          which i purpose to do to them  that they may return every          man from his evil way  that i may forgive their iniquity          and their sin           then jeremiah called baruch the son of neriah  and baruch          wrote from the mouth of jeremiah all the words of yahweh           which he had spoken to him  on a scroll of a book           jeremiah commanded baruch  saying  i am shut up  i can t go          into the house of yahweh           therefore go you  and read in the scroll  which you have written          from my mouth  the words of yahweh in the ears of the people          in yahweh s house on the fast day  and also you shall read          them in the ears of all judah who come out of their cities           it may be they will present their supplication before yahweh           and will return everyone from his evil way  for great is the anger          and the wrath that yahweh has pronounced against this people           baruch the son of neriah did according to all that jeremiah          the prophet commanded him  reading in the book the words          of yahweh in yahweh s house           now it happened in the fifth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah           king of judah  in the ninth month  that all the people          in jerusalem  and all the people who came from the cities          of judah to jerusalem  proclaimed a fast before yahweh           then read baruch in the book the words of jeremiah in the house          of yahweh  in the chamber of gemariah the son of shaphan           the scribe  in the upper court  at the entry of the new gate          of yahweh s house  in the ears of all the people           when micaiah the son of gemariah  the son of shaphan           had heard out of the book all the words of yahweh           he went down into the king s house  into the scribe s chamber           and behold  all the princes were sitting there   to wit            elishama the scribe  and delaiah the son of shemaiah           and elnathan the son of achbor  and gemariah the son of shaphan           and zedekiah the son of hananiah  and all the princes           then micaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard           when baruch read the book in the ears of the people           therefore all the princes sent jehudi the son of nethaniah           the son of shelemiah  the son of cushi  to baruch  saying           take in your hand the scroll in which you have read in the ears          of the people  and come   so baruch the son of neriah took          the scroll in his hand  and came to them           they said to him  sit down now  and read it in our ears           so baruch read it in their ears           now it happened  when they had heard all the words  they turned          in fear one toward another  and said to baruch  we will surely          tell the king of all these words           they asked baruch  saying  tell us now  how did you write          all these words at his mouth           then baruch answered them  he pronounced all these words to me          with his mouth  and i wrote them with ink in the book           then said the princes to baruch  go  hide you  you and jeremiah           and let no man know where you are           they went in to the king into the court  but they had laid          up the scroll in the chamber of elishama the scribe           and they told all the words in the ears of the king           so the king sent jehudi to get the scroll  and he took it          out of the chamber of elishama the scribe   jehudi read it          in the ears of the king  and in the ears of all the princes          who stood beside the king           now the king was sitting in the winter house in the ninth month           and  there was a fire in  the brazier burning before him           it happened  when jehudi had read three or four leaves           that  the king  cut it with the penknife  and cast it into          the fire that was in the brazier  until all the scroll was          consumed in the fire that was in the brazier           they were not afraid  nor tore their garments  neither the king           nor any of his servants who heard all these words           moreover elnathan and delaiah and gemariah had made          intercession to the king that he would not burn the scroll           but he would not hear them           the king commanded jerahmeel the king s son  and seraiah the son          of azriel  and shelemiah the son of abdeel  to take baruch          the scribe and jeremiah the prophet  but yahweh hid them           then the word of yahweh came to jeremiah  after that the king          had burned the scroll  and the words which baruch wrote          at the mouth of jeremiah  saying           take again another scroll  and write in it all the former          words that were in the first scroll  which jehoiakim the king          of judah has burned           concerning jehoiakim king of judah you shall say           thus says yahweh   you have burned this scroll  saying           why have you written therein  saying  the king of babylon          shall certainly come and destroy this land  and shall cause          to cease from there man and animal           therefore thus says yahweh concerning jehoiakim king          of judah   he shall have none to sit on the throne of david           and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat           and in the night to the frost           i will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity           and i will bring on them  and on the inhabitants of jerusalem           and on the men of judah  all the evil that i have pronounced          against them  but they didn t listen           then took jeremiah another scroll  and gave it to baruch          the scribe  the son of neriah  who wrote therein from the mouth          of jeremiah all the words of the book which jehoiakim king          of judah had burned in the fire  and there were added besides          to them many like words           zedekiah the son of josiah reigned as king  instead of coniah          the son of jehoiakim  whom nebuchadnezzar king of babylon          made king in the land of judah           but neither he  nor his servants  nor the people of the land           did listen to the words of yahweh  which he spoke by          the prophet jeremiah           zedekiah the king sent jehucal the son of shelemiah  and zephaniah          the son of maaseiah  the priest  to the prophet jeremiah           saying  pray now to yahweh our god for us           now jeremiah came in and went out among the people  for they          had not put him into prison           pharaoh s army was come forth out of egypt  and when the          chaldeans who were besieging jerusalem heard news of them           they broke up from jerusalem           then came the word of yahweh to the prophet jeremiah  saying           thus says yahweh  the god of israel  thus shall you tell          the king of judah  who sent you to me to inquire of me           behold  pharaoh s army  which is come forth to help you           shall return to egypt into their own land           the chaldeans shall come again  and fight against this city           and they shall take it  and burn it with fire           thus says yahweh  don t deceive yourselves  saying  the chaldeans          shall surely depart from us  for they shall not depart           for though you had struck the whole army of the chaldeans          who fight against you  and there remained but wounded men          among them  yes would they rise up every man in his tent           and burn this city with fire           it happened that  when the army of the chaldeans was broken          up from jerusalem for fear of pharaoh s army           then jeremiah went forth out of jerusalem to go into the land          of benjamin  to receive his portion there  in the midst          of the people           when he was in the gate of benjamin  a captain of the guard          was there  whose name was irijah  the son of shelemiah           the son of hananiah  and he laid hold on jeremiah the prophet           saying  you are falling away to the chaldeans           then said jeremiah  it is false  i am not falling away to          the chaldeans   but he didn t listen to him  so irijah laid          hold on jeremiah  and brought him to the princes           the princes were angry with jeremiah  and struck him           and put him in prison in the house of jonathan the scribe           for they had made that the prison           when jeremiah was come into the dungeon house  and into the cells           and jeremiah had remained there many days           then zedekiah the king sent  and fetched him           and the king asked him secretly in his house  and said           is there any word from yahweh   jeremiah said  there is           he said also  you shall be delivered into the hand of the          king of babylon           moreover jeremiah said to king zedekiah  wherein have i sinned          against you  or against your servants  or against this people           that you have put me in prison           where now are your prophets who prophesied to you  saying  the king          of babylon shall not come against you  nor against this land           now please hear  my lord the king   please let my supplication          be presented before you  that you not cause me to return          to the house of jonathan the scribe  lest i die there           then zedekiah the king commanded  and they committed jeremiah          into the court of the guard  and they gave him daily a loaf          of bread out of the bakers  street  until all the bread          in the city was spent   thus jeremiah remained in the court          of the guard           shephatiah the son of mattan  and gedaliah the son of pashhur           and jucal the son of shelemiah  and pashhur the son of malchijah           heard the words that jeremiah spoke to all the people  saying           thus says yahweh  he who remains in this city shall die          by the sword  by the famine  and by the pestilence           but he who goes forth to the chaldeans shall live  and his          life shall be to him for a prey  and he shall live           thus says yahweh  this city shall surely be given into the hand          of the army of the king of babylon  and he shall take it           then the princes said to the king  let this man  we pray you           be put to death  because he weakens the hands of the men of war          who remain in this city  and the hands of all the people           in speaking such words to them   for this man doesn t seek          the welfare of this people  but the hurt           zedekiah the king said  behold  he is in your hand           for the king is not he who can do anything against you           then took they jeremiah  and cast him into the dungeon of          malchijah the king s son  that was in the court of the guard           and they let down jeremiah with cords   in the dungeon there          was no water  but mire  and jeremiah sank in the mire           now when ebedmelech the ethiopian  a eunuch  who was in the          king s house  heard that they had put jeremiah in the dungeon           the king then sitting in the gate of benjamin            ebedmelech went forth out of the king s house  and spoke          to the king  saying           my lord the king  these men have done evil in all that they          have done to jeremiah the prophet  whom they have cast into          the dungeon  and he is likely to die in the place where he is           because of the famine  for there is no more bread in the city           then the king commanded ebedmelech the ethiopian  saying           take from hence thirty men with you  and take up jeremiah          the prophet out of the dungeon  before he dies           so ebedmelech took the men with him  and went into the house          of the king under the treasury  and took there rags          and worn out garments  and let them down by cords into          the dungeon to jeremiah           ebedmelech the ethiopian said to jeremiah  put now these rags          and worn out garments under your armholes under the cords           jeremiah did so           so they drew up jeremiah with the cords  and took him up          out of the dungeon   and jeremiah remained in the court          of the guard           then zedekiah the king sent  and took jeremiah the prophet          to him into the third entry that is in the house of yahweh           and the king said to jeremiah  i will ask you a thing           hide nothing from me           then jeremiah said to zedekiah  if i declare it to you           will you not surely put me to death  and if i give you counsel           you will not listen to me           so zedekiah the king swore secretly to jeremiah  saying           as yahweh lives  who made us this soul  i will not put you          to death  neither will i give you into the hand of these men          who seek your life           then said jeremiah to zedekiah  thus says yahweh  the god          of armies  the god of israel   if you will go forth to the king          of babylon s princes  then your soul shall live  and this          city shall not be burned with fire  and you shall live           and your house           but if you will not go forth to the king of babylon s princes           then shall this city be given into the hand of the chaldeans           and they shall burn it with fire  and you shall not escape          out of their hand           zedekiah the king said to jeremiah  i am afraid of the jews          who are fallen away to the chaldeans  lest they deliver me          into their hand  and they mock me           but jeremiah said  they shall not deliver you   obey  i beg you           the voice of yahweh  in that which i speak to you           so it shall be well with you  and your soul shall live           but if you refuse to go forth  this is the word that yahweh          has shown me           behold  all the women who are left in the king of judah s house          shall be brought forth to the king of babylon s princes           and those women shall say  your familiar friends have set you on           and have prevailed over you    now that  your feet are sunk          in the mire  they are turned away back           they shall bring out all your wives and your children to          the chaldeans  and you shall not escape out of their hand           but shall be taken by the hand of the king of babylon           and you shall cause this city to be burned with fire           then said zedekiah to jeremiah  let no man know of these words           and you shall not die           but if the princes hear that i have talked with you  and they          come to you  and tell you  declare to us now what you have said          to the king  don t hide it from us  and we will not put you          to death  also what the king said to you           then you shall tell them  i presented my supplication before the king           that he would not cause me to return to jonathan s house           to die there           then came all the princes to jeremiah  and asked him           and he told them according to all these words that the king          had commanded   so they left off speaking with him           for the matter was not perceived           so jeremiah abode in the court of the guard until the day          that jerusalem was taken           it happened when jerusalem was taken   in the ninth year of          zedekiah king of judah  in the tenth month  came nebuchadnezzar          king of babylon and all his army against jerusalem           and besieged it           in the eleventh year of zedekiah  in the fourth month           the ninth day of the month  a breach was made in the city            that all the princes of the king of babylon came in           and sat in the middle gate   to wit   nergal sharezer           samgarnebo  sarsechim  rabsaris  nergal sharezer  rabmag           with all the rest of the princes of the king of babylon           it happened that  when zedekiah the king of judah and all          the men of war saw them  then they fled  and went forth          out of the city by night  by the way of the king s garden           through the gate between the two walls  and he went out          toward the arabah           but the army of the chaldeans pursued after them  and overtook          zedekiah in the plains of jericho   and when they had taken him           they brought him up to nebuchadnezzar king of babylon to riblah          in the land of hamath  and he gave judgment on him           then the king of babylon killed the sons of zedekiah in riblah          before his eyes   also the king of babylon killed all          the nobles of judah           moreover he put out zedekiah s eyes  and bound him in fetters           to carry him to babylon           the chaldeans burned the king s house  and the houses of the people           with fire  and broke down the walls of jerusalem           then nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive          into babylon the residue of the people who remained in the city           the deserters also who fell away to him  and the residue          of the people who remained           but nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor          of the people  who had nothing  in the land of judah           and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time           now nebuchadnezzar king of babylon gave charge concerning          jeremiah to nebuzaradan the captain of the guard  saying           take him  and look well to him  and do him no harm           but do to him even as he shall tell you           so nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent           and nebushazban  rabsaris  and nergal sharezer  rabmag  and all          the chief officers of the king of babylon           they sent  and took jeremiah out of the court of the guard           and committed him to gedaliah the son of ahikam           the son of shaphan  that he should carry him home           so he lived among the people           now the word of yahweh came to jeremiah  while he was shut up          in the court of the guard  saying           go  and speak to ebedmelech the ethiopian  saying  thus says          yahweh of armies  the god of israel   behold  i will bring          my words on this city for evil  and not for good  and they          shall be accomplished before you in that day           but i will deliver you in that day  says yahweh  and you shall          not be given into the hand of the men of whom you are afraid           for i will surely save you  and you shall not fall by the sword           but your life shall be for a prey to you  because you have put          your trust in me  says yahweh           the word which came to jeremiah from yahweh  after that          nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from ramah           when he had taken him being bound in chains among all          the captives of jerusalem and judah  who were carried away          captive to babylon           the captain of the guard took jeremiah  and said to him           yahweh your god pronounced this evil on this place           and yahweh has brought it  and done according as he spoke           because you have sinned against yahweh  and have not obeyed          his voice  therefore this thing is come on you           now  behold  i loose you this day from the chains which are          on your hand   if it seems good to you to come with me          into babylon  come  and i will take care of you  but if it          seems bad to you to come with me into babylon  don t  behold           all the land is before you  where it seems good and right          to you to go  there go           now while he was not yet gone back  go back then   said he            to gedaliah the son of ahikam  the son of shaphan  whom the king          of babylon has made governor over the cities of judah           and dwell with him among the people  or go wherever it seems          right to you to go   so the captain of the guard gave him          food and a present  and let him go           then went jeremiah to gedaliah the son of ahikam to mizpah           and lived with him among the people who were left in the land           now when all the captains of the forces who were in the fields           even they and their men  heard that the king of babylon          had made gedaliah the son of ahikam governor in the land           and had committed to him men  and women  and children           and of the poorest of the land  of those who were not carried          away captive to babylon           then they came to gedaliah to mizpah   to wit   ishmael the son          of nethaniah  and johanan and jonathan the sons of kareah           and seraiah the son of tanhumeth  and the sons of ephai          the netophathite  and jezaniah the son of the maacathite           they and their men           gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan swore to them and          to their men  saying  don t be afraid to serve the chaldeans           dwell in the land  and serve the king of babylon  and it          shall be well with you           as for me  behold  i will dwell at mizpah  to stand before          the chaldeans who shall come to us   but you  gather you wine          and summer fruits and oil  and put them in your vessels           and dwell in your cities that you have taken           likewise when all the jews who were in moab  and among the children          of ammon  and in edom  and who were in all the countries           heard that the king of babylon had left a remnant of judah           and that he had set over them gedaliah the son of ahikam           the son of shaphan           then all the jews returned out of all places where they          were driven  and came to the land of judah  to gedaliah           to mizpah  and gathered wine and summer fruits very much           moreover johanan the son of kareah  and all the captains of          the forces who were in the fields  came to gedaliah to mizpah           and said to him  do you know that baalis the king of the children          of ammon has sent ishmael the son of nethaniah to take your life           but gedaliah the son of ahikam didn t believe them           then johanan the son of kareah spoke to gedaliah in          mizpah secretly  saying  please let me go  and i will kill          ishmael the son of nethaniah  and no man shall know it           why should he take your life  that all the jews who are gathered          to you should be scattered  and the remnant of judah perish           but gedaliah the son of ahikam said to johanan the son          of kareah  you shall not do this thing  for you speak          falsely of ishmael           now it happened in the seventh month  that ishmael the son          of nethaniah  the son of elishama  of the seed royal and  one          of  the chief officers of the king  and ten men with him           came to gedaliah the son of ahikam to mizpah  and there they          ate bread together in mizpah           then arose ishmael the son of nethaniah  and the ten men who          were with him  and struck gedaliah the son of ahikam the son          of shaphan with the sword  and killed him  whom the king          of babylon had made governor over the land           ishmael also killed all the jews who were with him   to wit            with gedaliah  at mizpah  and the chaldeans who were found there           the men of war           it happened the second day after he had killed gedaliah           and no man knew it           that there came men from shechem  from shiloh  and from samaria           even eighty men  having their beards shaved and their clothes torn           and having cut themselves  with meal offerings and frankincense          in their hand  to bring them to the house of yahweh           ishmael the son of nethaniah went forth from mizpah to meet them           weeping all along as he went   and it happened  as he met them           he said to them  come to gedaliah the son of ahikam           it was so  when they came into the midst of the city           that ishmael the son of nethaniah killed them   and cast them           into the midst of the pit  he  and the men who were with him           but ten men were found among those who said to ishmael  don t kill us           for we have stores hidden in the field  of wheat  and of barley           and of oil  and of honey   so he stopped  and didn t kill          them among their brothers           now the pit in which ishmael cast all the dead bodies          of the men whom he had killed  by the side of gedaliah           the same was who which asa the king had made for fear of          baasha king of israel   ishmael the son of nethaniah filled          it with those who were killed           then ishmael carried away captive all the residue of          the people who were in mizpah  even the king s daughters           and all the people who remained in mizpah  whom nebuzaradan          the captain of the guard had committed to gedaliah the son          of ahikam  ishmael the son of nethaniah carried them away captive           and departed to go over to the children of ammon           but when johanan the son of kareah  and all the captains          of the forces who were with him  heard of all the evil          that ishmael the son of nethaniah had done           then they took all the men  and went to fight with ishmael          the son of nethaniah  and found him by the great waters          that are in gibeon           now it happened that  when all the people who were with ishmael          saw johanan the son of kareah  and all the captains of the forces          who were with him  then they were glad           so all the people who ishmael had carried away captive          from mizpah turned about and came back  and went to johanan          the son of kareah           but ishmael the son of nethaniah escaped from johanan with          eight men  and went to the children of ammon           then took johanan the son of kareah  and all the captains          of the forces who were with him  all the remnant of the people          whom he had recovered from ishmael the son of nethaniah           from mizpah  after that he had killed gedaliah the son of ahikam            to wit   the men of war  and the women  and the children           and the eunuchs  whom he had brought back from gibeon           and they departed  and lived in geruth chimham  which is          by bethlehem  to go to enter into egypt           because of the chaldeans  for they were afraid of them           because ishmael the son of nethaniah had killed gedaliah          the son of ahikam  whom the king of babylon made governor          over the land           then all the captains of the forces  and johanan the son of kareah           and jezaniah the son of hoshaiah  and all the people from          the least even to the greatest  came near           and said to jeremiah the prophet  let  we pray you  our supplication          be presented before you  and pray for us to yahweh your god           even for all this remnant  for we are left but a few of many           as your eyes do see us           that yahweh your god may show us the way in which we should walk           and the thing that we should do           then jeremiah the prophet said to them  i have heard you           behold  i will pray to yahweh your god according to your words           and it shall happen that whatever thing yahweh shall answer you           i will declare it to you  i will keep nothing back from you           then they said to jeremiah  yahweh be a true and faithful          witness among us  if we don t do according to all the word          with which yahweh your god shall send you to us           whether it be good  or whether it be evil  we will obey the voice          of yahweh our god  to whom we send you  that it may be well          with us  when we obey the voice of yahweh our god           it happened after ten days  that the word of yahweh          came to jeremiah           then called he johanan the son of kareah  and all the captains          of the forces who were with him  and all the people from          the least even to the greatest           and said to them  thus says yahweh  the god of israel           to whom you sent me to present your supplication before him           if you will still abide in this land  then will i build you           and not pull you down  and i will plant you  and not pluck you up           for i grieve over the distress that i have brought on you           don t be afraid of the king of babylon  of whom you are afraid           don t be afraid of him  says yahweh   for i am with you          to save you  and to deliver you from his hand           i will grant you mercy  that he may have mercy on you           and cause you to return to your own land           but if you say  we will not dwell in this land  so that you          don t obey the voice of yahweh your god           saying  no  but we will go into the land of egypt  where we          shall see no war  nor hear the sound of the trumpet           nor have hunger of bread  and there will we dwell           now therefore hear you the word of yahweh  o remnant          of judah   thus says yahweh of armies  the god of israel  if you          indeed set your faces to enter into egypt  and go to sojourn there           then it shall happen  that the sword  which you fear           shall overtake you there in the land of egypt  and the famine           about which you are afraid  shall follow hard after you there          in egypt  and there you shall die           so shall it be with all the men who set their faces to go          into egypt to sojourn there   they shall die by the sword           by the famine  and by the pestilence  and none of them shall          remain or escape from the evil that i will bring on them           for thus says yahweh of armies  the god of israel   as my          anger and my wrath has been poured forth on the inhabitants          of jerusalem  so shall my wrath be poured forth on you           when you shall enter into egypt  and you shall be an object          of horror  and an astonishment  and a curse  and a reproach           and you shall see this place no more           yahweh has spoken concerning you  remnant of judah  don t you          go into egypt   know certainly that i have testified to          you this day           for you have dealt deceitfully against your own souls           for you sent me to yahweh your god  saying  pray for us to yahweh          our god  and according to all that yahweh our god shall say           so declare to us  and we will do it           and i have this day declared it to you  but you have not obeyed          the voice of yahweh your god in anything for which he has          sent me to you           now therefore know certainly that you shall die by the sword           by the famine  and by the pestilence  in the place where you          desire to go to sojourn there           it happened that  when jeremiah had made an end of speaking          to all the people all the words of yahweh their god  with which          yahweh their god had sent him to them  even all these words           then spoke azariah the son of hoshaiah  and johanan the son of kareah           and all the proud men  saying to jeremiah  you speak falsely           yahweh our god has not sent you to say  you shall not go          into egypt to sojourn there           but baruch the son of neriah sets you on against us  to deliver us          into the hand of the chaldeans  that they may put us to death           and carry us away captive to babylon           so johanan the son of kareah  and all the captains of the forces           and all the people  didn t obey the voice of yahweh           to dwell in the land of judah           but johanan the son of kareah  and all the captains of the forces           took all the remnant of judah  who were returned from          all the nations where they had been driven  to sojourn          in the land of judah           the men  and the women  and the children  and the king s daughters           and every person who nebuzaradan the captain of the guard          had left with gedaliah the son of ahikam  the son of shaphan           and jeremiah the prophet  and baruch the son of neriah           and they came into the land of egypt  for they didn t obey          the voice of yahweh   and they came to tahpanhes           then came the word of yahweh to jeremiah in tahpanhes  saying           take great stones in your hand  and hide them in mortar          in the brick work  which is at the entry of pharaoh s house          in tahpanhes  in the sight of the men of judah           and tell them  thus says yahweh of armies  the god          of israel   behold  i will send and take nebuchadnezzar          the king of babylon  my servant  and will set his throne          on these stones that i have hidden  and he shall spread his          royal pavilion over them           he shall come  and shall strike the land of egypt           such as are for death  shall be given  to death  and such as          are for captivity to captivity  and such as are for the sword          to the sword           i will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of egypt           and he shall burn them  and carry them away captive           and he shall array himself with the land of egypt           as a shepherd puts on his garment  and he shall go forth          from there in peace           he shall also break the pillars of beth shemesh  that is in          the land of egypt  and the houses of the gods of egypt shall          he burn with fire           the word that came to jeremiah concerning all the jews who lived          in the land of egypt  who lived at migdol  and at tahpanhes           and at memphis  and in the country of pathros  saying           thus says yahweh of armies  the god of israel   you have seen          all the evil that i have brought on jerusalem  and on all          the cities of judah  and behold  this day they are a desolation           and no man dwells therein           because of their wickedness which they have committed          to provoke me to anger  in that they went to burn incense            and  to serve other gods  that they didn t know  neither they           nor you  nor your fathers           however i sent to you all my servants the prophets  rising up          early and sending them  saying  oh  don t do this abominable          thing that i hate           but they didn t listen  nor inclined their ear to turn from          their wickedness  to burn no incense to other gods           therefore my wrath and my anger was poured forth  and was          kindled in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem           and they are wasted and desolate  as it is this day           therefore now thus says yahweh  the god of armies  the god          of israel   why commit you  this  great evil against your own souls           to cut off from you man and woman  infant and suckling           out of the midst of judah  to leave you none remaining           in that you provoke me to anger with the works of your hands           burning incense to other gods in the land of egypt           where you are gone to sojourn  that you may be cut off           and that you may be a curse and a reproach among all the nations          of the earth           have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers           and the wickedness of the kings of judah  and the wickedness          of their wives  and your own wickedness  and the wickedness          of your wives which they committed in the land of judah           and in the streets of jerusalem           they are not humbled even to this day  neither have they feared           nor walked in my law  nor in my statutes  that i set before          you and before your fathers           therefore thus says yahweh of armies  the god          of israel   behold  i will set my face against you for evil           even to cut off all judah           i will take the remnant of judah  that have set their faces          to go into the land of egypt to sojourn there  and they          shall all be consumed  in the land of egypt shall they fall           they shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine           they shall die  from the least even to the greatest  by the sword          and by the famine  and they shall be an object of horror            and  an astonishment  and a curse  and a reproach           for i will punish those who dwell in the land of egypt           as i have punished jerusalem  by the sword  by the famine           and by the pestilence           so that none of the remnant of judah  who have gone into          the land of egypt to sojourn there  shall escape or be left           to return into the land of judah  to which they have a desire          to return to dwell there   for none shall return save such          as shall escape           then all the men who knew that their wives burned incense to          other gods  and all the women who stood by  a great assembly           even all the people who lived in the land of egypt  in pathros           answered jeremiah  saying           as for the word that you have spoken to us in the name of yahweh           we will not listen to you           but we will certainly perform every word that is gone forth          out of our mouth  to burn incense to the queen of the sky           and to pour out drink offerings to her  as we have done           we and our fathers  our kings and our princes  in the cities          of judah  and in the streets of jerusalem  for then had we          plenty of food  and were well  and saw no evil           but since we left off burning incense to the queen of the sky           and pouring out drink offerings to her  we have wanted all things           and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine           when we burned incense to the queen of the sky  and poured out          drink offerings to her  did we make her cakes to worship her           and pour out drink offerings to her  without our husbands           then jeremiah said to all the people  to the men  and to the women           even to all the people who had given him an answer  saying           the incense that you burned in the cities of judah           and in the streets of jerusalem  you and your fathers           your kings and your princes  and the people of the land           didn t yahweh remember them  and didn t it come into his mind           so that yahweh could no longer bear  because of the evil          of your doings  and because of the abominations which you          have committed  therefore is your land become a desolation           and an astonishment  and a curse  without inhabitant           as it is this day           because you have burned incense  and because you have sinned          against yahweh  and have not obeyed the voice of yahweh           nor walked in his law  nor in his statutes  nor in his testimonies           therefore this evil is happened to you  as it is this day           moreover jeremiah said to all the people  and to all the women           hear the word of yahweh  all judah who are in the land of egypt           thus says yahweh of armies  the god of israel  saying  you and          your wives have both spoken with your mouths  and with your          hands have fulfilled it  saying  we will surely perform          our vows that we have vowed  to burn incense to the queen          of the sky  and to pour out drink offerings to her           establish then your vows  and perform your vows           therefore hear the word of yahweh  all judah who dwell in          the land of egypt   behold  i have sworn by my great name           says yahweh  that my name shall no more be named in the mouth          of any man of judah in all the land of egypt  saying  as the          lord yahweh lives           behold  i watch over them for evil  and not for good           and all the men of judah who are in the land of egypt shall          be consumed by the sword and by the famine  until there          be an end of them           those who escape the sword shall return out of the land of egypt          into the land of judah  few in number  and all the remnant          of judah  who have gone into the land of egypt to sojourn there           shall know whose word shall stand  mine  or theirs           this shall be the sign to you  says yahweh  that i will punish          you in this place  that you may know that my words shall          surely stand against you for evil           thus says yahweh  behold  i will give pharaoh hophra king          of egypt into the hand of his enemies  and into the hand of          those who seek his life  as i gave zedekiah king of judah into          the hand of nebuchadnezzar king of babylon  who was his enemy           and sought his life           the message that jeremiah the prophet spoke to baruch the son          of neriah  when he wrote these words in a book at the mouth          of jeremiah  in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah           king of judah  saying           thus says yahweh  the god of israel  to you  baruch           you did say  woe is me now  for yahweh has added sorrow to my pain           i am weary with my groaning  and i find no rest           thus shall you tell him  thus says yahweh   behold  that which i          have built will i break down  and that which i have planted          i will pluck up  and this in the whole land           seek you great things for yourself   don t seek them           for  behold  i will bring evil on all flesh  says yahweh           but your life will i give to you for a prey in all places          where you go           the word of yahweh which came to jeremiah the prophet          concerning the nations           of egypt   concerning the army of pharaoh necoh king          of egypt  which was by the river euphrates in carchemish           which nebuchadnezzar king of babylon struck in the fourth          year of jehoiakim the son of josiah  king of judah           prepare you the buckler and shield  and draw near to battle           harness the horses  and get up  you horsemen  and stand forth          with your helmets  furbish the spears  put on the coats of mail           why have i seen it  they are dismayed and are turned backward           and their mighty ones are beaten down  and have fled apace           and don t look back   terror is on every side  says yahweh           don t let the swift flee away  nor the mighty man escape           in the north by the river euphrates have they stumbled and fallen           who is this who rises up like the nile  whose waters toss          themselves like the rivers           egypt rises up like the nile  and his waters toss themselves          like the rivers   and he says  i will rise up  i will cover          the earth  i will destroy cities and the inhabitants of it           go up  you horses  and rage  you chariots  and let the mighty men          go forth   cush and put  who handle the shield  and the ludim           who handle and bend the bow           for that day is  a day  of the lord  yahweh of armies  a day          of vengeance  that he may avenge him of his adversaries           and the sword shall devour and be satiate  and shall drink          its fill of their blood  for the lord  yahweh of armies           has a sacrifice in the north country by the river euphrates           go up into gilead  and take balm  virgin daughter of egypt           in vain do you use many medicines  there is no healing for you           the nations have heard of your shame  and the earth is full          of your cry  for the mighty man has stumbled against the mighty           they are fallen both of them together           the word that yahweh spoke to jeremiah the prophet           how that nebuchadnezzar king of babylon should come and strike          the land of egypt           declare you in egypt  and publish in migdol  and publish in memphis          and in tahpanhes   say you  stand forth  and prepare you           for the sword has devoured round about you           why are your strong ones swept away  they didn t stand           because yahweh did drive them           he made many to stumble  yes  they fell one on another           and they said  arise  and let us go again to our own people           and to the land of our birth  from the oppressing sword           they cried there  pharaoh king of egypt is but a noise           he has let the appointed time pass by           as i live  says the king  whose name is yahweh of armies           surely like tabor among the mountains  and like carmel by the sea           so shall he come           you daughter who dwell in egypt  furnish yourself to go          into captivity  for memphis shall become a desolation           and shall be burnt up  without inhabitant           egypt is a very beautiful heifer   but  destruction out of          the north is come  it is come           also her hired men in the midst of her are like calves of the stall           for they also are turned back  they are fled away together           they didn t stand   for the day of their calamity is come          on them  the time of their visitation           the sound of it shall go like the serpent  for they shall march          with an army  and come against her with axes  as wood cutters           they shall cut down her forest  says yahweh  though it          can t be searched  because they are more than the locusts           and are innumerable           the daughter of egypt shall be disappointed  she shall be          delivered into the hand of the people of the north           yahweh of armies  the god of israel  says   behold  i will          punish amon of no  and pharaoh  and egypt  with her gods           and her kings  even pharaoh  and those who trust in him           and i will deliver them into the hand of those who seek their lives           and into the hand of nebuchadnezzar king of babylon  and into          the hand of his servants  and afterwards it shall be inhabited           as in the days of old  says yahweh           but don t be afraid you  jacob my servant  neither be          dismayed  israel   for  behold  i will save you from afar           and your seed from the land of their captivity  and jacob          shall return  and shall be quiet and at ease  and none shall          make him afraid           don t be afraid you  o jacob my servant  says yahweh  for i          am with you   for i will make a full end of all the nations          where i have driven you  but i will not make a full end of you           but i will correct you in measure  and will in no way          leave you unpunished           the word of yahweh that came to jeremiah the prophet concerning          the philistines  before that pharaoh struck gaza           thus says yahweh   behold  waters rise up out of the north           and shall become an overflowing stream  and shall overflow          the land and all that is therein  the city and those who          dwell therein  and the men shall cry  and all the inhabitants          of the land shall wail           at the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong ones           at the rushing of his chariots  at the rumbling of his wheels           the fathers don t look back to their children for          feebleness of hands           because of the day that comes to destroy all the philistines           to cut off from tyre and sidon every helper who remains           for yahweh will destroy the philistines  the remnant of          the isle of caphtor           baldness is come on gaza  ashkelon is brought to nothing           the remnant of their valley   how long will you cut yourself           you sword of yahweh  how long will it be before you be quiet           put up yourself into your scabbard  rest  and be still           how can you be quiet  seeing yahweh has given you a charge           against ashkelon  and against the seashore  there has          he appointed it           of moab   thus says yahweh of armies  the god of israel   woe to          nebo  for it is laid waste  kiriathaim is disappointed           it is taken  misgab is put to shame and broken down           the praise of moab is no more  in heshbon they have devised          evil against her   come  and let us cut her off from being          a nation   you also  madmen  shall be brought to silence           the sword shall pursue you           the sound of a cry from horonaim  desolation and great destruction           moab is destroyed  her little ones have caused a cry to be heard           for by the ascent of luhith with continual weeping shall they go up           for at the descent of horonaim they have heard the distress          of the cry of destruction           flee  save your lives  and be like the heath in the wilderness           for  because you have trusted in your works and in your treasures           you also shall be taken   and chemosh shall go forth into captivity           his priests and his princes together           the destroyer shall come on every city  and no city shall escape           the valley also shall perish  and the plain shall be destroyed           as yahweh has spoken           give wings to moab  that she may fly and get her away           and her cities shall become a desolation  without any          to dwell therein           cursed be he who does the work of yahweh negligently           and cursed be he who keeps back his sword from blood           moab has been at ease from his youth  and he has settled          on his lees  and has not been emptied from vessel to vessel           neither has he gone into captivity   therefore his taste          remains in him  and his scent is not changed           therefore  behold  the days come  says yahweh  that i will send          to him those who pour off  and they shall pour him off  and they          shall empty his vessels  and break their bottles in pieces           moab shall be ashamed of chemosh  as the house of israel was          ashamed of bethel their confidence           how say you  we are mighty men  and valiant men for the war           moab is laid waste  and they are gone up into his cities           and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter           says the king  whose name is yahweh of armies           the calamity of moab is near to come  and his affliction          hurries fast           all you who are round about him  bemoan him  and all you          who know his name  say  how is the strong staff broken           the beautiful rod           you daughter who dwells in dibon  come down from your glory           and sit in thirst  for the destroyer of moab is come up          against you  he has destroyed your strongholds           inhabitant of aroer  stand by the way  and watch           ask him who flees  and her who escapes  say  what has been done           moab is disappointed  for it is broken down   wail and cry           tell you it by the arnon  that moab is laid waste           judgment is come on the plain country  on holon  and on jahzah           and on mephaath           and on dibon  and on nebo  and on beth diblathaim           and on kiriathaim  and on beth gamul  and on beth meon           and on kerioth  and on bozrah  and on all the cities of the land          of moab  far or near           the horn of moab is cut off  and his arm is broken  says yahweh           make you him drunken  for he magnified himself against yahweh           and moab shall wallow in his vomit  and he also shall          be in derision           for wasn t israel a derision to you  was he found among thieves           for as often as you speak of him  you wag the head           you inhabitants of moab  leave the cities  and dwell in the rock           and be like the dove that makes her nest over the mouth          of the abyss           we have heard of the pride of moab   that  he is very proud           his loftiness  and his pride  and his arrogance  and the          haughtiness of his heart           i know his wrath  says yahweh  that it is nothing  his boastings          have worked nothing           therefore will i wail for moab  yes  i will cry out for all moab           for the men of kir heres shall they mourn           with more than the weeping of jazer will i weep for you           vine of sibmah   your branches passed over the sea           they reached even to the sea of jazer   on your summer fruits          and on your vintage the destroyer is fallen           gladness and joy is taken away from the fruitful field          and from the land of moab  and i have caused wine to cease          from the wine presses   none shall tread with shouting           the shouting shall be no shouting           from the cry of heshbon even to elealeh  even to jahaz          have they uttered their voice  from zoar even to horonaim           to eglath shelishiyah   for the waters of nimrim also          shall become desolate           moreover i will cause to cease in moab  says yahweh           him who offers in the high place  and him who burns incense          to his gods           therefore my heart sounds for moab like pipes  and my          heart sounds like pipes for the men of kir heres           therefore the abundance that he has gotten is perished           for every head is bald  and every beard clipped           on all the hands are cuttings  and on the waist sackcloth           on all the housetops of moab and in the streets of it there is          lamentation every where  for i have broken moab like a vessel          in which none delights  says yahweh           how is it broken down   how  do they wail  how has moab          turned the back with shame  so shall moab become a derision          and a terror to all who are round about him           for thus says yahweh   behold  he shall fly as an eagle           and shall spread out his wings against moab           kerioth is taken  and the strongholds are seized  and the heart          of the mighty men of moab at that day shall be as the heart          of a woman in her pangs           moab shall be destroyed from being a people  because he has          magnified himself against yahweh           fear  and the pit  and the snare  are on you  inhabitant          of moab  says yahweh           he who flees from the fear shall fall into the pit           and he who gets up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare           for i will bring on him  even on moab  the year of          their visitation  says yahweh           those who fled stand without strength under the shadow of heshbon           for a fire is gone forth out of heshbon  and a flame from          the midst of sihon  and has devoured the corner of moab           and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones           woe to you  o moab  the people of chemosh is undone  for your sons          are taken away captive  and your daughters into captivity           yet will i bring back the captivity of moab in the latter days           says yahweh   thus far is the judgment of moab           of the children of ammon   thus says yahweh   has israel          no sons  has he no heir  why then does malcam possess gad           and his people well in the cities of it           therefore  behold  the days come  says yahweh  that i will cause          an alarm of war to be heard against rabbah of the children of ammon           and it shall become a desolate heap  and her daughters shall          be burned with fire   then shall israel possess those who did          possess him  says yahweh           wail  heshbon  for ai is laid waste  cry  you daughters of rabbah           gird you with sackcloth   lament  and run back and forth          among the fences  for malcam shall go into captivity           his priests and his princes together           why glory you in the valleys  your flowing valley  backsliding          daughter  who trusted in her treasures   saying   who shall          come to me           behold  i will bring a fear on you  says the lord  yahweh of armies           from all who are round about you  and you shall be driven          out every man right forth  and there shall be none to gather          together the fugitives           but afterward i will bring back the captivity of the children          of ammon  says yahweh           of edom   thus says yahweh of armies   is wisdom no more in teman           is counsel perished from the prudent  is their wisdom vanished           flee you  turn back  dwell in the depths  inhabitants of dedan           for i will bring the calamity of esau on him  the time that i          shall visit him           if grape gatherers came to you  would they not leave some          gleaning grapes  if thieves by night  wouldn t they destroy          until they had enough           but i have made esau bare  i have uncovered his secret places           and he shall not be able to hide himself   his seed is destroyed           and his brothers  and his neighbors  and he is no more           leave your fatherless children  i will preserve them alive           and let your widows trust in me           for thus says yahweh   behold  they to whom it didn t pertain          to drink of the cup shall certainly drink  and are you he who          shall altogether go unpunished  you shall not go unpunished           but you shall surely drink           for i have sworn by myself  says yahweh  that bozrah shall          become an astonishment  a reproach  a waste  and a curse           and all the cities of it shall be perpetual wastes           i have heard news from yahweh  and an ambassador is sent          among the nations   saying   gather yourselves together           and come against her  and rise up to the battle           for  behold  i have made you small among the nations           and despised among men           as for your terror  the pride of your heart has deceived you           o you who dwell in the clefts of the rock  who hold the height          of the hill   though you should make your nest as high          as the eagle  i will bring you down from there  says yahweh           edom shall become an astonishment   everyone who passes by it          shall be astonished  and shall hiss at all the plagues of it           as in the overthrow of sodom and gomorrah and the neighbor          cities of it  says yahweh  no man shall dwell there           neither shall any son of man sojourn therein           behold  he shall come up like a lion from the pride of the jordan          against the strong habitation   for i will suddenly make them run          away from it  and whoever is chosen  him will i appoint over it           for who is like me  and who will appoint me a time  and who is          the shepherd who will stand before me           therefore hear the counsel of yahweh  that he has taken          against edom  and his purposes  that he has purposed against          the inhabitants of teman   surely they shall drag them away            even  the little ones of the flock  surely he shall make          their habitation desolate over them           the earth trembles at the noise of their fall  there is a cry           the noise which is heard in the red sea or  sea of reeds            behold  he shall come up and fly as the eagle  and spread          out his wings against bozrah   and the heart of the mighty          men of edom at that day shall be as the heart of a woman          in her pangs           of damascus   hamath is confounded  and arpad  for they have heard          evil news  they are melted away   there is sorrow on the sea           it can t be quiet           damascus has grown feeble  she turns herself to flee           and trembling has seized on her   anguish and sorrows have          taken hold of her  as of a woman in travail           how is the city of praise not forsaken  the city of my joy           therefore her young men shall fall in her streets  and all          the men of war shall be brought to silence in that day           says yahweh of armies           i will kindle a fire in the wall of damascus  and it shall          devour the palaces of ben hadad           of kedar  and of the kingdoms of hazor  which nebuchadnezzar          king of babylon struck   thus says yahweh   arise you           go up to kedar  and destroy the children of the east           their tents and their flocks shall they take  they shall carry          away for themselves their curtains  and all their vessels           and their camels  and they shall cry to them  terror on every side           flee you  wander far off  dwell in the depths  you inhabitants          of hazor  says yahweh  for nebuchadnezzar king of babylon has taken          counsel against you  and has conceived a purpose against you           arise  go up to a nation that is at ease  that dwells          without care  says yahweh  that have neither gates nor bars           that dwell alone           their camels shall be a booty  and the multitude of their          livestock a spoil   and i will scatter to all winds those who          have the corners  of their hair  cut off  and i will bring          their calamity from every side of them  says yahweh           hazor shall be a dwelling place of jackals  a desolation forever           no man shall dwell there  neither shall any son of          man sojourn therein           the word of yahweh that came to jeremiah the prophet concerning elam           in the beginning of the reign of zedekiah king of judah  saying           thus says yahweh of armies   behold  i will break the bow of elam           the chief of their might           on elam will i bring the four winds from the four quarters          of the sky  and will scatter them toward all those winds           and there shall be no nation where the outcasts of elam          shall not come           i will cause elam to be dismayed before their enemies           and before those who seek their life  and i will bring evil          on them  even my fierce anger  says yahweh  and i will send          the sword after them  until i have consumed them           and i will set my throne in elam  and will destroy from there          king and princes  says yahweh           but it shall happen in the latter days  that i will bring back          the captivity of elam  says yahweh           the word that yahweh spoke concerning babylon  concerning the land          of the chaldeans  by jeremiah the prophet           declare you among the nations and publish  and set up          a standard  publish  and don t conceal   say  babylon is taken           bel is disappointed  merodach is dismayed  her images          are disappointed  her idols are dismayed           for out of the north there comes up a nation against her           which shall make her land desolate  and none shall dwell therein           they are fled  they are gone  both man and animal           in those days  and in that time  says yahweh  the children          of israel shall come  they and the children of judah together           they shall go on their way weeping  and shall seek          yahweh their god           they shall inquire concerning zion with their faces turned          toward it   saying   come you  and join yourselves to yahweh          in an everlasting covenant that shall not be forgotten           my people have been lost sheep   their shepherds have caused          them to go astray  they have turned them away on the mountains           they have gone from mountain to hill  they have forgotten          their resting place           all who found them have devoured them  and their adversaries said           we are not guilty  because they have sinned against yahweh           the habitation of righteousness  even yahweh  the hope          of their fathers           flee out of the midst of babylon  and go forth out of the land          of the chaldeans  and be as the male goats before the flocks           for  behold  i will stir up and cause to come up against babylon          a company of great nations from the north country  and they          shall set themselves in array against her  from there she shall          be taken   their arrows shall be as of an expert mighty man           none shall return in vain           chaldea shall be a prey   all who prey on her shall          be satisfied  says yahweh           because you are glad  because you rejoice  o you who plunder          my heritage  because you are wanton as a heifer that treads          out  the grain   and neigh as strong horses           your mother shall be utterly disappointed  she who bore you shall          be confounded   behold  she shall be the least of the nations           a wilderness  a dry land  and a desert           because of the wrath of yahweh she shall not be inhabited           but she shall be wholly desolate   everyone who goes by babylon          shall be astonished  and hiss at all her plagues           set yourselves in array against babylon round about           all you who bend the bow  shoot at her  spare no arrows           for she has sinned against yahweh           shout against her round about   she has submitted herself           her bulwarks are fallen  her walls are thrown down           for it is the vengeance of yahweh   take vengeance on her           as she has done  do to her           cut off the sower from babylon  and him who handles the sickle          in the time of harvest   for fear of the oppressing sword          they shall turn everyone to his people  and they shall flee          everyone to his own land           israel is a hunted sheep  the lions have driven him away           first  the king of assyria devoured him  and now at last          nebuchadnezzar king of babylon has broken his bones           therefore thus says yahweh of armies  the god of israel   behold  i          will punish the king of babylon and his land  as i have punished          the king of assyria           i will bring israel again to his pasture  and he shall feed          on carmel and bashan  and his soul shall be satisfied on          the hills of ephraim and in gilead           in those days  and in that time  says yahweh  the iniquity          of israel shall be sought for  and there shall be none           and the sins of judah  and they shall not be found           for i will pardon them whom i leave as a remnant           go up against the land of merathaim  even against it  and against          the inhabitants of pekod   kill and utterly destroy after them           says yahweh  and do according to all that i have commanded you           a sound of battle is in the land  and of great destruction           how is the hammer of the whole earth cut apart and broken           how is babylon become a desolation among the nations           i have laid a snare for you  and you are also taken  babylon           and you weren t aware   you are found  and also caught           because you have striven against yahweh           yahweh has opened his armory  and has brought forth the weapons          of his indignation  for the lord  yahweh of armies  has a work           to do  in the land of the chaldeans           come against her from the utmost border  open her storehouses           cast her up as heaps  and destroy her utterly  let nothing          of her be left           kill all her bulls  let them go down to the slaughter           woe to them  for their day is come  the time of their visitation           the voice of those who flee and escape out of the land          of babylon  to declare in zion the vengeance of yahweh our god           the vengeance of his temple           call together the archers against babylon  all those who bend          the bow  encamp against her round about  let none of it escape           recompense her according to her work  according to all that she          has done  do to her  for she has been proud against yahweh           against the holy one of israel           therefore shall her young men fall in her streets  and all her men          of war shall be brought to silence in that day  says yahweh           behold  i am against you  you proud one  says the lord  yahweh          of armies  for your day is come  the time that i will visit you           the proud one shall stumble and fall  and none shall raise him up           and i will kindle a fire in his cities  and it shall devour          all who are round about him           thus says yahweh of armies   the children of israel and the          children of judah are oppressed together  and all who took          them captive hold them fast  they refuse to let them go           their redeemer is strong  yahweh of armies is his name           he will thoroughly plead their cause  that he may give rest          to the earth  and disquiet the inhabitants of babylon           a sword is on the chaldeans  says yahweh  and on the inhabitants          of babylon  and on her princes  and on her wise men           a sword is on the boasters  and they shall become fools           a sword is on her mighty men  and they shall be dismayed           a sword is on their horses  and on their chariots           and on all the mixed people who are in the midst of her           and they shall become as women   a sword is on her treasures           and they shall be robbed           a drought is on her waters  and they shall be dried up           for it is a land of engraved images  and they are mad over idols           therefore the wild animals of the desert with the wolves          shall dwell there  and the ostriches shall dwell therein           and it shall be no more inhabited forever  neither shall it          be lived in from generation to generation           as when god overthrew sodom and gomorrah and the neighbor          cities of it  says yahweh  so shall no man dwell there           neither shall any son of man sojourn therein           behold  a people comes from the north  and a great nation          and many kings shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts          of the earth           they lay hold on bow and spear  they are cruel  and have no mercy           their voice roars like the sea  and they ride on horses           everyone set in array  as a man to the battle  against you           daughter of babylon           the king of babylon has heard the news of them  and his hands          wax feeble   anguish has taken hold of him   and  pangs          as of a woman in travail           behold   the enemy  shall come up like a lion from          the pride of the jordan against the strong habitation           for i will suddenly make them run away from it           and whoever is chosen  him will i appoint over it           for who is like me  and who will appoint me a time  and who is          the shepherd who can stand before me           therefore hear the counsel of yahweh  that he has taken          against babylon  and his purposes  that he has purposed against          the land of the chaldeans   surely they shall drag them away            even  the little ones of the flock  surely he shall make          their habitation desolate over them           at the noise of the taking of babylon the earth trembles           and the cry is heard among the nations           thus says yahweh   behold  i will raise up against babylon           and against those who dwell in lebkamai  a destroying wind           i will send to babylon strangers  who shall winnow her           and they shall empty her land   for in the day of trouble          they shall be against her round about           against  him who  bends let the archer bend his bow           and against  him who  lifts himself up in his coat of mail           and don t you spare her young men  destroy you utterly          all her army           they shall fall down slain in the land of the chaldeans           and thrust through in her streets           for israel is not forsaken  nor judah  of his god  of yahweh          of armies  though their land is full of guilt against          the holy one of israel           flee out of the midst of babylon  and save every man his life           don t be cut off in her iniquity   for it is the time          of yahweh s vengeance  he will render to her a recompense           babylon has been a golden cup in yahweh s hand  who made          all the earth drunken   the nations have drunk of her wine           therefore the nations are mad           babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed   wail for her           take balm for her pain  if so be she may be healed           we would have healed babylon  but she is not healed           forsake her  and let us go everyone into his own country           for her judgment reaches to heaven  and is lifted up even          to the skies           yahweh has brought forth our righteousness   come  and let us          declare in zion the work of yahweh our god           make sharp the arrows  hold firm the shields           yahweh has stirred up the spirit of the kings of the medes           because his purpose is against babylon  to destroy it           for it is the vengeance of yahweh  the vengeance of his temple           set up a standard against the walls of babylon  make the          watch strong  set the watchmen  prepare the ambushes           for yahweh has both purposed and done that which he spoke          concerning the inhabitants of babylon           you who dwell on many waters  abundant in treasures  your end          is come  the measure of your covetousness           yahweh of armies has sworn by himself   saying   surely i          will fill you with men  as with the canker worm  and they          shall lift up a shout against you           he has made the earth by his power  he has established the world          by his wisdom  and by his understanding has he stretched          out the heavens           when he utters his voice  there is a tumult of waters in the heavens           and he causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth           he makes lightning for the rain  and brings forth the wind          out of his treasuries           every man is become brutish  and is  without knowledge           every goldsmith is disappointed by his image  for his molten          image is falsehood  and there is no breath in them           they are vanity  a work of delusion   in the time of their          visitation they shall perish           the portion of jacob is not like these  for he is the former          of all things  and  israel  is the tribe of his inheritance           yahweh of armies is his name           you are my battle axe and weapons of war   and with you will i          break in pieces the nations  and with you will i destroy kingdoms           and with you will i break in pieces the horse and his rider           and with you will i break in pieces the chariot and him who          rides therein  and with you will i break in pieces man and woman           and with you will i break in pieces the old man and the youth           and with you will i break in pieces the young man and the virgin           and with you will i break in pieces the shepherd and his flock           and with you will i break in pieces the farmer and his          yoke  of oxen   and with you will i break in pieces          governors and deputies           i will render to babylon and to all the inhabitants of chaldea          all their evil that they have done in zion in your sight           says yahweh           behold  i am against you  destroying mountain  says yahweh           which destroys all the earth  and i will stretch out my hand          on you  and roll you down from the rocks  and will make you          a burnt mountain           they shall not take of you a stone for a corner  nor a stone          for foundations  but you shall be desolate for ever  says yahweh           set up a standard in the land  blow the trumpet among          the nations  prepare the nations against her  call together          against her the kingdoms of ararat  minni  and ashkenaz           appoint a marshal against her  cause the horses to come up          as the rough canker worm           prepare against her the nations  the kings of the medes           the governors of it  and all the deputies of it  and all          the land of their dominion           the land trembles and is in pain  for the purposes of yahweh          against babylon do stand  to make the land of babylon          a desolation  without inhabitant           the mighty men of babylon have forborne to fight           they remain in their strongholds  their might has failed           they are become as women   her dwelling places are set on fire           her bars are broken           one runner will run to meet another  and one messenger          to meet another  to show the king of babylon that his city          is taken on every quarter           and the passages are seized  and the reeds they have burned          with fire  and the men of war are frightened           for thus says yahweh of armies  the god of israel   the daughter          of babylon is like a threshing floor at the time when it          is trodden  yet a little while  and the time of harvest shall          come for her           nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon has devoured me  he has          crushed me  he has made me an empty vessel  he has  like a monster           swallowed me up  he has filled his maw with my delicacies           he has cast me out           the violence done to me and to my flesh be on babylon           shall the inhabitant of zion say  and  my blood be on          the inhabitants of chaldea  shall jerusalem say           therefore thus says yahweh   behold  i will plead your cause           and take vengeance for you  and i will dry up her sea           and make her fountain dry           babylon shall become heaps  a dwelling place for jackals           an astonishment  and a hissing  without inhabitant           they shall roar together like young lions  they shall growl          as lions  cubs           when they are heated  i will make their feast  and i will make          them drunken  that they may rejoice  and sleep a perpetual sleep           and not wake  says yahweh           i will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter  like rams          with male goats           how is sheshach taken  and the praise of the whole earth seized           how is babylon become a desolation among the nations           the sea is come up on babylon  she is covered with the multitude          of the waves of it           her cities are become a desolation  a dry land  and a desert           a land in which no man dwells  neither does any son of          man pass thereby           i will execute judgment on bel in babylon  and i will bring          forth out of his mouth that which he has swallowed up           and the nations shall not flow any more to him   yes  the wall          of babylon shall fall           my people  go you out of the midst of her  and save yourselves          every man from the fierce anger of yahweh           don t let your heart faint  neither fear for the news that          shall be heard in the land  for news shall come one year           and after that in another year  shall come  news  and violence          in the land  ruler against ruler           therefore  behold  the days come  that i will execute judgment          on the engraved images of babylon  and her whole land shall          be confounded  and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her           then the heavens and the earth  and all that is therein           shall sing for joy over babylon  for the destroyers shall          come to her from the north  says yahweh           as babylon has caused the slain of israel to fall  so at babylon          shall fall the slain of all the land           you who have escaped the sword  go you  don t stand still           remember yahweh from afar  and let jerusalem come into your mind           we are confounded  because we have heard reproach  confusion has          covered our faces   for strangers are come into the sanctuaries          of yahweh s house           therefore  behold  the days come  says yahweh  that i will          execute judgment on her engraved images  and through all her          land the wounded shall groan           though babylon should mount up to the sky  and though she          should fortify the height of her strength  yet from me shall          destroyers come to her  says yahweh           the sound of a cry from babylon  and of great destruction          from the land of the chaldeans           for yahweh lays babylon waste  and destroys out of her          the great voice  and their waves roar like many waters           the noise of their voice is uttered           for the destroyer is come on her  even on babylon  and her          mighty men are taken  their bows are broken in pieces           for yahweh is a god of recompenses  he will surely requite           i will make drunk her princes and her wise men  her governors          and her deputies  and her mighty men  and they shall sleep          a perpetual sleep  and not wake up  says the king  whose name          is yahweh of armies           thus says yahweh of armies   the broad walls of babylon          shall be utterly overthrown  and her high gates shall be          burned with fire  and the peoples shall labor for vanity           and the nations for the fire  and they shall be weary           the word which jeremiah the prophet commanded seraiah the son          of neriah  the son of mahseiah  when he went with zedekiah          the king of judah to babylon in the fourth year of his reign           now seraiah was chief quartermaster           jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come on babylon           even all these words that are written concerning babylon           jeremiah said to seraiah  when you come to babylon  then see          that you read all these words           and say  yahweh  you have spoken concerning this place  to cut          it off  that none shall dwell therein  neither man nor animal           but that it shall be desolate forever           it shall be  when you have made an end of reading this book           that you shall bind a stone to it  and cast it into the midst          of the euphrates           and you shall say  thus shall babylon sink  and shall not          rise again because of the evil that i will bring on her           and they shall be weary   thus far are the words of jeremiah           zedekiah was twenty one years old when he began to reign           and he reigned eleven years in jerusalem   and his mother s          name was hamutal the daughter of jeremiah of libnah           he did that which was evil in the sight of yahweh  according to          all that jehoiakim had done           for through the anger of yahweh did it happen in jerusalem          and judah  until he had cast them out from his presence           zedekiah rebelled against the king of babylon           it happened in the ninth year of his reign  in the tenth month           in the tenth day of the month  that nebuchadnezzar king          of babylon came  he and all his army  against jerusalem           and encamped against it  and they built forts against          it round about           so the city was besieged to the eleventh year of king zedekiah           in the fourth month  in the ninth day of the month  the famine          was sore in the city  so that there was no bread for the people          of the land           then a breach was made in the city  and all the men of war fled           and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate          between the two walls  which was by the king s garden            now the chaldeans were against the city round about            and they went toward the arabah           but the army of the chaldeans pursued after the king           and overtook zedekiah in the plains of jericho  and all his          army was scattered from him           then they took the king  and carried him up to the king          of babylon to riblah in the land of hamath  and he gave          judgment on him           the king of babylon killed the sons of zedekiah before his eyes           he killed also all the princes of judah in riblah           he put out the eyes of zedekiah  and the king of babylon          bound him in fetters  and carried him to babylon  and put          him in prison until the day of his death           now in the fifth month  in the tenth day of the month           which was the nineteenth year of king nebuchadnezzar           king of babylon  came nebuzaradan the captain of the guard           who stood before the king of babylon  into jerusalem           and he burned the house of yahweh  and the king s house           and all the houses of jerusalem  even every great house           burned he with fire           all the army of the chaldeans  who were with the captain of          the guard  broke down all the walls of jerusalem round about           then nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive          of the poorest of the people  and the residue of the people          who were left in the city  and those who fell away  who fell          to the king of babylon  and the residue of the multitude           but nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poorest          of the land to be vineyard keepers and farmers           the pillars of brass that were in the house of yahweh           and the bases and the bronze sea that were in the house of yahweh           did the chaldeans break in pieces  and carried all the brass          of them to babylon           the pots also  and the shovels  and the snuffers  and the basins           and the spoons  and all the vessels of brass with which          they ministered  took they away           the cups  and the fire pans  and the basins  and the pots           and the lampstands  and the spoons  and the bowls            that which was of gold  in gold  and that which was of silver           in silver   the captain of the guard took away           the two pillars  the one sea  and the twelve bronze bulls          that were under the bases  which king solomon had made          for the house of yahweh   the brass of all these vessels          was without weight           as for the pillars  the height of the one pillar was          eighteen cubits  and a line of twelve cubits did compass it           and the thickness of it was four fingers   it was hollow           a capital of brass was on it  and the height of the one capital          was five cubits  with network and pomegranates on the capital          round about  all of brass   and the second pillar also had          like these  and pomegranates           there were ninety six pomegranates on the sides  all the          pomegranates were one hundred on the network round about           the captain of the guard took seraiah the chief priest           and zephaniah the second priest  and the three keepers          of the threshold           and out of the city he took an officer who was set over the men          of war  and seven men of those who saw the king s face           who were found in the city  and the scribe of the captain          of the army  who mustered the people of the land  and sixty          men of the people of the land  who were found in the midst          of the city           nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them  and brought          them to the king of babylon to riblah           the king of babylon struck them  and put them to death at riblah          in the land of hamath   so judah was carried away captive          out of his land           this is the people whom nebuchadnezzar carried away captive           in the seventh year three thousand twenty three jews           in the eighteenth year of nebuchadnezzar he carried away          captive from jerusalem eight hundred thirty two persons           in the three and twentieth year of nebuchadnezzar nebuzaradan          the captain of the guard carried away captive of the jews          seven hundred forty five persons   all the persons were four          thousand and six hundred           it happened in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity          of jehoiachin king of judah  in the twelfth month           in the five and twentieth day of the month  that evilmerodach          king of babylon  in the  first  year of his reign  lifted up          the head of jehoiachin king of judah  and brought him forth          out of prison           and he spoke kindly to him  and set his throne above the throne          of the kings who were with him in babylon           and changed his prison garments    jehoiachin  ate bread          before him continually all the days of his life           and for his allowance  there

to you            says yahweh of armies           don t you be like your fathers  to whom the former prophets          proclaimed  saying   thus says yahweh of armies   return now          from your evil ways  and from your evil doings   but they          did not hear  nor listen to me  says yahweh           your fathers  where are they   and the prophets           do they live forever           but my words and my decrees  which i commanded my servants          the prophets  didn t they overtake your fathers            then they repented and said   just as yahweh of armies          determined to do to us  according to our ways  and according          to our practices  so he has dealt with us             on the twenty fourth day of the eleventh month  which is          the month shebat  in the second year of darius  the word of          yahweh came to zechariah the son of berechiah  the son of iddo           the prophet  saying            i had a vision in the night  and behold  a man riding on a red horse           and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in a ravine           and behind him there were red  brown  and white horses           then i asked   my lord  what are these     the angel who talked          with me said to me   i will show you what these are            the man who stood among the myrtle trees answered   they are          the ones yahweh has sent to go back and forth through the earth            they reported to the angel of yahweh who stood among the myrtle trees           and said   we have walked back and forth through the earth           and behold  all the earth is at rest and in peace            then the angel of yahweh replied   o yahweh of armies  how long          will you not have mercy on jerusalem and on the cities of judah           against which you have had indignation these seventy years            yahweh answered the angel who talked with me with kind          and comforting words           so the angel who talked with me said to me   proclaim  saying            thus says yahweh of armies    i am jealous for jerusalem          and for zion with a great jealousy           i am very angry with the nations that are at ease  for i was          but a little displeased  but they added to the calamity            therefore thus says yahweh    i have returned to jerusalem          with mercy   my house shall be built in it   says yahweh of armies            and a line shall be stretched forth over jerusalem              proclaim further  saying   thus says yahweh of armies    my cities          will again overflow with prosperity  and yahweh will again          comfort zion  and will again choose jerusalem              i lifted up my eyes  and saw  and behold  four horns           i asked the angel who talked with me   what are these            he answered me   these are the horns which have scattered          judah  israel  and jerusalem            yahweh showed me four craftsmen           then i asked   what are these coming to do    he said            these are the horns which scattered judah  so that no man          lifted up his head  but these have come to terrify them           to cast down the horns of the nations  which lifted up their          horn against the land of judah to scatter it            i lifted up my eyes  and saw  and behold  a man with a measuring          line in his hand           then i asked   where are you going    he said to me            to measure jerusalem  to see what is its breadth and what          is its length            behold  the angel who talked with me went forth  and another          angel went out to meet him           and said to him   run  speak to this young man  saying            jerusalem will be inhabited as villages without walls           because of the multitude of men and livestock in it           for i   says yahweh   will be to her a wall of fire around it           and i will be the glory in the midst of her           come   come   flee from the land of the north   says yahweh            for i have spread you abroad as the four winds of the sky            says yahweh            come  zion   escape  you who dwell with the daughter of babylon            for thus says yahweh of armies    for honor he has sent me          to the nations which plundered you  for he who touches you          touches the apple of his eye           for  behold  i will shake my hand over them  and they will be          a spoil to those who served them  and you will know that yahweh          of armies has sent me           sing and rejoice  daughter of zion  for  behold  i come           and i will dwell in the midst of you   says yahweh           many nations shall join themselves to yahweh in that day           and shall be my people  and i will dwell in the midst of you           and you shall know that yahweh of armies has sent me to you           yahweh will inherit judah as his portion in the holy land           and will again choose jerusalem           be silent  all flesh  before yahweh  for he has roused himself          from his holy habitation            he showed me joshua the high priest standing before          the angel of yahweh  and satan standing at his right hand          to be his adversary           yahweh said to satan   yahweh rebuke you  satan   yes  yahweh who          has chosen jerusalem rebuke you   isn t this a burning stick          plucked out of the fire            now joshua was clothed with filthy garments  and was standing          before the angel           he answered and spoke to those who stood before him  saying            take the filthy garments off of him    to him he said            behold  i have caused your iniquity to pass from you           and i will clothe you with rich clothing            i said   let them set a clean turban on his head            so they set a clean turban on his head  and clothed him           and the angel of yahweh was standing by           the angel of yahweh protested to joshua  saying            thus says yahweh of armies    if you will walk in my ways           and if you will keep my charge  then you also shall judge          my house  and shall also keep my courts  and i will give you          a place of access among these who stand by           hear now  joshua the high priest  you and your fellows          who sit before you  for they are men who are a sign           for  behold  i will bring forth my servant  the branch           for  behold  the stone that i have set before joshua  on one stone          are seven eyes   behold  i will engrave the engraving of it            says yahweh of armies   and i will remove the iniquity          of that land in one day           in that day   says yahweh of armies   you will invite every          man his neighbor under the vine and under the fig tree             the angel who talked with me came again  and wakened me           as a man who is wakened out of his sleep           he said to me   what do you see    i said   i have seen           and behold  a lampstand all of gold  with its bowl on the top          of it  and its seven lamps thereon  there are seven pipes          to each of the lamps  which are on the top of it           and two olive trees by it  one on the right side of the bowl           and the other on the left side of it            i answered and spoke to the angel who talked with me  saying            what are these  my lord            then the angel who talked with me answered me   don t you know          what these are    i said   no  my lord            then he answered and spoke to me  saying   this is the word          of yahweh to zerubbabel  saying   not by might  nor by power           but by my spirit   says yahweh of armies           who are you  great mountain   before zerubbabel you are a plain           and he will bring out the capstone with shouts of  grace           grace  to it             moreover the word of yahweh came to me  saying            the hands of zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house           his hands shall also finish it  and you will know that yahweh          of armies has sent me to you           indeed  who despises the day of small things           for these seven shall rejoice  and shall see the plumb line          in the hand of zerubbabel   these are the eyes of yahweh           which run back and forth through the whole earth            then i asked him   what are these two olive trees on the right          side of the lampstand and on the left side of it            i asked him the second time   what are these two olive branches           which are beside the two golden spouts  that pour the golden          oil out of themselves            he answered me   don t you know what these are            i said   no  my lord            then he said   these are the two anointed ones who stand          by the lord of the whole earth            then again i lifted up my eyes  and saw  and behold           a flying scroll           he said to me   what do you see    i answered   i see a flying scroll           its length is twenty cubits  and its breadth ten cubits            then he said to me   this is the curse that goes out over          the surface of the whole land  for everyone who steals shall          be cut off according to it on the one side  and everyone          who swears falsely shall be cut off according to it on          the other side           i will cause it to go out   says yahweh of armies   and it          will enter into the house of the thief  and into the house          of him who swears falsely by my name  and it will remain          in the midst of his house  and will destroy it with its timber          and its stones            then the angel who talked with me came forward  and said to me            lift up now your eyes  and see what is this that is appearing            i said   what is it    he said   this is the ephah  an ephah          is a measure of volume of about    litres      u  s  gallons               imperial gallons  or a bit more than half a bushel             basket that is appearing    he said moreover   this is          their appearance in all the land           and behold  a talent a talent is a weight of about    kilograms          or    pounds   of lead was lifted up   and this is a woman          sitting in the midst of the ephah basket            he said   this is wickedness   and he threw her down into          the midst of the ephah basket  and he threw the weight of lead          on its mouth           then lifted i up my eyes  and saw  and behold           there were two women  and the wind was in their wings           now they had wings like the wings of a stork  and they lifted          up the ephah basket between earth and the sky           then said i to the angel who talked with me   where are these          carrying the ephah basket            he said to me   to build her a house in the land of shinar           when it is prepared  she will be set there in her own place            again i lifted up my eyes  and saw  and behold  four chariots          came out from between two mountains  and the mountains were          mountains of brass           in the first chariot were red horses  in the second          chariot black horses           in the third chariot white horses  and in the fourth chariot          dappled horses  all of them powerful           then i asked the angel who talked with me   what are these  my lord            the angel answered me   these are the four winds of the sky           which go forth from standing before the lord of all the earth           the one with the black horses goes out toward the north country           and the white went out after them  and the dappled went forth          toward the south country            the strong went out  and sought to go that they might walk          back and forth through the earth   and he said   go around          and through the earth    so they walked back and forth          through the earth           then he called to me  and spoke to me  saying   behold           those who go toward the north country have quieted my spirit          in the north country            the word of yahweh came to me  saying            take of them of the captivity  even of heldai  of tobijah           and of jedaiah  and come the same day  and go into the house          of josiah the son of zephaniah  where they have come from babylon           yes  take silver and gold  and make crowns  and set them on          the head of joshua the son of jehozadak  the high priest           and speak to him  saying   thus says yahweh of armies   behold           the man whose name is the branch   and he shall grow up out          of his place  and he shall build the temple of yahweh           even he shall build the temple of yahweh  and he shall bear          the glory  and shall sit and rule on his throne  and he shall          be a priest on his throne  and the counsel of peace shall          be between them both           the crowns shall be to helem  and to tobijah  and to jedaiah           and to hen the son of zephaniah  for a memorial in the          temple of yahweh           those who are far off shall come and build in the temple of yahweh           and you shall know that yahweh of armies has sent me to you           this will happen  if you will diligently obey the voice          of yahweh your god              it happened in the fourth year of king darius that the word          of yahweh came to zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth month           the month of chislev           the people of bethel sent sharezer and regem melech  and their men           to entreat yahweh s favor           and to speak to the priests of the house of yahweh of armies           and to the prophets  saying   should i weep in the fifth month           separating myself  as i have done these so many years            then the word of yahweh of armies came to me  saying            speak to all the people of the land  and to the priests  saying            when you fasted and mourned in the fifth and in the seventh          month for these seventy years  did you at all fast to me           really to me           when you eat  and when you drink  don t you eat for yourselves           and drink for yourselves           aren t these the words which yahweh proclaimed by the former prophets           when jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity  and its cities          around her  and the south and the lowland were inhabited             the word of yahweh came to zechariah  saying            thus has yahweh of armies spoken  saying   execute true judgment           and show kindness and compassion every man to his brother           don t oppress the widow  nor the fatherless  the foreigner           nor the poor  and let none of you devise evil against his          brother in your heart            but they refused to listen  and turned their backs  and stopped          their ears  that they might not hear           yes  they made their hearts as hard as flint  lest they might          hear the law  and the words which yahweh of armies had sent          by his spirit by the former prophets   therefore great wrath          came from yahweh of armies           it has come to pass that  as he called  and they refused          to listen  so they will call  and i will not listen            said yahweh of armies            but i will scatter them with a whirlwind among all the nations          which they have not known   thus the land was desolate          after them  so that no man passed through nor returned           for they made the pleasant land desolate            the word of yahweh of armies came to me           thus says yahweh of armies    i am jealous for zion with          great jealousy  and i am jealous for her with great wrath            thus says yahweh    i have returned to zion  and will dwell in the          midst of jerusalem   jerusalem shall be called  the city of truth            and the mountain of yahweh of armies   the holy mountain             thus says yahweh of armies    old men and old women will again          dwell in the streets of jerusalem  every man with his staff          in his hand for very age           the streets of the city will be full of boys and girls playing          in its streets            thus says yahweh of armies    if it is marvelous in the eyes          of the remnant of this people in those days  should it also be          marvelous in my eyes   says yahweh of armies           thus says yahweh of armies    behold  i will save my people          from the east country  and from the west country           and i will bring them  and they will dwell in the midst of jerusalem           and they will be my people  and i will be their god           in truth and in righteousness            thus says yahweh of armies    let your hands be strong           you who hear in these days these words from the mouth          of the prophets who were in the day that the foundation          of the house of yahweh of armies was laid  even the temple           that it might be built           for before those days there was no wages for man           nor any wages for an animal  neither was there any peace          to him who went out or came in  because of the adversary           for i set all men everyone against his neighbor           but now i will not be to the remnant of this people as in          the former days   says yahweh of armies            for the seed of peace and the vine will yield its fruit           and the ground will give its increase  and the heavens will          give their dew  and i will cause the remnant of this people          to inherit all these things           it shall come to pass that  as you were a curse among          the nations  house of judah and house of israel  so will i          save you  and you shall be a blessing   don t be afraid           let your hands be strong            for thus says yahweh of armies    as i thought to do evil to you           when your fathers provoked me to wrath   says yahweh of armies            and i didn t repent           so again have i thought in these days to do good to jerusalem          and to the house of judah   don t be afraid           these are the things that you shall do   speak every man          the truth with his neighbor   execute the judgment of truth          and peace in your gates           and let none of you devise evil in your hearts against          his neighbor  and love no false oath   for all these are things          that i hate   says yahweh           the word of yahweh of armies came to me           thus says yahweh of armies    the fasts of the fourth fifth           seventh  and tenth months shall be for the house of judah          joy and gladness  and cheerful feasts   therefore love          truth and peace            thus says yahweh of armies    many peoples  and the inhabitants          of many cities will yet come           and the inhabitants of one shall go to another  saying   let us          go speedily to entreat the favor of yahweh  and to seek yahweh          of armies   i will go also            yes  many peoples and strong nations will come to seek yahweh          of armies in jerusalem  and to entreat the favor of yahweh            thus says yahweh of armies    in those days  ten men will take hold           out of all the languages of the nations  they will take hold          of the skirt of him who is a jew  saying   we will go with you           for we have heard that god is with you             an oracle   the word of yahweh is against the land of hadrach           and will rest upon damascus  for the eye of man and of all          the tribes of israel is toward yahweh           and hamath  also  which borders on it  tyre and sidon           because they are very wise           tyre built herself a stronghold  and heaped up silver like the dust           and fine gold like the mire of the streets           behold  the lord will dispossess her  and he will strike her          power in the sea  and she will be devoured with fire           ashkelon will see it  and fear  gaza also  and will writhe in agony           as will ekron  for her expectation will be disappointed           and the king will perish from gaza  and ashkelon will          not be inhabited           foreigners will dwell in ashdod  and i will cut off the pride          of the philistines           i will take away his blood out of his mouth  and his abominations          from between his teeth  and he also will be a remnant for our god           and he will be as a chieftain in judah  and ekron as a jebusite           i will encamp around my house against the army  that none pass          through or return  and no oppressor will pass through them any more           for now i have seen with my eyes           rejoice greatly  daughter of zion   shout  daughter          of jerusalem   behold  your king comes to you   he is righteous           and having salvation  lowly  and riding on a donkey           even on a colt  the foal of a donkey           i will cut off the chariot from ephraim  and the horse from jerusalem           and the battle bow will be cut off  and he will speak peace          to the nations   and his dominion will be from sea to sea           and from the river to the ends of the earth           as for you also  because of the blood of your covenant  i have          set free your prisoners from the pit in which is no water           turn to the stronghold  you prisoners of hope   even today i          declare that i will restore double to you           for indeed i bend judah as a bow for me   i have filled          the bow with ephraim  and i will stir up your sons  zion           against your sons  greece  and will make you like the sword          of a mighty man           yahweh will be seen over them  and his arrow will go flash          like lightning  and the lord yahweh will blow the trumpet           and will go with whirlwinds of the south           yahweh of armies will defend them  and they will destroy          and overcome with sling stones  and they will drink           and roar as through wine  and they will be filled like bowls           like the corners of the altar           yahweh their god will save them in that day as the flock          of his people  for they are like the jewels of a crown           lifted on high over his land           for how great is his goodness  and how great is his beauty           grain will make the young men flourish  and new wine the virgins           ask of yahweh rain in the spring time  yahweh who makes          storm clouds  and he gives rain showers to everyone for          the plants in the field           for the teraphim have spoken vanity  and the diviners have seen          a lie  and they have told false dreams   they comfort in vain           therefore they go their way like sheep   they are oppressed           because there is no shepherd           my anger is kindled against the shepherds  and i will punish          the male goats  for yahweh of armies has visited his flock           the house of judah  and will make them as his majestic horse          in the battle           from him will come forth the cornerstone  from him the nail           from him the battle bow  from him every ruler together           they shall be as mighty men  treading down muddy streets in          the battle  and they shall fight  because yahweh is with them           and the riders on horses will be confounded            i will strengthen the house of judah  and i will save the house          of joseph  and i will bring them back  for i have mercy on them           and they will be as though i had not cast them off           for i am yahweh their god  and i will hear them           ephraim will be like a mighty man  and their heart will rejoice          as through wine  yes  their children will see it  and rejoice           their heart will be glad in yahweh           i will signal for them  and gather them  for i have redeemed them           and they will increase as they have increased           i will sow them among the peoples  and they will remember me          in far countries  and they will live with their children           and will return           i will bring them again also out of the land of egypt           and gather them out of assyria  and i will bring them into          the land of gilead and lebanon  and there won t be room          enough for them           he will pass through the sea of affliction  and will strike          the waves in the sea  and all the depths of the nile will dry up           and the pride of assyria will be brought down  and the scepter          of egypt will depart           i will strengthen them in yahweh  and they will walk up          and down in his name   says yahweh           open your doors  lebanon  that the fire may devour your cedars           wail  fir tree  for the cedar has fallen  because the stately          ones are destroyed   wail  you oaks of bashan  for the strong          forest has come down           a voice of the wailing of the shepherds   for their glory          is destroyed   a voice of the roaring of young lions           for the pride of the jordan is ruined           thus says yahweh my god    feed the flock of slaughter           their buyers slaughter them  and go unpunished           those who sell them say   blessed be yahweh  for i am rich            and their own shepherds don t pity them           for i will no more pity the inhabitants of the land            says yahweh   but  behold  i will deliver the men everyone          into his neighbor s hand  and into the hand of his king           they will strike the land  and out of their hand i will          not deliver them            so i fed the flock of slaughter  especially the oppressed          of the flock   i took for myself two staffs           the one i called  favor   and the other i called  union            and i fed the flock           i cut off the three shepherds in one month  for my soul was          weary of them  and their soul also loathed me           then i said   i will not feed you   that which dies  let it die           and that which is to be cut off  let it be cut off           and let those who are left eat each other s flesh            i took my staff favor  and cut it apart  that i might break          my covenant that i had made with all the peoples           it was broken in that day  and thus the poor of the flock          that listened to me knew that it was the word of yahweh           i said to them   if you think it best  give me my wages           and if not  keep them    so they weighed for my wages thirty          pieces of silver           yahweh said to me   throw it to the potter  the handsome price          that i was valued at by them    i took the thirty pieces of silver           and threw them to the potter  in the house of yahweh           then i cut apart my other staff  even union  that i might break          the brotherhood between judah and israel           yahweh said to me   take for yourself yet again the equipment          of a foolish shepherd           for  behold  i will raise up a shepherd in the land           who will not visit those who are cut off  neither will seek          those who are scattered  nor heal that which is broken           nor feed that which is sound  but he will eat the flesh          of the fat sheep  and will tear their hoofs in pieces           woe to the worthless shepherd who leaves the flock           the sword will be on his arm  and on his right eye           his arm will be completely withered  and his right eye will          be totally blinded            an oracle   the word of yahweh concerning israel           yahweh  who stretches out the heavens  and lays the foundation          of the earth  and forms the spirit of man within him says            behold  i will make jerusalem a cup of reeling to all          the surrounding peoples  and on judah also will it be in          the siege against jerusalem           it will happen in that day  that i will make jerusalem a burdensome          stone for all the peoples   all who burden themselves with it          will be severely wounded  and all the nations of the earth          will be gathered together against it           in that day   says yahweh   i will strike every horse          with terror  and his rider with madness  and i will open          my eyes on the house of judah  and will strike every horse          of the peoples with blindness           the chieftains of judah will say in their heart   the inhabitants          of jerusalem are my strength in yahweh of armies their god            in that day i will make the chieftains of judah like a pan          of fire among wood  and like a flaming torch among sheaves           and they will devour all the surrounding peoples  on the right          hand and on the left  and jerusalem will yet again dwell          in their own place  even in jerusalem           yahweh also will save the tents of judah first  that the glory          of the house of david and the glory of the inhabitants          of jerusalem not be magnified above judah           in that day yahweh will defend the inhabitants of jerusalem           he who is feeble among them at that day will be like david           and the house of david will be like god  like the angel          of yahweh before them           it will happen in that day  that i will seek to destroy all          the nations that come against jerusalem           i will pour on the house of david  and on the inhabitants          of jerusalem  the spirit of grace and of supplication  and they will          look to me after  me   the hebrew has the two letters  aleph tav            the first and last letters of the hebrew alphabet   not as          a word  but as a grammatical marker   whom they have pierced           and they shall mourn for him  as one mourns for his only son           and will grieve bitterly for him  as one grieves for his firstborn           in that day there will be a great mourning in jerusalem           like the mourning of hadadrimmon in the valley of megiddon           the land will mourn  every family apart  the family of the house          of david apart  and their wives apart  the family of the house          of nathan apart  and their wives apart           the family of the house of levi apart  and their wives apart           the family of the shimeites apart  and their wives apart           all the families who remain  every family apart           and their wives apart            in that day there will be a spring opened to the house          of david and to the inhabitants of jerusalem  for sin          and for uncleanness           it will come to pass in that day  says yahweh of armies           that i will cut off the names of the idols out of the land           and they will be remembered no more   i will also cause          the prophets and the spirit of impurity to pass out of the land           it will happen that  when anyone still prophesies           then his father and his mother who bore him will tell him            you must die  because you speak lies in the name of yahweh            and his father and his mother who bore him will stab him          when he prophesies           it will happen in that day  that the prophets will each be          ashamed of his vision  when he prophesies  neither will they          wear a hairy mantle to deceive           but he will say   i am no prophet  i am a tiller of the ground           for i have been made a bondservant from my youth            one will say to him   what are these wounds between your arms            then he will answer   those with which i was wounded in the house          of my friends             awake  sword  against my shepherd  and against the man who is          close to me   says yahweh of armies    strike the shepherd           and the sheep will be scattered  and i will turn my hand          against the little ones           it shall happen that in all the land   says yahweh   two parts          in it will be cut off and die  but the third will be left in it           i will bring the third part into the fire  and will refine them          as silver is refined  and will test them like gold is tested           they will call on my name  and i will hear them   i will say            it is my people   and they will say   yahweh is my god             behold  a day of yahweh comes  when your spoil will be divided          in your midst           for i will gather all nations against jerusalem to battle  and the          city will be taken  the houses rifled  and the women ravished           half of the city will go out into captivity  and the rest          of the people will not be cut off from the city           then yahweh will go out and fight against those nations           as when he fought in the day of battle           his feet will stand in that day on the mount of olives  which is          before jerusalem on the east  and the mount of olives will be          split in two  from east to west  making a very great valley           half of the mountain will move toward the north  and half          of it toward the south           you shall flee by the valley of my mountains  for the valley          of the mountains shall reach to azel  yes  you shall flee           just like you fled from before the earthquake in the days          of uzziah king of judah   yahweh my god will come  and all          the holy ones with you           it will happen in that day  that there will not be light           cold  or frost           it will be a unique day which is known to yahweh  not day           and not night  but it will come to pass  that at evening time          there will be light           it will happen in that day  that living waters will go          out from jerusalem  half of them toward the eastern sea           and half of them toward the western sea  in summer and in winter          will it be           yahweh will be king over all the earth   in that day yahweh          will be one  and his name one           all the land will be made like the arabah  from geba          to rimmon south of jerusalem  and she will be lifted up           and will dwell in her place  from benjamin s gate to the place          of the first gate  to the corner gate  and from the tower          of hananel to the king s winepresses           men will dwell therein  and there will be no more curse           but jerusalem will dwell safely           this will be the plague with which yahweh will strike          all the peoples who have warred against jerusalem           their flesh will consume away while they stand on their feet           and their eyes will consume away in their sockets  and their          tongue will consume away in their mouth           it will happen in that day  that a great panic from yahweh          will be among them  and they will lay hold everyone on the hand          of his neighbor  and his hand will rise up against the hand          of his neighbor           judah also will fight at jerusalem  and the wealth of all          the surrounding nations will be gathered together           gold  and silver  and clothing  in great abundance           so will be the plague of the horse  of the mule  of the camel           and of the donkey  and of all the animals that will be in          those camps  as that plague           it will happen that everyone who is left of all the nations that          came against jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship          the king  yahweh of armies  and to keep the feast of tents           it will be  that whoever of all the families of the earth doesn t          go up to jerusalem to worship the king  yahweh of armies           on them there will be no rain           if the family of egypt doesn t go up  and doesn t come           neither will it rain on them   this will be the plague          with which yahweh will strike the nations that don t go up          to keep the feast of tents           this will be the punishment of egypt  and the punishment of all          the nations that don t go up to keep the feast of tents           in that day there will be on the bells of the horses            holy to yahweh   and the pots in yahweh s house will be          like the bowls before the altar           yes  every pot in jerusalem and in judah will be holy to yahweh          of armies  and all those who sacrifice will come and take          of them  and cook in them   in that day there will no longer          be a canaanite in the house of yahweh of armies                      the spirit of holiness  by the resurrection from the dead           jesus christ our lord           through whom we received grace and apostleship  for obedience          of faith among all the nations  for his name s sake           among whom you are also called to belong to jesus christ           to all who are in rome  beloved of god  called to be saints           grace to you and peace from god our father and the          lord jesus christ           first  i thank my god through jesus christ for all of you           that your faith is proclaimed throughout the whole world           for god is my witness  whom i serve in my spirit in the good news          of his son  how unceasingly i make mention of you always          in my prayers           requesting  if by any means now at last i may be prospered          by the will of god to come to you           for i long to see you  that i may impart to you some spiritual gift           to the end that you may be established           that is  that i with you may be encouraged in you  each of us          by the other s faith  both yours and mine           now i don t desire to have you unaware  brothers  that i          often planned to come to you  and was hindered so far           that i might have some fruit among you also  even as among          the rest of the gentiles           i am debtor both to greeks and to foreigners  both to the wise          and to the foolish           so  as much as is in me  i am eager to preach the good news          to you also who are in rome           for i am not ashamed of the good news of christ  for it is          the power of god for salvation for everyone who believes           for the jew first  and also for the greek           for in it is revealed god s righteousness from faith to faith           as it is written   but the righteous shall live          by faith   habakkuk               for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all          ungodliness and unrighteousness of men  who suppress          the truth in unrighteousness           because that which is known of god is revealed in them           for god revealed it to them           for the invisible things of him since the creation of the world          are clearly seen  being perceived through the things          that are made  even his everlasting power and divinity           that they may be without excuse           because  knowing god  they didn t glorify him as god           neither gave thanks  but became vain in their reasoning           and their senseless heart was darkened           professing themselves to be wise  they became fools           and traded the glory of the incorruptible god for the likeness of an          image of corruptible man  and of birds  and four footed animals           and creeping things           therefore god also gave them up in the lusts of their          hearts to uncleanness  that their bodies should be          dishonored among themselves           who exchanged the truth of god for a lie  and worshiped          and served the creature rather than the creator  who is          blessed forever   amen           for this reason  god gave them up to vile passions           for their women changed the natural function into that which          is against nature           likewise also the men  leaving the natural function of the woman           burned in their lust toward one another  men doing what is          inappropriate with men  and receiving in themselves the due          penalty of their error           even as they refused to have god in their knowledge           god gave them up to a reprobate mind  to do those things          which are not fitting           being filled with all unrighteousness  sexual immorality           wickedness  covetousness  maliciousness  full of envy           murder  strife  deceit  evil habits  secret slanderers           backbiters  hateful to god  insolent  haughty  boastful           inventors of evil things  disobedient to parents           without understanding  covenant breakers  without natural          affection  unforgiving  unmerciful           who  knowing the ordinance of god  that those who practice          such things are worthy of death  not only do the same           but also approve of those who practice them           therefore you are without excuse  o man  whoever you are who judge           for in that which you judge another  you condemn yourself           for you who judge practice the same things           we know that the judgment of god is according to truth against          those who practice such things           do you think this  o man who judges those who practice such things           and do the same  that you will escape the judgment of god           or do you despise the riches of his goodness  forbearance           and patience  not knowing that the goodness of god leads          you to repentance           but according to your hardness and unrepentant heart you          are treasuring up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath           revelation  and of the righteous judgment of god           who  will pay back to everyone according to their          works   psalm        proverbs                 to those who by patience in well doing seek for glory  honor           and incorruptibility  eternal life           but to those who are self seeking  and don t obey the truth           but obey unrighteousness  will be wrath and indignation           oppression and anguish  on every soul of man who works evil           to the jew first  and also to the greek           but glory  honor  and peace go to every man who works good           to the jew first  and also to the greek           for there is no partiality with god           for as many as have sinned without law will also perish without          the law   as many as have sinned under the law will be judged          by the law           for it isn t the hearers of the law who are righteous before god           but the doers of the law will be justified           for when gentiles who don t have the law do by nature the things          of the law  these  not having the law  are a law to themselves           in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts           their conscience testifying with them  and their thoughts          among themselves accusing or else excusing them           in the day when god will judge the secrets of men  according to          my good news  by jesus christ           indeed you bear the name of a jew  and rest on the law           and glory in god           and know his will  and approve the things that are excellent           being instructed out of the law           and are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind           a light to those who are in darkness           a corrector of the foolish  a teacher of babies  having in          the law the form of knowledge and of the truth           you therefore who teach another  don t you teach yourself           you who preach that a man shouldn t steal  do you steal           you who say a man shouldn t commit adultery   do you commit adultery           you who abhor idols  do you rob temples           you who glory in the law  through your disobedience of the law          do you dishonor god           for  the name of god is blasphemed among the gentiles because          of you   isaiah       ezekiel        just as it is written           for circumcision indeed profits  if you are a doer of the law           but if you are a transgressor of the law  your circumcision          has become uncircumcision           if therefore the uncircumcised keep the ordinances of the law           won t his uncircumcision be accounted as circumcision           won t the uncircumcision which is by nature  if it fulfills          the law  judge you  who with the letter and circumcision          are a transgressor of the law           for he is not a jew who is one outwardly  neither is that          circumcision which is outward in the flesh           but he is a jew who is one inwardly  and circumcision          is that of the heart  in the spirit not in the letter           whose praise is not from men  but from god           then what advantage does the jew have   or what is the          profit of circumcision           much in every way   because first of all  they were entrusted          with the oracles of god           for what if some were without faith   will their lack of faith          nullify the faithfulness of god           may it never be   yes  let god be found true  but every man a liar           as it is written   that you might be justified in your words           and might prevail when you come into judgment   psalm                but if our unrighteousness commends the righteousness of god           what will we say   is god unrighteous who inflicts wrath           i speak like men do           may it never be   for then how will god judge the world           for if the truth of god through my lie abounded to his glory           why am i also still judged as a sinner           why not  as we are slanderously reported  and as some affirm          that we say    let us do evil  that good may come            those who say so are justly condemned           what then   are we better than they   no  in no way           for we previously charged both jews and greeks  that they          are all under sin           as it is written   there is no one righteous  no  not one           there is no one who understands   there is no one who          seeks after god           they have all turned aside   they have together become unprofitable           there is no one who does good  no  not  so much as          one   psalms                 ecclesiastes                 their throat is an open tomb   with their tongues they          have used deceit   psalm       the poison of vipers is under          their lips   psalm                  whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness   psalm                 their feet are swift to shed blood           destruction and misery are in their ways           the way of peace  they haven t known   isaiah                   there is no fear of god before their eyes   psalm                now we know that whatever things the law says  it speaks to          those who are under the law  that every mouth may be closed           and all the world may be brought under the judgment of god           because by the works of the law  no flesh will be justified          in his sight   for through the law comes the knowledge of sin           but now apart from the law  a righteousness of god has          been revealed  being testified by the law and the prophets           even the righteousness of god through faith in jesus christ          to all and on all those who believe   for there is no distinction           for all have sinned  and fall short of the glory of god           being justified freely by his grace through the redemption          that is in christ jesus           whom god set forth to be an atoning sacrifice or  a propitiation            through faith in his blood  for a demonstration of his          righteousness through the passing over of prior sins           in god s forbearance           to demonstrate his righteousness at this present time           that he might himself be just  and the justifier of him          who has faith in jesus           where then is the boasting   it is excluded   by what manner of law           of works   no  but by a law of faith           we maintain therefore that a man is justified by faith apart          from the works of the law           or is god the god of jews only   isn t he the god of gentiles also           yes  of gentiles also           since indeed there is one god who will justify the circumcised          by faith  and the uncircumcised through faith           do we then nullify the law through faith   may it never be           no  we establish the law           what then will we say that abraham  our forefather  has found          according to the flesh           for if abraham was justified by works  he has something          to boast about  but not toward god           for what does the scripture say    abraham believed god           and it was accounted to him for righteousness   genesis                now to him who works  the reward is not counted as grace           but as debt           but to him who doesn t work  but believes in him who justifies          the ungodly  his faith is accounted for righteousness           even as david also pronounces blessing on the man to whom god          counts righteousness apart from works            blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven           whose sins are covered           blessed is the man whom the lord will by no means charge          with sin   psalm                  is this blessing then pronounced on the circumcised  or on          the uncircumcised also   for we say that faith was accounted          to abraham for righteousness           how then was it counted   when he was in circumcision           or in uncircumcision   not in circumcision  but in uncircumcision           he received the sign of circumcision  a seal of the righteousness          of the faith which he had while he was in uncircumcision           that he might be the father of all those who believe           though they be in uncircumcision  that righteousness might          also be accounted to them           the father of circumcision to those who not only are of          the circumcision  but who also walk in the steps of that faith          of our father abraham  which he had in uncircumcision           for the promise to abraham and to his seed that he should          be heir of the world wasn t through the law  but through          the righteousness of faith           for if those who are of the law are heirs  faith is made void           and the promise is made of no effect           for the law works wrath  for where there is no law           neither is there disobedience           for this cause it is of faith  that it may be according to grace           to the end that the promise may be sure to all the seed           not to that only which is of the law  but to that also which          is of the faith of abraham  who is the father of us all           as it is written   i have made you a father of many nations   genesis                this is in the presence of him whom he believed           god  who gives life to the dead  and calls the things that are not           as though they were           who in hope believed against hope  to the end that he might          become a father of many nations  according to that which had          been spoken   so will your seed be   genesis                without being weakened in faith  he didn t consider his own body           already having been worn out   he being about a hundred          years old   and the deadness of sarah s womb           yet  looking to the promise of god  he didn t waver through unbelief           but grew strong through faith  giving glory to god           and being fully assured that what he had promised  he was able          also to perform           therefore it also was  reckoned to him for righteousness   genesis                         now it was not written that it was accounted to him for          his sake alone           but for our sake also  to whom it will be accounted  who believe          in him who raised jesus  our lord  from the dead           who was delivered up for our trespasses  and was raised          for our justification           being therefore justified by faith  we have peace with god          through our lord jesus christ           through whom we also have our access by faith into this grace          in which we stand   we rejoice in hope of the glory of god           not only this  but we also rejoice in our sufferings           knowing that suffering works perseverance           and perseverance  proven character  and proven character  hope           and hope doesn t disappoint us  because god s love has been          poured out into our hearts through the holy spirit who was          given to us           for while we were yet weak  at the right time christ died          for the ungodly           for one will hardly die for a righteous man   yet perhaps          for a righteous person someone would even dare to die           but god commends his own love toward us  in that while we          were yet sinners  christ died for us           much more then  being now justified by his blood  we will be          saved from god s wrath through him           for if  while we were enemies  we were reconciled to god          through the death of his son  much more  being reconciled           we will be saved by his life           not only so  but we also rejoice in god through our lord jesus christ           through whom we have now received the reconciliation           therefore  as sin entered into the world through one man           and death through sin  and so death passed to all men           because all sinned           for until the law  sin was in the world  but sin is not charged          when there is no law           nevertheless death reigned from adam until moses           even over those whose sins weren t like adam s disobedience           who is a foreshadowing of him who was to come           but the free gift isn t like the trespass   for if by the trespass          of the one the many died  much more did the grace of god           and the gift by the grace of the one man  jesus christ           abound to the many           the gift is not as through one who sinned   for the judgment          came by one to condemnation  but the free gift came of many          trespasses to justification           for if by the trespass of the one  death reigned through the one           so much more will those who receive the abundance of grace          and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through          the one  jesus christ           so then as through one trespass  all men were condemned           even so through one act of righteousness  all men were          justified to life           for as through the one man s disobedience many were made sinners           even so through the obedience of the one  many will          be made righteous           the law came in besides  that the trespass might abound           but where sin abounded  grace abounded more exceedingly           that as sin reigned in death  even so grace might reign through          righteousness to eternal life through jesus christ our lord           what shall we say then   shall we continue in sin           that grace may abound           may it never be   we who died to sin  how could we live          in it any longer           or don t you know that all we who were baptized into christ jesus          were baptized into his death           we were buried therefore with him through baptism to death           that just like christ was raised from the dead through the glory          of the father  so we also might walk in newness of life           for if we have become united with him in the likeness of his death           we will also be part of his resurrection           knowing this  that our old man was crucified with him           that the body of sin might be done away with  so that we          would no longer be in bondage to sin           for he who has died has been freed from sin           but if we died with christ  we believe that we will also          live with him           knowing that christ  being raised from the dead  dies no more           death no more has dominion over him           for the death that he died  he died to sin one time           but the life that he lives  he lives to god           thus consider yourselves also to be dead to sin  but alive          to god in christ jesus our lord           therefore don t let sin reign in your mortal body  that you          should obey it in its lusts           neither present your members to sin as instruments of unrighteousness           but present yourselves to god  as alive from the dead           and your members as instruments of righteousness to god           for sin will not have dominion over you   for you are not under law           but under grace           what then   shall we sin  because we are not under law           but under grace   may it never be           don t you know that to whom you present yourselves as          servants to obedience  his servants you are whom you obey           whether of sin to death  or of obedience to righteousness           but thanks be to god  that  whereas you were bondservants of sin           you became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching          whereunto you were delivered           being made free from sin  you became bondservants of righteousness           i speak in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh           for as you presented your members as servants to uncleanness          and to wickedness upon wickedness  even so now present your          members as servants to righteousness for sanctification           for when you were servants of sin  you were free in          regard to righteousness           what fruit then did you have at that time in the things of which          you are now ashamed   for the end of those things is death           but now  being made free from sin  and having become servants          of god  you have your fruit of sanctification  and the result          of eternal life           for the wages of sin is death  but the free gift of god is          eternal life in christ jesus our lord           or don t you know  brothers the word for  brothers           here and where context allows may also be correctly translated           brothers and sisters  or  siblings     for i speak to men          who know the law   that the law has dominion over a man          for as long as he lives           for the woman that has a husband is bound by law to the husband          while he lives  but if the husband dies  she is discharged          from the law of the husband           so then if  while the husband lives  she is joined to another man           she would be called an adulteress   but if the husband dies           she is free from the law  so that she is no adulteress           though she is joined to another man           therefore  my brothers  you also were made dead to the law          through the body of christ  that you would be joined to another           to him who was raised from the dead  that we might bring          forth fruit to god           for when we were in the flesh  the sinful passions which          were through the law  worked in our members to bring forth          fruit to death           but now we have been discharged from the law  having died          to that in which we were held  so that we serve in newness          of the spirit  and not in oldness of the letter           what shall we say then   is the law sin   may it never be           however  i wouldn t have known sin  except through the law           for i wouldn t have known coveting  unless the law had said            you shall not covet   exodus        deuteronomy                but sin  finding occasion through the commandment           produced in me all kinds of coveting   for apart from the law           sin is dead           i was alive apart from the law once  but when the commandment came           sin revived  and i died           the commandment  which was for life  this i found to be for death           for sin  finding occasion through the commandment  deceived me           and through it killed me           therefore the law indeed is holy  and the commandment holy           and righteous  and good           did then that which is good become death to me   may it never be           but sin  that it might be shown to be sin  by working death          to me through that which is good  that through the commandment          sin might become exceeding sinful           for we know that the law is spiritual  but i am fleshly           sold under sin           for i don t know what i am doing   for i don t practice what i          desire to do  but what i hate  that i do           but if what i don t desire  that i do  i consent to the law          that it is good           so now it is no more i that do it  but sin which dwells in me           for i know that in me  that is  in my flesh  dwells no good thing           for desire is present with me  but i don t find it doing          that which is good           for the good which i desire  i don t do  but the evil which i          don t desire  that i practice           but if what i don t desire  that i do  it is no more i that do it           but sin which dwells in me           i find then the law  that  to me  while i desire to do good           evil is present           for i delight in god s law after the inward man           but i see a different law in my members  warring against the law          of my mind  and bringing me into captivity under the law          of sin which is in my members           what a wretched man i am   who will deliver me out of the body          of this death           i thank god through jesus christ  our lord   so then with the mind           i myself serve god s law  but with the flesh  the sin s law           there is therefore now no condemnation to those who are          in christ jesus  who don t walk according to the flesh           but according to the spirit  nu omits  who don t walk according          to the flesh  but according to the spirit            for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus made me free          from the law of sin and of death           for what the law couldn t do  in that it was weak through the flesh           god did  sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh          and for sin  he condemned sin in the flesh           that the ordinance of the law might be fulfilled in us           who walk not after the flesh  but after the spirit           for those who live according to the flesh set their minds          on the things of the flesh  but those who live according          to the spirit  the things of the spirit           for the mind of the flesh is death  but the mind of the spirit          is life and peace           because the mind of the flesh is hostile towards god           for it is not subject to god s law  neither indeed can it be           those who are in the flesh can t please god           but you are not in the flesh but in the spirit  if it is so          that the spirit of god dwells in you   but if any man doesn t          have the spirit of christ  he is not his           if christ is in you  the body is dead because of sin           but the spirit is alive because of righteousness           but if the spirit of him who raised up jesus from the dead          dwells in you  he who raised up christ jesus from the dead          will also give life to your mortal bodies through his spirit          who dwells in you           so then  brothers  we are debtors  not to the flesh  to live          after the flesh           for if you live after the flesh  you must die  but if by the spirit          you put to death the deeds of the body  you will live           for as many as are led by the spirit of god  these are          children of god           for you didn t receive the spirit of bondage again to fear           but you received the spirit of adoption  by whom we cry            abba abba is an aramaic word for father or daddy  often used          affectionately and respectfully in prayer to our father          in heaven     father            the spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are          children of god           and if children  then heirs  heirs of god  and joint heirs          with christ  if indeed we suffer with him  that we may also be          glorified with him           for i consider that the sufferings of this present time          are not worthy to be compared with the glory which will be          revealed toward us           for the creation waits with eager expectation for the children          of god to be revealed           for the creation was subjected to vanity  not of its own will           but because of him who subjected it  in hope          that the creation itself also will be delivered from the bondage          of decay into the liberty of the glory of the children of god           for we know that the whole creation groans and travails in pain          together until now           not only so  but ourselves also  who have the first fruits          of the spirit  even we ourselves groan within ourselves           waiting for adoption  the redemption of our body           for we were saved in hope  but hope that is seen is not hope           for who hopes for that which he sees           but if we hope for that which we don t see  we wait for          it with patience           in the same way  the spirit also helps our weaknesses  for we          don t know how to pray as we ought   but the spirit himself          makes intercession for us with groanings which can t be uttered           he who searches the hearts knows what is on the spirit s mind           because he makes intercession for the saints according to god           we know that all things work together for good for those who          love god  to those who are called according to his purpose           for whom he foreknew  he also predestined to be conformed          to the image of his son  that he might be the firstborn          among many brothers  the word for  brothers  here and where          context allows may also be correctly translated  brothers          and sisters  or  siblings             whom he predestined  those he also called           whom he called  those he also justified   whom he justified           those he also glorified           what then shall we say about these things   if god is for us           who can be against us           he who didn t spare his own son  but delivered him up for us all           how would he not also with him freely give us all things           who could bring a charge against god s chosen ones           it is god who justifies           who is he who condemns   it is christ who died  yes rather           who was raised from the dead  who is at the right hand of god           who also makes intercession for us           who shall separate us from the love of christ   could oppression           or anguish  or persecution  or famine  or nakedness           or peril  or sword           even as it is written   for your sake we are killed all day long           we were accounted as sheep for the slaughter   psalm                 no  in all these things  we are more than conquerors through          him who loved us           for i am persuaded  that neither death  nor life  nor angels           nor principalities  nor things present  nor things          to come  nor powers           nor height  nor depth  nor any other created thing           will be able to separate us from the love of god  which is          in christ jesus our lord           i tell the truth in christ   i am not lying  my conscience          testifying with me in the holy spirit           that i have great sorrow and unceasing pain in my heart           for i could wish that i myself were accursed from christ          for my brothers  sake  my relatives according to the flesh           who are israelites  whose is the adoption  the glory  the covenants           the giving of the law  the service  and the promises           of whom are the fathers  and from whom is christ as concerning          the flesh  who is over all  god  blessed forever   amen           but it is not as though the word of god has come to nothing           for they are not all israel  that are of israel           neither  because they are abraham s seed  are they all children           but   in isaac will your seed be called   genesis                 that is  it is not the children of the flesh who are children          of god  but the children of the promise are counted as a seed           for this is a word of promise   at the appointed time i will come           and sarah will have a son   genesis                    not only so  but rebecca also conceived by one  by our father isaac           for being not yet born  neither having done anything good or bad           that the purpose of god according to election might stand           not of works  but of him who calls           it was said to her   the elder will serve the younger   genesis                 even as it is written   jacob i loved  but esau i hated   malachi                          what shall we say then   is there unrighteousness          with god   may it never be           for he said to moses   i will have mercy on whom i have mercy           and i will have compassion on whom i have compassion   exodus                 so then it is not of him who wills  nor of him who runs           but of god who has mercy           for the scripture says to pharaoh   for this very purpose i          caused you to be raised up  that i might show in you my power           and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth   exodus                so then  he has mercy on whom he desires  and he hardens          whom he desires           you will say then to me   why does he still find fault           for who withstands his will            but indeed  o man  who are you to reply against god   will the          thing formed ask him who formed it   why did you make me          like this   isaiah                       or hasn t the potter a right over the clay  from the same lump          to make one part a vessel for honor  and another for dishonor           what if god  willing to show his wrath  and to make his          power known  endured with much patience vessels of wrath          made for destruction           and that he might make known the riches of his glory on vessels          of mercy  which he prepared beforehand for glory           us  whom he also called  not from the jews only  but also          from the gentiles           as he says also in hosea   i will call them  my people            which were not my people  and her  beloved   who was          not beloved   hosea                 it will be that in the place where it was said to them            you are not my people   there they will be called  children          of the living god    hosea                isaiah cries concerning israel   if the number of the children          of israel are as the sand of the sea  it is the remnant          who will be saved           for he will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness           because the lord will make a short work upon the earth   isaiah                             as isaiah has said before   unless the lord of armies greek  sabaoth           for hebrew   tze va ot   had left us a seed  we would have become          like sodom  and would have been made like gomorrah   isaiah               what shall we say then   that the gentiles  who didn t          follow after righteousness  attained to righteousness           even the righteousness which is of faith           but israel  following after a law of righteousness  didn t arrive          at the law of righteousness           why   because they didn t seek it by faith  but as it were          by works of the law   they stumbled over the stumbling stone           even as it is written   behold  i lay in zion a stumbling          stone and a rock of offense  and no one who believes in him          will be disappointed   isaiah                       brothers  my heart s desire and my prayer to god is for israel           that they may be saved           for i testify about them that they have a zeal for god           but not according to knowledge           for being ignorant of god s righteousness  and seeking          to establish their own righteousness  they didn t subject          themselves to the righteousness of god           for christ is the fulfillment or  completion  or end  of the law          for righteousness to everyone who believes           for moses writes about the righteousness of the law   the one          who does them will live by them   leviticus                but the righteousness which is of faith says this   don t say          in your heart   who will ascend into heaven   deuteronomy                  that is  to bring christ down            or   who will descend into the abyss   deuteronomy                  that is  to bring christ up from the dead             but what does it say    the word is near you  in your mouth           and in your heart   deuteronomy        that is  the word of faith           which we preach           that if you will confess with your mouth that jesus is lord           and believe in your heart that god raised him from the dead           you will be saved           for with the heart  one believes unto righteousness           and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation           for the scripture says   whoever believes in him will not          be disappointed   isaiah                 for there is no distinction between jew and greek  for the same          lord is lord of all  and is rich to all who call on him           for   whoever will call on the name of the lord will          be saved   joel                how then will they call on him in whom they have not believed           how will they believe in him whom they have not heard           how will they hear without a preacher           and how will they preach unless they are sent   as it is written            how beautiful are the feet of those who preach the good news          of peace  who bring glad tidings of good things   isaiah                but they didn t all listen to the glad news   for isaiah says            lord  who has believed our report   isaiah                so faith comes by hearing  and hearing by the word of god           but i say  didn t they hear   yes  most certainly   their sound          went out into all the earth  their words to the ends of          the world   psalm                but i ask  didn t israel know   first moses says   i will provoke          you to jealousy with that which is no nation  with a nation          void of understanding i will make you angry   deuteronomy                 isaiah is very bold  and says   i was found by those who          didn t seek me   i was revealed to those who didn t ask          for me   isaiah                but as to israel he says   all day long i stretched out my hands          to a disobedient and contrary people   isaiah                i ask then  did god reject his people   may it never be           for i also am an israelite  a descendant of abraham           of the tribe of benjamin           god didn t reject his people  which he foreknew   or don t you          know what the scripture says about elijah   how he pleads          with god against israel            lord  they have killed your prophets  they have broken          down your altars  and i am left alone  and they seek my          life     kings                    but how does god answer him    i have reserved for myself seven          thousand men  who have not bowed the knee to baal     kings                 even so then at this present time also there is a remnant          according to the election of grace           and if by grace  then it is no longer of works  otherwise grace          is no longer grace   but if it is of works  it is no longer grace           otherwise work is no longer work           what then   that which israel seeks for  that he didn t obtain           but the chosen ones obtained it  and the rest were hardened           according as it is written   god gave them a spirit of stupor           eyes that they should not see  and ears that they should not hear           to this very day   deuteronomy       isaiah                 david says   let their table be made a snare  and a trap           a stumbling block  and a retribution to them           let their eyes be darkened  that they may not see           bow down their back always   psalm                    i ask then  did they stumble that they might fall   may it never be           but by their fall salvation has come to the gentiles           to provoke them to jealousy           now if their fall is the riches of the world  and their loss          the riches of the gentiles  how much more their fullness           for i speak to you who are gentiles   since then as i am          an apostle to gentiles  i glorify my ministry           if by any means i may provoke to jealousy those who are my flesh           and may save some of them           for if the rejection of them is the reconciling of the world           what would their acceptance be  but life from the dead           if the first fruit is holy  so is the lump   if the root is holy           so are the branches           but if some of the branches were broken off  and you  being a          wild olive  were grafted in among them  and became partaker          with them of the root and of the richness of the olive tree           don t boast over the branches   but if you boast  it is not you          who support the root  but the root supports you           you will say then   branches were broken off  that i might          be grafted in            true  by their unbelief they were broken off  and you stand          by your faith   don t be conceited  but fear           for if god didn t spare the natural branches  neither will          he spare you           see then the goodness and severity of god   toward those          who fell  severity  but toward you  goodness  if you continue          in his goodness  otherwise you also will be cut off           they also  if they don t continue in their unbelief  will be          grafted in  for god is able to graft them in again           for if you were cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree           and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree           how much more will these  which are the natural branches           be grafted into their own olive tree           for i don t desire you to be ignorant  brothers  the word          for  brothers  here and where context allows may also be          correctly translated  brothers and sisters  or  siblings             of this mystery  so that you won t be wise in your own conceits           that a partial hardening has happened to israel  until the          fullness of the gentiles has come in           and so all israel will be saved   even as it is written            there will come out of zion the deliverer  and he will turn          away ungodliness from jacob           this is my covenant to them  when i will take away their          sins   isaiah                 jeremiah                    concerning the good news  they are enemies for your sake           but concerning the election  they are beloved for the fathers  sake           for the gifts and the calling of god are irrevocable           for as you in time past were disobedient to god  but now have          obtained mercy by their disobedience           even so these also have now been disobedient  that by the mercy          shown to you they may also obtain mercy           for god has shut up all to disobedience  that he might have          mercy on all           oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge          of god   how unsearchable are his judgments  and his ways          past tracing out            for who has known the mind of the lord   or who has been          his counselor   isaiah                  or who has first given to him  and it will be repaid to          him again   job                 for of him  and through him  and to him  are all things           to him be the glory for ever   amen           therefore i urge you  brothers  by the mercies of god  to present          your bodies a living sacrifice  holy  acceptable to god           which is your spiritual service           don t be conformed to this world  but be transformed by          the renewing of your mind  so that you may prove what is          the good  well pleasing  and perfect will of god           for i say  through the grace that was given me  to every          man who is among you  not to think of himself more highly          than he ought to think  but to think reasonably  as god has          apportioned to each person a measure of faith           for even as we have many members in one body  and all the members          don t have the same function           so we  who are many  are one body in christ  and individually          members one of another           having gifts differing according to the grace that was given to us           if prophecy  let us prophesy according to the proportion          of our faith           or service  let us give ourselves to service  or he who teaches           to his teaching           or he who exhorts  to his exhorting   he who gives           let him do it with liberality  he who rules  with diligence           he who shows mercy  with cheerfulness           let love be without hypocrisy   abhor that which is evil           cling to that which is good           in love of the brothers be tenderly affectionate one to another           in honor preferring one another           not lagging in diligence  fervent in spirit  serving the lord           rejoicing in hope  enduring in troubles  continuing steadfastly          in prayer           contributing to the needs of the saints  given to hospitality           bless those who persecute you  bless  and don t curse           rejoice with those who rejoice   weep with those who weep           be of the same mind one toward another   don t set your          mind on high things  but associate with the humble           don t be wise in your own conceits           repay no one evil for evil   respect what is honorable          in the sight of all men           if it is possible  as much as it is up to you  be at peace          with all men           don t seek revenge yourselves  beloved  but give place to          god s wrath   for it is written   vengeance belongs to me           i will repay  says the lord   deuteronomy                 therefore  if your enemy is hungry  feed him   if he is thirsty           give him a drink  for in doing so  you will heap coals of fire          on his head   proverbs                    don t be overcome by evil  but overcome evil with good           let every soul be in subjection to the higher authorities           for there is no authority except from god  and those who exist          are ordained by god           therefore he who resists the authority  withstands the ordinance          of god  and those who withstand will receive to themselves judgment           for rulers are not a terror to the good work  but to the evil           do you desire to have no fear of the authority           do that which is good  and you will have praise from the same           for he is a servant of god to you for good   but if you do that          which is evil  be afraid  for he doesn t bear the sword in vain           for he is a servant of god  an avenger for wrath to him          who does evil           therefore you need to be in subjection  not only because of          the wrath  but also for conscience  sake           for this reason you also pay taxes  for they are servants          of god s service  attending continually on this very thing           give therefore to everyone what you owe   taxes to whom taxes          are due  customs to whom customs  respect to whom respect           honor to whom honor           owe no one anything  except to love one another  for he who loves          his neighbor has fulfilled the law           for the commandments   you shall not commit adultery             you shall not murder    you shall not steal    you shall          not give false testimony    you shall not covet   tr adds           you shall not give false testimony    exodus                       deuteronomy             and whatever other commandments there are           are all summed up in this saying  namely   you shall love          your neighbor as yourself   leviticus                 love doesn t harm a neighbor   love therefore is the fulfillment          of the law           do this  knowing the time  that it is already time for you          to awaken out of sleep  for salvation is now nearer to us          than when we first believed           the night is far gone  and the day is near   let s therefore throw          off the works of darkness  and let s put on the armor of light           let us walk properly  as in the day  not in reveling          and drunkenness  not in sexual promiscuity and lustful acts           and not in strife and jealousy           but put on the lord jesus christ  and make no provision          for the flesh  for its lusts           now accept one who is weak in faith  but not for disputes          over opinions           one man has faith to eat all things  but he who is weak          eats only vegetables           don t let him who eats despise him who doesn t eat           don t let him who doesn t eat judge him who eats  for god          has accepted him           who are you who judge another s servant   to his own lord          he stands or falls   yes  he will be made to stand  for god          has power to make him stand           one man esteems one day as more important   another esteems every          day alike   let each man be fully assured in his own mind           he who observes the day  observes it to the lord  and he who does          not observe the day  to the lord he does not observe it           he who eats  eats to the lord  for he gives god thanks           he who doesn t eat  to the lord he doesn t eat           and gives god thanks           for none of us lives to himself  and none dies to himself           for if we live  we live to the lord   or if we die  we die          to the lord   if therefore we live or die  we are the lord s           for to this end christ died  rose  and lived again           that he might be lord of both the dead and the living           but you  why do you judge your brother   or you again           why do you despise your brother   for we will all stand          before the judgment seat of christ           for it is written    as i live   says the lord   to me every knee          will bow   every tongue will confess to god    isaiah                 so then each one of us will give account of himself to god           therefore let s not judge one another any more  but judge this rather           that no man put a stumbling block in his brother s way           or an occasion for falling           i know  and am persuaded in the lord jesus  that nothing is          unclean of itself  except that to him who considers anything          to be unclean  to him it is unclean           yet if because of food your brother is grieved  you walk          no longer in love   don t destroy with your food him for          whom christ died           then don t let your good be slandered           for the kingdom of god is not eating and drinking           but righteousness  peace  and joy in the holy spirit           for he who serves christ in these things is acceptable to god          and approved by men           so then  let us follow after things which make for peace           and things by which we may build one another up           don t overthrow god s work for food s sake   all things indeed          are clean  however it is evil for that man who creates          a stumbling block by eating           it is good to not eat meat  drink wine  nor do anything          by which your brother stumbles  is offended  or is made weak           do you have faith   have it to yourself before god           happy is he who doesn t judge himself in that which he approves           but he who doubts is condemned if he eats  because it          isn t of faith  and whatever is not of faith is sin                   now to him who is able to establish you according          to my good news and the preaching of jesus christ           according to the revelation of the mystery which has been          kept secret through long ages          but now is revealed           and by the scriptures of the prophets  according to the          commandment of the eternal god  is made known for obedience          of faith to all the nations          to the only wise god           through jesus christ  to whom be the glory forever           amen  tr places verses       after romans       as verses                  now we who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of the weak           and not to please ourselves           let each one of us please his neighbor for that which is good           to be building him up           for even christ didn t please himself   but  as it is written            the reproaches of those who reproached you fell on me   psalm                for whatever things were written before were written for          our learning  that through patience and through encouragement          of the scriptures we might have hope           now the god of patience and of encouragement grant you to be          of the same mind one with another according to christ jesus           that with one accord you may with one mouth glorify the god          and father of our lord jesus christ           therefore accept one another  even as christ also accepted          you  tr reads  us  instead of  you   to the glory of god           now i say that christ has been made a servant of the circumcision          for the truth of god  that he might confirm the promises          given to the fathers           and that the gentiles might glorify god for his mercy           as it is written   therefore will i give praise to you among          the gentiles  and sing to your name     samuel        psalm                 again he says   rejoice  you gentiles  with his people   deuteronomy                          again   praise the lord  all you gentiles   let all the peoples          praise him   psalm                 again  isaiah says   there will be the root of jesse           he who arises to rule over the gentiles  in him the gentiles          will hope   isaiah                 now may the god of hope fill you with all joy and peace          in believing  that you may abound in hope  in the power          of the holy spirit           i myself am also persuaded about you  my brothers the word          for  brothers  here and where context allows may also be correctly          translated  brothers and sisters  or  siblings     that you          yourselves are full of goodness  filled with all knowledge           able also to admonish others           but i write the more boldly to you in part  as reminding you           because of the grace that was given to me by god           that i should be a servant of christ jesus to the gentiles           serving as a priest the good news of god  that the offering          up of the gentiles might be made acceptable  sanctified by          the holy spirit           i have therefore my boasting in christ jesus in things          pertaining to god           for i will not dare to speak of any things except those which          christ worked through me  for the obedience of the gentiles           by word and deed           in the power of signs and wonders  in the power of god s spirit           so that from jerusalem  and around as far as to illyricum  i have          fully preached the good news of christ           yes  making it my aim to preach the good news  not where christ          was already named  that i might not build on another s foundation           but  as it is written   they will see  to whom no news of him came           they who haven t heard will understand   isaiah                 therefore also i was hindered these many times from coming to you           but now  no longer having any place in these regions           and having these many years a longing to come to you           whenever i journey to spain  i will come to you           for i hope to see you on my journey  and to be helped on my way          there by you  if first i may enjoy your company for a while           but now  i say  i am going to jerusalem  serving the saints           for it has been the good pleasure of macedonia and achaia          to make a certain contribution for the poor among the saints          who are at jerusalem           yes  it has been their good pleasure  and they are their debtors           for if the gentiles have been made partakers of their          spiritual things  they owe it to them also to serve them          in fleshly things           when therefore i have accomplished this  and have sealed          to them this fruit  i will go on by way of you to spain           i know that  when i come to you  i will come in the fullness          of the blessing of the good news of christ           now i beg you  brothers  by our lord jesus christ  and by          the love of the spirit  that you strive together with me          in your prayers to god for me           that i may be delivered from those who are disobedient in judea           and that my service which i have for jerusalem may be acceptable          to the saints           that i may come to you in joy through the will of god           and together with you  find rest           now the god of peace be with you all   amen           i commend to you phoebe  our sister  who is a servant or           deacon  of the assembly that is at cenchreae           that you receive her in the lord  in a way worthy of the saints           and that you assist her in

  for god can t be tempted by evil  and he himself tempts no one           but each one is tempted  when he is drawn away by his          own lust  and enticed           then the lust  when it has conceived  bears sin  and the sin           when it is full grown  brings forth death           don t be deceived  my beloved brothers           every good gift and every perfect gift is from above  coming down          from the father of lights  with whom can be no variation           nor turning shadow           of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth           that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures           so  then  my beloved brothers  let every man be swift to hear           slow to speak  and slow to anger           for the anger of man doesn t produce the righteousness of god           therefore  putting away all filthiness and overflowing          of wickedness  receive with humility the implanted word           which is able to save your souls or  preserve your life             but be doers of the word  and not only hearers  deluding          your own selves           for if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer           he is like a man looking at his natural face in a mirror           for he sees himself  and goes away  and immediately forgets          what kind of man he was           but he who looks into the perfect law of freedom  and continues           not being a hearer who forgets  but a doer of the work           this man will be blessed in what he does           if anyone among you thinks himself to be religious while          he doesn t bridle his tongue  but deceives his heart           this man s religion is worthless           pure religion and undefiled before our god and father is this           to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction           and to keep oneself unstained by the world           my brothers  don t hold the faith of our lord jesus christ          of glory with partiality           for if a man with a gold ring  in fine clothing  comes into          your synagogue or  meeting   and a poor man in filthy clothing          also comes in           and you pay special attention to him who wears the fine clothing           and say   sit here in a good place   and you tell the poor man            stand there   or  sit by my footstool            haven t you shown partiality among yourselves  and become          judges with evil thoughts           listen  my beloved brothers   didn t god choose those who are poor          in this world to be rich in faith  and heirs of the kingdom          which he promised to those who love him           but you have dishonored the poor man   don t the rich oppress you           and personally drag you before the courts           don t they blaspheme the honorable name by which you are called           however  if you fulfill the royal law  according to          the scripture   you shall love your neighbor as yourself   leviticus                 you do well           but if you show partiality  you commit sin  being convicted          by the law as transgressors           for whoever keeps the whole law  and yet stumbles in one point           he has become guilty of all           for he who said   do not commit adultery   exodus                 deuteronomy       also said   do not commit murder   exodus                 deuteronomy       now if you do not commit adultery  but murder           you have become a transgressor of the law           so speak  and so do  as men who are to be judged by a          law of freedom           for judgment is without mercy to him who has shown no mercy           mercy triumphs over judgment           what good is it  my brothers  if a man says he has faith           but has no works   can faith save him           and if a brother or sister is naked and in lack of daily food           and one of you tells them   go in peace  be warmed and filled            and yet you didn t give them the things the body needs           what good is it           even so faith  if it has no works  is dead in itself           yes  a man will say   you have faith  and i have works            show me your faith without works  and i by my works will show          you my faith           you believe that god is one   you do well   the demons          also believe  and shudder           but do you want to know  vain man  that faith apart from          works is dead           wasn t abraham our father justified by works  in that he offered          up isaac his son on the altar           you see that faith worked with his works  and by works          faith was perfected           and the scripture was fulfilled which says   abraham believed god           and it was accounted to him as righteousness   genesis                 and he was called the friend of god           you see then that by works  a man is justified  and not          only by faith           in like manner wasn t rahab the prostitute also justified          by works  in that she received the messengers  and sent them          out another way           for as the body apart from the spirit is dead  even so faith          apart from works is dead           let not many of you be teachers  my brothers  knowing that we          will receive heavier judgment           for in many things we all stumble   if anyone doesn t          stumble in word  the same is a perfect man  able to bridle          the whole body also           indeed  we put bits into the horses  mouths so that they may          obey us  and we guide their whole body           behold  the ships also  though they are so big and are driven          by fierce winds  are yet guided by a very small rudder           wherever the pilot desires           so the tongue is also a little member  and boasts great things           see how a small fire can spread to a large forest           and the tongue is a fire   the world of iniquity among          our members is the tongue  which defiles the whole body           and sets on fire the course of nature  and is set on fire          by gehenna  or  hell           for every kind of animal  bird  creeping thing  and thing          in the sea  is tamed  and has been tamed by mankind           but nobody can tame the tongue   it is a restless evil           full of deadly poison           with it we bless our god and father  and with it we curse men           who are made in the image of god           out of the same mouth comes forth blessing and cursing           my brothers  these things ought not to be so           does a spring send out from the same opening fresh and bitter water           can a fig tree  my brothers  yield olives  or a vine figs           thus no spring yields both salt water and fresh water           who is wise and understanding among you   let him show by his          good conduct that his deeds are done in gentleness of wisdom           but if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart           don t boast and don t lie against the truth           this wisdom is not that which comes down from above           but is earthly  sensual  and demonic           for where jealousy and selfish ambition are  there is confusion          and every evil deed           but the wisdom that is from above is first pure  then peaceful           gentle  reasonable  full of mercy and good fruits           without partiality  and without hypocrisy           now the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those          who make peace           where do wars and fightings among you come from           don t they come from your pleasures that war in your members           you lust  and don t have   you kill  covet  and can t obtain           you fight and make war   you don t have  because you don t ask           you ask  and don t receive  because you ask with wrong motives           so that you may spend it for your pleasures           you adulterers and adulteresses  don t you know that friendship          with the world is enmity with god   whoever therefore wants          to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of god           or do you think that the scripture says in vain   the spirit          who lives in us yearns jealously            but he gives more grace   therefore it says   god resists          the proud  but gives grace to the humble   proverbs                be subject therefore to god   but resist the devil  and he will          flee from you           draw near to god  and he will draw near to you   cleanse your hands           you sinners  and purify your hearts  you double minded           lament  mourn  and weep   let your laughter be turned to mourning           and your joy to gloom           humble yourselves in the sight of the lord  and he will exalt you           don t speak against one another  brothers   he who speaks          against a brother and judges his brother  speaks against          the law and judges the law   but if you judge the law           you are not a doer of the law  but a judge           only one is the lawgiver  who is able to save and to destroy           but who are you to judge another           come now  you who say   today or tomorrow let s go into this city           and spend a year there  trade  and make a profit            whereas you don t know what your life will be like tomorrow           for what is your life   for you are a vapor  that appears          for a little time  and then vanishes away           for you ought to say   if the lord wills  we will both live           and do this or that            but now you glory in your boasting   all such boasting is evil           to him therefore who knows to do good  and doesn t do it           to him it is sin           come now  you rich  weep and howl for your miseries that are          coming on you           your riches are corrupted and your garments are moth eaten           your gold and your silver are corroded  and their corrosion will be          for a testimony against you  and will eat your flesh like fire           you have laid up your treasure in the last days           behold  the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields           which you have kept back by fraud  cry out  and the cries          of those who reaped have entered into the ears of the lord          of armies greek  sabaoth  for hebrew   tze va ot             you have lived delicately on the earth  and taken your pleasure           you have nourished your hearts as in a day of slaughter           you have condemned  you have murdered the righteous one           he doesn t resist you           be patient therefore  brothers  until the coming of the lord           behold  the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth           being patient over it  until it receives the early and late rain           you also be patient   establish your hearts  for the coming          of the lord is at hand           don t grumble  brothers  against one another  so that you          won t be judged   behold  the judge stands at the door           take  brothers  for an example of suffering and of patience           the prophets who spoke in the name of the lord           behold  we call them blessed who endured   you have heard          of the patience of job  and have seen the lord in the outcome           and how the lord is full of compassion and mercy           but above all things  my brothers  don t swear  neither by heaven           nor by the earth  nor by any other oath  but let your  yes           be  yes   and your  no    no   so that you don t fall into          hypocrisy  tr reads  under judgment

assembly           and let them pray over him  anointing him with oil in the name          of the lord           and the prayer of faith will heal him who is sick           and the lord will raise him up   if he has committed sins           he will be forgiven           confess your offenses to one another  and pray for one another           that you may be healed   the insistent prayer of a righteous          person is powerfully effective           elijah was a man with a nature like ours  and he prayed earnestly          that it might not rain  and it didn t rain on the earth          for three years and six months           he prayed again  and the sky gave rain  and the earth brought          forth its fruit           brothers  if any among you wanders from the truth  and someone          turns him back           let him know that he who turns a sinner from the error of his way          will save a soul from death  and will cover a multitude of sins                    about

robe reaching down to his feet           and with a golden sash around his chest           his head and his hair were white as white wool  like snow           his eyes were like a flame of fire           his feet were like burnished brass  as if it had been refined          in a furnace   his voice was like the voice of many waters           he had seven stars in his right hand   out of his mouth

on his throne           he who has an ear  let him hear what the spirit says          to the assemblies            after these things i looked and saw a door opened in heaven           and the first voice that i heard  like a trumpet speaking          with me  was one saying   come up here  and i will show you          the things which must happen after this            immediately i was in the spirit   behold  there was a throne          set in heaven  and one sitting on the throne          that looked like a jasper stone and a sardius   there was          a rainbow around the throne  like an emerald to look at           around the throne were twenty four thrones   on the thrones          were twenty four elders sitting  dressed in white garments           with crowns of gold on their heads           out of the throne proceed lightnings  sounds  and thunders           there were seven lamps of fire burning before his throne           which are the seven spirits of god           before the throne was something like a sea of glass  similar          to crystal   in the midst of the throne  and around the throne          were four living creatures full of eyes before and behind           the first creature was like a lion  and the second creature          like a calf  and the third creature had a face like a man           and the fourth was like a flying eagle           the four living creatures  each one of them having six wings           are full of eyes around about and within   they have no rest day          and night  saying   holy  holy  holy hodges farstad mt reads  holy             times instead of     is the lord god  the almighty           who was and who is and who is to come            when the living creatures give glory  honor  and thanks to him          who sits on the throne  to him who lives forever and ever           the twenty four elders fall down before him who sits on          the throne  and worship him who lives forever and ever           and throw their crowns before the throne  saying            worthy are you  our lord and god  the holy one  tr omits           and god  the holy one    to receive the glory  the honor           and the power  for you created all things  and because of your          desire they existed  and were created            i saw  in the right hand of him who sat on the throne  a book          written inside and outside  sealed shut with seven seals           i saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice   who is          worthy to open the book  and to break its seals            no one in heaven above  or on the earth  or under the earth           was able to open the book  or to look in it           and i wept much  because no one was found worthy to open the book           or to look in it           one of the elders said to me   don t weep   behold  the lion          who is of the tribe of judah  the root of david  has overcome           he who opens the book and its seven seals            i saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures           and in the midst of the elders  a lamb standing  as though          it had been slain  having seven horns  and seven eyes           which are the seven spirits of god  sent out into all the earth           then he came  and he took it out of the right hand of him          who sat on the throne           now when he had taken the book  the four living creatures          and the twenty four elders fell down before the lamb           each one having a harp  and golden bowls full of incense           which are the prayers of the saints           they sang a new song  saying   you are worthy to take the book           and to open its seals   for you were killed  and bought us for god          with your blood  out of every tribe  language  people  and nation           and made us kings and priests to our god  and we will          reign on earth            i saw  and i heard something like a voice of many angels          around the throne  the living creatures  and the elders           and the number of them was ten thousands of ten thousands           and thousands of thousands           saying with a loud voice   worthy is the lamb who has been          killed to receive the power  wealth  wisdom  strength  honor           glory  and blessing            i heard every created thing which is in heaven  on the earth           under the earth  on the sea  and everything in them  saying            to him who sits on the throne  and to the lamb be the blessing           the honor  the glory  and the dominion  forever and ever           amen  tr omits  amen              the four living creatures said   amen    the  tr adds           twenty four  elders fell down and worshiped  tr adds  the          one living forever and ever            i saw that the lamb opened one of the seven seals  and i heard          one of the four living creatures saying  as with a voice          of thunder   come and see            and behold  a white horse  and he who sat on it had a bow           a crown was given to him  and he came forth conquering           and to conquer           when he opened the second seal  i heard the second living          creature saying   come            another came forth  a red horse   to him who sat on it was given          power to take peace from the earth  and that they should kill          one another   there was given to him a great sword           when he opened the third seal  i heard the third living          creature saying   come and see    and behold  a black horse           and he who sat on it had a balance in his hand           i heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying            a choenix a choenix is a dry volume measure that is a little          more than a litre  a little more than a quart    of wheat          for a denarius  and three choenix of barley for a denarius           don t damage the oil and the wine            when he opened the fourth seal  i heard the fourth living          creature saying   come and see            and behold  a pale horse  and he who sat on it           his name was death   hades or  hell  followed with him           authority over one fourth of the earth  to kill with the sword           with famine  with death  and by the wild animals of the earth          was given to him           when he opened the fifth seal  i saw underneath the altar          the souls of those who had been killed for the word of god           and for the testimony of the lamb which they had           they cried with a loud voice  saying   how long  master  the holy          and true  until you judge and avenge our blood on those who          dwell on the earth            a long white robe was given to each of them   they were told          that they should rest yet for a while  until their fellow servants          and their brothers  the word for  brothers  here and where context          allows may also be correctly translated  brothers and sisters           or  siblings    who would also be killed even as they were           should complete their course           i saw when he opened the sixth seal  and there was a          great earthquake   the sun became black as sackcloth made          of hair  and the whole moon became as blood           the stars of the sky fell to the earth  like a fig tree dropping          its unripe figs when it is shaken by a great wind           the sky was removed like a scroll when it is rolled up           every mountain and island were moved out of their places           the kings of the earth  the princes  the commanding officers           the rich  the strong  and every slave and free person           hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains           they told the mountains and the rocks   fall on us           and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne           and from the wrath of the lamb           for the great day of his wrath has come  and who is able to stand            after this  i saw four angels standing at the four corners          of the earth  holding the four winds of the earth           so that no wind would blow on the earth  or on the sea           or on any tree           i saw another angel ascend from the sunrise  having the seal          of the living god   he cried with a loud voice to the four          angels to whom it was given to harm the earth and the sea           saying   don t harm the earth  neither the sea  nor the trees           until we have sealed the bondservants of our god          on their foreheads            i heard the number of those who were sealed  one hundred          forty four thousand  sealed out of every tribe of the          children of israel           of the tribe of judah were sealed twelve thousand  of the tribe          of reuben twelve thousand  of the tribe of gad twelve thousand           of the tribe of asher twelve thousand  of the tribe of naphtali          twelve thousand  of the tribe of manasseh twelve thousand           of the tribe of simeon twelve thousand  of the tribe of levi          twelve thousand  of the tribe of issachar twelve thousand           of the tribe of zebulun twelve thousand  of the tribe          of joseph twelve thousand  of the tribe of benjamin were          sealed twelve thousand           after these things i looked  and behold  a great multitude           which no man could number  out of every nation and of          all tribes  peoples  and languages  standing before the throne          and before the lamb  dressed in white robes  with palm branches          in their hands           they cried with a loud voice  saying   salvation be to our god           who sits on the throne  and to the lamb            all the angels were standing around the throne  the elders           and the four living creatures  and they fell on their faces          before his throne  and worshiped god           saying   amen   blessing  glory  wisdom  thanksgiving  honor  power           and might  be to our god forever and ever   amen            one of the elders answered  saying to me   these who are arrayed          in white robes  who are they  and from where did they come            i told him   my lord  you know    he said to me            these are those who came out of the great tribulation           they washed their robes  and made them white in the lamb s blood           therefore they are before the throne of god  they serve him          day and night in his temple   he who sits on the throne          will spread his tent over them           they will never be hungry  neither thirsty any more           neither will the sun beat on them  nor any heat           for the lamb who is in the midst of the throne shepherds them           and leads them to springs of waters of life   and god will          wipe away every tear from their eyes            when he opened the seventh seal  there was silence in heaven          for about half an hour           i saw the seven angels who stand before god  and seven trumpets          were given to them           another angel came and stood over the altar  having a golden censer           much incense was given to him  that he should add it to          the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar which was          before the throne           the smoke of the incense  with the prayers of the saints           went up before god out of the angel s hand           the angel took the censer  and he filled it with the fire of          the altar  and threw it on the earth   there followed thunders           sounds  lightnings  and an earthquake           the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared          themselves to sound           the first sounded  and there followed hail and fire           mixed with blood  and they were thrown to the earth           one third of the earth was burnt up  tr omits  one third          of the earth was burnt up   and one third of the trees were          burnt up  and all green grass was burnt up           the second angel sounded  and something like a great burning mountain          was thrown into the sea   one third of the sea became blood           and one third of the living creatures which were in the sea died           one third of the ships were destroyed           the third angel sounded  and a great star fell from the sky           burning like a torch  and it fell on one third of the rivers           and on the springs of the waters           the name of the star is called  wormwood   one third of the          waters became wormwood   many people died from the waters           because they were made bitter           the fourth angel sounded  and one third of the sun was struck           and one third of the moon  and one third of the stars           so that one third of them would be darkened  and the day wouldn t          shine for one third of it  and the night in the same way           i saw  and i heard an eagle  tr reads  angel           instead of  eagle   flying in mid heaven  saying with a          loud voice   woe   woe   woe for those who dwell on the earth           because of the other voices of the trumpets of the three angels           who are yet to sound            the fifth angel sounded  and i saw a star from the sky which          had fallen to the earth   the key to the pit of the abyss          was given to him           he opened the pit of the abyss  and smoke went up out of the pit           like the smoke from a tr adds  great   burning furnace           the sun and the air were darkened because of the smoke          from the pit           then out of the smoke came forth locusts on the earth  and power          was given to them  as the scorpions of the earth have power           they were told that they should not hurt the grass of the earth           neither any green thing  neither any tree  but only those people          who don t have god s seal on their foreheads           they were given power not to kill them  but to torment them for          five months   their torment was like the torment of a scorpion           when it strikes a person           in those days people will seek death  and will in no way find it           they will desire to die  and death will flee from them           the shapes of the locusts were like horses prepared for war           on their heads were something like golden crowns  and their          faces were like people s faces           they had hair like women s hair  and their teeth were like          those of lions           they had breastplates  like breastplates of iron           the sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots           or of many horses rushing to war           they have tails like those of scorpions  and stings           in their tails they have power to harm men for five months           they have over them as king the angel of the abyss           his name in hebrew is  abaddon    abaddon  is a hebrew word that          means ruin  destruction  or the place of destruction  but in greek           he has the name  apollyon    apollyon  means  destroyer             the first woe is past   behold  there are still two woes          coming after this           the sixth angel sounded   i heard a voice from the horns          of the golden altar which is before god           saying to the sixth angel who had one trumpet   free the four          angels who are bound at the great river euphrates            the four angels were freed who had been prepared for that hour          and day and month and year  so that they might kill one          third of mankind           the number of the armies of the horsemen was two hundred          million literally   ten thousands of ten thousands    i heard          the number of them           thus i saw the horses in the vision  and those who sat on them           having breastplates of fiery red  hyacinth blue  and sulfur yellow           and the heads of lions   out of their mouths proceed fire           smoke  and sulfur           by these three plagues were one third of mankind killed           by the fire  the smoke  and the sulfur  which proceeded out          of their mouths           for the power of the horses is in their mouths  and in their tails           for their tails are like serpents  and have heads  and with          them they harm           the rest of mankind  who were not killed with these plagues           didn t repent of the works of their hands  that they wouldn t          worship demons  and the idols of gold  and of silver           and of brass  and of stone  and of wood  which can neither see           nor hear  nor walk           they didn t repent of their murders  nor of their sorceries  the          word for  sorceries   pharmakeia  also implies the use          of potions  poisons  and drugs  nor of their sexual immorality           nor of their thefts           i saw a mighty angel coming down out of the sky  clothed with          a cloud   a rainbow was on his head   his face was like the sun           and his feet like pillars of fire           he had in his hand a little open book   he set his right foot          on the sea  and his left on the land           he cried with a loud voice  as a lion roars   when he cried           the seven thunders uttered their voices           when the seven thunders sounded  i was about to write           but i heard a voice from the sky saying   seal up the things          which the seven thunders said  and don t write them            the angel who i saw standing on the sea and on the land lifted          up his right hand to the sky           and swore by him who lives forever and ever  who created heaven          and the things that are in it  the earth and the things          that are in it  and the sea and the things that are in it           that there will no longer be delay           but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel  when he is          about to sound  then the mystery of god is finished           as he declared to his servants  the prophets           the voice which i heard from heaven  again speaking with me           said   go  take the book which is open in the hand of the angel          who stands on the sea and on the land            i went to the angel  telling him to give me the little book           he said to me   take it  and eat it up   it will make your          stomach bitter  but in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey            i took the little book out of the angel s hand  and ate it up           it was as sweet as honey in my mouth   when i had eaten it           my stomach was made bitter           they told me   you must prophesy again over many peoples           nations  languages  and kings            a reed like a rod was given to me   someone said   rise  and measure          god s temple  and the altar  and those who worship in it           leave out the court which is outside of the temple           and don t measure it  for it has been given to the nations           they will tread the holy city under foot for forty two months           i will give power to my two witnesses  and they will prophesy          one thousand two hundred sixty days  clothed in sackcloth            these are the two olive trees and the two lampstands           standing before the lord of the earth           if anyone desires to harm them  fire proceeds out of their mouth          and devours their enemies   if anyone desires to harm them           he must be killed in this way           these have the power to shut up the sky  that it may not rain          during the days of their prophecy   they have power over          the waters  to turn them into blood  and to strike the earth          with every plague  as often as they desire           when they have finished their testimony  the beast that comes up          out of the abyss will make war with them  and overcome them           and kill them           their dead bodies will be in the street of the great city           which spiritually is called sodom and egypt  where also their          lord was crucified           from among the peoples  tribes  languages  and nations people          will look at their dead bodies for three and a half days           and will not allow their dead bodies to be laid in a tomb           those who dwell on the earth rejoice over them  and they will          be glad   they will give gifts to one another  because these          two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth           after the three and a half days  the breath of life from          god entered into them  and they stood on their feet           great fear fell on those who saw them           i heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them   come up here            they went up into heaven in the cloud  and their enemies saw them           in that day there was a great earthquake  and a tenth of the          city fell   seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake           and the rest were terrified  and gave glory to the god of heaven           the second woe is past   behold  the third woe comes quickly           the seventh angel sounded  and great voices in heaven followed           saying   the kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of          our lord  and of his christ   he will reign forever and ever            the twenty four elders  who sit on their thrones before god s throne           fell on their faces and worshiped god           saying    we give you thanks  lord god  the almighty           the one who is and who was tr adds  and who is coming             because you have taken your great power  and reigned           the nations were angry  and your wrath came  as did the time          for the dead to be judged  and to give your bondservants          the prophets  their reward  as well as to the saints           and those who fear your name  to the small and the great           and to destroy those who destroy the earth            god s temple that is in heaven was opened  and the ark of the lord s          covenant was seen in his temple   lightnings  sounds  thunders           an earthquake  and great hail followed           a great sign was seen in heaven   a woman clothed with the sun           and the moon under her feet  and on her head a crown          of twelve stars           she was with child   she cried out in pain  laboring to give birth           another sign was seen in heaven   behold  a great red dragon           having seven heads and ten horns  and on his heads seven crowns           his tail drew one third of the stars of the sky  and threw          them to the earth   the dragon stood before the woman who was          about to give birth  so that when she gave birth he might          devour her child           she gave birth to a son  a male child  who is to rule all          the nations with a rod of iron   her child was caught up to god           and to his throne           the woman fled into the wilderness  where she has a place          prepared by god  that there they may nourish her one thousand          two hundred sixty days           there was war in the sky   michael and his angels made war          on the dragon   the dragon and his angels made war           they didn t prevail  neither was a place found for him any          more in heaven           the great dragon was thrown down  the old serpent  he who is          called the devil and satan  the deceiver of the whole world           he was thrown down to the earth  and his angels were thrown          down with him           i heard a loud voice in heaven  saying   now is come the salvation           the power  and the kingdom of our god  and the authority of          his christ  for the accuser of our brothers has been thrown down           who accuses them before our god day and night           they overcame him because of the lamb s blood  and because of          the word of their testimony   they didn t love their life           even to death           therefore rejoice  heavens  and you who dwell in them           woe to the earth and to the sea  because the devil has          gone down to you  having great wrath  knowing that he has          but a short time            when the dragon saw that he was thrown down to the earth           he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male child           two wings of the great eagle were given to the woman  that she          might fly into the wilderness to her place  so that she          might be nourished for a time  and times  and half a time           from the face of the serpent           the serpent spewed water out of his mouth after the woman          like a river  that he might cause her to be carried away          by the stream           the earth helped the woman  and the earth opened its mouth          and swallowed up the river which the dragon spewed out          of his mouth           the dragon grew angry with the woman  and went away to make          war with the rest of her seed  who keep god s commandments          and hold jesus  testimony           then i stood on the sand of the sea   i saw a beast coming          up out of the sea  having ten horns and seven heads           on his horns were ten crowns  and on his heads  blasphemous names           the beast which i saw was like a leopard  and his feet were          like those of a bear  and his mouth like the mouth of a lion           the dragon gave him his power  his throne  and great authority           one of his heads looked like it had been wounded fatally           his fatal wound was healed  and the whole earth marveled          at the beast           they worshiped the dragon  because he gave his authority to the beast           and they worshiped the beast  saying   who is like the beast           who is able to make war with him            a mouth speaking great things and blasphemy was given to him           authority to make war for forty two months was given to him           he opened his mouth for blasphemy against god  to blaspheme          his name  and his dwelling  those who dwell in heaven           it was given to him to make war with the saints  and to          overcome them   authority over every tribe  people  language           and nation was given to him           all who dwell on the earth will worship him  everyone whose          name has not been written from the foundation of the world          in the book of life of the lamb who has been killed           if anyone has an ear  let him hear           if anyone has captivity  he will go   if anyone is with the sword           he must be killed  tr reads  if anyone leads into captivity           into captivity he goes   if anyone will kill with the sword           he must be killed with a sword    instead of  if anyone          has captivity  he goes away   if anyone is with the sword           he must be killed    here is the endurance and the faith          of the saints           i saw another beast coming up out of the earth           he had two horns like a lamb  and he spoke like a dragon           he exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence           he makes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship          the first beast  whose fatal wound was healed           he performs great signs  even making fire come down out of          the sky to the earth in the sight of people           he deceives my own people who dwell on the earth because          of the signs he was granted to do in front of the beast           saying to those who dwell on the earth  that they should make          an image to the beast who had the sword wound and lived           it was given to him to give breath to it  to the image          of the beast  that the image of the beast should both speak           and cause as many as wouldn t worship the image of the beast          to be killed           he causes all  the small and the great  the rich and the poor           and the free and the slave  to be given marks on their right hands           or on their foreheads           and that no one would be able to buy or to sell  unless he has          that mark  the name of the beast or the number of his name           here is wisdom   he who has understanding  let him calculate          the number of the beast  for it is the number of a man           his number is six hundred sixty six           i saw  and behold  the lamb standing on mount zion  and with him          a number  one hundred forty four thousand  having his name           and the name of his father  written on their foreheads           i heard a sound from heaven  like the sound of many waters           and like the sound of a great thunder   the sound which i          heard was like that of harpists playing on their harps           they sing a new song before the throne  and before the four          living creatures and the elders   no one could learn the song          except the one hundred forty four thousand  those who had been          redeemed out of the earth           these are those who were not defiled with women  for they          are virgins   these are those who follow the lamb wherever he goes           these were redeemed by jesus from among men  the first fruits          to god and to the lamb           in their mouth was found no lie  for they are blameless  tr          adds  before the throne of god            i saw an angel flying in mid heaven  having an eternal          good news to proclaim to those who dwell on the earth           and to every nation  tribe  language  and people           he said with a loud voice   fear the lord  and give him glory           for the hour of his judgment has come   worship him who made          the heaven  the earth  the sea  and the springs of waters            another  a second angel  followed  saying   babylon the great          has fallen  which has made all the nations to drink of the wine          of the wrath of her sexual immorality            another angel  a third  followed them  saying with a great voice            if anyone worships the beast and his image  and receives          a mark on his forehead  or on his hand           he also will drink of the wine of the wrath of god           which is prepared unmixed in the cup of his anger           he will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence          of the holy angels  and in the presence of the lamb           the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever           they have no rest day and night  those who worship the beast          and his image  and whoever receives the mark of his name           here is the patience of the saints  those who keep the commandments          of god  and the faith of jesus            i heard the voice from heaven saying   write   blessed are the dead          who die in the lord from now on      yes   says the spirit            that they may rest from their labors  for their works          follow with them            i looked  and behold  a white cloud  and on the cloud one          sitting like a son of man  daniel       having on his head          a golden crown  and in his hand a sharp sickle           another angel came out from the temple  crying with a loud          voice to him who sat on the cloud   send forth your sickle           and reap  for the hour to reap has come  for the harvest          of the earth is ripe            he who sat on the cloud thrust his sickle on the earth           and the earth was reaped           another angel came out from the temple which is in heaven           he also had a sharp sickle           another angel came out from the altar  he who has power          over fire  and he called with a great voice to him who had          the sharp sickle  saying   send forth your sharp sickle           and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth  for the earth s          grapes are fully ripe            the angel thrust his sickle into the earth  and gathered          the vintage of the earth  and threw it into the great winepress          of the wrath of god           the winepress was trodden outside of the city  and blood came          out from the winepress  even to the bridles of the horses           as far as one thousand six hundred stadia       stadia                kilometers or     miles           i saw another great and marvelous sign in the sky           seven angels having the seven last plagues  for in them god s          wrath is finished           i saw something like a sea of glass mixed with fire  and those          who overcame the beast  his image  tr adds  his mark             and the number of his name  standing on the sea of glass           having harps of god           they sang the song of moses  the servant of god  and the song          of the lamb  saying   great and marvelous are your works           lord god  the almighty   righteous and true are your ways           you king of the nations           who wouldn t fear you  lord  and glorify your name   for you only          are holy   for all the nations will come and worship before you           for your righteous acts have been revealed            after these things i looked  and the temple of the tabernacle          of the testimony in heaven was opened           the seven angels who had the seven plagues came out           clothed with pure  bright linen  and wearing golden sashes          around their breasts           one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels          seven golden bowls full of the wrath of god  who lives          forever and ever           the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of god           and from his power   no one was able to enter into the temple           until the seven plagues of the seven angels would be finished           i heard a loud voice out of the temple  saying to the seven angels            go and pour out the seven bowls of the wrath of god          on the earth            the first went  and poured out his bowl into the earth           and it became a harmful and evil sore on the people who had          the mark of the beast  and who worshiped his image           the second angel poured out his bowl into the sea  and it became          blood as of a dead man   every living thing in the sea died           the third poured out his bowl into the rivers and springs of water           and they became blood           i heard the angel of the waters saying   you are righteous           who are and who were  you holy one  because you have          judged these things           for they poured out the blood of the saints and the prophets           and you have given them blood to drink   they deserve this            i heard the altar saying   yes  lord god  the almighty           true and righteous are your judgments            the fourth poured out his bowl on the sun  and it was given          to him to scorch men with fire           people were scorched with great heat  and people blasphemed          the name of god who has the power over these plagues           they didn t repent and give him glory           the fifth poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast           and his kingdom was darkened   they gnawed their tongues          because of the pain           and they blasphemed the god of heaven because of their pains          and their sores   they didn t repent of their works           the sixth poured out his bowl on the great river  the euphrates           its water was dried up  that the way might be made ready          for the kings that come from the sunrise           i saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon  and out of the mouth          of the beast  and out of the mouth of the false prophet           three unclean spirits  something like frogs           for they are spirits of demons  performing signs  which go forth          to the kings of the whole inhabited earth  to gather them          together for the war of that great day of god  the almighty            behold  i come like a thief   blessed is he who watches           and keeps his clothes  so that he doesn t walk naked           and they see his shame            he gathered them together into the place which is called          in hebrew  megiddo           the seventh poured out his bowl into the air           a loud voice came forth out of the temple of heaven           from the throne  saying   it is done            there were lightnings  sounds  and thunders  and there was          a great earthquake  such as was not since there were men          on the earth  so great an earthquake  so mighty           the great city was divided into three parts  and the cities          of the nations fell   babylon the great was remembered          in the sight of god  to give to her the cup of the wine          of the fierceness of his wrath           every island fled away  and the mountains were not found           great hailstones  about the weight of a talent    talent is about             kilograms or    pounds  came down out of the sky on people           people blasphemed god because of the plague of the hail           for this plague is exceedingly severe           one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke          with me  saying   come here   i will show you the judgment          of the great prostitute who sits on many waters           with whom the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality           and those who dwell in the earth were made drunken with the wine          of her sexual immorality            he carried me away in the spirit into a wilderness           i saw a woman sitting on a scarlet colored animal  full of          blasphemous names  having seven heads and ten horns           the woman was dressed in purple and scarlet  and decked with gold          and precious stones and pearls  having in her hand a golden          cup full of abominations and the impurities of the sexual          immorality of the earth           and on her forehead a name was written   mystery  babylon the great           the mother of the prostitutes and of the abominations of the earth            i saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints           and with the blood of the martyrs of jesus   when i saw her           i wondered with great amazement           the angel said to me   why do you wonder   i will tell you          the mystery of the woman  and of the beast that carries her           which has the seven heads and the ten horns           the beast that you saw was  and is not  and is about          to come up out of the abyss and to go into destruction           those who dwell on the earth and whose names have not          been written in the book of life from the foundation          of the world will marvel when they see that the beast was           and is not  and shall be present  tr reads  yet is           instead of  shall be present            here is the mind that has wisdom   the seven heads are          seven mountains  on which the woman sits           they are seven kings   five have fallen  the one is           the other has not yet come   when he comes  he must continue          a little while           the beast that was  and is not  is himself also an eighth           and is of the seven  and he goes to destruction           the ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have received          no kingdom as yet  but they receive authority as kings           with the beast  for one hour           these have one mind  and they give their power and authority          to the beast           these will war against the lamb  and the lamb will overcome them           for he is lord of lords  and king of kings   they also will          overcome who are with him  called and chosen and faithful            he said to me   the waters which you saw  where the prostitute sits           are peoples  multitudes  nations  and languages           the ten horns which you saw  and the beast  these will hate          the prostitute  and will make her desolate  and will make her naked           and will eat her flesh  and will burn her utterly with fire           for god has put in their hearts to do what he has in mind           and to be of one mind  and to give their kingdom to the beast           until the words of god should be accomplished           the woman whom you saw is the great city  which reigns over          the kings of the earth            after these things  i saw another angel coming down out of          the sky  having great authority   the earth was illuminated          with his glory           he cried with a mighty voice  saying   fallen  fallen is          babylon the great  and she has become a habitation of demons           a prison of every unclean spirit  and a prison of every          unclean and hateful bird           for all the nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her          sexual immorality  the kings of the earth committed sexual          immorality with her  and the merchants of the earth grew rich          from the abundance of her luxury            i heard another voice from heaven  saying   come out of her           my people  that you have no participation in her sins           and that you don t receive of her plagues           for her sins have reached to the sky  and god has          remembered her iniquities           return to her just as she returned  and repay her double as she did           and according to her works   in the cup which she mixed           mix to her double           however much she glorified herself  and grew wanton  so much          give her of torment and mourning   for she says in her heart            i sit a queen  and am no widow  and will in no way see mourning            therefore in one day her plagues will come   death  mourning           and famine  and she will be utterly burned with fire           for the lord god who has judged her is strong           the kings of the earth  who committed sexual immorality          and lived wantonly with her  will weep and wail over her           when they look at the smoke of her burning           standing far away for the fear of her torment  saying            woe  woe  the great city  babylon  the strong city           for your judgment has come in one hour

have been slain on the earth            after these things i heard something like a loud voice of a great          multitude in heaven  saying   hallelujah   salvation  power           and glory belong to our god           for true and righteous are his judgments   for he has judged          the great prostitute  who corrupted the earth with her          sexual immorality  and he has avenged

 the small          and the great            i heard something like the voice of a great multitude           and like the voice of many waters  and like the voice of          mighty thunders  saying   hallelujah   for the lord our god           the almighty  reigns           let us rejoice and be exceedingly glad  and let us give          the glory to him   for the marriage of the lamb has come           and his wife has made herself ready            it was given to her that she would array herself in bright           pure  fine linen   for the fine linen is the righteous acts          of the saints           he said to me   write   blessed are those who are invited          to the marriage supper of the lamb     he said to me            these are true words of god            i fell down before his feet to worship him   he said          to me   look   don t do it   i am a fellow bondservant with you          and with your brothers who hold the testimony of jesus           worship god  for the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy            i saw the heaven opened  and behold  a white horse           and he who sat on it is called faithful and true           in righteousness he judges and makes war           his eyes are a flame of fire  and on his head are many crowns           he has names written and a name written which no one knows          but he himself           he is clothed in a garment sprinkled with blood           his name is called  the word of god            the armies which are in heaven followed him on white horses           clothed in white  pure  fine linen           out of his mouth proceeds a sharp  double edged sword           that with it he should strike the nations   he will rule          them with an iron rod  psalm      he treads the winepress          of the fierceness of the wrath of god  the almighty           he has on his garment and on his thigh a name written            king of kings  and lord of lords            i saw an angel standing in the sun   he cried with a loud voice           saying to all the birds that fly in the sky   come   be gathered          together to the great supper of god  tr reads  supper          of the great god  instead of  great supper of god            that you may eat the flesh of kings  the flesh of captains           the flesh of mighty men  and the flesh of horses and of those          who sit on them  and the flesh of all men  both free and slave           and small and great            i saw the beast  and the kings of the earth  and their armies           gathered together to make war against him who sat on the horse           and against his army           the beast was taken  and with him the false prophet who worked          the signs in his sight  with which he deceived those who had          received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image           these two were thrown alive into the lake of fire that          burns with sulfur           the rest were killed with the sword of him who sat on          the horse  the sword which came forth out of his mouth           all the birds were filled with their flesh           i saw an angel coming down out of heaven  having the key          of the abyss and a great chain in his hand           he seized the dragon  the old serpent  which is the devil          and satan  who deceives the whole inhabited earth  and bound          him for a thousand years           and cast him into the abyss  and shut it  and sealed it          over him  that he should deceive the nations no more           until the thousand years were finished   after this  he must          be freed for a short time           i saw thrones  and they sat on them  and judgment was given          to them   i saw the souls of those who had been beheaded          for the testimony of jesus  and for the word of god           and such as didn t worship the beast nor his image  and didn t          receive the mark on their forehead and on their hand           they lived  and reigned with christ for the thousand years           the rest of the dead didn t live until the thousand years          were finished   this is the first resurrection           blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection           over these  the second death has no power  but they will          be priests of god and of christ  and will reign with him          one thousand years           and after the thousand years  satan will be released          from his prison           and he will come out to deceive the nations which are in the four          corners of the earth  gog and magog  to gather them together          to the war  the number of whom is as the sand of the sea           they went up over the breadth of the earth  and surrounded          the camp of the saints  and the beloved city   fire came          down out of heaven from god  and devoured them           the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire          and sulfur  where the beast and the false prophet are also           they will be tormented day and night forever and ever           i saw a great white throne  and him who sat on it           from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away           there was found no place for them           i saw the dead  the great and the small  standing before          the throne  and they opened books   another book was opened           which is the book of life   the dead were judged out of the things          which were written in the books  according to their works           the sea gave up the dead who were in it           death and hades or  hell  gave up the dead who were in them           they were judged  each one according to his works           death and hades or  hell  were thrown into the lake of fire           this is the second death  the lake of fire           if anyone was not found written in the book of life  he was          cast into the lake of fire           i saw a new heaven and a new earth   for the first heaven          and the first earth have passed away  and the sea is no more           i saw the holy city  new jerusalem  coming down out of heaven          from god  made ready like a bride adorned for her husband           i heard a loud voice out of heaven saying   behold  god s dwelling          is with people  and he will dwell with them  and they will be          his people  and god himself will be with them as their god           he will wipe away from them every tear from their eyes           death will be no more  neither will there be mourning  nor crying           nor pain  any more   the first things have passed away            he who sits on the throne said   behold  i am making all things new            he said   write  for these words of god are faithful and true            he said to me   it is done   i am the alpha and the omega           the beginning and the end   i will give freely to him who is          thirsty from the spring of the water of life           he who overcomes  i will give him these things           i will be his god  and he will be my son
