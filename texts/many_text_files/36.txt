the large corner house  on the right of the engraving  samuel  johnson was born on the   th of september  n s        we learn from  boswell  that the house was built by johnson s father  and that the  two fronts  towards market and broad market street stood upon waste  land of the corporation of lichfield  under a forty years lease  this  expired in       when on the   th of august   at a common hall of the  bailiffs and citizens  it was ordered   and that without any  solicitation   that a lease should be granted to samuel johnson   doctor of laws  of the incroachments at his house  for the term of  ninety nine years  at the old rent  which was five shillings  of  which  as town clerk  mr  simpson had the honour and pleasure of  informing him  and that he was desired to accept it  without paying  any fine on the occasion  which lease was afterwards granted  and the  doctor died possessed of this property                 note to boswell s life of johnson   nd edition  vol  iii           p          in the above house  the doctor s father michael johnson  a native of  derbyshire  of obscure extraction  settled as a bookseller and  stationer  he was diligent in business  and not only  kept shop  at  home  but  on market days  frequented several towns in the  neighbourhood     some of which were at a considerable distance from  lichfield   at that time booksellers  shops in the provincial towns of  england were very rare  so that there was not one even in birmingham   in which town old mr  johnson used to open a shop every market day  he  was a pretty good latin scholar  and a citizen so creditable as to be  made one of the magistrates of lichfield  and  being a man of good  sense and skill in his trade  he acquired a reasonable share of  wealth  of which  however  he afterwards lost the greatest part  by  engaging unsuccessfully in the manufacture of parchment      this  failure is attributed to the dishonesty of a servant  but it is  observable in connexion with an incident in dr  johnson s literary  history  which has not escaped the keen eye of mr  croker  the  ingenious annotator of boswell s  life  of the great lexicographer                to show the great estimation in which the father of our          great moralist was held  we may quote a letter  dated           trentham  st  peter s day         written by the rev           george plaxton  then chaplain to lord gower    johnson           the lichfield librarian  is now here  he propagates          learning all over this diocese  and advanceth knowledge to          its just height  all the

adjudged not by the  common          judges  of property  but by  wretches  hired by those to          whom excise is paid   and  in the  idler   no      he          calls a  commissioner of excise   one of the  lowest  of          all human beings   this violence of language seems so          little reasonable  that the editor was induced to suspect          some cause of  personal animosity   this mention of the          trade in parchment  an  excisable  article  afforded a          clue  which has led to the confirmation of that suspicion           in the records of the excise board is to be found the          following letter  addressed to the supervisor of excise at          lichfield    july           the commissioners received          yours of the   nd instant  and since the

 you          do not lay an information against him  but send an          affidavit of the fact  that he may be prosecuted in the          exchequer   it does not appear whether he offended again           but here is sufficient cause of his son s animosity          against commissioners of excise  and of the allusion in          the dictionary to the  special  jurisdiction under which          that revenue is administered  the reluctance of the          justices to convict will not appear unnatural  when it is          recollected that mr  johnson was   this very year   chief          magistrate of the city    note to boswell  by croker            vol  i     johnson s mother was a woman of distinguished understanding and piety   and to her must be ascribed those early impressions of religion upon  the mind of her son  from which the world afterwards derived so much  benefit  johnson was the elder of two sons  the younger of whom died  in his infancy     of johnson s childhood at lichfield it would not be difficult to  assemble many interesting particulars  from his listening to dr   sacheverel  when he was but three years old  his being first taught to  read english by dame oliver  a widow who kept a school for young  children in lichfield  and who gave him a present of gingerbread  and  said he was the best scholar she ever had  to his arrival in london  with the unfinished tragedy of  irene  in his pocket  and the prospect  of a slender engagement with cave of the  gentleman s magazine   one  thing is certain  that however unpromising were johnson s early days  at lichfield  he ever retained a warm affection for his native city   and which  by a sudden apostrophe  under the word  lich   he  introduces with reverence into his immortal work  the english  dictionary   salve magna parens   boswell    his last visit was in his    th year when he writes to boswell    i came to lichfield  and found  every body glad enough to see me      the annexed view is

instances are recorded by ancient historians of the  practice of this noble virtue  but in the reminiscences of our  youthful studies  there is no incident that occurs with more freshness  to the memory than that of the continence of scipio africanus  related  by livy  it appears that the soldiers of scipio s army  after the  taking of new carthage  brought before him a young lady of great  beauty  scipio inquiring concerning her country and parents   ascertained that she was betrothed to allutius  prince of the  celtiberians  he immediately ordered her parents and bridegroom to be  sent for  in the meantime he was informed that the young prince was so  excessively enamoured of his bride  that he could not survive the loss  of her  for this reason  as soon as he appeared  and before he spoke  to her parents  he took great care to talk with him   as you and i are  both young   said he   we can converse together with greater freedom   when your bride  who had fallen into the hands of my soldiers  was  brought before me  i was informed that you loved her passionately   and  in truth  her perfect beauty left me no room to doubt of it  if i  were at liberty to indulge a youthful passion  i mean honourable and  lawful wedlock  and were not solely engrossed by the affairs of my  republic  i might have hoped to have been pardoned my excessive love  for so charming a mistress  but as i am situated  and have it in my  power  with pleasure i promote your happiness  your future spouse has  met with as civil and modest treatment from me  as if she had been  amongst her own parents  who are soon to be yours too  i have kept her  pure  in order to have it in my power to make you a present worthy of  you and of me   the magnanimity of his behaviour did not close here   for when the parents of the fair captive brought an immense sum of  money to ransom her  they were much surprised at scipio s noble  conduct  and in the ecstacy of joy and gratitude  they pressed him to  accept it as a token of thankfulness  scipio  unable to resist their  importunate solicitations  told them he accepted it  but ordering it  to be laid at his feet  he thus addressed allutius    to the portion  you are to receive from your father in law  i add this  and beg you  would accept it as a nuptial present   thus exhibiting in the whole  transaction a rare instance of modesty  disinterestedness  and  benevolence  well worthy of imperishable record  as a moral lesson for  mankind     when araspes had commended the fair panthea to cyrus  as a beauty  worthy his admiration  he replied   for that very reason i will not  see her  lest if by thy persuasion i should see her but once  she  herself might persuade me to see her often  and spend more time with  her than would be for the advantage of my own affairs    alexander the  great would not trust his eyes in the presence of the beauteous queen  of persia  but kept himself out of the reach of her charms  and  treated only with her aged mother  these  as they were peculiar acts  of continence  so were they as absolutely checks of curiosity  which  never sleeps in youthful breasts when beauty elicits admiration     cicero  treating of the many degrees of human commerce and society   places matrimony in the first rank  in fact  marriage is not only a  state capable of the highest human felicity  but it is an institution  well calculated to destroy those rank and noxious weeds of the  passions which  by their pestiferous influence  spread misery and  death around the social hemisphere  marriage is the basis of  community  and the cement of society   it is  or ought to be  that  state of perfect friendship in which there are  according to  pythagoras   two bodies with but one soul   it is in the genial  atmosphere of this noble communion of sentiment and affection that the  virtue of continence comes forth in all its dazzling splendour  milton  has touched this subject with so chaste and

manner in debate  mr   butler has given a striking account    at times lord thurlow was  superlatively great  it was the good fortune of the reminiscent to  hear his celebrated reply to the duke of grafton  during the inquiry  into lord sandwich s administration of greenwich hospital  his grace s  action and delivery  when he addressed the house  were singularly  dignified and graceful  but his matter was not equal to his manner  he  reproached lord thurlow with his plebeian extraction  and his recent  admission into the peerage  particular circumstances caused lord  thurlow s reply to make a deep impression on the reminiscent  his  lordship had spoken too often  and began to be heard with a civil but  visible impatience  under these circumstances he was attacked in the  manner we have mentioned  he rose from the woolsack  and advanced  slowly to the place from which the chancellor generally addresses the  house  then fixing on the duke the look of jove when he grasps the  thunder   i am amazed   he said  in a level tone of voice   at the  attack the noble duke has made on me  yes  my lords   considerably  raising his voice   i am amazed at his grace s speech  the noble duke  cannot look before him  behind him  or on either side of him  without  seeing some noble peer who owes his seat in this house to his  successful exertions in the profession to which i belong  does he not  feel that it is as honourable to owe it to these  as to being the  accident of an accident  to all these noble lords the language of the  noble duke is applicable and as insulting as it is to myself  but i  don t fear to meet it single and alone  no one venerates the peerage  more than i do   but  my lords  i must say that the peerage solicited  me  not i the peerage   nay  more  i can say  and will say  that as a  peer of parliament  as speaker of this right honourable house  as  keeper of the great seal  as guardian of his majesty s conscience  as  lord high chancellor of england  nay  even in that character alone in  which the noble duke would think it an affront to be considered  as a   man   i am at this moment as respectable  i beg leave to add  i am at  this time as much respected  as the proudest peer i now look down  upon   the effect of this speech  both within the walls of parliament  and out of them  was prodigious  it gave lord thurlow an ascendancy in  the house which no chancellor had ever possessed  it invested him  in  public opinion  with a character of independence and honour  and this   though he was ever on the unpopular side in politics  made him always  popular with the people      the legal talents and acquirements of lord thurlow have been the  subject of frequent panegyric  but it may  perhaps  be questioned   whether in all cases those eulogiums were just  it has been said  but  with what truth it is difficult to form an opinion  that his lordship  was much indebted to mr  hargrave  for the learning by which his  judgments were sometimes distinguished  and that mr  hargrave received  a handsome remuneration for these services   as lord chancellor   says  a writer who was personally acquainted with his lordship   from a  well placed confidence in mr  hargrave  who was indefatigable in his  service  he had occasion to give himself less trouble than any other  man in that high station  an old free speaking companion of his  well  known at lincoln s inn  would sometimes say to me   i met the great  law lion this morning going to westminster  but he was so busily  reading in the coach what his provider had supplied him with  that he  took no notice of me       the ardent zeal with which lord thurlow contested the great question  of the regency  led him  if we may credit the narrative of one who was  a party to the debate  to be guilty of an act of great disingenuousness   dr  watson  the bishop of llandaff  in the course of a speech  in  which he supported the claims of the prince of wales  incidentally  cited a passage from grotius  with regard to the definition of the  word  right    the chancellor  in his reply   says the bishop in his  memoirs   boldly asserted that he perfectly well remembered the  passage i had quoted from grotius  and that it solely respected  natural  but was inapplicable to civil  rights  lord loughborough  the  first time i saw him after the debate  assured me that before he went  to sleep that night he had looked into grotius  and was astonished to  find that the chancellor  in contradicting me  had presumed on the  ignorance of the house  and that my quotation was perfectly correct   what miserable shifts do great men submit to  in supporting their  parties  the chancellor thurlow   continues the bishop   was an able  and upright judge  but as the speaker of the house of lords  he was  domineering and insincere  it was said of him  that in the cabinet he  opposed everything  proposed nothing  and was ready to support  anything  i remember lord camden s saying to me one night  when the  chancellor was speaking contrary  as he thought  to his own  conviction   there now  i could not do that  he is supporting what he  does not believe a word of        roscoe s lives of eminent lawyers  cabinet cyclopaedia                                                      manners and customs                                                   torchlight       it is an interesting circumstance in the habits of the ancient romans   that their journeys were pursued very much in the night time  and by  torchlight  cicero  in one of his letters  speaks of passing through  the towns of italy by night  as a serviceable scheme for some  political purpose  either of avoiding too much to publish his motions   or of evading the necessity  else perhaps not avoidable  of drawing  out the party sentiments of the magistrates in the circumstances of  honour or neglect with which they might choose to receive him  his  words  however  imply that the practice was by no means an uncommon  one  and  indeed  from some passages in writers of the augustan era   it would seem that this custom was not confined to people of  distinction  but was familiar to a class of travellers so low in rank  as to be capable of abusing their opportunities of concealment for the  infliction of wanton injury upon the woods and fences which bounded  the margin of the high road  under the cloud of night and solitude   the mischief loving traveller was often in the habit of applying his  torch to the withered boughs of wood  or to artificial hedges  and  extensive ravages by fire  such as now happen not unfrequently in the  american woods  but generally from carelessness in scattering the  glowing embers of a fire  or even the ashes of a pipe   were then  occasionally the result of mere wantonness of mischief  ovid  accordingly notices  as one amongst the familiar images of daybreak   the half burnt torch of the traveller  and  apparently  from the  position which it holds in his description  where it is ranked with  the most familiar of all circumstances in all countries  that of the  rural labourer going out to his morning tasks it must have been common  indeed        semiustamque facem vigilata nocte viator    ponet  et ad solitum rusticus ibit opus      this occurs in the  fasti   elsewhere he notices it for its danger        ut facibus sepes ardent  cum forte viator    vel nimis admovit  vel jam sub luce reliquit      he  however  we see  good naturedly ascribes the danger to mere  carelessness  in bringing the torch too near to the hedge  or tossing  it away at daybreak  but varro  a more matter of fact observer  does  not disguise the plain truth  that these disasters were often the  product of pure malicious frolic  for instance  in recommending a  certain kind of quickset fence  he insists upon it as one of its  advantages  that it will not readily ignite under the torch of the  mischievous wayfarer   naturale sepimentum   says he   quod obseri  solet virgultis aut spinis   praetereuntis lascivi non metuet facem     it is not easy to see the origin or advantage of this practice of  nocturnal travelling   which must have considerably increased the  hazards of a journey   excepting only in the heats of summer  it is  probable  however  that men of high rank and public station may have  introduced the practice by way of releasing corporate bodies in large  towns from the burdensome ceremonies of public receptions  thus making  a compromise between their own dignity and the convenience of the  provincial public  once introduced  and the arrangements upon the road  for meeting the wants of travellers once adapted to such a practice   it would easily become universal  it is  however  very possible that  mere horror of the heats of daytime may have been the original ground  for it  the ancients appear to have shrunk from no hardship as so  trying and insufferable as that of heat  and in relation to that  subject  it is interesting to observe the way in which the ordinary  use of language has accommodated itself to that feeling  our northern  way of expressing effeminacy  is derived chiefly from the hardships of  cold  he that shrinks from the trials and rough experience of real  life in any department  is described by the contemptuous prefix of   chimney corner   as if shrinking from the cold which he would meet on  coming out into the open air amongst his fellow men  thus  a   chimney corner  politician for a mere speculator or unpractical  dreamer  but the very same indolent habit of aerial speculation  which  courts no test of real life and practice  is described by the ancients  under the term  umbraticus   or seeking the cool shade  and shrinking  from the heat  thus an  umbraticus doctor  is one who has no practical  solidity in his teaching  the fatigue and hardship of real life  in  short  is represented by the ancients under the uniform image of heat   and by the moderns under that of cold      blackwood s magazine                                                      retrospective gleanings                                                    progress  of charles ii

 the ostrich is swifter than the  arabian horse  during the residence of mr  adamson at pador  a french  factory on the south side of the river niger  he says that two  ostriches  which had been about two years in the factory  afforded him  a sight of a very extraordinary nature  these gigantic birds  though  young  were of nearly the full size  they were  he continues  so tame   that two little blacks mounted both together on the back of the  larger  no sooner did he feel their weight  than he began to run as  last as possible  and carried them several times round the  village   and it was impossible to stop him  otherwise than by  obstructing the passage  this sight pleased me so much  that i wished  it to be repeated  and  to try their strength  directed a full grown  negro to mount the smallest  and two others the larger  this burden  did not seem at all disproportioned to their strength  at first  they  went at a pretty sharp trot  but when they became heated a little   they expanded their wings  as though to catch the wind  and moved with  such fleetness that they seemed scarcely to touch the ground  most  people have  at one time or other  seen the partridge run  and  consequently must know that there is no man able to keep up with it   and it is easy to imagine  that if this bird had a longer step  its  speed would be considerably augmented  the ostrich moves like the  partridge  with this advantage  and i am satisfied that those i am  speaking of would have distanced the fleetest race horses that were  ever bred in england  it is true  that they would not hold out so long  as a horse  but they would  undoubtedly  be able to go over the space  in less time  i have frequently beheld this sight  which is capable of  giving one an idea of the prodigious strength of the ostrich  and of  showing what use it might be of  had we but the method of breaking and  managing it as we do the horse      the following interesting particulars  relating to the capability of  the ostrich to digest hard substances  is given by mr  fuller  in his   tour of the turkish empire     an ostrich  belonging to an english  gentleman  arrived at cairo from upper egypt  and afforded us an  opportunity of observing this curious peculiarity in the natural  history of that animal  the persons in charge of him observing his  great propensity for hard substances  mistook  unfortunately  for his  natural and ordinary diet  things that were only the objects of his  luxury  and while they gave him corn only occasionally  administered  every day a certain portion of iron  chiefly in the form of nails  to  which he occasionally added a knife or a razor  which he chanced to  pick up  or a few loose buttons  which he pulled from the coats of his  attendants  this metallic system did not however succeed  the poor  bird drooped gradually  his strength just lasted him to walk with a  stately step into the court of the consulate  and he died in about an  hour afterwards  on a  post mortem  examination  at which i was  present  about three pounds of iron were taken from his stomach  a  considerable portion of the hardest parts  such as the blades of the  knives and razor  was dissolved  and it is possible that the whole  might in time have been digested  as the death of the animal was in  part accidental  being immediately occasioned by a sharp  boat builder s nail  three or four inches long  which he had  swallowed  and which had penetrated quite through the stomach  and  produced mortification      w g c                                                   effects of light and air on plants       the importance of light and air to plants is well known  when  unassisted by these agents  plants lose their colour  and are deprived  of many of their properties  colour is thus evidently produced by the  absorption of carbonic acid gas  and the colouring matter may be  detected by a powerful microscope  lodged in the cellular substance of  the leaf  how this colour is formed  and why it assumes different  tints in different plants  are  however  questions which it is at  present impossible to decide  the secretions of plants depend upon  light  and their flavour and nutritious qualities are materially  altered by their exclusion from it  the importance of this knowledge  to a practical horticulturist is proved by the fact  that sea kale  so  well known as a wholesome and palatable vegetable  is not eatable in  its original state  and that any part of the cultivated plant  if  accidentally left exposed to the action of the air and light  becomes  tough  and so strong in flavour as to be extremely unpleasant to the  taste  celery  also  in its native state  is poisonous  and it is only  the parts that are blanched that are perfectly fitted for the table   though colour is generally supposed to depend principally on the  plant s being exposed to the light  some portion of colouring matter  appears to be occasionally absorbed by the root  this colouring  substance is  however  never a deep green  red and yellow  as may be  seen in forced rhubarb   c   are the most common hues  succulent  plants are less susceptible of the influence of light than any others   as they are always natives of hot countries  nature  to prevent the  danger they would be exposed to from excessive evaporation  has  provided them with leaves almost destitute of pores  and the moisture  they absorb by their roots thus remains for the nourishment of the  plant  it is for this reason that cactuses  mesembryanthemums  and  other plants of a similar description  require very little water when  kept in pots  scarcely any carbon is found in plants grown in the  dark  many experiments have been tried to show the stimulus afforded  to vegetation by light  trees of the same species and variety have  been planted in the same garden and the same soil  but against walls  with different aspects  and differently situated with regard to shade   the effect has been  not only a difference in the growth and  appearance of the tree  but also in the size  colour  and flavour of  the fruit which it produced  the contrast between plants grown in  hot houses with wooden sash frames  and those grown in hot houses with  iron sash frames  has been found equally striking  the difference of  light between the two kinds of houses being as seven to twenty seven   or  sometimes  as three to twenty three  light is required at an early  period of vegetation  but  as its properties are to give strength and  flavour  it must be admitted with caution  as it is sometimes  injurious  too much light renders the skin of fruits tough  and will  make cucumbers bitter  berard of montpelier found that the ripening of  fruits is merely the turning the acid which they contain into sugar   by exposure to the light  and that too much light and heat  before  they have attained their proper size  will bring on premature  ripening  and make them insipid      lindley s lectures  reported in the gardeners  magazine                                                    plants in rooms       it is very difficult to make plants grow in rooms  they must  necessarily be deficient in the three important auxiliaries to  vegetable life  light  air  and moisture  the latter of which cannot  be maintained in apartments that are daily occupied  in large towns   plants cannot thrive even in the open air  as the minute particles of  soot  which are constantly floating about  settle upon their leaves   and choke up their pores  the gases produced by the combustion of  coal   c   are also injurious to plants  sulphurous acid  which  abounds in the atmosphere of london  turns the leaves yellow  and the  want of evaporation and absorption by the leaves prevents the proper  elaboration of the sap  and makes the trees stunted and unproductive      ibid                                                    the chlamyphorus       in our account of  the nine banded armadillo   at page    of the  present volume  we noticed the curious fact of the whole series of  armadillos offering a notable example of one genus being confined to a  particular country  viz  south america  of their standing perfectly  insulated  and exhibiting all the characters of a creation entirely  distinct  and  except as to the general character of mammiferous  quadrupeds  perfectly of its own kind     the nearest resemblance to the armadillo is  we believe  to be traced  in a very curious little quadruped which is occasionally to be seen in  the district of cuyo  at the foot of the andes  on the eastern side   the first instance of its being brought to europe was a specimen  preserved in spirit  which was added to the museum of the zoological  society  about four years since  by the hon  capt  percy  r n  who  received it from woodbine parish  esq  british consul at buenos ayres   it had been previously known only by the figures and description given  by dr  harlan  in the annals of the lyceum of natural history of new  york  his specimen was  however  deprived of the skeleton and internal  parts  which are perfect in the specimen  in one of the lower rooms of  the museum in bruton street  it is called the  chlamyphorus   and may  be said to unite the habits of the mole with the appearance of the  armadillo  its upper parts and sides are defended by a coat  or rather  cloak  of mail  of a coriaceous nature  but exceeding in inflexibility  sole leather of equal thickness  this cloak does not adhere  like that  of the armadillo  to the whole surface  occupying the place of the  skin  but is applied over the skin and fur  forming an additional  covering  which is attached only along the middle of the back and on  the head  the hinder parts of the animal are also protected by it  to  cover which  it is suddenly bent downwards at nearly a right angle   the tail is short  and is directed forwards along the under surface of  the body  owing to the rigidity of the case which so nearly encloses  the animal  its motions must be limited almost entirely to those of  mere progression  and even for these  the structure of its fore feet  is ill suited  the anterior limbs are  indeed  scarcely fitted for any  other purpose than that of burrowing  for this operation  the long and  broad claws with which they are furnished are truly admirably adapted   and their sharp points and cutting lower edges must materially assist  in clearing through the entangled roots which the animal may encounter  in its subterranean travels  its teeth resemble those of the sloth  more nearly than any other animal s  and it seems to represent   beneath the earth  that well known and singular inhabitant of  trees  for its motions  so far as can be conjectured from its  conformation  must also be executed with extreme slowness      illustration   the chlamyphorus       the dimensions of the specimen in the museum are as follow  length  from tip of nose to root of tail        inches  ditto tail        in    height at shoulder        in  a more detailed account of the internal  structure and economy of this extraordinary little animal will be  found in the  zoological journal   vols  ii  and iii                                                   arrow root        mr  andrew mathews  of lima  has communicated to the  gardeners   magazine  the following account of the otaheitan method of preparing  the excellent farinaceous substance termed  arrow root   so  extensively used in this country      the root   tacca  pinnatifida  lin    the  pea  of the natives  grows  in the greatest abundance in all the islands which we visited  viz    in otaheite  eimeo  huaheine  raiatea  and otaha  its favourite  situation is on the sides and ridges of the hills which rise directly  from the sea  and which are generally covered with a coarse grass  on  a red sandy loam  the root is round  white  smooth  full of eyes like  a potato  and from   to   in  in diameter  the flower stem rises  directly from the root  simple  from   to   ft  in height  as thick as  a man s finger  bearing its flowers in a loose simple umbel on the  summit  and  when large and full blown  it presents a beautiful and  delicate appearance  the leaf is large  tri pinnatifid  segments  acute  of a rich shining green  it is subject to great variation in  the size of the segments  some leaves being much more cut  and having  the segments narrower  than others  when a sufficient quantity of the  roots is collected  they are taken to a running stream  or to the  sea beach  and washed  the outer skin is carefully scraped off at the  same time with a shell  and those who are particular in the  preparation scrape out even the eyes  the root is then reduced to a  pulp  by rubbing it up and down a kind of rasp  made as follows   a  piece of board  about   in  wide  and    ft  long  is procured  upon  which some coarse twine  made of the fibres of the cocoa nut husk  is  tightly and regularly wound  and which affords an admirable substitute  for a coarse rasp  the pulp  when prepared  is washed first with salt  or sea water  through a sieve made of the fibrous web which protects  the young frond of the cocoa nut palm  and the starch  or arrow root   being carried through with the water  is received in a wooden trough  made like the small canoes used by the natives  the starch is allowed  to settle for a few days  the water is then strained  or  more  properly  poured off  and the sediment rewashed with fresh  or river   water  this washing is repeated three times with spring water  after  which the deposit is made into balls of about   or   in  in diameter   and in this state dried in the sun for twelve or twenty four hours   the balls are then broken  and the powder spread for some days in the  sun to dry  after which it is carefully wrapped in  tapa   the native  cloth   and put into baskets  and hung up in the houses  the natural  indolence of the people is so great  and their avarice such  that but  few of them will give the arrow root sufficient time to dry  if they  have an opportunity of parting with it  which i suspect was the case  with that sent to england some few years back by the missionaries  so  abundant is the root  that several tons might be prepared annually by  proper management  as it is  there is a considerable quantity  prepared  it being not only eaten by the natives and strangers on the  island  but also by the crews of the vessels that touch there     at present  when the roots are taken up  the only precaution used to  secure a crop the following year is to throw the smaller roots back  into the holes from which they were taken  and to leave them to  chance  i have no doubt that  with proper care and cultivation  any  quantity might be produced  when we visited the island  we purchased  the prepared arrow root at   d   per lb   and a missionary there  informed us  that he would engage to procure any given quantity at        d   per lb   which is  i believe  much less than it can be  purchased at either in the east or the west indies  its quality is  excellent  i should say equal to that of the east indies  and far  superior to that of chile  with which i have since my return  had an  opportunity of comparing it                                                     notes

of piracy in the middle ages    a pirate  in a well armed   quick sailing vessel  must feel  i suppose  the enjoyments of his  exemption from control more exquisitely than any other free booter   and  darting along the bosom of the ocean  under the impartial  radiance of the heavens  may deride the dark concealments and hurried  nights of the forest robber  his occupation is indeed extinguished by  the civilization of later ages  or confined to distant climates  but  in the   th or   th centuries  a rich vessel was never secure from  attack  and neither restitution nor punishment of the criminals was to  be obtained from governments  who sometimes feared the plunderer  and  sometimes connived at the offence                                                    good effects of salt       salt appears to be a necessary and universal stimulus to animated  beings  and its effects upon the vegetable as well as animal kingdom  have furnished objects of the most interesting inquiry to the  physiologist  the chemist  the physician  and the agriculturist  it  appears to be a natural stimulant to the digestive organs of all  warm blooded animals  and that they are instinctively led to immense  distances in pursuit of it  this is strikingly exemplified in the  avidity with which animals in a wild state seek the salt pans of  africa and america  and in the difficulties they will encounter to  reach them  this cannot arise from accident or caprice  but from a  powerful instinct  which  beyond control  compels them to seek  at all  risks  that which is salubrious  to those who are anxious to gain  further information upon this curious subject  i would recommend the  perusal of a work entitled   thoughts on the laws relating to salt     by samuel parkes  esq   and a small volume by my late lamented friend  sir thomas bernard  on the   case of the salt duties  with proofs and  illustrations    we are all sensible of the effect of salt on the  human body  we know how unpalatable fresh meat and vegetables are  without it  during the course of my professional practice  i have had  frequent opportunities of witnessing the evils which have attended an  abstinance from salt  in my examination before a committee of the  house of commons in       appointed for the purpose of inquiring into  the laws respecting the salt duties  i stated  from my own experience   the bad effects of a diet of unsalted fish  and the injury which the  poorer classes  in many districts  sustained in their health from an  inability to procure this essential condiment  i had some years ago a  gentleman of rank and fortune under my care  for a deranged state of  the digestive organs  accompanied with extreme emaciation  i found  that  from some cause which he could not explain  he had never eaten  any salt with his meals  i enforced the necessity of his taking it in  moderate quantities  and the recovery of his digestive powers was soon  evinced in the increase of his strength and condition  one of the ill  effects produced by an unsalted diet is the generation of worms  mr   marshall has published the case of a lady who had a natural antipathy  to salt  and was in consequence most dreadfully infested with worms  during the whole of her life     london medical and physical journal    vol  xxix  no        in ireland  where  from the bad quality of the  food  the lower classes are greatly infested with worms  a draught of  salt and water is a popular and efficacious anthelmintic  lord  somerville  in his address to the board of agriculture  gave an  interesting account of the effects of a punishment which formerly  existed in holland   the ancient laws of the country ordained men to  be kept on bread alone  unmixed with salt  as the severest punishment  that could be inflicted upon them in their moist climate  the effect  was horrible  these wretched criminals are said to have been devoured  by worms engendered in their own stomachs   the wholesomeness and  digestibility of our bread are undoubtedly much promoted by the  addition of salt which it so universally receives      dr  paris  quoted in the doctor

the system in which  its usual actions or perceptions are either interrupted or attended  with pain  this state is called disease  every animal carries within  itself the germ of its own destruction  or  in other words  it is  formed for a limited existence  many diseases  therefore arise  spontaneously  or without any assignable external cause  but many more  are produced by causes  over which we have some control  and perhaps  the chief source of the physical ills to which we are liable  is the  deviation we make from the simplicity of nature  the injurious  influence that domestication has upon the health of the lower animals  is very strikingly apparent  and in proportion as their subjugation is  more complete  and their manner of life differs more widely from that  which is natural to them  so are their diseases more numerous and  severe  the diseases of our more valuable domestic animals are  sufficiently numerous and important to employ a particular class of  men  and the horse

lady blessington s conversations        of love he had strange notions  he said that most people had  le  besoin d aimer   and that with this  besoin  the first person who fell  in one s way contented one  he maintained that those who possessed the  most imagination  poets for example  were most likely to be constant  in their attachments  as with the  beau ideal  in their heads  with  which they identified the object of their attachment  they had nothing  to desire  and viewed their mistresses through the brilliant medium of  fancy  instead of the common one of the eyes   a poet  therefore  said  byron   endows the person he loves with all the charms with which his  mind is stored  and has no need of actual beauty to fill up the  picture  hence he should select a woman  who is rather good looking  than beautiful  leaving the latter for those who  having no  imagination  require actual beauty to satisfy their tastes  and after  all  said he   where is the actual beauty that can come up to the  bright  imaginings  of the poet  where can one see women that equal  the visions  half mortal  half angelic  that people his fancy  love   who is painted blind  an allegory that proves the uselessness of  beauty   can supply all deficiencies with his aid  we can invest her  whom we admire with all the attributes of loveliness  and though time  may steal the roses from her cheek  and the lustre from her eye  still  the original  beau ideal  remains  filling the mind and intoxicating  the soul with the overpowering presence of loveliness  i flatter  myself that my leila  zuleika  gulnare  medora  and haidee will always  vouch for my taste in beauty  these are the bright creations of my  fancy  with rounded forms  and delicacy of limbs  nearly so  incompatible as to be rarely if ever united  for where  with some rare  exceptions  do we see roundness of contour accompanied by lightness   and those fairy hands and feet that are at once the type of beauty and  refinement  i like to shut myself up  close my eyes  and fancy one of  the creatures of my imagination  with taper and rose tipped fingers   playing with my hair  touching my cheek  or resting its little  snowy dimpled hand on mine  i like to fancy the fairy foot  round and  pulpy  but small to diminutiveness  peeping from beneath the drapery  that half conceals it  or moving in the mazes of the dance  i detest  thin women  and unfortunately all  or nearly all plump women  have  clumsy hands and feet  so that i am obliged to have recourse to  imagination for my beauties  and there i always find them  i can so  well understand the lover leaving his mistress that he might write to  her  i should leave mine  not to write to  but to think of her  to  dress her up in the habiliments of my ideal beauty  investing her with  all the charms of the latter  and then adoring the idol i had formed   you must have observed that i give my heroines extreme refinement   joined to great simplicity and want of education  now  refinement and  want of education are incompatible  at least i have ever found them  so  so here again  you see  i am forced to have recourse to  imagination  and certainly it furnishes me with creatures as unlike  the sophisticated beings of civilized existence  as they are to the  still less tempting  coarse realities of vulgar life  in short  i am  of opinion that poets do not require great beauty in the objects of  their affection  all that is necessary for them is a strong and  devoted attachment from the object  and where this exists  joined to  health and good temper  little more is required  at least in early  youth  though with advancing years  men become more  exigeants     talking of the difference between love in early youth and in maturity   byron

     umbrellas  in my youth  were not ordinary things  few but the  macaronis of the day  as the dandies were then called  would venture  to display them  for a long while it was not usual for men to carry  them without incurring the brand of effeminacy  and they were vulgarly  considered as the characteristics of a person whom the mob hugely  disliked  namely  a mincing frenchman  at first  a single umbrella  seems to have been kept at a coffee house for some extraordinary  occasion  lent as a coach or chair in a heavy shower  but not commonly  carried by the walkers  the female tatler

umbrella carried by a man was  obviously then considered as extreme effeminacy  as late as in        one john macdonald  a footman  who has written his own life  informs  us that when he used  a fine silk umbrella  which he had brought from  spain  he could not with any comfort to himself use it  the people  calling out  frenchman  why don t you get a coach    the fact was that  the hackney coachmen and the chairmen  joining with the true  esprit  de corps   were clamorous against this portentous rival  this footman   in       gives us further information   at this time there were no  umbrellas wore in london  except in noblemen s and gentlemen s houses   where there was a large one hung in the hall to hold over a lady or a  gentleman  if it rained between the door and their carriage   his  sister was compelled to quit his arm one day from the abuse he drew  down on himself and his umbrella  but he adds  that  he persisted for  three months till they took no further notice of this novelty   foreigners began to use theirs  and then the english  now it is become  a great trade in london   this footman  if he does not arrogate too  much to his own confidence  was

any other rural mischief done by night  it  was immediately fathered upon a neighbouring tent of  the dark race    no further evidence was required than the pot boiling on stick  transverse  no one hesitated to conclude that the said pot contained  the  corpus delicti   that the individual missing cock was there  parboiling  and that the swarthy race lolling around the fire  or  peeping from beneath the canvass roof  were resting from the unholy  labours of the night  crime  however  has made such rapid marches that  it has long been seen that the gipsies could not perpetrate the whole  of it  and now it is pretty clear they are  and probably have always  been  innocent of the whole of it  it is an event of extreme rarity to  see a gipsy in a court of justice  and we have reason to believe that  it has come to pass that farmers entertain a belief that the tent of  the wanderer  with its nightly blaze and its dark shadows flitting  about it  is a protection to their property  there is every  probability in favour of the justice of this character  the life of  the gipsy is not unlucrative  his wants are few and coarse  and the  calls upon him are scarcely any  he pays no rent  he is exempt from  taxes  he spends nothing in the luxury of attire  no man can bring him  in a bill  being himself a mender and universal repairer  he is under  the necessity of demanding no man s aid  his horse or his ass feeds on  nature s common  the hedge side  the waste corner  the forest thicket   well known and long haunted by him and his tribe  gipsies are subject  to few diseases  they seldom ask the doctor s assistance but for one  friendly office  and that serves a man his lifetime  the open air  the  inconstancy of their labour  the sufficiency of their food  and the  quantity of healthy exercise  necessarily render these arabs of  civilization the healthiest part of the people  as the monks of old  always managed to select a happy site for their establishments  so  does the gipsy always contrive to fix upon a pleasant and healthy spot  for the pitching of his tent  it is sure to be near a brook for the  supply of fresh water for the pot  and a washing place for the family  rags  it generally lies under the shelter of some umbrageous tree  it  will always be found to have a view of the road  and invariably placed  on the edge of some nice short and sweet morsel of grass for the  recreation of the quadrupeds of the party     the character of the gipsy has not been well understood  it is  altogether oriental  he is quiet  patient  sober  long suffering   pleasant in speech  indolent but handy  far from speculative  and yet  good at succedaneum  when his anger is kindled  it descends like  lightning  unlike his dog  his wrath gives no notice by grumbling  he  blazes up like one of his own fires of dried fern  quarrels do not  often take place among them  but when they do  they are dreadful  the  laws of the country in which they sojourn have so far banished the use  of knives from among them that they only grind them  otherwise these  conflicts would always be fatal  they fight like tigers with tooth and  nail  and knee and toe  and seem animated only with the spirit of  daemonism  luckily the worst weapon they use is a stick  and  if the  devil tempts  a hedge stake     we have been put in mind to say something of the gipsies by having  witnessed the consequences of one of these affrays  which has brought  us still better acquainted with these singular people  a quarrel  originating in jealousy had produced results of the most serious  nature  a blow on the head with a tent pole had evidently produced  concussion of the brain if not fracture  and the victim was lying on  his straw bed in a state of profound coma  the tent was tripartite   being formed of three main tops meeting in a centre  one was sacred to  the women  the gynekeion of the greeks  the anderoon of the persians   in the others were collected the whole faction of the dying man  nine  or ten swarthy but handsome countenances were anxiously watching the  struggling breath of their unhappy comrade  some sobbing  some  grief stricken  some sombre  none savage  an old crone was  administering ineffectual milk  perhaps the very woman who had found  the same fluid so nutritious some thirty years ago  before  or rather   under her lay as noble a form as nature ever moulded  with a fine  dark  but thoroughly indian face  covered with the clammy sweat of  apoplectic death  there was no want of light  the fire at the mouth  every now and then sent in a volume of illumination  and when the  medical men arrived there was scarcely a hand that did not contain a  candle in the hope of aiding their investigation  the man died on the  fourth day  the surgeons were compelled to mangle him in their search  for a fracture  after his death justice demanded a still further  investigation of the corpse  and yet during all these trying  circumstances an important witness can declare that the behaviour of  the supposed lawless people was not merely decent  it was more than  exemplary  it was delicate  tender  nay  refined  it was moreover  exempt from prejudice  at the same time that it was full of feeling   were the details in place here  it would perhaps be allowed that few  brighter examples of friendship and right feeling were to be found  than in this instance occurred among the  dark race   as they call  themselves      new monthly magazine                                                      the gatherer

violet virtue should ever dwell with honour  and  that such an aspiring fume as pride is  should ever sojourn with a  constant baseness  it is sure  we seldom find it  but in such as being  conscious of their own deficiency  think there is no way to get honour  but by a bold assuming it  if you search for high and strained  carriages  you shall for the most part meet with them in low men   arrogance is a weed that ever grows in a dunghill  it is from the  rankness of that soil that she hath her height and spreadings  witness  clowns  fools  and fellows that from nothing are lifted some few steps  upon fortune s ladder  where  seeing the glorious representment of  honour above  they are so greedy of embracing  that they strive to  leap thither at once  so by overreaching themselves in the way  they  fail of the end  and fall  and all this happiness  either for want of  education  which should season their minds with the generous precepts  of morality  or  which is more powerful  example  or else for lack of  a discerning judgment  which will tell them that the best way thither   is to go about by humility and desert  otherwise the river of contempt  runs betwixt them and it  and if they go not by these passages  they  must of necessity either turn back with shame  or suffer in the  desperate venture  of trees  i observe  god hath chosen the vine  a  low plant that creeps

 nothing procureth love like humility  nothing hate  like pride  the  proud man walks among daggers pointed against him  whereas the humble  and the affable  have the people for their guard in dangers  to be  humble to our superiors  is duty  to our equals  courtesy  to our  inferiors  nobleness  which for all her lowness  carries such a sway  that she may command their souls  but we must take heed  we express it  not in unworthy actions  for then leaving virtue  it falls into  disdained baseness  which is the undoubtable badge of one that will  betray society  so far as a man  both in words and deeds  may be free  from flattery and unmanly cowardice  he may be humble with  commendation  but surely no circumstance can make the expression of  pride laudable  if ever it be  it is when it meets with audacious  pride  and conquers  of this good it may then be author  that the  affronting man  by his own folly  may learn the way to his duty and  wit  yet this i cannot so well call pride  as an emulation of the  divine justice  which will always vindicate itself upon presumptuous  ones  and is indeed said to fight against no sin but pride      w g c

and not an exclusive gathering   and the task of selection and revision brings home to me with something of  the effect of discovery that i was once an industrious writer of short  stories  and that i am no longer anything of the kind  i have not written  one now for quite a long time  and in the past five or six years i have  made scarcely one a year  the bulk of the fifty or sixty tales from which  this present three and thirty have been chosen dates from the last  century  this edition is more definitive than i supposed when first i  arranged for it  in the presence of so conclusive an ebb and cessation an  almost obituary manner seems justifiable     i find it a little difficult to disentangle the causes that have  restricted the flow of these inventions  it has happened  i remark  to  others as well as to myself  and in spite of the kindliest encouragement  to continue from editors and readers  there was a time when life bubbled  with short stories  they were always coming to the surface of my mind  and  it is no deliberate change of will that has thus restricted my production   it is rather  i think  a diversion of attention to more sustained and more  exacting forms  it was my friend mr  c l  hind who set that spring going   he urged me to write short stories for the  pall mall budget   and  persuaded me by his simple and buoyant conviction that i could do what he  desired  there existed at the time only the little sketch   the jilting of  jane   included in this volume  at least  that is the only tolerable  fragment of fiction i find surviving from my pre lewis hind period  but i  set myself  so encouraged  to the experiment of inventing moving and  interesting things that could be given vividly in the little space of  eight or ten such pages as this  and for a time i found it a very  entertaining pursuit indeed  mr  hind s indicating finger had shown me an  amusing possibility of the mind  i found that  taking almost anything as a  starting point and letting my thoughts play about it  there would  presently come out of the darkness  in a manner quite inexplicable  some  absurd or vivid little incident more or less relevant to that initial  nucleus  little men in canoes upon sunlit oceans would come floating out  of nothingness  incubating the eggs of prehistoric monsters unawares   violent conflicts would break out amidst the flower beds of suburban  gardens  i would discover i was peering into remote and mysterious worlds  ruled by an order logical indeed but other than our common sanity     the  nineties was a good and stimulating period for a short story writer   mr  kipling had made his astonishing advent with a series of little  blue grey books  whose covers opened like window shutters to reveal  the dusty sun glare and blazing colours of the east  mr  barrie had  demonstrated what could be done in a little space through the panes of his   window in thrums   the  national observer  was at the climax of  its career of heroic insistence upon lyrical brevity and a vivid finish   and mr  frank harris was not only printing good short stories by other  people  but writing still better ones himself in the dignified pages of  the  fortnightly review  longman s magazine   too  represented a   clientele  of appreciative short story readers that is now  scattered  then came the generous opportunities of the  yellow book    and the  national observer  died only to give birth to the  new  review   no short story of the slightest distinction went for long  unrecognised  the sixpenny popular magazines had still to deaden down the  conception of what a short story might be to the imaginative limitation of  the common reader  and a maximum length of six thousand words  short  stories broke out everywhere  kipling was writing short stories  barrie   stevenson  frank harris  max beerbohm wrote at least one perfect one   the  happy hypocrite   henry james pursued his wonderful and inimitable bent   and among other names that occur to me  like a mixed handful of jewels  drawn from a bag  are george street  morley roberts  george gissing  ella  d arcy  murray gilchrist  e  nesbit  stephen crane  joseph conrad  edwin  pugh  jerome k  jerome  kenneth graham  arthur morrison  marriott watson   george moore  grant allen  george egerton  henry harland  pett ridge  w   w  jacobs  who alone seems inexhaustible   i dare say i could recall as  many more names with a little effort  i may be succumbing to the  infirmities of middle age  but i do not think the present decade can  produce any parallel to this list  or what is more remarkable  that the  later achievements in this field of any of the survivors from that time   with the sole exception of joseph conrad  can compare with the work they  did before       it seems to me this outburst of short stories came not  only as a phase in literary development  but also as a phase in the  development of the individual writers concerned     it is now quite unusual to see any adequate criticism of short stories in  english  i do not know how far the decline in short story writing may not  be due to that  every sort of artist demands human responses  and few men  can contrive to write merely for a publisher s cheque and silence  however  reassuring that cheque may be  a mad millionaire who commissioned  masterpieces to burn would find it impossible to buy them  scarcely any  artist will hesitate in the choice between money and attention  and it was  primarily for that last and better sort of pay that the short stories of  the  nineties were written  people talked about them tremendously   compared them  and ranked them  that was the thing that mattered     it was not  of course  all good talk  and we suffered then  as now  from  the  a priori  critic  just as nowadays he goes about declaring that  the work of such and such a dramatist is all very amusing and delightful   but  it isn t a play   so we  had a great deal of talk about  the   short story  and found ourselves measured by all kinds of arbitrary  standards  there was a tendency to treat the short story as though it was  as definable a form as the sonnet  instead of being just exactly what any  one of courage and imagination can get told in twenty minutes  reading or  so  it was either mr  edward garnett or mr  george moore in a violently  anti kipling mood who invented the distinction between the short story and  the anecdote  the short story was maupassant  the anecdote was damnable   it was a quite infernal comment in its way  because it permitted no  defence  fools caught it up and used it freely  nothing is so destructive  in a field of artistic effort as a stock term of abuse  anyone could say  of any short story   a mere anecdote   just as anyone can say   incoherent   of any novel or of any sonata that isn t studiously  monotonous  the recession of enthusiasm for this compact  amusing form is  closely associated in my mind with that discouraging imputation  one felt  hopelessly open to a paralysing and unanswerable charge  and one s ease  and happiness in the garden of one s fancies was more and more marred by  the dread of it  it crept into one s mind  a distress as vague and  inexpugnable as a sea fog on a spring morning  and presently one shivered  and wanted to go indoors   it is the absurd fate of the imaginative writer  that he should be thus sensitive to atmospheric conditions     but after one has died as a maker one may still live as a critic  and i  will confess i am all for laxness and variety in this as in every field of  art  insistence upon rigid forms and austere unities seems to me the  instinctive reaction of the sterile against the fecund  it is the tired  man with a headache who values a work of art for what it does not contain   i suppose it is the lot of every critic nowadays to suffer from  indigestion and a fatigued appreciation  and to develop a self protective  tendency towards rules that will reject  as it were  automatically the  more abundant and irregular forms  but this world is not for the weary   and in the long run it is the new and variant that matter  i refuse  altogether to recognise any hard and fast type for the short story  any  more than i admit any limitation upon the liberties of the small picture   the short story is a fiction that may be read in something under an hour   and so that it is moving and delightful  it does not matter whether it is  as  trivial  as a japanese print of insects seen closely between grass  stems  or as spacious as the prospect of the plain of italy from monte  mottarone  it does not matter whether it is human or inhuman  or whether  it leaves you thinking deeply or radiantly but superficially pleased  some  things are more easily done as short stories than others and more  abundantly done  but one of the many pleasures of short story writing is  to achieve the impossible     at any rate  that is the present writer s conception of the art of the  short story  as the jolly art of making something very bright and moving   it may be horrible or pathetic or funny or beautiful or profoundly  illuminating  having only this essential  that it should take from fifteen  to fifty minutes to read aloud  all the rest is just whatever invention  and imagination and the mood can give  a vision of buttered slides on a  busy day or of unprecedented worlds  in that spirit of miscellaneous  expectation these stories should be received  each is intended to be a  thing by itself  and if it is not too ungrateful to kindly and  enterprising publishers  i would confess i would much prefer to see each  printed expensively alone  and left in a little brown paper cover to lie  about a room against the needs of a quite casual curiosity  and i would  rather this volume were found in the bedrooms of convalescents and in  dentists  parlours and railway trains than in gentlemen s studies  i would  rather have it dipped in and dipped in again than read severely through   essentially it is a miscellany of inventions  many of which were very  pleasant to write  and its end is more than attained if some of them are  refreshing and agreeable to read  i have now re read them all  and i am  glad to think i wrote them  i like them  but i cannot tell how much the  associations of old happinesses gives them a flavour for me  i make no  claims for them and no apology  they will be read as long as people read  them  things written either live or die  unless it be for a place of  judgment upon academic impostors  there is no apologetic intermediate  state     i may add that i have tried to set a date to most of these stories  but  that they are not arranged in strictly chronological order     h  g  wells         contents

brush and dust pan  she used in the old days to sing  hymn tunes  or the british national song for the time being  to these  instruments  but latterly she has been silent and even careful over her  work  time was when i prayed with fervour for such silence  and my wife  with sighs for such care  but now they have come we are not so glad as we  might have anticipated we should be  indeed  i would rejoice secretly   though it may be unmanly weakness to admit it  even to hear jane sing   daisy   or  by the fracture of any plate but one of euphemia s best green  ones  to learn that the period of brooding has come to an end     yet how we longed to hear the last of jane s young man before we heard the  last of him  jane was always very free with her conversation to my wife   and discoursed admirably in the kitchen on a variety of topics  so well   indeed  that i sometimes left my study door open  our house is a small  one  to partake of it  but after william came  it was always william   nothing but william  william this and william that  and when we thought  william was worked out and exhausted altogether  then william all over  again  the engagement lasted altogether three years  yet how she got  introduced to william  and so became thus saturated with him  was always a  secret  for my part  i believe it was at the street corner where the rev   barnabas baux used to hold an open air service after evensong on sundays   young cupids were wont to flit like moths round the paraffin flare of that  centre of high church hymn singing  i fancy she stood singing hymns there   out of memory and her imagination  instead of coming home to get supper   and william came up beside her and said   hello    hello yourself   she  said  and etiquette being satisfied  they proceeded to talk together     as euphemia has a reprehensible way of letting her servants talk to her   she soon heard of him   he is  such  a respectable young man  ma am    said jane   you don t know   ignoring the slur cast on her acquaintance   my wife inquired further about this william      he is second porter at maynard s  the draper s   said jane   and gets  eighteen shillings  nearly a pound  a week  m m  and when the head porter  leaves he will be head porter  his relatives are quite superior people   m m  not labouring people at all  his father was a greengrosher  m m  and  had a churnor  and he was bankrup  twice  and one of his sisters is in a  home for the dying  it will be a very good match for me  m m   said jane    me being an orphan girl       then you are engaged to him   asked my wife      not engaged  ma am  but he is saving money to buy a ring  hammyfist       well  jane  when you are properly engaged to him you may ask him round  here on sunday afternoons  and have tea with him in the kitchen   for my  euphemia has a motherly conception of her duty towards her maid servants   and presently the amethystine ring was being worn about the house  even  with ostentation  and jane developed a new way of bringing in the joint so  that this gage was evident  the elder miss maitland was aggrieved by it   and told my wife that servants ought not to wear rings  but my wife looked  it up in  enquire within  and  mrs  motherly s book of household  management   and found no prohibition  so jane remained with this  happiness added to her love     the treasure of jane s heart appeared to me to be what respectable people  call a very deserving young man   william  ma am   said jane one day  suddenly  with ill concealed complacency  as she counted out the beer  bottles   william  ma am  is a teetotaller  yes  m m  and he don t smoke   smoking  ma am   said jane  as one who reads the heart    do  make  such a dust about  beside the waste of money   and  the smell   however  i suppose they got to do it  some of them        william was at first a rather shabby young man of the ready made black  coat school of costume  he had watery gray eyes  and a complexion  appropriate to the brother of one in a home for the dying  euphemia did  not fancy him very much  even at the beginning  his eminent respectability  was vouched for by an alpaca umbrella  from which he never allowed himself  to be parted      he goes to chapel   said jane   his papa  ma am          his  what   jane       his papa  ma am  was church  but mr  maynard is a plymouth brother  and  william thinks it policy  ma am  to go there too  mr  maynard comes and  talks to him quite friendly when they ain t busy  about using up all the  ends of string  and about his soul  he takes a lot of notice  do mr   maynard  of william  and the way he saves his soul  ma am      presently we heard that the head porter at maynard s had left  and that  william was head porter at twenty three shillings a week   he is really  kind of over the man who drives the van   said jane   and him married   with three children   and she promised in the pride of her heart to make  interest for us with william to favour us so that we might get our parcels  of drapery from maynard s with exceptional promptitude     after this promotion a rapidly increasing prosperity came upon jane s  young man  one day we learned that mr  maynard had given william a book     smiles   elp yourself   it s called   said jane   but it ain t comic  it  tells you how to get on in the world  and some what william read to me was   lovely   ma am      euphemia told me of this  laughing  and then she became suddenly grave    do you know  dear   she said   jane said one thing i did not like  she  had been quiet for a minute  and then she suddenly remarked   william is a  lot above me  ma am  ain t he        i don t see anything in that   i said  though later my eyes were to be  opened     one sunday afternoon about that time i was sitting at my writing desk    possibly i was reading a good book  when a something went by the window  i  heard a startled exclamation behind me  and saw euphemia with her hands  clasped together and her eyes dilated   george   she said in an  awe stricken whisper   did you see      then we both spoke to one another at the same moment  slowly and solemnly     a silk hat  yellow gloves  a new umbrella        it may be my fancy  dear   said euphemia   but his tie was very like  yours  i believe jane keeps him in ties  she told me a little while ago   in a way that implied volumes about the rest of your costume   the master   do  wear pretty ties  ma am   and he echoes all your novelties      the young couple passed our window again on their way to their customary  walk  they were arm in arm  jane looked exquisitely proud  happy  and  uncomfortable  with new white cotton gloves  and william  in the silk hat   singularly genteel     that was the culmination of jane s happiness  when she returned   mr   maynard has been talking to william  ma am   she said   and he is to serve  customers  just like the young shop gentlemen  during the next sale  and  if he gets on  he is to be made an assistant  ma am  at the first  opportunity  he has got to be as gentlemanly as he can  ma am  and if he  ain t  ma am  he says it won t be for want of trying  mr  maynard has took  a great fancy to him       he  is  getting on  jane   said my wife      yes  ma am   said jane thoughtfully   he  is  getting on      and she sighed     that next sunday as i drank my tea i interrogated my wife   how is this  sunday different from all other sundays  little woman  what has happened   have you altered the curtains  or re arranged the furniture  or where is  the indefinable difference of it  are you wearing your hair in a new way  without warning me  i perceive a change clearly  and i cannot for the life  of me say what it is      then my wife answered in her most tragic voice   george   she said   that  william has not come near the place to day  and jane is crying her heart  out upstairs      there followed a period of silence  jane  as i have said  stopped singing  about the house  and began to care for our brittle possessions  which  struck my wife as being a very sad sign indeed  the next sunday  and the  next  jane asked to go out   to walk with william   and my wife  who never  attempts to extort confidences  gave her permission  and asked no  questions  on each occasion jane came back looking flushed and very  determined  at last one day she became communicative      william is being led away   she remarked abruptly  with a catching of the  breath  apropos of tablecloths   yes  m m  she is a milliner  and she can  play on the piano       i thought   said my wife   that you went out with him on sunday       not out with him  m m  after him  i walked along by the side of them  and  told her he was engaged to me       dear me  jane  did you  what did they do       took no more notice of me than if i was dirt  so i told her she should  suffer for it       it could not have been a very agreeable walk  jane       not for no parties  ma am       i wish   said jane   i could play the piano  ma am  but anyhow  i don t  mean to let  her  get him away from me  she s older than him  and her  hair ain t gold to the roots  ma am      it was on the august bank holiday that the crisis came  we do not clearly  know the details of the fray  but only such fragments as poor jane let  fall  she came home dusty  excited  and with her heart hot within her     the milliner s mother  the milliner  and william had made a party to the  art museum at south kensington  i think  anyhow  jane had calmly but  firmly accosted them somewhere in the streets  and asserted her right to  what  in spite of the consensus of literature  she held to be her  inalienable property  she did  i think  go so far as to lay hands on him   they dealt with her in a crushingly superior way  they  called a cab    there was a  scene   william being pulled away into the four wheeler by  his future wife and mother in law from the reluctant hands of our  discarded jane  there were threats of giving her  in charge       my poor jane   said my wife  mincing veal as though she was mincing  william   it s a shame of them  i would think no more of him  he is not  worthy of you       no  m m   said jane   he  is  weak      but it s that woman has done it   said jane  she was never known to bring  herself to pronounce  that woman s  name or to admit her girlishness   i  can t think what minds some women must have  to try and get a girl s young  man away from her  but there  it only hurts to talk about it   said jane     thereafter our house rested from william  but there was something in the  manner of jane s scrubbing the front doorstep or sweeping out the rooms  a  certain viciousness  that persuaded me that the story had not yet ended      please  m m  may i go and see a wedding tomorrow   said jane one day     my wife knew by instinct whose wedding   do you think it is wise  jane    she said      i would like to see the last of him   said jane      my dear   said my wife  fluttering into my room about twenty minutes  after jane had started   jane has been to the boot hole and taken all the  left off boots and shoes  and gone off to the wedding with them in a bag   surely she cannot mean        jane   i said   is developing character  let us hope for the best      jane came back with a pale  hard face  all the boots seemed to be still in  her bag  at which my wife heaved a premature sigh of relief  we heard her  go upstairs and replace the boots with considerable emphasis      quite a crowd at the wedding  ma am   she said presently  in a purely  conversational style  sitting in our little kitchen  and scrubbing the  potatoes   and such a lovely day for them   she proceeded to numerous  other details  clearly avoiding some cardinal incident      it was all extremely respectable and nice  ma am  but  her  father  didn t wear a black coat  and looked quite out of place  ma am  mr   piddingquirk         who        mr  piddingquirk  william that was  ma am  had white gloves  and a coat  like a clergyman  and a lovely chrysanthemum  he looked so nice  ma am   and there was red carpet down  just like for gentlefolks  and they say he  gave the clerk four shillings  ma am  it was a real kerridge they had  not  a fly  when they came out of church there was rice throwing  and her two  little sisters dropping dead flowers  and someone threw a slipper  and  then i threw a boot        threw a  boot   jane       yes  ma am  aimed at her  but it hit  him   yes  ma am  hard  gev  him a black eye  i should think  i only threw that one  i hadn t the heart  to try again  all the little boys cheered when it hit him      after an interval   i am sorry the boot hit  him       another pause  the potatoes were being scrubbed violently   he always   was  a bit above me  you know  ma am  and he was led away      the potatoes were more than finished  jane rose sharply with a sigh  and  rapped the basin down on the table      i don t care   she said   i don t care a rap  he will find out his  mistake yet  it serves me right  i was stuck up about him  i ought not to  have looked so high  and i am glad things are as things are      my wife was in the kitchen  seeing to the higher cookery  after the  confession of the boot throwing  she must have watched poor jane fuming  with a certain dismay in those brown eyes of hers  but i imagine they  softened again very quickly  and then jane s must have met them      oh  ma am   said jane  with an astonishing change of note   think of all  that  might  have been  oh  ma am  i  could  have been so happy   i ought to have known  but i didn t know   you re very kind to let me talk  to you  ma am   for it s hard on me  ma am   it s har r r r d       and i gather that euphemia so far forgot herself as to let jane sob out  some of the fullness of her heart on a sympathetic shoulder  my euphemia   thank heaven  has never properly grasped the importance of  keeping up her  position   and since that fit of weeping  much of the accent of bitterness  has gone out of jane s scrubbing and brush work     indeed  something passed the other day with the butcher boy  but that  scarcely belongs to this story  however  jane is young still  and time and  change are at work with her  we all have our sorrows  but i do not believe  very much in the existence of sorrows that never heal             ii       the cone       the night was hot and overcast  the sky red rimmed with the lingering  sunset of midsummer  they sat at the open window  trying to fancy the air  was fresher there  the trees and shrubs of the garden stood stiff and  dark  beyond in the roadway a gas lamp burnt  bright orange against the  hazy blue of the evening  farther were the three lights of the railway  signal against the lowering sky  the man and woman spoke to one another in  low tones      he does not suspect   said the man  a little nervously      not he   she said peevishly  as though that too irritated her   he  thinks of nothing but the works and the prices of fuel  he has no  imagination  no poetry       none of these men of iron have   he said sententiously   they have no  hearts        he  has not   she said  she turned her discontented face towards  the window  the distant sound of a roaring and rushing drew nearer and  grew in volume  the house quivered  one heard the metallic rattle of the  tender  as the train passed  there was a glare of light above the cutting  and a driving tumult of smoke  one  two  three  four  five  six  seven   eight black oblongs  eight trucks  passed across the dim grey of the  embankment  and were suddenly extinguished one by one in the throat of the  tunnel  which  with the last  seemed to swallow down train  smoke  and  sound in one abrupt gulp      this country was all fresh and beautiful once   he said   and now  it is  gehenna  down that way  nothing but pot banks and chimneys belching fire  and dust into the face of heaven   but what does it matter  an end comes   an end to all this cruelty    to morrow    he spoke the last word in  a whisper       to morrow    she said  speaking in a whisper too  and still staring  out of the window      dear   he said  putting his hand on hers     she turned with a start  and their eyes searched one another s  hers  softened to his gaze   my dear one   she said  and then   it seems so  strange  that you should have come into my life like this  to open    she  paused      to open   he said      all this wonderful world   she hesitated  and spoke still more softly     this world of  love  to me      then suddenly the door clicked and closed  they turned their heads  and he  started violently back  in the shadow of the room stood a great shadowy  figure silent  they saw the face dimly in the half light  with  unexpressive dark patches under the pent house brows  every muscle in  raut s body suddenly became tense  when could the door have opened  what  had he heard  had he heard all  what had he seen  a tumult of questions     the new comer s voice came at last  after a pause that seemed  interminable   well   he said      i was afraid i had missed you  horrocks   said the man at the window   gripping the window ledge with his hand  his voice was unsteady     the clumsy figure of horrocks came forward out of the shadow  he made no  answer to raut s remark  for a moment he stood above them     the woman s heart was cold within her   i told mr  raut it was just  possible you might come back   she said in a voice that never quivered     horrocks  still silent  sat down abruptly in the chair by her little  work table  his big hands were clenched  one saw now the fire of his eyes  under the shadow of his brows  he was trying to get his breath  his eyes  went from the woman he had trusted to the friend he had trusted  and then  back to the woman     by this time and for the moment all three half understood one another   yet none dared say a word to ease the pent up things that choked them     it was the husband s voice that broke the silence at last      you wanted to see me   he said to raut     raut started as he spoke   i came to see you   he said  resolved to lie to  the last      yes   said horrocks      you promised   said raut   to show me some fine effects of moonlight and  smoke       i promised to show you some fine effects of moonlight and smoke    repeated horrocks in a colourless voice      and i thought i might catch you to night before you went down to the  works   proceeded raut   and come with you      there was another pause  did the man mean to take the thing coolly  did  he  after all  know  how long had he been in the room  yet even at the  moment when they heard the door  their attitudes     horrocks glanced at  the profile of the woman  shadowy pallid in the half light  then he  glanced at raut  and seemed to recover himself suddenly   of course   he  said   i promised to show you the works under their proper dramatic  conditions  it s odd how i could have forgotten       if i am troubling you    began raut     horrocks started again  a new light had suddenly come into the sultry  gloom of his eyes   not in the least   he said      have you been telling mr  raut of all these contrasts of flame and shadow  you think so splendid   said the woman  turning now to her husband for  the first time  her confidence creeping back again  her voice just one  half note too high   that dreadful theory of yours that machinery is  beautiful  and everything else in the world ugly  i thought he would not  spare you  mr  raut  it s his great theory  his one discovery in art       i am slow to make discoveries   said horrocks grimly  damping her  suddenly   but what i discover      he stopped      well   she said      nothing   and suddenly he rose to his feet      i promised to show you the works   he said to raut  and put his big   clumsy hand on his friend s shoulder   and you are ready to go       quite   said raut  and stood up also     there was another pause  each of them peered through the indistinctness of  the dusk at the other two     horrocks  hand still rested on raut s shoulder  raut half fancied still  that the incident was trivial after all  but mrs  horrocks knew her  husband better  knew that grim quiet in his voice  and the confusion in  her mind took a vague shape of physical evil   very well   said horrocks   and  dropping his hand  turned towards the door      my hat   raut looked round in the half light      that s my work basket   said mrs  horrocks with a gust of hysterical  laughter  their hands came together on the back of the chair   here it  is   he said  she had an impulse to warn him in an undertone  but she  could not frame a word   don t go   and  beware of him   struggled in her  mind  and the swift moment passed      got it   said horrocks  standing with the door half open     raut stepped towards him   better say goodbye to mrs  horrocks   said the  ironmaster  even more grimly quiet in his tone than before     raut started and turned   good evening  mrs  horrocks   he said  and their  hands touched     horrocks held the door open with a ceremonial politeness unusual in him  towards men  raut went out  and then  after a wordless look at her  her  husband followed  she stood motionless while raut s light footfall and her  husband s heavy tread  like bass and treble  passed down the passage  together  the front door slammed heavily  she went to the window  moving  slowly  and stood watching  leaning forward  the two men appeared for a  moment at the gateway in the road  passed under the street lamp  and were  hidden by the black masses of the shrubbery  the lamplight fell for a  moment on their faces  showing only unmeaning pale patches  telling  nothing of what she still feared  and doubted  and craved vainly to know   then she sank down into a crouching attitude in the big arm chair  her  eyes wide open and staring out at the red lights from the furnaces that  flickered in the sky  an hour after she was still there  her attitude  scarcely changed     the oppressive stillness of the evening weighed heavily upon raut  they  went side by side down the road in silence  and in silence turned into the  cinder made byway that presently opened out the prospect of the valley     a blue haze  half dust  half mist  touched the long valley with mystery   beyond were hanley and etruria  grey and dark masses  outlined thinly by  the rare golden dots of the street lamps  and here and there a gas lit  window  or the yellow glare of some late working factory or crowded  public house  out of the masses  clear and slender against the evening  sky  rose a multitude of tall chimneys  many of them reeking  a few  smokeless during a season of  play   here and there a pallid patch and  ghostly stunted beehive shapes showed the position of a pot bank or a  wheel  black and sharp against the hot lower sky  marked some colliery  where they raise the iridescent coal of the place  nearer at hand was the  broad stretch of railway  and half invisible trains shunted  a steady  puffing and rumbling  with every run a ringing concussion and a rhymthic  series of impacts  and a passage of intermittent puffs of white steam  across the further view  and to the left  between the railway and the  dark mass of the low hill beyond  dominating the whole view  colossal   inky black  and crowned with smoke and fitful flames  stood the great  cylinders of the jeddah company blast furnaces  the central edifices of  the big ironworks of which horrocks was the manager  they stood heavy and  threatening  full of an incessant turmoil of flames and seething molten  iron  and about the feet of them rattled the rolling mills  and the  steam hammer beat heavily and splashed the white iron sparks hither and  thither  even as they looked  a truckful of fuel was shot into one of the  giants  and the red flames gleamed out  and a confusion of smoke and black  dust came boiling upwards towards the sky      certainly you get some colour with your furnaces   said raut  breaking a  silence that had become apprehensive     horrocks grunted  he stood with his hands in his pockets  frowning down at  the dim steaming railway and the busy ironworks beyond  frowning as if he  were thinking out some knotty problem     raut glanced at him and away again   at present your moonlight effect is  hardly ripe   he continued  looking upward   the moon is still smothered  by the vestiges of daylight      horrocks stared at him with the expression of a man who has suddenly  awakened   vestiges of daylight      of course  of course   he too looked  up at the moon  pale still in the midsummer sky   come along   he said  suddenly  and gripping raut s arm in his hand  made a move towards the  path that dropped from them to the railway     raut hung back  their eyes met and saw a thousand things in a moment that  their lips came near to say  horrocks s hand tightened and then relaxed   he let go  and before raut was aware of it  they were arm in arm  and  walking  one unwillingly enough  down the path      you see the fine effect of the railway signals towards burslem   said  horrocks  suddenly breaking into loquacity  striding fast and tightening  the grip of his elbow the while   little green lights and red and white  lights  all against the haze  you have an eye for effect  raut  it s fine   and look at those furnaces of mine  how they rise upon us as we come down  the hill  that to the right is my pet  seventy feet of him  i packed him  myself  and he s boiled away cheerfully with iron in his guts for five  long years  i ve a particular fancy for  him   that line of red  there  a lovely bit of warm orange you d call it  raut  that s the  puddlers  furnaces  and there  in the hot light  three black figures  did  you see the white splash of the steam hammer then   that s the rolling  mills  come along  clang  clatter  how it goes rattling across the floor   sheet tin  raut   amazing stuff  glass mirrors are not in it when that  stuff comes from the mill  and  squelch  there goes the hammer again  come  along      he had to stop talking to catch at his breath  his arm twisted into raut s  with benumbing tightness  he had come striding down the black path towards  the railway as though he was possessed  raut had not spoken a word  had  simply hung back against horrocks s pull with all his strength      i say   he said now  laughing nervously  but with an undertone of snarl  in his voice   why on earth are you nipping my arm off  horrocks  and  dragging me along like this      at length horrocks released him  his manner changed again   nipping your  arm off   he said   sorry  but it s you taught me the trick of walking  in that friendly way       you haven t learnt the refinements of it yet then   said raut  laughing  artificially again   by jove  i m black and blue   horrocks offered no  apology  they stood now near the bottom of the hill  close to the fence  that bordered the railway  the ironworks had grown larger and spread out  with their approach  they looked up to the blast furnaces now instead of  down  the further view of etruria and hanley had dropped out of sight with  their descent  before them  by the stile  rose a notice board  bearing   still dimly visible  the words   beware of the trains   half hidden by  splashes of coaly mud      fine effects   said horrocks  waving his arm   here comes a train  the  puffs of smoke  the orange glare  the round eye of light in front of it   the melodious rattle  fine effects  but these furnaces of mine used to be  finer  before we shoved cones in their throats  and saved the gas       how   said raut   cones       cones  my man  cones  i ll show you one nearer  the flames used to flare  out of the open throats  great  what is it   pillars of cloud by day  red  and black smoke  and pillars of fire by night  now we run it off  in  pipes  and burn it to heat the blast  and the top is shut by a cone   you ll be interested in that cone       but every now and then   said raut   you get a burst of fire and smoke up  there       the cone s not fixed  it s hung by a chain from a lever  and balanced by  an equipoise  you shall see it nearer  else  of course  there d be no way  of getting fuel into the thing  every now and then the cone dips  and out  comes the flare       i see   said raut  he looked over his shoulder   the moon gets brighter    he said      come along   said horrocks abruptly  gripping his shoulder again  and  moving him suddenly towards the railway crossing  and then came one of  those swift incidents  vivid  but so rapid that they leave one doubtful  and reeling  half way across  horrocks s hand suddenly clenched upon him  like a vice  and swung him backward and through a half turn  so that he  looked up the line  and there a chain of lamp lit carriage windows  telescoped swiftly as it came towards them  and the red and yellow lights  of an engine grew larger and larger  rushing down upon them  as he grasped  what this meant  he turned his face to horrocks  and pushed with all his  strength against the arm that held him back between the rails  the  struggle did not last a moment  just as certain as it was that horrocks  held him there  so certain was it that he had been violently lugged out of  danger      out of the way   said horrocks with a gasp  as the train came rattling  by  and they stood panting by the gate into the ironworks      i did not see it coming   said raut  still  even in spite of his own  apprehensions  trying to keep up an appearance of ordinary intercourse     horrocks answered with a grunt   the cone   he said  and then  as one who  recovers himself   i thought you did not hear       i didn t   said raut      i wouldn t have had you run over then for the world   said horrocks      for a moment i lost my nerve   said raut     horrocks stood for half a minute  then turned abruptly towards the  ironworks again   see how fine these great mounds of mine  these  clinker heaps  look in the night  that truck yonder  up above there  up  it goes  and out tilts the slag  see the palpitating red stuff go sliding  down the slope  as we get nearer  the heap rises up and cuts the blast  furnaces  see the quiver up above the big one  not that way  this way   between the heaps  that goes to the puddling furnaces  but i want to show  you the canal first   he came and took raut by the elbow  and so they went  along side by side  raut answered horrocks vaguely  what  he asked  himself  had really happened on the line  was he deluding himself with his  own fancies  or had horrocks actually held him back in the way of the  train  had he just been within an ace of being murdered     suppose this slouching  scowling monster  did  know anything  for a  minute or two then raut was really afraid for his life  but the mood  passed as he reasoned with himself  after all  horrocks might have heard  nothing  at any rate  he had pulled him out of the way in time  his odd  manner might be due to the mere vague jealousy he had shown once before   he was talking now of the ash heaps and the canal   eigh   said horrocks      what   said raut   rather  the haze in the moonlight  fine       our canal   said horrocks  stopping suddenly   our canal by moonlight and  firelight is immense  you ve never seen it  fancy that  you ve spent too  many of your evenings philandering up in newcastle there  i tell you  for  real florid quality    but you shall see  boiling water         as they came out of the labyrinth of clinker heaps and mounds of coal and  ore  the noises of the rolling mill sprang upon them suddenly  loud  near   and distinct  three shadowy workmen went by and touched their caps to  horrocks  their faces were vague in the darkness  raut felt a futile  impulse to address them  and before he could frame his words they passed  into the shadows  horrocks pointed to the canal close before them now  a  weird looking place it seemed  in the blood red reflections of the  furnaces  the hot water that cooled the tuyeres came into it  some fifty  yards up  a tumultuous  almost boiling affluent  and the steam rose up  from the water in silent white wisps and streaks  wrapping damply about  them  an incessant succession of ghosts coming up from the black and red  eddies  a white uprising that made the head swim  the shining black tower  of the larger blast furnace rose overhead out of the mist  and its  tumultuous riot filled their ears  raut kept away from the edge of the  water  and watched horrocks      here it is red   said horrocks   blood red vapour as red and hot as sin   but yonder there  where the moonlight falls on it  and it drives across  the clinker heaps  it is as white as death      raut turned his head for a moment  and then came back hastily to his watch  on horrocks   come along to the rolling mills   said horrocks  the  threatening hold was not so evident that time  and raut felt a little  reassured  but all the same  what on earth did horrocks mean about  white  as death  and  red as sin   coincidence  perhaps     they went and stood behind the puddlers for a little while  and then  through the rolling mills  where amidst an incessant din the deliberate  steam hammer beat the juice out of the succulent iron  and black   half naked titans rushed the plastic bars  like hot sealing wax  between  the wheels   come on   said horrocks in raut s ear  and they went and  peeped through the little glass hole behind the tuyeres  and saw the  tumbled fire writhing in the pit of the blast furnace  it left one eye  blinded for a while  then  with green and blue patches dancing across the  dark  they went to the lift by which the trucks of ore and fuel and lime  were raised to the top of the big cylinder     and out upon the narrow rail that overhung the furnace raut s doubts came  upon him again  was it wise to be here  if horrocks did know  everything   do what he would  he could not resist a violent trembling  right under  foot was a sheer depth of seventy feet  it was a dangerous place  they  pushed by a truck of fuel to get to the railing that crowned the thing   the reek of the furnace  a sulphurous vapour streaked with pungent  bitterness  seemed to make the distant hillside of hanley quiver  the moon  was riding out now from among a drift of clouds  half way up the sky above  the undulating wooded outlines of newcastle  the steaming canal ran away  from below them under an indistinct bridge  and vanished into the dim haze  of the flat fields towards burslem      that s the cone i ve been telling you of   shouted horrocks   and  below  that  sixty feet of fire and molten metal  with the air of the blast  frothing through it like gas in soda water      raut gripped the hand rail tightly  and stared down at the cone  the heat  was intense  the boiling of the iron and the tumult of the blast made a  thunderous accompaniment to horrocks s voice  but the thing had to be gone  through now  perhaps  after all        in the middle   bawled horrocks   temperature near a thousand degrees  if   you  were dropped into it     flash into flame like a pinch of  gunpowder in a candle  put your hand out and feel the heat of his breath   why  even up here i ve seen the rain water boiling off the trucks  and  that cone there  it s a damned sight too hot for roasting cakes  the top  side of it s three hundred degrees       three hundred degrees   said raut      three hundred centigrade  mind   said horrocks   it will boil the blood  out of you in no time       eigh   said raut  and turned      boil the blood out of you in     no  you don t       let me go   screamed raut   let go my arm      with one hand he clutched at the hand rail  then with both  for a moment  the two men stood swaying  then suddenly  with a violent jerk  horrocks  had twisted him from his hold  he clutched at horrocks and missed  his  foot went back into empty air  in mid air he twisted himself  and then  cheek and shoulder and knee struck the hot cone together     he clutched the chain by which the cone hung  and the thing sank an  infinitesimal amount as he struck it  a circle of glowing red appeared  about him  and a tongue of flame  released from the chaos within   flickered up towards him  an intense pain assailed him at the knees  and  he could smell the singeing of his hands  he raised himself to his feet   and tried to climb up the chain  and then something struck his head  black  and shining with the moonlight  the throat of the furnace rose about  him     horrocks  he saw  stood above him by one of the trucks of fuel on the  rail  the gesticulating figure was bright and white in the moonlight  and  shouting   fizzle  you fool  fizzle  you hunter of women  you hot blooded  hound  boil  boil  boil      suddenly he caught up a handful of coal out of the truck  and flung it  deliberately  lump after lump  at raut      horrocks   cried raut   horrocks      he clung  crying  to the chain  pulling himself up from the burning of the  cone  each missile horrocks flung hit him  his clothes charred and glowed   and as he struggled the cone dropped  and a rush of hot  suffocating gas  whooped out and burned round him in a swift breath of flame     his human likeness departed from him  when the momentary red had passed   horrocks saw a charred  blackened figure  its head streaked with blood   still clutching and fumbling with the chain  and writhing in agony  a  cindery animal  an inhuman  monstrous creature that began a sobbing   intermittent shriek     abruptly at the sight the ironmaster s anger passed  a deadly sickness  came upon him  the heavy odour of burning flesh came drifting up to his  nostrils  his sanity returned to him      god have mercy upon me   he cried   o god  what have i done      he knew the thing below him  save that it still moved and felt  was  already a dead man  that the blood of the poor wretch must be boiling in  his veins  an intense realisation of that agony came to his mind  and  overcame every other feeling  for a moment he stood irresolute  and then   turning to the truck  he hastily tilted its contents upon the struggling  thing that had once been a man  the mass fell with a thud  and went  radiating over the cone  with the thud the shriek ended  and a boiling  confusion of smoke  dust  and flame came rushing up towards him  as it  passed  he saw the cone clear again     then he staggered back  and stood trembling  clinging to the rail with  both hands  his lips moved  but no words came to them     down below was the sound of voices and running steps  the clangour of  rolling in the shed ceased abruptly             iii       the stolen bacillus        this again   said the bacteriologist  slipping a glass slide under the  microscope   is well   a preparation of the bacillus of cholera  the  cholera germ      the pale faced man peered down the microscope  he was evidently not  accustomed to that kind of thing  and held a limp white hand over his  disengaged eye   i see very little   he said      touch this screw   said the bacteriologist   perhaps the microscope is  out of focus for you  eyes vary so much  just the fraction of a turn this  way or that       ah  now i see   said the visitor   not so very much to see after all   little streaks and shreds of pink  and yet those little particles  those  mere atomies  might multiply and devastate a city  wonderful      he stood up  and releasing the glass slip from the microscope  held it in  his hand towards the window   scarcely visible   he said  scrutinising the  preparation  he hesitated   are these  alive  are they dangerous now       those have been stained and killed   said the bacteriologist   i wish   for my own part  we could kill and stain every one of them in the  universe       i suppose   the pale man said  with a slight smile   that you scarcely  care to have such things about you in the living  in the active state       on the contrary  we are obliged to   said the bacteriologist    here  for instance    he walked across the room and took up one of  several sealed tubes   here is the living thing  this is a cultivation of  the actual living disease bacteria   he hesitated   bottled cholera  so to  speak      a slight gleam of satisfaction appeared momentarily in the face of the  pale man   it s a deadly thing to have in your possession   he said   devouring the little tube with his eyes  the bacteriologist watched the  morbid pleasure in his visitor s expression  this man  who had visited him  that afternoon with a note of introduction from an old friend  interested  him from the very contrast of their dispositions  the lank black hair and  deep grey eyes  the haggard expression and nervous manner  the fitful yet  keen interest of his visitor were a novel change from the phlegmatic  deliberations of the ordinary scientific worker with whom the  bacteriologist chiefly associated  it was perhaps natural  with a hearer  evidently so impressionable to the lethal nature of  his topic  to take  the most effective aspect of the matter     he held the tube in his hand thoughtfully   yes  here is the pestilence  imprisoned  only break such a little tube as this into a supply of  drinking water  say to these minute particles of life that one must needs  stain and examine with the highest powers of the microscope even to see   and that one can neither smell nor taste  say to them   go forth  increase  and multiply  and replenish the cisterns   and death  mysterious   untraceable death  death swift and terrible  death full of pain and  indignity  would be released upon this city  and go hither and thither  seeking his victims  here he would take the husband from the wife  here  the child from its mother  here the statesman from his duty  and here the  toiler from his trouble  he would follow the water mains  creeping along  streets  picking out and punishing a house here and a house there where  they did not boil their drinking water  creeping into the wells of the  mineral water makers  getting washed into salad  and lying dormant in  ices  he would wait ready to be drunk in the horse troughs  and by unwary  children in the public fountains  he would soak into the soil  to reappear  in springs and wells at a thousand unexpected places  once start him at  the water supply  and before we could ring him in  and catch him again   he would have decimated the metropolis      he stopped abruptly  he had been told rhetoric was his weakness      but he is quite safe here  you know  quite safe      the pale faced man nodded  his eyes shone  he cleared his throat   these  anarchist  rascals   said he   are fools  blind fools  to use bombs when  this kind of thing is attainable  i think         a gentle rap  a mere light touch of the finger nails  was heard at the  door  the bacteriologist opened if   just a minute  dear   whispered his  wife     when he re entered the laboratory his visitor was looking at his watch   i  had no idea i had wasted an hour of your time   he said   twelve minutes  to four  i ought to have left here by half past three  but your things  were really too interesting  no  positively i cannot stop a moment longer   i have an engagement at four      he passed out of the room reiterating his thanks  and the bacteriologist  accompanied him to the door  and then returned thoughtfully along the  passage to his laboratory  he was musing on the ethnology of his visitor   certainly the man was not a teutonic type nor a common latin one   a  morbid product  anyhow  i am afraid   said the bacteriologist to himself    how he gloated over those cultivations of disease germs   a disturbing  thought struck him  he turned to the bench by the vapour bath  and then  very quickly to his writing table  then he felt hastily in his pockets and  then rushed to the door   i may have put it down on the hall table   he  said      minnie   he shouted hoarsely in the hall      yes  dear   came a remote voice      had i anything in my hand when i spoke to you  dear  just now      pause      nothing  dear  because i remember          blue ruin   cried the bacteriologist  and incontinently ran to the front  door and down the steps of his house to the street     minnie  hearing the door slam violently  ran in alarm to the window  down  the street a slender man was getting into a cab  the bacteriologist   hatless  and in his carpet slippers  was running and gesticulating wildly  towards this group  one slipper came off  but he did not wait for it   he  has gone  mad    said minnie   it s that horrid science of his   and   opening the window  would have called after him  the slender man  suddenly  glancing round  seemed struck with the same idea of mental disorder  he  pointed hastily to the bacteriologist  said something to the cabman  the  apron of the cab slammed  the whip swished  the horse s feet clattered   and in a moment cab and bacteriologist hotly in pursuit  had receded up  the vista of the roadway and disappeared round the corner     minnie remained straining out of the window for a minute  then she drew  her head back into the room again  she was dumbfounded   of course he is  eccentric   she meditated   but running about london  in the height of the  season  too  in his socks   a happy thought struck her  she hastily put  her bonnet on  seized his shoes  went into the hall  took down his hat and  light overcoat from the pegs  emerged upon the doorstep  and hailed a cab  that opportunely crawled by   drive me up the road and round havelock  crescent  and see if we can find a gentleman running about in a velveteen  coat and no hat       velveteen coat  ma am  and no  at  very good  ma am   and the cabman  whipped up at once in the most matter of fact way  as if he drove to this  address every day in his life     some few minutes later the little group of cabmen and loafers that  collects round the cabman s shelter at haverstock hill were startled by  the passing of a cab with a ginger coloured screw of a horse  driven  furiously     they were silent as it went by  and then as it receded   that s  arry   icks  wot s  he  got   said the stout gentleman known as old  tootles      he s a using his whip  he is   to  rights   said the ostler boy      hullo   said poor old tommy byles   here s another bloomin  loonatic   blowed if there ain t       it s old george   said old tootles   and he s drivin  a loonatic    as  you say  ain t he a clawin  out of the keb  wonder if he s after   arry  icks      the group round the cabman s shelter became animated  chorus   go it   george    it s a race    you ll ketch  em    whip up       she s a goer  she is   said the ostler boy      strike me giddy   cried old tootles   here   i m  a goin  to begin  in a minute  here s another comin   if all the cabs in hampstead ain t  gone mad this morning       it s a fieldmale this time   said the ostler boy      she s a followin   him    said old tootles   usually the other way  about       what s she got in her  and       looks like a  igh  at       what a bloomin  lark it is  three to one on old george   said the ostler  boy   nexst      minnie went by in a perfect roar of applause  she did not like it  but she  felt that she was doing her duty  and whirled on down haverstock hill and  camden town high street with her eyes ever intent on the animated back  view of old george  who was driving her vagrant husband so  incomprehensibly away from her     the man in the foremost cab sat crouched in the corner  his arms tightly  folded  and the little tube that contained such vast possibilities of  destruction gripped in his hand  his mood was a singular mixture of fear  and exultation  chiefly he was afraid of being caught before he could  accomplish his purpose  but behind this was a vaguer but larger fear of  the awfulness of his crime  but his exultation far exceeded his fear  no  anarchist before him had ever approached this conception of his  ravachol   vaillant  all those distinguished persons whose fame he had envied  dwindled into insignificance beside him  he had only to make sure of the  water supply  and break the little tube into a reservoir  how brilliantly  he had planned it  forged the letter of introduction and got into the  laboratory  and how brilliantly he had seized his opportunity  the world  should hear of him at last  all those people who had sneered at him   neglected him  preferred other people to him  found his company  undesirable  should consider him at last  death  death  death  they had  always treated him as a man of no importance  all the world had been in a  conspiracy to keep him under  he would teach them yet what it is to  isolate a man  what was this familiar street  great saint andrew s street   of course  how fared the chase  he craned out of the cab  the  bacteriologist was scarcely fifty yards behind  that was bad  he would be  caught and stopped yet  he felt in his pocket for money  and found half a  sovereign  this he thrust up through the trap in the top of the cab into  the man s face   more   he shouted   if only we get away      the money was snatched out of his hand   right you are   said the cabman   and the trap slammed  and the lash lay along the glistening side of the  horse  the cab swayed  and the anarchist  half standing under the trap   put the hand containing the little glass tube upon the apron to preserve  his balance  he felt the brittle thing crack  and the broken half of it  rang upon the floor of the cab  he fell back into the seat with a curse   and stared dismally at the two or three drops of moisture on the apron     he shuddered      well  i suppose i shall be the first   phew   anyhow  i shall be a  martyr  that s something  but it is a filthy death  nevertheless  i wonder  if it hurts as much as they say      presently a thought occurred to him  he groped between his feet  a little  drop was still in the broken end of the tube  and he drank that to make  sure  it was better to make sure  at any rate  he would not fail     then it dawned upon him that there was no further need to escape the  bacteriologist  in wellington street he told the cabman to stop  and got  out  he slipped on the step  and his head felt queer  it was rapid stuff   this cholera poison  he waved his cabman out of existence  so to speak   and stood on the pavement with his arms folded upon his breast awaiting  the arrival of the bacteriologist  there was something tragic in his pose   the sense of imminent death gave him a certain dignity  he greeted his  pursuer with a defiant laugh      vive l anarchie  you are too late  my friend  i have drunk it  the  cholera is abroad      the bacteriologist from his cab beamed curiously at him through his  spectacles   you have drunk it  an anarchist  i see now   he was about to  say something more  and then checked himself  a smile hung in the corner  of his mouth  he opened the apron of his cab as if to descend  at which  the anarchist waved him a dramatic farewell and strode off towards  waterloo bridge  carefully jostling his infected body against as many  people as possible  the bacteriologist was so preoccupied with the vision  of him that he scarcely manifested the slightest surprise at the  appearance of minnie upon the pavement with his hat and shoes and  overcoat   very good of you to bring my things   he said  and remained  lost in contemplation of the receding figure of the anarchist      you had better get in   he said  still staring  minnie felt absolutely  convinced now that he was mad  and directed the cabman home on her own  responsibility   put on my shoes  certainly  dear   said he  as the cab  began to turn  and hid the strutting black figure  now small in the  distance  from his eyes  then suddenly something grotesque struck him  and  he laughed  then he remarked   it is really very serious  though      you see  that man came to my house to see me  and he is an anarchist   no  don t faint  or i cannot possibly tell you the rest  and i wanted to  astonish him  not knowing he was an anarchist  and took up a cultivation  of that new species of bacterium i was telling you of that infest  and i  think cause  the blue patches upon various monkeys  and  like a fool  i  said it was asiatic cholera  and he ran away with it to poison the water  of london  and he certainly might have made things look blue for this  civilised city  and now he has swallowed it  of course  i cannot say what  will happen  but you know it turned that kitten blue  and the three  puppies  in patches  and the sparrow  bright blue  but the bother is  i  shall have all the trouble and expense of preparing some more      put on my coat on this hot day  why  because we might meet mrs  jabber   my dear  mrs  jabber is not a draught  but why should i wear a coat on a  hot day because of mrs        oh   very  well              iv       the flowering of the strange orchid       the buying of orchids always has in it a certain speculative flavour  you  have before you the brown shrivelled lump of tissue  and for the rest you  must trust your judgment  or the auctioneer  or your good luck  as your  taste may incline  the plant may be moribund or dead  or it may be just a  respectable purchase  fair value for your money  or perhaps  for the thing  has happened again and again  there slowly unfolds before the delighted  eyes of the happy purchaser  day after day  some new variety  some novel  richness  a strange twist of the labellum  or some subtler colouration or  unexpected mimicry  pride  beauty  and profit blossom together on one  delicate green spike  and  it may be  even immortality  for the new  miracle of nature may stand in need of a new specific name  and what so  convenient as that of its discoverer   john smithia   there have been  worse names     it was perhaps the hope of some such happy discovery that made winter  wedderburn such a frequent attendant at these sales  that hope  and also   maybe  the fact that he had nothing else of the slightest interest to do  in the world  he was a shy  lonely  rather ineffectual man  provided with  just enough income to keep off the spur of necessity  and not enough  nervous energy to make him seek any exacting employments  he might have  collected stamps or coins  or translated horace  or bound books  or  invented new species of diatoms  but  as it happened  he grew orchids  and  had one ambitious little hothouse      i have a fancy   he said over his coffee   that something is going to  happen to me to day   he spoke  as he moved and thought  slowly      oh  don t say  that    said his housekeeper  who was also his remote  cousin  for  something happening  was a euphemism that meant only one  thing to her      you misunderstand me  i mean nothing unpleasant   though what i do mean i  scarcely know      to day   he continued  after a pause   peters  are going to sell a batch  of plants from the andamans and the indies  i shall go up and see what  they have  it may be i shall buy something good unawares  that may be it      he passed his cup for his second cupful of coffee      are these the things collected by that poor young fellow you told me of  the other day   asked his cousin  as she filled his cup      yes   he said  and became meditative over a piece of toast      nothing ever does happen to me   he remarked presently  beginning to  think aloud   i wonder why  things enough happen to other people  there is  harvey  only the other week  on monday he picked up sixpence  on wednesday  his chicks all had the staggers  on friday his cousin came home from  australia  and on saturday he broke his ankle  what a whirl of  excitement   compared to me       i think i would rather be without so much excitement   said his  housekeeper   it can t be good for you       i suppose it s troublesome  still     you see  nothing ever happens to  me  when i was a little boy i never had accidents  i never fell in love as  i grew up  never married    i wonder how it feels to have something  happen to you  something really remarkable      that orchid collector was only thirty six  twenty years younger than  myself  when he died  and he had been married twice and divorced once  he  had had malarial fever four times  and once he broke his thigh  he killed  a malay once  and once he was wounded by a poisoned dart  and in the end  he was killed by jungle leeches  it must have all been very troublesome   but then it must have been very interesting  you know  except  perhaps   the leeches       i am sure it was not good for him   said the lady with conviction      perhaps not   and then wedderburn looked at his watch   twenty three  minutes past eight  i am going up by the quarter to twelve train  so that  there is plenty of time  i think i shall wear my alpaca jacket  it is  quite warm enough  and my grey felt hat and brown shoes  i suppose       he glanced out of the window at the serene sky and sunlit garden  and then  nervously at his cousin s face      i think you had better take an umbrella if you are going to london   she  said in a voice that admitted of no denial   there s all between here and  the station coming back      when he returned he was in a state of mild excitement  he had made a  purchase  it was rare that he could make up his mind quickly enough to  buy  but this time he had done so      there are vandas   he said   and a dendrobe and some palaeonophis   he  surveyed his purchases lovingly as he consumed his soup  they were laid  out on the spotless tablecloth before him  and he was telling his cousin  all about them as he slowly meandered through his dinner  it was his  custom to live all his visits to london over again in the evening for her  and his own entertainment      i knew something would happen to day  and i have bought all these  some  of them  some of them  i feel sure  do you know  that some of them will be  remarkable  i don t know how it is  but i feel just as sure as if some one  had told me that some of these will turn out remarkable      that one    he pointed to a shrivelled rhizome   was not identified  it  may be a palaeonophis  or it may not  it may be a new species  or even a  new genus  and it was the last that poor batten ever collected       i don t like the look of it   said his housekeeper   it s such an ugly  shape       to me it scarcely seems to have a shape       i don t like those things that stick out   said his housekeeper      it shall be put away in a pot to morrow       it looks   said the housekeeper   like a spider shamming dead      wedderburn smiled and surveyed the root with his head on one side   it is  certainly not a pretty lump of stuff  but you can never judge of these  things from their dry appearance  it may turn out to be a very beautiful  orchid indeed  how busy i shall be to morrow  i must see to night just  exactly what to do with these things  and to morrow i shall set to work       they found poor batten lying dead  or dying  in a mangrove swamp  i  forget which   he began again presently   with one of these very orchids  crushed up under his body  he had been unwell for some days with some kind  of native fever  and i suppose he fainted  these mangrove swamps are very  unwholesome  every drop of blood  they say  was taken out of him by the  jungle leeches  it may be that very plant that cost him his life to  obtain       i think none the better of it for that       men must work though women may weep   said wedderburn with profound  gravity      fancy dying away from every comfort in a nasty swamp  fancy being ill of  fever with nothing to take but chlorodyne and quinine  if men were left to  themselves they would live on chlorodyne and quinine  and no one round you  but horrible natives  they say the andaman islanders are most disgusting  wretches  and  anyhow  they can scarcely make good nurses  not having the  necessary training  and just for people in england to have orchids       i don t suppose it was comfortable  but some men seem to enjoy that kind  of thing   said wedderburn   anyhow  the natives of his party were  sufficiently civilised to take care of all his collection until his  colleague  who was an ornithologist  came back again from the interior   though they could not tell the species of the orchid  and had let it  wither  and it makes these things more interesting       it makes them disgusting  i should be afraid of some of the malaria  clinging to them  and just think  there has been a dead body lying across  that ugly thing  i never thought of that before  there  i declare i cannot  eat another mouthful of dinner       i will take them off the table if you like  and put them in the  window seat  i can see them just as well there      the next few days he was indeed singularly busy in his steamy little  hothouse  fussing about with charcoal  lumps of teak  moss  and all the  other mysteries of the orchid cultivator  he considered he was having a  wonderfully eventful time  in the evening he would talk about these new  orchids to his friends  and over and over again he reverted to his  expectation of something strange     several of the vandas and the dendrobium died under his care  but  presently the strange orchid began to show signs of life  he was  delighted  and took his housekeeper right away from jam making to see it  at once  directly he made the discovery      that is a bud   he said   and presently there will be a lot of leaves  there  and those little things coming out here are aerial rootlets       they look to me like little white fingers poking out of the brown   said  his housekeeper   i don t like them       why not       i don t know  they look like fingers trying to get at you  i can t help  my likes and dislikes       i don t know for certain  but i don t  think  there are any orchids  i know that have aerial rootlets quite like that  it may be my fancy  of  course  you see they are a little flattened at the ends       i don t like  em   said his housekeeper  suddenly shivering and turning  away   i know it s very silly of me  and i m very sorry  particularly as  you like the thing so much  but i can t help thinking of that corpse       but it may not be that particular plant  that was merely a guess of  mine      his housekeeper shrugged her shoulders   anyhow i don t like it   she  said     wedderburn felt a little hurt at her dislike to the plant  but that did  not prevent his talking to her about orchids generally  and this orchid in  particular  whenever he felt inclined      there are such queer things about orchids   he said one day   such  possibilities of surprises  you know  darwin studied their fertilisation   and showed that the whole structure of an ordinary orchid flower was  contrived in order that moths might carry the pollen from plant to plant   well  it seems that there are lots of orchids known the flower of which  cannot possibly be used for fertilisation in that way  some of the  cypripediums  for instance  there are no insects known that can possibly  fertilise them  and some of them have never been found with seed       but how do they form new plants       by runners and tubers  and that kind of outgrowth  that is easily  explained  the puzzle is  what are the flowers for      very likely   he added    my  orchid may be something extraordinary  in that way  if so i shall study it  i have often thought of making  researches as darwin did  but hitherto i have not found the time  or  something else has happened to prevent it  the leaves are beginning to  unfold now  i do wish you would come and see them      but she said that the orchid house was so hot it gave her the headache   she had seen the plant once again  and the aerial rootlets  which were now  some of them more than a foot long  had unfortunately reminded her of  tentacles reaching out after something  and they got into her dreams   growing after her with incredible rapidity  so that she had settled to her  entire satisfaction that she would not see that plant again  and  wedderburn had to admire its leaves alone  they were of the ordinary broad  form  and a deep glossy green  with splashes and dots of deep red towards  the base he knew of no other leaves quite like them  the plant was placed  on a low bench near the thermometer  and close by was a simple arrangement  by which a tap dripped on the hot water pipes and kept the air steamy  and  he spent his afternoons now with some regularity meditating on the  approaching flowering of this strange plant     and at last the great thing happened  directly he entered the little glass  house he knew that the spike had burst out  although his great   paloeonophis lowii  hid the corner where his new darling stood   there was a new odour in the air  a rich  intensely sweet scent  that  overpowered every other in that crowded  steaming little greenhouse     directly he noticed this he hurried down to the strange orchid  and   behold  the trailing green spikes bore now three great splashes of  blossom  from which this overpowering sweetness proceeded  he stopped  before them in an ecstasy of admiration     the flowers were white  with streaks of golden orange upon the petals  the  heavy labellum was coiled into an intricate projection  and a wonderful  bluish purple mingled there with the gold  he could see at once that the  genus was altogether a new one  and the insufferable scent  how hot the  place was  the blossoms swam before his eyes     he would see if the temperature was right  he made a step towards the  thermometer  suddenly everything appeared unsteady  the bricks on the  floor were dancing up and down  then the white blossoms  the green leaves  behind them  the whole greenhouse  seemed to sweep sideways  and then in a  curve upward                                                at half past four his cousin made the tea  according to their invariable  custom  but wedderburn did not come in for his tea      he is worshipping that horrid orchid   she told herself  and waited ten  minutes   his watch must have stopped  i will go and call him      she went straight to the hothouse  and  opening the door  called his name   there was no reply  she noticed that the air was very close  and loaded  with an intense perfume  then she saw something lying on the bricks  between the hot water pipes     for a minute  perhaps  she stood motionless     he was lying  face upward  at the foot of the strange orchid  the  tentacle like aerial rootlets no longer swayed freely in the air  but were  crowded together  a tangle of grey ropes  and stretched tight  with their  ends closely applied to his chin and neck and hands     she did not understand  then she saw from under one of the exultant  tentacles upon his cheek there trickled a little thread of blood     with an inarticulate cry she ran towards him  and tried to pull him away  from the leech like suckers  she snapped two of these tentacles  and their  sap dripped red     then the overpowering scent of the blossom began to make her head reel   how they clung to him  she tore at the tough ropes  and he and the white  inflorescence swam about her  she felt she was fainting  knew she must  not  she left him and hastily opened the nearest door  and  after she had  panted for a moment in the fresh air  she had a brilliant inspiration  she  caught up a flower pot and smashed in the windows at the end of the  greenhouse  then she re entered  she tugged now with renewed strength at  wedderburn s motionless body  and brought the strange orchid crashing to  the floor  it still clung with the grimmest tenacity to its victim  in a  frenzy  she lugged it and him into the open air     then she thought of tearing through the sucker rootlets one by one  and in  another minute she had released him and was dragging him away from the  horror     he was white and bleeding from a dozen circular patches     the odd job man was coming up the garden  amazed at the smashing of glass   and saw her emerge  hauling the inanimate body with red stained hands  for  a moment he thought impossible things      bring some water   she cried  and her voice dispelled his fancies  when   with unnatural alacrity  he returned with the water  he found her weeping  with excitement  and with wedderburn s head upon her knee  wiping the  blood from his face      what s the matter   said wedderburn  opening his eyes feebly  and closing  them again at once      go and tell annie to come out here to me  and then go for dr  haddon at  once   she said to the odd job man so soon as he brought the water  and  added  seeing he hesitated   i will tell you all about it when you come  back      presently wedderburn opened his eyes again  and  seeing that he was  troubled by the puzzle of his position  she explained to him   you fainted  in the hothouse       and the orchid       i will see to that   she said     wedderburn had lost a good deal of blood  but beyond that he had suffered  no very great injury  they gave him brandy mixed with some pink extract of  meat  and carried him upstairs to bed  his housekeeper told her incredible  story in fragments to dr  haddon   come to the orchid house and see   she  said     the cold outer air was blowing in through the open door  and the sickly  perfume was almost dispelled  most of the torn aerial rootlets lay already  withered amidst a number of dark stains upon the bricks  the stem of the  inflorescence was broken by the fall of the plant  and the flowers were  growing limp and brown at the edges of the petals  the doctor stooped  towards it  then saw that one of the aerial rootlets still stirred feebly   and hesitated     the next morning the strange orchid still lay there  black now and  putrescent  the door banged intermittently in the morning breeze  and all  the array of wedderburn s orchids was shrivelled and prostrate  but  wedderburn himself was bright and garrulous upstairs in the glory of his  strange adventure             v       in the avu observatory       the observatory at avu  in borneo  stands on the spur of the mountain  to  the north rises the old crater  black at night against the unfathomable  blue of the sky  from the little circular building  with its mushroom  dome  the slopes plunge steeply downward into the black mysteries of the  tropical forest beneath  the little house in which the observer and his  assistant live is about fifty yards from the observatory  and beyond this  are the huts of their native attendants     thaddy  the chief observer  was down with a slight fever  his assistant   woodhouse  paused for a moment in silent contemplation of the tropical  night before commencing his solitary vigil  the night was very still  now  and then voices and laughter came from the native huts  or the cry of some  strange animal was heard from the midst of the mystery of the forest   nocturnal insects appeared in ghostly fashion out of the darkness  and  fluttered round his light  he thought  perhaps  of all the possibilities  of discovery that still lay in the black tangle beneath him  for to the  naturalist the virgin forests of borneo are still a wonderland full of  strange questions and half suspected discoveries  woodhouse carried a  small lantern in his hand  and its yellow glow contrasted vividly with the  infinite series of tints between lavender blue and black in which the  landscape was painted  his hands and face were smeared with ointment  against the attacks of the mosquitoes     even in these days of celestial photography  work done in a purely  temporary erection  and with only the most primitive appliances in  addition to the telescope  still involves a very large amount of cramped  and motionless watching  he sighed as he thought of the physical fatigues  before him  stretched himself  and entered the observatory     the reader is probably familiar with the structure of an ordinary  astronomical observatory  the building is usually cylindrical in shape   with a very light hemispherical roof capable of being turned round from  the interior  the telescope is supported upon a stone pillar in the  centre  and a clockwork arrangement compensates for the earth s rotation   and allows a star once found to be continuously observed  besides this   there is a compact tracery of wheels and screws about its point of  support  by which the astronomer adjusts it  there is  of course  a slit  in the movable roof which follows the eye of the telescope in its survey  of the heavens  the observer sits or lies on a sloping wooden arrangement   which he can wheel to any part of the observatory as the position of the  telescope may require  within it is advisable to have things as dark as  possible  in order to enhance the brilliance of the stars observed     the lantern flared as woodhouse entered his circular den  and the general  darkness fled into black shadows behind the big machine  from which it  presently seemed to creep back over the whole place again as the light  waned  the slit was a profound transparent blue  in which six stars shone  with tropical brilliance  and their light lay  a pallid gleam  along the  black tube of the instrument  woodhouse shifted the roof  and then  proceeding to the telescope  turned first one wheel and then another  the  great cylinder slowly swinging into a new position  then he glanced  through the finder  the little companion telescope  moved the roof a  little more  made some further adjustments  and set the clockwork in  motion  he took off his jacket  for the night was very hot  and pushed  into position the uncomfortable seat to which he was condemned for the  next four hours  then with a sigh he resigned himself to his watch upon  the mysteries of space     there was no sound now in the observatory  and the lantern waned steadily   outside there was the occasional cry of some animal in alarm or pain  or  calling to its mate  and the intermittent sounds of the malay and dyak  servants  presently one of the men began a queer chanting song  in which  the others joined at intervals  after this it would seem that they turned  in for the night  for no further sound came from their direction  and the  whispering stillness became more and more profound     the clockwork ticked steadily  the shrill hum of a mosquito explored the  place and grew shriller in indignation at woodhouse s ointment  then the  lantern went out and all the observatory was black     woodhouse shifted his position presently  when the slow movement of the  telescope had carried it beyond the limits of his comfort     he was watching a little group of stars in the milky way  in one of which  his chief had seen or fancied a remarkable colour variability  it was not  a part of the regular work for which the establishment existed  and for  that reason perhaps woodhouse was deeply interested  he must have  forgotten things terrestrial  all his attention was concentrated upon the  great blue circle of the telescope field  a circle powdered  so it seemed   with an innumerable multitude of stars  and all luminous against the  blackness of its setting  as he watched he seemed to himself to become  incorporeal  as if he too were floating in the ether of space  infinitely  remote was the faint red spot he was observing     suddenly the stars were blotted out  a flash of blackness passed  and they  were visible again      queer   said woodhouse   must have been a bird      the thing happened again  and immediately after the great tube shivered as  though it had been struck  then the dome of the observatory resounded with  a series of thundering blows  the stars seemed to sweep aside as the  telescope  which had been unclamped  swung round and away from the slit in  the roof      great scott   cried woodhouse   what s this      some huge vague black shape  with a flapping something like a wing  seemed  to be struggling in the aperture of the roof  in another moment the slit  was clear again  and the luminous haze of the milky way shone warm and  bright     the interior of the roof was perfectly black  and only a scraping sound  marked the whereabouts of the unknown creature     woodhouse had scrambled from the seat to his feet  he was trembling  violently and in a perspiration with the suddenness of the occurrence  was  the thing  whatever it was  inside or out  it was big  whatever else it  might be  something shot across the skylight  and the telescope swayed  he  started violently and put his arm up  it was in the observatory  then   with him  it was clinging to the roof apparently  what the devil was it   could it see him     he stood for perhaps a minute in a state of stupefaction  the beast   whatever it was  clawed at the interior of the dome  and then something  flapped almost into his face  and he saw the momentary gleam of starlight  on a skin like oiled leather  his water bottle was knocked off his little  table with a smash     the sense of some strange bird creature hovering a few yards from his face  in the darkness was indescribably unpleasant to woodhouse  as his thought  returned he concluded that it must be some night bird or large bat  at any  risk he would see what it was  and pulling a match from his pocket  he  tried to strike it on the telescope seat  there was a smoking streak of  phosphorescent light  the match flared for a moment  and he saw a vast  wing sweeping towards him  a gleam of grey brown fur  and then he was  struck in the face and the match knocked out of his hand  the blow was  aimed at his temple  and a claw tore sideways down to his cheek  he reeled  and fell  and he heard the extinguished lantern smash  another blow  followed as he fell  he was partly stunned  he felt his own warm blood  stream out upon his face  instinctively he felt his eyes had been struck  at  and  turning over on his face to save them  tried to crawl under the  protection of the telescope     he was struck again upon the back  and he heard his jacket rip  and then  the thing hit the roof of the observatory  he edged as far as he could  between the wooden seat and the eyepiece of the instrument  and turned his  body round so that it was chiefly his feet that were exposed  with these  he could at least kick  he was still in a mystified state  the strange  beast banged about in the darkness  and presently clung to the telescope   making it sway and the gear rattle  once it flapped near him  and he  kicked out madly and felt a soft body with his feet  he was horribly  scared now  it must be a big thing to swing the telescope like that  he  saw for a moment the outline of a head black against the starlight  with  sharply pointed upstanding ears and a crest between them  it seemed to him  to be as big as a mastiff s  then he began to bawl out as loudly as he  could for help     at that the thing came down upon him again  as it did so his hand touched  something beside him on the floor  he kicked out  and the next moment his  ankle was gripped and held by a row of keen teeth  he yelled again  and  tried to free his leg by kicking with the other  then he realised he had  the broken water bottle at his hand  and  snatching it  he struggled into  a sitting posture  and feeling in the darkness towards his foot  gripped a  velvety ear  like the ear of a big cat  he had seized the water bottle by  its neck and brought it down with a shivering crash upon the head of the  strange beast  he repeated the blow  and then stabbed and jabbed with the  jagged end of it  in the darkness  where he judged the face might be     the small teeth relaxed their hold  and at once woodhouse pulled his leg  free and kicked hard  he felt the sickening feel of fur and bone giving  under his boot  there was a tearing bite at his arm  and he struck over it  at the face  as he judged  and hit damp fur     there was a pause  then he heard the sound of claws  and the dragging of a  heavy body away from him over the observatory floor  then there was  silence  broken only by his own sobbing breathing  and a sound like  licking  everything was black except the parallelogram of the blue  skylight with the luminous dust of stars  against which the end of the  telescope now appeared in silhouette  he waited  as it seemed  an  interminable time     was the thing coming on again  he felt in his trouser pocket for some  matches  and found one remaining  he tried to strike this  but the floor  was wet  and it spat and went out  he cursed  he could not see where the  door was situated  in his struggle he had quite lost his bearings  the  strange beast  disturbed by the splutter of the match  began to move  again   time   called woodhouse  with a sudden gleam of mirth  but the  thing was not coming at him again  he must have hurt it  he thought  with  the broken bottle  he felt a dull pain in his ankle  probably he was  bleeding there  he wondered if it would support him if he tried to stand  up  the night outside was very still  there was no sound of any one  moving  the sleepy fools had not heard those wings battering upon the  dome  nor his shouts  it was no good wasting strength in shouting  the  monster flapped its wings and startled him into a defensive attitude  he  hit his elbow against the seat  and it fell over with a crash  he cursed  this  and then he cursed the darkness     suddenly the oblong patch of starlight seemed to sway to and fro  was he  going to faint  it would never do to faint  he clenched his fists and set  his teeth to hold himself together  where had the door got to  it occurred  to him he could get his bearings by the stars visible through the  skylight  the patch of stars he saw was in sagittarius and south eastward   the door was north  or was it north by west  he tried to think  if he  could get the door open he might retreat  it might be the thing was  wounded  the suspense was beastly   look here   he said   if you don t  come on  i shall come at you      then the thing began clambering up the side of the observatory  and he saw  its black outline gradually blot out the skylight  was it in retreat  he  forgot about the door  and watched as the dome shifted and creaked   somehow he did not feel very frightened or excited now  he felt a curious  sinking sensation inside him  the sharply defined patch of light  with the  black form moving across it  seemed to be growing smaller and smaller   that was curious  he began to feel very thirsty  and yet he did not feel  inclined to get anything to drink  he seemed to be sliding down a long  funnel     he felt a burning sensation in his throat  and then he perceived it was  broad daylight  and that one of the dyak servants was looking at him with  a curious expression  then there was the top of thaddy s face upside down   funny fellow  thaddy  to go about like that  then he grasped the situation  better  and perceived that his head was on thaddy s knee  and thaddy was  giving him brandy  and then he saw the eyepiece of the telescope with a  lot of red smears on it  he began to remember      you ve made this observatory in a pretty mess   said thaddy     the dyak boy was beating up an egg in brandy  woodhouse took this and sat  up  he felt a sharp twinge of pain  his ankle was tied up  so were his  arm and the side of his face  the smashed glass  red stained  lay about  the floor  the telescope seat was overturned  and by the opposite wall was  a dark pool  the door was open  and he saw the grey summit of the mountain  against a brilliant background of blue sky      pah   said woodhouse   who s been killing calves here  take me out of  it      then he remembered the thing  and the fight he had had with it      what  was  it   he said to thaddy   the thing i fought with         you  know that best   said thaddy   but  anyhow  don t worry  yourself now about it  have some more to drink      thaddy  however  was curious enough  and it was a hard struggle between  duty and inclination to keep woodhouse quiet until he was decently put  away in bed  and had slept upon the copious dose of meat extract thaddy  considered advisable  they then talked it over together      it was   said woodhouse   more like a big bat than anything else in the  world  it had sharp  short ears  and soft fur  and its wings were  leathery  its teeth were little but devilish sharp  and its jaw could not  have been very strong or else it would have bitten through my ankle       it has pretty nearly   said thaddy      it seemed to me to hit out with its claws pretty freely  that is about as  much as i know about the beast  our conversation was intimate  so to  speak  and yet not confidential       the dyak chaps talk about a big colugo  a klang utang  whatever that may  be  it does not often attack man  but i suppose you made it nervous  they  say there is a big colugo and a little colugo  and a something else that  sounds like gobble  they all fly about at night  for my own part  i know  there are flying foxes and flying lemurs about here  but they are none of  them very big beasts       there are more things in heaven and earth   said woodhouse  and thaddy  groaned at the quotation   and more particularly in the forests of borneo   than are dreamt of in our philosophies  on the whole  if the borneo fauna  is going to disgorge any more of its novelties upon me  i should prefer  that it did so when i was not occupied in the observatory at night and  alone              vi       aepyornis island       the man with the scarred face leant over the table and looked at my  bundle      orchids   he asked      a few   i said      cypripediums   he said      chiefly   said i      anything new  i thought not   i  did these islands twenty five    twenty seven years ago  if you find anything new here  well  it s brand  new  i didn t leave much       i m not a collector   said i      i was young then   he went on   lord  how i used to fly round   he seemed  to take my measure   i was in the east indies two years  and in brazil  seven  then i went to madagascar       i know a few explorers by name   i said  anticipating a yarn   whom did  you collect for       dawson s  i wonder if you ve heard the name of butcher ever       butcher  butcher   the name seemed vaguely present in my memory   then i recalled  butcher  v   dawson    why   said i   you are the  man who sued them for four years  salary  got cast away on a desert  island         your servant   said the man with the scar  bowing   funny case  wasn t  it  here was me  making a little fortune on that island  doing nothing  for it neither  and them quite unable to give me notice  it often used  to amuse me thinking over it while i was there  i did calculations of  it  big  all over the blessed atoll in ornamental figuring       how did it happen   said i   i don t rightly remember the case       well    you ve heard of the aepyornis       rather  andrews was telling me of a new species he was working on only a  month or so ago  just before i sailed  they ve got a thigh bone  it seems   nearly a yard long  monster the thing must have been       i believe you   said the man with the scar   it  was  a monster   sindbad s roc was just a legend of  em  but when did they find these  bones       three or four years ago       i fancy  why       why  because  i  found them  lord   it s nearly twenty years ago  if  dawson s hadn t been silly about that salary they might have made a  perfect ring in  em     i  couldn t help the infernal boat going  adrift      he paused   i suppose it s the same place  a kind of swamp about ninety  miles north of antananarivo  do you happen to know  you have to go to it  along the coast by boats  you don t happen to remember  perhaps       i don t  i fancy andrews said something about a swamp       it must be the same  it s on the east coast  and somehow there s  something in the water that keeps things from decaying  like creosote it  smells  it reminded me of trinidad  did they get any more eggs  some of  the eggs i found were a foot and a half long  the swamp goes circling  round  you know  and cuts off this bit  it s mostly salt  too  well     what a time i had of it  i found the things quite by accident  we went for  eggs  me and two native chaps  in one of those rum canoes all tied  together  and found the bones at the same time  we had a tent and  provisions for four days  and we pitched on one of the firmer places  to  think of it brings that odd tarry smell back even now  it s funny work   you go probing into the mud with iron rods  you know  usually the egg gets  smashed  i wonder how long it is since these aepyornises really lived  the  missionaries say the natives have legends about when they were alive  but  i never heard any such stories myself     but certainly those eggs we got  were as fresh as if they had been new laid  fresh  carrying them down to  the boat one of my nigger chaps dropped one on a rock and it smashed  how  i lammed into the beggar  but sweet it was  as if it was new laid  not  even smelly  and its mother dead these four hundred years  perhaps  said a  centipede had bit him  however  i m getting off the straight with the  story  it had taken us all day to dig into the slush and get these eggs  out unbroken  and we were all covered with beastly black mud  and  naturally i was cross  so far as i knew they were the only eggs that have  ever been got out not even cracked  i went afterwards to see the ones they  have at the natural history museum in london  all of them were cracked and  just stuck together like a mosaic  and bits missing  mine were perfect   and i meant to blow them when i got back  naturally i was annoyed at the  silly duffer dropping three hours  work just on account of a centipede  i  hit him about rather       footnote    no european is known to have seen a live aepyornis  with the  doubtful exception of macandrew  who visited madagascar in        h g w      the man with the scar took out a clay pipe  i placed my pouch before him   he filled up absent mindedly      how about the others  did you get those home  i don t remember        that s the queer part of the story  i had three others  perfectly fresh  eggs  well  we put  em in the boat  and then i went up to the tent to make  some coffee  leaving my two heathens down by the beach  the one fooling  about with his sting and the other helping him  it never occurred to me  that the beggars would take advantage of the peculiar position i was in to  pick a quarrel  but i suppose the centipede poison and the kicking i had  given him had upset the one  he was always a cantankerous sort  and he  persuaded the other      i remember i was sitting and smoking and boiling up the water over a  spirit lamp business i used to take on these expeditions  incidentally i  was admiring the swamp under the sunset  all black and blood red it was   in streaks  a beautiful sight  and up beyond the land rose grey and hazy  to the hills  and the sky behind them red  like a furnace mouth  and fifty  yards behind the back of me was these blessed heathen  quite regardless of  the tranquil air of things  plotting to cut off with the boat and leave me  all alone with three days  provisions and a canvas tent  and nothing to  drink whatsoever beyond a little keg of water  i heard a kind of yelp  behind me  and there they were in this canoe affair  it wasn t properly a  boat  and  perhaps  twenty yards from land  i realised what was up in a  moment  my gun was in the tent  and  besides  i had no bullets  only duck  shot  they knew that  but i had a little revolver in my pocket  and i  pulled that out as i ran down to the beach       come back   says i  flourishing it      they jabbered something at me  and the man that broke the egg jeered  i  aimed at the other  because he was unwounded and had the paddle  and i  missed  they laughed  however  i wasn t beat  i knew i had to keep cool   and i tried him again and made him jump with the whang of it  he didn t  laugh that time  the third time i got his head  and over he went  and the  paddle with him  it was a precious lucky shot for a revolver  i reckon it  was fifty yards  he went right under  i don t know if he was shot  or  simply stunned and drowned  then i began to shout to the other chap to  come back  but he huddled up in the canoe and refused to answer  so i  fired out my revolver at him and never got near him      i felt a precious fool  i can tell you  there i was on this rotten  black  beach  flat swamp all behind me  and the flat sea  cold after the sun set   and just this black canoe drifting steadily out to sea  i tell you i  damned dawson s and jamrach s and museums and all the rest of it just to  rights  i bawled to this nigger to come back  until my voice went up into  a scream      there was nothing for it but to swim after him and take my luck with the  sharks  so i opened my clasp knife and put it in my mouth  and took off  my clothes and waded in  as soon as i was in the water i lost sight of  the canoe  but i aimed  as i judged  to head it off  i hoped the man in it  was too bad to navigate it  and that it would keep on drifting in the  same direction  presently it came up over the horizon again to the  south westward about  the afterglow of sunset was well over now and the  dim of night creeping up  the stars were coming through the blue  i swum  like a champion  though my legs and arms were soon aching      however  i came up to him by the time the stars were fairly out  as it  got darker i began to see all manner of glowing things in the water    phosphorescence  you know  at times it made me giddy  i hardly knew which  was stars and which was phosphorescence  and whether i was swimming on my  head or my heels  the canoe was as black as sin  and the ripple under the  bows like liquid fire  i was naturally chary of clambering up into it  i  was anxious to see what he was up to first  he seemed to be lying cuddled  up in a lump in the bows  and the stern was all out of water  the thing  kept turning round slowly as it drifted   kind of waltzing  don t you  know  i went to the stern and pulled it down  expecting him to wake up   then i began to clamber in with my knife in my hand  and ready for a rush   but he never stirred  so there i sat in the stern of the little canoe   drifting away over the calm phosphorescent sea  and with all the host of  the stars above me  waiting for something to happen      after a long time i called him by name  but he never answered  i was too  tired to take any risks by going along to him  so we sat there  i fancy i  dozed once or twice  when the dawn came i saw he was as dead as a doornail  and all puffed up and purple  my three eggs and the bones were lying in  the middle of the canoe  and the keg of water and some coffee and biscuits  wrapped in a cape  argus  by his feet  and a tin of methylated spirit  underneath him  there was no paddle  nor  in fact  anything except the  spirit tin that i could use as one  so i settled to drift until i was  picked up  i held an inquest on him  brought in a verdict against some  snake  scorpion  or centipede unknown  and sent him overboard      after that i had a drink of water and a few biscuits  and took a look  round  i suppose a man low down as i was don t see very far  leastways   madagascar was clean out of sight  and any trace of land at all  i saw a  sail going south westward  looked like a schooner but her hull never came  up  presently the sun got high in the sky and began to beat down upon me   lord  it pretty near made my brains boil  i tried dipping my head in the  sea  but after a while my eye fell on the cape  argus   and i lay  down flat in the canoe and spread this over me  wonderful things these  newspapers  i never read one through thoroughly before  but it s odd what  you get up to when you re alone  as i was  i suppose i read that blessed  old cape  argus  twenty times  the pitch in the canoe simply reeked  with the heat and rose up into big blisters      i drifted ten days   said the man with the scar   it s a little thing in  the telling  isn t it  every day was like the last  except in the morning  and the evening i never kept a look out even  the blaze was so infernal  i  didn t see a sail after the first three days  and those i saw took no  notice of me  about the sixth night a ship went by scarcely half a mile  away from me  with all its lights ablaze and its ports open  looking like  a big firefly  there was music aboard  i stood up and shouted and screamed  at it  the second day i broached one of the aepyornis eggs  scraped the  shell away at the end bit by bit  and tried it  and i was glad to find it  was good enough to eat  a bit flavoury  not bad  i mean  but with  something of the taste of a duck s egg  there was a kind of circular  patch  about six inches across  on one side of the yoke  and with streaks  of blood and a white mark like a ladder in it that i thought queer  but i  did not understand what this meant at the time  and i wasn t inclined to  be particular  the egg lasted me three days  with biscuits and a drink of  water  i chewed coffee berries too  invigorating stuff  the second egg i  opened about the eighth day  and it scared me      the man with the scar paused   yes   he said   developing       i daresay you find it hard to believe   i  did  with the thing  before me  there the egg had been  sunk in that cold black mud  perhaps  three hundred years  but there was no mistaking it  there was the  what is  it   embryo  with its big head and curved back  and its heart beating  under its throat  and the yolk shrivelled up and great membranes spreading  inside of the shell and all over the yolk  here was i hatching out the  eggs of the biggest of all extinct birds  in a little canoe in the midst  of the indian ocean  if old dawson had known that  it was worth four  years  salary  what do  you  think      however  i had to eat that precious thing up  every bit of it  before i  sighted the reef  and some of the mouthfuls were beastly unpleasant  i  left the third one alone  i held it up to the light  but the shell was too  thick for me to get any notion of what might be happening inside  and  though i fancied i heard blood pulsing  it might have been the rustle in  my own ears  like what you listen to in a seashell      then came the atoll  came out of the sunrise  as it were  suddenly  close  up to me  i drifted straight towards it until i was about half a mile from  shore  not more  and then the current took a turn  and i had to paddle as  hard as i could with my hands and bits of the aepyornis shell to make the  place  however  i got there  it was just a common atoll about four miles  round  with a few trees growing and a spring in one place  and the lagoon  full of parrot fish  i took the egg ashore and put it in a good place   well above the tide lines and in the sun  to give it all the chance i  could  and pulled the canoe up safe  and loafed about prospecting  it s  rum how dull an atoll is  as soon as i had found a spring all the interest  seemed to vanish  when i was a kid i thought nothing could be finer or  more adventurous than the robinson crusoe business  but that place was as  monotonous as a book of sermons  i went round finding eatable things and  generally thinking  but i tell you i was bored to death before the first  day was out  it shows my luck  the very day i landed the weather changed   a thunderstorm went by to the north and flicked its wing over the island   and in the night there came a drencher and a howling wind slap over us  it  wouldn t have taken much  you know  to upset that canoe      i was sleeping under the canoe  and the egg was luckily among the sand  higher up the beach  and the first thing i remember was a sound like a  hundred pebbles hitting the boat at once  and a rush of water over my  body  i d been dreaming of antananarivo  and i sat up and holloaed to  intoshi to ask her what the devil was up  and clawed out at the chair  where the matches used to be  then i remembered where i was  there were  phosphorescent waves rolling up as if they meant to eat me  and all the  rest of the night as black as pitch  the air was simply yelling  the  clouds seemed down on your head almost  and the rain fell as if heaven was  sinking and they were baling out the waters above the firmament  one great  roller came writhing at me  like a fiery serpent  and i bolted  then i  thought of the canoe  and ran down to it as the water went hissing back  again  but the thing had gone  i wondered about the egg then  and felt my  way to it  it was all right and well out of reach of the maddest waves  so  i sat down beside it and cuddled it for company  lord  what a night that  was      the storm was over before the morning  there wasn t a rag of cloud left  in the sky when the dawn came  and all along the beach there were bits of  plank scattered  which was the disarticulated skeleton  so to speak  of my  canoe  however  that gave me something to do  for  taking advantage of two  of the trees being together  i rigged up a kind of storm shelter with  these vestiges  and that day the egg hatched      hatched  sir  when my head was pillowed on it and i was asleep  i heard a  whack and felt a jar and sat up  and there was the end of the egg pecked  out and a rum little brown head looking out at me   lord   i said   you re  welcome   and with a little difficulty he came out      he was a nice friendly little chap at first  about the size of a small  hen  very much like most other young birds  only bigger  his plumage was a  dirty brown to begin with  with a sort of grey scab that fell off it very  soon  and scarcely feathers  a kind of downy hair  i can hardly express  how pleased i was to see him  i tell you  robinson crusoe don t make near  enough of his loneliness  but here was interesting company  he looked at  me and winked his eye from the front backwards  like a hen  and gave a  chirp and began to peck about at once  as though being hatched three  hundred years too late was just nothing   glad to see you  man friday    says i  for i had naturally settled he was to be called man friday if ever  he was hatched  as soon as ever i found the egg in the canoe had  developed  i was a bit anxious about his feed  so i gave him a lump of raw  parrot fish at once  he took it  and opened his beak for more  i was glad  of that for  under the circumstances  if he d been at all fanciful  i  should have had to eat him after all      you d be surprised what an interesting bird that aepyornis chick was  he  followed me about from the very beginning  he used to stand by me and  watch while i fished in the lagoon  and go shares in anything i caught   and he was sensible  too  there were nasty green warty things  like  pickled gherkins  used to lie about on the beach  and he tried one of  these and it upset him  he never even looked at any of them again      and he grew  you could almost see him grow  and as i was never much of a  society man  his quiet  friendly ways suited me to a t  for nearly two  years we were as happy as we could be on that island  i had no business  worries  for i knew my salary was mounting up at dawsons   we would see a  sail now and then  but nothing ever came near us  i amused myself  too  by  decorating the island with designs worked in sea urchins and fancy shells  of various kinds  i put aepyornis island all round the place very nearly   in big letters  like what you see done with coloured stones at railway  stations in the old country  and mathematical calculations and drawings of  various sorts  and i used to lie watching the blessed bird stalking round  and growing  growing  and think how i could make a living out of him by  showing him about if i ever got taken off  after his first moult he began  to get handsome  with a crest and a blue wattle  and a lot of green  feathers at the behind of him  and then i used to puzzle whether dawsons   had any right to claim him or not  stormy weather and in the rainy season  we lay snug under the shelter i had made out of the old canoe  and i used  to tell him lies about my friends at home  and after a storm we would go  round the island together to see if there was any drift  it was a kind of  idyll  you might say  if only i had had some tobacco it would have been  simply just like heaven      it was about the end of the second year our little paradise went wrong   friday was then about fourteen feet high to the bill of him  with a big   broad head like the end of a pickaxe  and two huge brown eyes with yellow  rims  set together like a man s  not out of sight of each other like a  hen s  his plumage was fine  none of the half mourning style of your  ostrich  more like a cassowary as far as colour and texture go  and then  it was he began to cock his comb at me and give himself airs  and show  signs of a nasty temper         at last came a time when my fishing had been rather unlucky  and he began  to hang about me in a queer  meditative way  i thought he might have been  eating sea cucumbers or something  but it was really just discontent on  his part  i was hungry too  and when at last i landed a fish i wanted it  for myself  tempers were short that morning on both sides  he pecked at it  and grabbed it  and i gave him a whack on the head to make him leave go   and at that he went for me  lord          he gave me this in the face   the man indicated his scar   then he kicked  me  it was like a carthorse  i got up  and seeing he hadn t finished  i  started off full tilt with my arms doubled up over my face  but he ran on  those gawky legs of his faster than a racehorse  and kept landing out at  me with sledgehammer kicks  and bringing his pickaxe down on the back of  my head  i made for the lagoon  and went in up to my neck  he stopped at  the water  for he hated getting his feet wet  and began to make a shindy   something like a peacock s  only hoarser  he started strutting up and down  the beach  i ll admit i felt small to see this blessed fossil lording it  there  and my head and face were all bleeding  and  well  my body just one  jelly of bruises      i decided to swim across the lagoon and leave him alone for a bit  until  the affair blew over  i shinned up the tallest palm tree  and sat there  thinking of it all  i don t suppose i ever felt so hurt by anything before  or since  it was the brutal ingratitude of the creature  i d been more  than a brother to him  i d hatched him  educated him  a great gawky   out of date bird  and me a human being  heir of the ages and all that      i thought after a time he d begin to see things in that light himself   and feel a little sorry for his behaviour  i thought if i was to catch  some nice little bits of fish  perhaps  and go to him presently in a  casual kind of way  and offer them to him  he might do the sensible thing   it took me some time to learn how unforgiving and cantankerous an extinct  bird can be  malice      i won t tell you all the little devices i tried to get that bird round  again  i simply can t  it makes my cheek burn with shame even now to think  of the snubs and buffets i had from this infernal curiosity  i tried  violence  i chucked lumps of coral at him from a safe distance  but he  only swallowed them  i shied my open knife at him and almost lost it   though it was too big for him to swallow  i tried starving him out and  struck fishing  but he took to picking along the beach at low water after  worms  and rubbed along on that  half my time i spent up to my neck in the  lagoon  and the rest up the palm trees  one of them was scarcely high  enough  and when he caught me up it he had a regular bank holiday with the  calves of my legs  it got unbearable  i don t know if you have ever tried  sleeping up a palm tree  it gave me the most horrible nightmares  think of  the shame of it  too  here was this extinct animal mooning about my island  like a sulky duke  and me not allowed to rest the sole of my foot on the  place  i used to cry with weariness and vexation  i told him straight that  i didn t mean to be chased about a desert island by any damned  anachronisms  i told him to go and peck a navigator of his own age  but he  only snapped his beak at me  great ugly bird  all legs and neck      i shouldn t like to say how long that went on altogether  i d have killed  him sooner if i d known how  however  i hit on a way of settling him at  last  it is a south american dodge  i joined all my fishing lines together  with stems of seaweed and things  and made a stoutish string  perhaps  twelve yards in length or more  and i fastened two lumps of coral rock to  the ends of this  it took me some time to do  because every now and then  i had to go into the lagoon or up a tree as the fancy took me  this i  whirled rapidly round my head  and then let it go at him  the first time i  missed  but the next time the string caught his legs beautifully  and  wrapped round them again and again  over he went  i threw it standing  waist deep in the lagoon  and as soon as he went down i was out of the  water and sawing at his neck with my knife         i don t like to think of that even now  i felt like a murderer while i  did it  though my anger was hot against him  when i stood over him and saw  him bleeding on the white sand  and his beautiful great legs and neck  writhing in his last agony     pah      with that tragedy loneliness came upon me like a curse  good lord  you  can t imagine how i missed that bird  i sat by his corpse and sorrowed  over him  and shivered as i looked round the desolate  silent reef   i thought of what a jolly little bird he had been when he was hatched  and  of a thousand pleasant tricks he had played before he went wrong   i thought if i d only wounded him i might have nursed him round into a  better understanding  if i d had any means of digging into the coral rock  i d have buried him  i felt exactly as if he was human  as it was   i couldn t think of eating him  so i put him in the lagoon  and the little  fishes picked him clean  i didn t even save the feathers  then one day a  chap cruising about in a yacht had a fancy to see if my atoll still  existed      he didn t come a moment too soon  for i was about sick enough of the  desolation of it  and only hesitating whether i should walk out into the  sea and finish up the business that way  or fall back on the green  things        i sold the bones to a man named winslow  a dealer near the british  museum  and he says he sold them to old havers  it seems havers didn t  understand they were extra large  and it was only after his death they  attracted attention  they called  em aepyornis  what was it        aepyornis vastus    said i   it s funny  the very thing was  mentioned to me by a friend of mine  when they found an aepyornis  with a  thigh a yard long  they thought they had reached the top of the scale  and  called him  aepyornis maximus   then some one turned up another  thigh bone four feet six or more  and that they called  aepyornis  titan   then your  vastus  was found after old havers died  in his  collection  and then a  vastissimus  turned up       winslow was telling me as much   said the man with the scar   if they get  any more aepyornises  he reckons some scientific swell will go and burst a  blood vessel  but it was a queer thing to happen to a man  wasn t it    altogether              vii       the remarkable case of davidson s eyes     i     the transitory mental aberration of sidney davidson  remarkable enough in  itself  is still more remarkable if wade s explanation is to be credited   it sets one dreaming of the oddest possibilities of intercommunication in  the future  of spending an intercalary five minutes on the other side of  the world  or being watched in our most secret operations by unsuspected  eyes  it happened that i was the immediate witness of davidson s seizure   and so it falls naturally to me to put the story upon paper     when i say that i was the immediate witness of his seizure  i mean that i  was the first on the scene  the thing happened at the harlow technical  college  just beyond the highgate archway  he was alone in the larger  laboratory when the thing happened  i was in a smaller room  where the  balances are  writing up some notes  the thunderstorm had completely upset  my work  of course  it was just after one of the louder peals that i  thought i heard some glass smash in the other room  i stopped writing  and  turned round to listen  for a moment i heard nothing  the hail was playing  the devil s tattoo on the corrugated zinc of the roof  then came another  sound  a smash  no doubt of it this time  something heavy had been knocked  off the bench  i jumped up at once and went and opened the door leading  into the big laboratory     i was surprised to hear a queer sort of laugh  and saw davidson standing  unsteadily in the middle of the room  with a dazzled look on his face  my  first impression was that he was drunk  he did not notice me  he was  clawing out at something invisible a yard in front of his face  he put out  his hand  slowly  rather hesitatingly  and then clutched nothing   what s  come to it   he said  he held up his hands to his face  fingers spread  out   great scott   he said  the thing happened three or four years ago   when every one swore by that personage  then he began raising his feet  clumsily  as though he had expected to find them glued to the floor      davidson   cried i   what s the matter with you   he turned round in my  direction and looked about for me  he looked over me and at me and on  either side of me  without the slightest sign of seeing me   waves   he  said   and a remarkably neat schooner  i d swear that was bellow s voice    hullo    he shouted suddenly at the top of his voice     i thought he was up to some foolery  then i saw littered about his feet  the shattered remains of the best of our electrometers   what s up  man    said i   you ve smashed the electrometer       bellows again   said he   friends left  if my hands are gone  something  about electrometers  which way  are  you  bellows   he suddenly came  staggering towards me   the damned stuff cuts like butter   he said  he  walked straight into the bench and recoiled   none so buttery that   he  said  and stood swaying     i felt scared   davidson   said i   what on earth s come over you      he looked round him in every direction   i could swear that was bellows   why don t you show yourself like a man  bellows      it occurred to me that he must be suddenly struck blind  i walked round  the table and laid my hand upon his arm  i never saw a man more startled  in my life  he jumped away from me  and came round into an attitude of  self defence  his face fairly distorted with terror   good god   he cried    what was that       it s i  bellows  confound it  davidson      he jumped when i answered him and stared  how can i express it   right  through me  he began talking  not to me  but to himself   here in broad  daylight on a clear beach  not a place to hide in   he looked about him  wildly   here  i m  off    he suddenly turned and ran headlong into  the big electro magnet  so violently that  as we found afterwards  he  bruised his shoulder and jawbone cruelly  at that he stepped back a pace   and cried out with almost a whimper   what  in heaven s name  has come  over me   he stood  blanched with terror and trembling violently  with his  right arm clutching his left  where that had collided with the magnet     by that time i was excited and fairly scared   davidson   said i   don t  be afraid      he was startled at my voice  but not so excessively as before  i repeated  my words in as clear and as firm a tone as i could assume   bellows   he  said   is that you       can t you see it s me      he laughed   i can t even see it s myself  where the devil are we       here   said i   in the laboratory       the laboratory   he answered in a puzzled tone  and put his hand to his  forehead   i  was  in the laboratory  till that flash came  but i m  hanged if i m there now  what ship is that       there s no ship   said i   do be sensible  old chap       no ship   he repeated  and seemed to forget my denial forthwith   i  suppose   said he slowly   we re both dead  but the rummy part is i feel  just as though i still had a body  don t get used to it all at once  i  suppose  the old shop was struck by lightning  i suppose  jolly quick  thing  bellows  eigh       don t talk nonsense  you re very much alive  you are in the laboratory   blundering about  you ve just smashed a new electrometer  i don t envy you  when boyce arrives      he stared away from me towards the diagrams of cryohydrates   i must be  deaf   said he   they ve fired a gun  for there goes the puff of smoke   and i never heard a sound      i put my hand on his arm again  and this time he was less alarmed   we  seem to have a sort of invisible bodies   said he   by jove  there s a  boat coming round the headland  it s very much like the old life after  all  in a different climate      i shook his arm   davidson   i cried   wake up          ii     it was just then that boyce came in  so soon as he spoke davidson  exclaimed   old boyce  dead too  what a lark   i hastened to explain that  davidson was in a kind of somnambulistic trance  boyce was interested at  once  we both did all we could to rouse the fellow out of his  extraordinary state  he answered our questions  and asked us some of his  own  but his attention seemed distracted by his hallucination about a  beach and a ship  he kept interpolating observations concerning some boat  and the davits  and sails filling with the wind  it made one feel queer   in the dusky laboratory  to hear him saying such things     he was blind and helpless  we had to walk him down the passage  one at  each elbow  to boyce s private room  and while boyce talked to him there   and humoured him about this ship idea  i went along the corridor and asked  old wade to come and look at him  the voice of our dean sobered him a  little  but not very much  he asked where his hands were  and why he had  to walk about up to his waist in the ground  wade thought over him a long  time  you know how he knits his brows  and then made him feel the couch   guiding his hands to it   that s a couch   said wade   the couch in the  private room of professor boyce  horse hair stuffing      davidson felt about  and puzzled over it  and answered presently that he  could feel it all right  but he couldn t see it      what  do  you see   asked wade  davidson said he could see nothing  but a lot of sand and broken up shells  wade gave him some other things to  feel  telling him what they were  and watching him keenly      the ship is almost hull down   said davidson presently   apropos  of  nothing      never mind the ship   said wade   listen to me  davidson  do you know  what hallucination means       rather   said davidson      well  everything you see is hallucinatory       bishop berkeley   said davidson      don t mistake me   said wade   you are alive and in this room of boyce s   but something has happened to your eyes  you cannot see  you can feel and  hear  but not see  do you follow me       it seems to me that i see too much   davidson rubbed his knuckles into  his eyes   well   he said      that s all  don t let it perplex you  bellows here and i will take you  home in a cab       wait a bit   davidson thought   help me to sit down   said he presently    and now  i m sorry to trouble you  but will you tell me all that over  again      wade repeated it very patiently  davidson shut his eyes  and pressed his  hands upon his forehead   yes   said he   it s quite right  now my eyes  are shut i know you re right  that s you  bellows  sitting by me on the  couch  i m in england again  and we re in the dark      then he opened his eyes   and there   said he   is the sun just rising   and the yards of the ship  and a tumbled sea  and a couple of birds  flying  i never saw anything so real  and i m sitting up to my neck in a  bank of sand      he bent forward and covered his face with his hands  then he opened his  eyes again   dark sea and sunrise  and yet i m sitting on a sofa in old  boyce s room     god help me          iii     that was the beginning  for three weeks this strange affection of  davidson s eyes continued unabated  it was far worse than being blind  he  was absolutely helpless  and had to be fed like a newly hatched bird  and  led about and undressed  if he attempted to move  he fell over things or  struck himself against walls or doors  after a day or so he got used to  hearing our voices without seeing us  and willingly admitted he was at  home  and that wade was right in what he told him  my sister  to whom he  was engaged  insisted on coming to see him  and would sit for hours every  day while he talked about this beach of his  holding her hand seemed to  comfort him immensely  he explained that when we left the college and  drove home  he lived in hampstead village  it appeared to him as if we  drove right through a sandhill  it was perfectly black until he emerged  again  and through rocks and trees and solid obstacles  and when he was  taken to his own room it made him giddy and almost frantic with the fear  of falling  because going upstairs seemed to lift him thirty or forty feet  above the rocks of his imaginary island  he kept saying he should smash  all the eggs  the end was that he had to be taken down into his father s  consulting room and laid upon a couch that stood there     he described the island as being a bleak kind of place on the whole  with  very little vegetation  except some peaty stuff  and a lot of bare rock   there were multitudes of penguins  and they made the rocks white and  disagreeable to see  the sea was often rough  and once there was a  thunderstorm  and he lay and shouted at the silent flashes  once or twice  seals pulled up on the beach  but only on the first two or three days  he  said it was very funny the way in which the penguins used to waddle right  through him  and how he seemed to lie among them without disturbing them     i remember one odd thing  and that was when he wanted very badly to smoke   we put a pipe in his hands  he almost poked his eye out with it  and lit  it  but he couldn t taste anything  i ve since found it s the same with  me  i don t know if it s the usual case  that i cannot enjoy tobacco at  all unless i can see the smoke     but the queerest part of his vision came when wade sent him out in a  bath chair to get fresh air  the davidsons hired a chair  and got that  deaf and obstinate dependant of theirs  widgery  to attend to it   widgery s ideas of healthy expeditions were peculiar  my sister  who had  been to the dogs  home  met them in camden town  towards king s cross   widgery trotting along complacently  and davidson  evidently most  distressed  trying in his feeble  blind way to attract widgery s  attention     he positively wept when my sister spoke to him   oh  get me out of this  horrible darkness   he said  feeling for her hand   i must get out of it   or i shall die   he was quite incapable of explaining what was the matter   but my sister decided he must go home  and presently  as they went uphill  towards hampstead  the horror seemed to drop from him  he said it was good  to see the stars again  though it was then about noon and a blazing day      it seemed   he told me afterwards   as if i was being carried  irresistibly towards the water  i was not very much alarmed at first  of  course it was night there  a lovely night       of course   i asked  for that struck me as odd      of course   said he   it s always night there when it is day here     well  we went right into the water  which was calm and shining under the  moonlight  just a broad swell that seemed to grow broader and flatter as i  came down into it  the surface glistened just like a skin  it might have  been empty space underneath for all i could tell to the contrary  very  slowly  for i rode slanting into it  the water crept up to my eyes  then i  went under and the skin seemed to break and heal again about my eyes  the  moon gave a jump up in the sky and grew green and dim  and fish  faintly  glowing  came darting round me  and things that seemed made of luminous  glass  and i passed through a tangle of seaweeds that shone with an oily  lustre  and so i drove down into the sea  and the stars went out one by  one  and the moon grew greener and darker  and the seaweed became a  luminous purple red  it was all very faint and mysterious  and everything  seemed to quiver  and all the while i could hear the wheels of the  bath chair creaking  and the footsteps of people going by  and a man in  the distance selling the special  pall mall       i kept sinking down deeper and deeper into the water  it became inky  black about me  not a ray from above came down into that darkness  and the  phosphorescent things grew brighter and brighter  the snaky branches of  the deeper weeds flickered like the flames of spirit lamps  but  after a  time  there were no more weeds  the fishes came staring and gaping towards  me  and into me and through me  i never imagined such fishes before  they  had lines of fire along the sides of them as though they had been outlined  with a luminous pencil  and there was a ghastly thing swimming backwards  with a lot of twining arms  and then i saw  coming very slowly towards me  through the gloom  a hazy mass of light that resolved itself as it drew  nearer into multitudes of fishes  struggling and darting round something  that drifted  i drove on straight towards it  and presently i saw in the  midst of the tumult  and by the light of the fish  a bit of splintered  spar looming over me  and a dark hull tilting over  and some glowing  phosphorescent forms that were shaken and writhed as the fish bit at them   then it was i began to try to attract widgery s attention  a horror came  upon me  ugh  i should have driven right into those half eaten  things  if  your sister had not come  they had great holes in them  bellows  and      never mind  but it was ghastly        iv     for three weeks davidson remained in this singular state  seeing what at  the time we imagined was an altogether phantasmal world  and stone blind  to the world around him  then  one tuesday  when i called i met old  davidson in the passage   he can see his thumb   the old gentleman said   in a perfect transport  he was struggling into his overcoat   he can see  his thumb  bellows   he said  with the tears in his eyes   the lad will be  all right yet      i rushed in to davidson  he was holding up a little book before his face   and looking at it and laughing in a weak kind of way      it s amazing   said he   there s a kind of patch come there   he pointed  with his finger   i m on the rocks as usual  and the penguins are  staggering and flapping about as usual  and there s been a whale showing  every now and then  but it s got too dark now to make him out  but put  something  there   and i see it  i do see it  it s very dim and  broken in places  but i see it all the same  like a faint spectre of  itself  i found it out this morning while they were dressing me  it s like  a hole in this infernal phantom world  just put your hand by mine  no  not  there  ah  yes  i see it  the base of your thumb and a bit of cuff  it  looks like the ghost of a bit of your hand sticking out of the darkling  sky  just by it there s a group of stars like a cross coming out      from that time davidson began to mend  his account of the change  like his  account of the vision  was oddly convincing  over patches of his field of  vision  the phantom world grew fainter  grew transparent  as it were  and  through these translucent gaps he began to see dimly the real world about  him  the patches grew in size and number  ran together and spread until  only here and there were blind spots left upon his eyes  he was able to  get up and steer himself about  feed himself once more  read  smoke  and  behave like an ordinary citizen again  at first it was very confusing to  him to have these two pictures overlapping each other like the changing  views of a lantern  but in a little while he began to distinguish the real  from the illusory     at first he was unfeignedly glad  and seemed only too anxious to complete  his cure by taking exercise and tonics  but as that odd island of his  began to fade away from him  he became queerly interested in it  he wanted  particularly to go down into the deep sea again  and would spend half his  time wandering about the low lying parts of london  trying to find the  water logged wreck he had seen drifting  the glare of real daylight very  soon impressed him so vividly as to blot out everything of his shadowy  world  but of a night time  in a darkened room  he could still see the  white splashed rocks of the island  and the clumsy penguins staggering to  and fro  but even these grew fainter and fainter  and  at last  soon after  he married my sister  he saw them for the last time       v     and now to tell of the queerest thing of all  about two years after his  cure i dined with the davidsons  and after dinner a man named atkins  called in  he is a lieutenant in the royal navy  and a pleasant  talkative  man  he was on friendly terms with my brother in law  and was soon on  friendly terms with me  it came out that he was engaged to davidson s  cousin  and incidentally he took out a kind of pocket photograph case to  show us a new rendering of his  fiancee    and  by the by   said he    here s the old  fulmar       davidson looked at it casually  then suddenly his face lit up   good  heavens   said he   i could almost swear          what   said atkins      that i had seen that ship before       don t see how you can have  she hasn t been out of the south seas for six  years  and before then          but   began davidson  and then   yes  that s the ship i dreamt of  i m  sure that s the ship i dreamt of  she was standing off an island that  swarmed with penguins  and she fired a gun       good lord   said atkins  who had now heard the particulars of the  seizure   how the deuce could you dream that      and then  bit by bit  it came out that on the very day davidson was  seized  h m s   fulmar  had actually been off a little rock to the  south of antipodes island  a boat had landed overnight to get penguins   eggs  had been delayed  and a thunderstorm drifting up  the boat s crew  had waited until the morning before rejoining the ship  atkins had been  one of them  and he corroborated  word for word  the descriptions davidson  had given of the island and the boat  there is not the slightest doubt in  any of our minds that davidson has really seen the place  in some  unaccountable way  while he moved hither and thither in london  his sight  moved hither and thither in a manner that corresponded  about this distant  island   how  is absolutely a mystery     that completes the remarkable story of davidson s eyes  it s perhaps the  best authenticated case in existence of real vision at a distance   explanation there is none forthcoming  except what professor wade has  thrown out  but his explanation invokes the fourth dimension  and a  dissertation on theoretical kinds of space  to talk of there being  a kink  in space  seems mere nonsense to me  it may be because i am no  mathematician  when i said that nothing would alter the fact that the  place is eight thousand miles away  he answered that two points might be a  yard away on a sheet of paper  and yet be brought together by bending the  paper round  the reader may grasp his argument  but i certainly do not   his idea seems to be that davidson  stooping between the poles of the big  electro magnet  had some extraordinary twist given to his retinal elements  through the sudden change in the field of force due to the lightning     he thinks  as a consequence of this  that it may be possible to live  visually in one part of the world  while one lives bodily in another  he  has even made some experiments in support of his views  but  so far  he  has simply succeeded in blinding a few dogs  i believe that is the net  result of his work  though i have not seen him for some weeks  latterly i  have been so busy with my work in connection with the saint pancras  installation that i have had little opportunity of calling to see him  but  the whole of his theory seems fantastic to me  the facts concerning  davidson stand on an altogether different footing  and i can testify  personally to the accuracy of every detail i have given             viii       the lord of the dynamos       the chief attendant of the three dynamos that buzzed and rattled at  camberwell  and kept the electric railway going  came out of yorkshire   and his name was james holroyd  he was a practical electrician  but fond  of whisky  a heavy  red haired brute with irregular teeth  he doubted the  existence of the deity  but accepted carnot s cycle  and he had read  shakespeare and found him weak in chemistry  his helper came out of the  mysterious east  and his name was azuma zi  but holroyd called him  pooh bah  holroyd liked a nigger help because he would stand kicking  a  habit with holroyd  and did not pry into the machinery and try to learn  the ways of it  certain odd possibilities of the negro mind brought into  abrupt contact with the crown of our civilisation holroyd never fully  realised  though just at the end he got some inkling of them     to define azuma zi was beyond ethnology  he was  perhaps  more negroid  than anything else  though his hair was curly rather than frizzy  and his  nose had a bridge  moreover  his skin was brown rather than black  and the  whites of his eyes were yellow  his broad cheekbones and narrow chin gave  his face something of the viperine v  his head  too  was broad behind  and  low and narrow at the forehead  as if his brain had been twisted round in  the reverse way to a european s  he was short of stature and still shorter  of english  in conversation he made numerous odd noises of no known  marketable value  and his infrequent words were carved and wrought into  heraldic grotesqueness  holroyd tried to elucidate his religious beliefs   and  especially after whisky  lectured to him against superstition and  missionaries  azuma zi  however  shirked the discussion of his gods  even  though he was kicked for it     azuma zi had come  clad in white but insufficient raiment  out of the  stoke hole of the  lord clive   from the straits settlements and  beyond  into london  he had heard even in his youth of the greatness and  riches of london  where all the women are white and fair  and even the  beggars in the streets are white  and he had arrived  with newly earned  gold coins in his pocket  to worship at the shrine of civilisation  the  day of his landing was a dismal one  the sky was dun  and a wind worried  drizzle filtered down to the greasy streets  but he plunged boldly into  the delights of shadwell  and was presently cast up  shattered in health   civilised in costume  penniless  and  except in matters of the direst  necessity  practically a dumb animal  to toil for james holroyd  and to be  bullied by him in the dynamo shed at camberwell  and to james holroyd  bullying was a labour of love     there were three dynamos with their engines at camberwell  the two that  have been there since the beginning are small machines  the larger one was  new  the smaller machines made a reasonable noise  their straps hummed  over the drums  every now and then the brushes buzzed and fizzled  and the  air churned steadily  whoo  whoo  whoo  between their poles  one was loose  in its foundations and kept the shed vibrating  but the big dynamo drowned  these little noises altogether with the sustained drone of its iron core   which somehow set part of the ironwork humming  the place made the  visitor s head reel with the throb  throb  throb of the engines  the  rotation of the big wheels  the spinning ball valves  the occasional  spittings of the steam  and over all the deep  unceasing  surging note of  the big dynamo  this last noise was from an engineering point of view a  defect  but azuma zi accounted it unto the monster for mightiness and  pride     if it were possible we would have the noises of that shed always about the  reader as he reads  we would tell all our story to such an accompaniment   it was a steady stream of din  from which the ear picked out first one  thread and then another  there was the intermittent snorting  panting  and  seething of the steam engines  the suck and thud of their pistons  the  dull beat on the air as the spokes of the great driving wheels came round   a note the leather straps made as they ran tighter and looser  and a  fretful tumult from the dynamos  and  over all  sometimes inaudible  as  the ear tired of it  and then creeping back upon the senses again  was  this trombone note of the big machine  the floor never felt steady and  quiet beneath one s feet  but quivered and jarred  it was a confusing   unsteady place  and enough to send anyone s thoughts jerking into odd  zigzags  and for three months  while the big strike of the engineers was  in progress  holroyd  who was a blackleg  and azuma zi  who was a mere  black  were never out of the stir and eddy of it  but slept and fed in the  little wooden shanty between the shed and the gates     holroyd delivered a theological lecture on the text of his big machine  soon after azuma zi came  he had to shout to be heard in the din   look at  that   said holroyd   where s your  eathen idol to match  im   and  azuma zi looked  for a moment holroyd was inaudible  and then azuma zi  heard   kill a hundred men  twelve per cent  on the ordinary shares   said  holroyd   and that s something like a gord      holroyd was proud of his big dynamo  and expatiated upon its size and  power to azuma zi until heaven knows what odd currents of thought that and  the incessant whirling and shindy set up within the curly black cranium   he would explain in the most graphic manner the dozen or so ways in which  a man might be killed by it  and once he gave azuma zi a shock as a sample  of its quality  after that  in the breathing times of his labour  it was  heavy labour  being not only his own  but most of holroyd s  azuma zi  would sit and watch the big machine  now and then the brushes would  sparkle and spit blue flashes  at which holroyd would swear  but all the  rest was as smooth and rhythmic as breathing  the band ran shouting over  the shaft  and ever behind one as one watched was the complacent thud of  the piston  so it lived all day in this big airy shed  with him and  holroyd to wait upon it  not prisoned up and slaving to drive a ship as  the other engines he knew  mere captive devils of the british solomon  had  been  but a machine enthroned  those two smaller dynamos azuma zi by force  of contrast despised  the large one he privately christened the lord of  the dynamos  they were fretful and irregular  but the big dynamo was  steady  how great it was  how serene and easy in its working  greater and  calmer even than the buddhas he had seen at rangoon  and yet not  motionless  but living  the great black coils spun  spun  spun  the rings  ran round under the brushes  and the deep note of its coil steadied the  whole  it affected azuma zi queerly     azuma zi was not fond of labour  he would sit about and watch the lord of  the dynamos while holroyd went away to persuade the yard porter to get  whisky  although his proper place was not in the dynamo shed but behind  the engines  and  moreover  if holroyd caught him skulking he got hit for  it with a rod of stout copper wire  he would go and stand close to the  colossus  and look up at the great leather band running overhead  there  was a black patch on the band that came round  and it pleased him somehow  among all the clatter to watch this return again and again  odd thoughts  spun with the whirl of it  scientific people tell us that savages give  souls to rocks and trees   and a machine is a thousand times more alive  than a rock or a tree  and azuma zi was practically a savage still  the  veneer of civilisation lay no deeper than his slop suit  his bruises  and  the coal grime on his face and hands  his father before him had worshipped  a meteoric stone  kindred blood  it may be  had splashed the broad wheels  of juggernaut     he took every opportunity holroyd gave him of touching and handling the  great dynamo that was fascinating him  he polished and cleaned it until  the metal parts were blinding in the sun  he felt a mysterious sense of  service in doing this  he would go up to it and touch its spinning coils  gently  the gods he had worshipped were all far away  the people in london  hid their gods     at last his dim feelings grew more distinct  and took shape in thoughts   and at last in acts  when he came into the roaring shed one morning he  salaamed to the lord of the dynamos  and then  when holroyd was away  he  went and whispered to the thundering machine that he was its servant  and  prayed it to have pity on him and save him from holroyd  as he did so a  rare gleam of light came in through the open archway of the throbbing  machine shed  and the lord of the dynamos  as he whirled and roared  was  radiant with pale gold  then azuma zi knew that his service was acceptable  to his lord  after that he did not feel so lonely as he had done  and he  had indeed been very much alone in london  and even when his work time was  over  which was rare  he loitered about the shed     then  the next time holroyd maltreated him  azuma zi went presently to the  lord of the dynamos and whispered   thou seest  o my lord   and the angry  whirr of the machinery seemed to answer him  thereafter it appeared to him  that whenever holroyd came into the shed a different note came into the  sounds of the dynamo   my lord bides his time   said azuma zi to himself    the iniquity of the fool is not yet ripe   and he waited and watched for  the day of reckoning  one day there was evidence of short circuiting  and  holroyd  making an unwary examination  it was in the afternoon  got a  rather severe shock  azuma zi from behind the engine saw him jump off and  curse at the peccant coil      he is warned   said azuma zi to himself   surely my lord is very  patient      holroyd had at first initiated his  nigger  into such elementary  conceptions of the dynamo s working as would enable him to take temporary  charge of the shed in his absence  but when he noticed the manner in which  azuma zi hung about the monster he became suspicious  he dimly perceived  his assistant was  up to something   and connecting him with the anointing  of the coils with oil that had rotted the varnish in one place  he issued  an edict  shouted above the confusion of the machinery   don t  ee go nigh  that big dynamo any more  pooh bah  or a ll take thy skin off   besides   if it pleased azuma zi to be near the big machine  it was plain sense and  decency to keep him away from it     azuma zi obeyed at the time  but later he was caught bowing before the  lord of the dynamos  at which holroyd twisted his arm and kicked him as he  turned to go away  as azuma zi presently stood behind the engine and  glared at the back of the hated holroyd  the noises of the machinery took  a new rhythm  and sounded like four words in his native tongue     it is hard to say exactly what madness is  i fancy azuma zi was mad  the  incessant din and whirl of the dynamo shed may have churned up his little  store of knowledge and big store of superstitious fancy  at last  into  something akin to frenzy  at any rate  when the idea of making holroyd a  sacrifice to the dynamo fetich was thus suggested to him  it filled him  with a strange tumult of exultant emotion     that night the two men and their black shadows were alone in the shed  together  the shed was lit with one big arc light that winked and  flickered purple  the shadows lay black behind the dynamos  the ball  governors of the engines whirled from light to darkness  and their pistons  beat loud and steady  the world outside seen through the open end of the  shed seemed incredibly dim and remote  it seemed absolutely silent  too   since the riot of the machinery drowned every external sound  far away was  the black fence of the yard with grey shadowy houses behind  and above was  the deep blue sky and the pale little stars  azuma zi suddenly walked  across the centre of the shed above which the leather bands were running   and went into the shadow by the big dynamo  holroyd heard a click  and the  spin of the armature changed      what are you dewin  with that switch   he bawled in surprise   han t i  told you         then he saw the set expression of azuma zi s eyes as the asiatic came out  of the shadow towards him     in another moment the two men were grappling fiercely in front of the  great dynamo      you coffee headed fool   gasped holroyd  with a brown hand at his throat    keep off those contact rings   in another moment he was tripped and  reeling back upon the lord of the dynamos  he instinctively loosened his  grip upon his antagonist to save himself from the machine     the messenger  sent in furious haste from the station to find out what had  happened in the dynamo shed  met azuma zi at the porter s lodge by the  gate  azuma zi tried to explain something  but the messenger could make  nothing of the black s incoherent english  and hurried on to the shed   the machines were all noisily at work  and nothing seemed to be  disarranged  there was  however  a queer smell of singed hair  then he saw  an odd looking crumpled mass clinging to the front of the big dynamo  and   approaching  recognised the distorted remains of holroyd     the man stared and hesitated a moment  then he saw the face  and shut his  eyes convulsively  he turned on his heel before he opened them  so that he  should not see holroyd again  and went out of the shed to get advice and  help     when azuma zi saw holroyd die in the grip of the great dynamo he had been  a little scared about the consequences of his act  yet he felt strangely  elated  and knew that the favour of the lord dynamo was upon him  his plan  was already settled when he met the man coming from the station  and the  scientific manager who speedily arrived on the scene jumped at the obvious  conclusion of suicide  this expert scarcely noticed azuma zi  except to  ask a few questions  did he see holroyd kill himself  azuma zi explained  he had been out of sight at the engine furnace until he heard a difference  in the noise from the dynamo  it was not a difficult examination  being  untinctured by suspicion     the distorted remains of holroyd  which the electrician removed from  the machine  were hastily covered by the porter with a coffee stained  table cloth  somebody  by a happy inspiration  fetched a medical man  the  expert was chiefly anxious to get the machine at work again  for seven or  eight trains had stopped midway in the stuffy tunnels of the electric  railway  azuma zi  answering or misunderstanding the questions of the  people who had by authority or impudence come into the shed  was presently  sent back to the stoke hole by the scientific manager  of course a crowd  collected outside the gates of the yard  a crowd  for no known reason   always hovers for a day or two near the scene of a sudden death in  london  two or three reporters percolated somehow into the engine shed   and one even got to azuma zi  but the scientific expert cleared them out  again  being himself an amateur journalist     presently the body was carried away  and public interest departed with it   azuma zi remained very quietly at his furnace  seeing over and over again  in the coals a figure that wriggled violently and became still  an hour  after the murder  to any one coming into the shed it would have looked  exactly as if nothing remarkable had ever happened there  peeping  presently from his engine room the black saw the lord dynamo spin and  whirl beside his little brothers  and the driving wheels were beating  round  and the steam in the pistons went thud  thud  exactly as it had  been earlier in the evening  after all  from the mechanical point of view   it had been a most insignificant incident  the mere temporary deflection  of a current  but now the slender form and slender shadow of the  scientific manager replaced the sturdy outline of holroyd travelling up  and down the lane of light upon the vibrating floor under the straps  between the engines and the dynamos      have i not served my lord   said azuma zi inaudibly  from his shadow  and  the note of the great dynamo rang out full and clear  as he looked at the  big whirling mechanism the strange fascination of it that had been a  little in abeyance since holroyd s death resumed its sway     never had azuma zi seen a man killed so swiftly and pitilessly  the big  humming machine had slain its victim without wavering for a second from  its steady beating  it was indeed a mighty god     the unconscious scientific manager stood with his back to him  scribbling  on a piece of paper  his shadow lay at the foot of the monster     was the lord dynamo still hungry  his servant was ready     azuma zi made a stealthy step forward  then stopped  the scientific  manager suddenly ceased his writing  walked down the shed to the endmost  of the dynamos  and began to examine the brushes     azuma zi hesitated  and then slipped across noiselessly into the shadow by  the switch  there he waited  presently the manager s footsteps could be  heard returning  he stopped in his old position  unconscious of the stoker  crouching ten feet away from him  then the big dynamo suddenly fizzled   and in another moment azuma zi had sprung out of the darkness upon him     first  the scientific manager was gripped round the body and swung towards  the big dynamo  then  kicking with his knee and forcing his antagonist s  head down with his hands  he loosened the grip on his waist and swung  round away from the machine  then the black grasped him again  putting a  curly head against his chest  and they swayed and panted as it seemed for  an age or so  then the scientific manager was impelled to catch a black  ear in his teeth and bite furiously  the black yelled hideously     they rolled over on the floor  and the black  who had apparently slipped  from the vice of the teeth or parted with some ear  the scientific manager  wondered which at the time  tried to throttle him  the scientific manager  was making some ineffectual efforts to claw something with his hands and  to kick  when the welcome sound of quick footsteps sounded on the floor   the next moment azuma zi had left him and darted towards the big dynamo   there was a splutter amid the roar     the officer of the company who had entered stood staring as azuma zi  caught the naked terminals in his hands  gave one horrible convulsion  and  then hung motionless from the machine  his face violently distorted      i m jolly glad you came in when you did   said the scientific manager   still sitting on the floor     he looked at the still quivering figure   it is not a nice death to die   apparently  but it is quick      the official was still staring at the body  he was a man of slow  apprehension     there was a pause     the scientific manager got up on his feet rather awkwardly  he ran his  fingers along his collar thoughtfully  and moved his head to and fro  several times      poor holroyd  i see now   then almost mechanically he went towards the  switch in the shadow and turned the current into the railway circuit  again  as he did so the singed body loosened its grip upon the machine and  fell forward on its face  the core of the dynamo roared out loud and  clear  and the armature beat the air     so ended prematurely the worship of the dynamo deity  perhaps the most  short lived of all religions  yet withal it could at least boast a  martyrdom and a human sacrifice           ix       the moth       probably you have heard of hapley  not w  t  hapley  the son  but the  celebrated hapley  the hapley of  periplaneta hapliia   hapley the  entomologist     if so you know at least of the great feud between hapley and professor  pawkins  though certain of its consequences may be new to you  for those  who have not  a word or two of explanation is necessary  which the idle  reader may go over with a glancing eye  if his indolence so incline him     it is amazing how very widely diffused is the ignorance of such really  important matters as this hapley pawkins feud  those epoch making  controversies  again  that have convulsed the geological society are  i  verily believe  almost entirely unknown outside the fellowship of that  body  i have heard men of fair general education even refer to the great  scenes at these meetings as vestry meeting squabbles  yet the great hate  of the english and scotch geologists has lasted now half a century  and  has  left deep and abundant marks upon the body of the science   and this  hapley pawkins business  though perhaps a more personal affair  stirred  passions as profound  if not profounder  your common man has no conception  of the zeal that animates a scientific investigator  the fury of  contradiction you can arouse in him  it is the  odium theologicum  in  a new form  there are men  for instance  who would gladly burn professor  ray lankester at smithfield for his treatment of the mollusca in the  encyclopaedia  that fantastic extension of the cephalopods to cover the  pteropods     but i wander from hapley and pawkins     it began years and years ago  with a revision of the microlepidoptera   whatever these may be  by pawkins  in which he extinguished a new species  created by hapley  hapley  who was always quarrelsome  replied by a  stinging impeachment of the entire classification of pawkins  a  pawkins  in his  rejoinder  b  suggested that hapley s microscope was as defective  as his power of observation  and called him an  irresponsible meddler     hapley was not a professor at that time  hapley in his retort  c  spoke of   blundering collectors   and described  as if inadvertently  pawkins   revision as a  miracle of ineptitude   it was war to the knife  however   it would scarcely interest the reader to detail how these two great men  quarrelled  and how the split between them widened until from the  microlepidoptera they were at war upon every open question in entomology   there were memorable occasions  at times the royal entomological society  meetings resembled nothing so much as the chamber of deputies  on the  whole  i fancy pawkins was nearer the truth than hapley  but hapley was  skilful with his rhetoric  had a turn for ridicule rare in a scientific  man  was endowed with vast energy  and had a fine sense of injury in the  matter of the extinguished species  while pawkins was a man of dull  presence  prosy of speech  in shape not unlike a water barrel  over  conscientious with testimonials  and suspected of jobbing museum  appointments  so the young men gathered round hapley and applauded him  it  was a long struggle  vicious from the beginning and growing at last to  pitiless antagonism  the successive turns of fortune  now an advantage to  one side and now to another  now hapley tormented by some success of  pawkins  and now pawkins outshone by hapley  belong rather to the history  of entomology than to this story      footnote a   remarks on a recent revision of microlepidoptera     quart  journ  entomological soc               footnote b   rejoinder to certain remarks   etc   ibid              footnote c   further remarks   etc   ibid       but in      pawkins  whose health had been bad for some time  published  some work upon the  mesoblast  of the death s head moth  what the  mesoblast of the death s head moth may be does not matter a rap in this  story  but the work was far below his usual standard  and gave hapley an  opening he had coveted for years  he must have worked night and day to  make the most of his advantage     in an elaborate critique he rent pawkins to tatters  one can fancy the  man s disordered black hair  and his queer dark eyes flashing as he went  for his antagonist  and pawkins made a reply  halting  ineffectual  with  painful gaps of silence  and yet malignant  there was no mistaking his  will to wound hapley  nor his incapacity to do it  but few of those who  heard him  i was absent from that meeting  realised how ill the man was     hapley got his opponent down  and meant to finish him  he followed with a  simply brutal attack upon pawkins  in the form of a paper upon the  development of moths in general  a paper showing evidence of a most  extraordinary amount of mental labour  and yet couched in a violently  controversial tone  violent as it was  an editorial note witnesses that it  was modified  it must have covered pawkins with shame and confusion of  face  it left no loophole  it was murderous in argument  and utterly  contemptuous in tone  an awful thing for the declining years of a man s  career     the world of entomologists waited breathlessly for the rejoinder from  pawkins  he would try one  for pawkins had always been game  but when it  came it surprised them  for the rejoinder of pawkins was to catch  influenza  proceed to pneumonia  and die     it was perhaps as effectual a reply as he could make under the  circumstances  and largely turned the current of feeling against hapley   the very people who had most gleefully cheered on those gladiators became  serious at the consequence  there could be no reasonable doubt the fret of  the defeat had contributed to the death of pawkins  there was a limit even  to scientific controversy  said serious people  another crushing attack  was already in the press and appeared on the day before the funeral  i  don t think hapley exerted himself to stop it  people remembered how  hapley had hounded down his rival  and forgot that rival s defects   scathing satire reads ill over fresh mould  the thing provoked comment in  the daily papers  this it was that made me think that you had probably  heard of hapley and this controversy  but  as i have already remarked   scientific workers live very much in a world of their own  half the  people  i dare say  who go along piccadilly to the academy every year   could not tell you where the learned societies abide  many even think that  research is a kind of happy family cage in which all kinds of men lie down  together in peace     in his private thoughts hapley could not forgive pawkins for dying  in  the first place  it was a mean dodge to escape the absolute pulverisation  hapley had in hand for him  and in the second  it left hapley s mind with  a queer gap in it  for twenty years he had worked hard  sometimes far  into the night  and seven days a week  with microscope  scalpel   collecting net  and pen  and almost entirely with reference to pawkins   the european reputation he had won had come as an incident in that great  antipathy  he had gradually worked up to a climax in this last  controversy  it had killed pawkins  but it had also thrown hapley out of  gear  so to speak  and his doctor advised him to give up work for a time   and rest  so hapley went down into a quiet village in kent  and thought  day and night of pawkins  and good things it was now impossible to say  about him     at last hapley began to realise in what direction the pre occupation  tended  he determined to make a fight for it  and started by trying to  read novels  but he could not get his mind off pawkins  white in the face  and making his last speech  every sentence a beautiful opening for hapley   he turned to fiction  and found it had no grip on him  he read the  island  nights  entertainments  until his  sense of causation  was shocked beyond  endurance by the bottle imp  then he went to kipling  and found he  proved  nothing   besides being irreverent and vulgar  these scientific people  have their limitations  then unhappily  he tried besant s  inner house    and the opening chapter set his mind upon learned societies and pawkins at  once     so hapley turned to chess  and found it a little more soothing  he soon  mastered the moves and the chief gambits and commoner closing positions   and began to beat the vicar  but then the cylindrical contours of the  opposite king began to resemble pawkins standing up and gasping  ineffectually against check mate  and hapley decided to give up chess     perhaps the study of some new branch of science would after all be better  diversion  the best rest is change of occupation  hapley determined to  plunge at diatoms  and had one of his smaller microscopes and halibut s  monograph sent down from london  he thought that perhaps if he could get  up a vigorous quarrel with halibut  he might be able to begin life afresh  and forget pawkins  and very soon he was hard at work in his habitual  strenuous fashion  at these microscopic denizens of the way side pool     it was on the third day of the diatoms that hapley became aware of a novel  addition to the local fauna  he was working late at the microscope  and  the only light in the room was the brilliant little lamp with the special  form of green shade  like all experienced microscopists  he kept both eyes  open  it is the only way to avoid excessive fatigue  one eye was over the  instrument  and bright and distinct before that was the circular field of  the microscope  across which a brown diatom was slowly moving  with the  other eye hapley saw  as it were  without seeing  he was only dimly  conscious of the brass side of the instrument  the illuminated part of the  table cloth  a sheet of notepaper  the foot of the lamp  and the darkened  room beyond     suddenly his attention drifted from one eye to the other  the table cloth  was of the material called tapestry by shopmen  and rather brightly  coloured  the pattern was in gold  with a small amount of crimson and pale  blue upon a greyish ground  at one point the pattern seemed displaced  and  there was a vibrating movement of the colours at this point     hapley suddenly moved his head back and looked with both eyes  his mouth  fell open with astonishment     it was a large moth or butterfly  its wings spread in butterfly fashion     it was strange it should be in the room at all  for the windows were  closed  strange that it should not have attracted his attention when  fluttering to its present position  strange that it should match the  table cloth  stranger far that to him  hapley  the great entomologist  it  was altogether unknown  there was no delusion  it was crawling slowly  towards the foot of the lamp      new genus  by heavens  and in england   said hapley  staring     then he suddenly thought of pawkins  nothing would have maddened pawkins  more   and pawkins was dead     something about the head and body of the insect became singularly  suggestive of pawkins  just as the chess king had been      confound pawkins   said hapley   but i must catch this   and looking  round him for some means of capturing the moth  he rose slowly out of his  chair  suddenly the insect rose  struck the edge of the lampshade  hapley  heard the  ping   and vanished into the shadow     in a moment hapley had whipped off the shade  so that the whole room was  illuminated  the thing had disappeared  but soon his practised eye  detected it upon the wall paper near the door  he went towards it poising  the lamp shade for capture  before he was within striking distance   however  it had risen and was fluttering round the room  after the fashion  of its kind  it flew with sudden starts and turns  seeming to vanish here  and reappear there  once hapley struck  and missed  then again     the third time he hit his microscope  the instrument swayed  struck and  overturned the lamp  and fell noisily upon the floor  the lamp turned over  on the table and  very luckily  went out  hapley was left in the dark   with a start he felt the strange moth blunder into his face     it was maddening  he had no lights  if he opened the door of the room the  thing would get away  in the darkness he saw pawkins quite distinctly  laughing at him  pawkins had ever an oily laugh  he swore furiously and  stamped his foot on the floor     there was a timid rapping at the door     then it opened  perhaps a foot  and very slowly  the alarmed face of the  landlady appeared behind a pink candle flame  she wore a night cap over  her grey hair and had some purple garment over her shoulders   what   was  that fearful smash   she said   has anything      the strange  moth appeared fluttering about the chink of the door   shut that door    said hapley  and suddenly rushed at her     the door slammed hastily  hapley was left alone in the dark  then in the  pause he heard his landlady scuttle upstairs  lock her door  and drag  something heavy across the room and put against it     it became evident to hapley that his conduct and appearance had been  strange and alarming  confound the moth  and pawkins  however  it was a  pity to lose the moth now  he felt his way into the hall and found the  matches  after sending his hat down upon the floor with a noise like a  drum  with the lighted candle he returned to the sitting room  no moth was  to be seen  yet once for a moment it seemed that the thing was fluttering  round his head  hapley very suddenly decided to give up the moth and go to  bed  but he was excited  all night long his sleep was broken by dreams of  the moth  pawkins  and his landlady  twice in the night he turned out and  soused his head in cold water     one thing was very clear to him  his landlady could not possibly  understand about the strange moth  especially as he had failed to catch  it  no one but an entomologist would understand quite how he felt  she was  probably frightened at his behaviour  and yet he failed to see how he  could explain it  he decided to say nothing further about the events of  last night  after breakfast he saw her in her garden  and decided to go  out and talk to reassure her  he talked to her about beans and potatoes   bees  caterpillars  and the price of fruit  she replied in her usual  manner  but she looked at him a little suspiciously  and kept walking as  he walked  so that there was always a bed of flowers  or a row of beans   or something of the sort  between them  after a while he began to feel  singularly irritated at this  and to conceal his vexation went indoors and  presently went out for a walk     the moth  or butterfly  trailing an odd flavour of pawkins with it  kept  coming into that walk  though he did his best to keep his mind off it   once he saw it quite distinctly  with its wings flattened out  upon the  old stone wall that runs along the west edge of the park  but going up to  it he found it was only two lumps of grey and yellow lichen   this   said  hapley   is the reverse of mimicry  instead of a butterfly looking like a  stone  here is a stone looking like a butterfly   once something hovered  and fluttered round his head  but by an effort of will he drove that  impression out of his mind again     in the afternoon hapley called upon the vicar  and argued with him upon  theological questions  they sat in the little arbour covered with briar   and smoked as they wrangled   look at that moth   said hapley  suddenly   pointing to the edge of the wooden table      where   said the vicar      you don t see a moth on the edge of the table there   said hapley      certainly not   said the vicar     hapley was thunderstruck  he gasped  the vicar was staring at him  clearly  the man saw nothing   the eye of faith is no better than the eye of  science   said hapley awkwardly      i don t see your point   said the vicar  thinking it was part of the  argument     that night hapley found the moth crawling over his counterpane  he sat on  the edge of the bed in his shirt sleeves and reasoned with himself  was it  pure hallucination  he knew he was slipping  and he battled for his sanity  with the same silent energy he had formerly displayed against pawkins  so  persistent is mental habit  that he felt as if it were still a struggle  with pawkins  he was well versed in psychology  he knew that such visual  illusions do come as a result of mental strain  but the point was  he did  not only  see  the moth  he had heard it when it touched the edge of  the lampshade  and afterwards when it hit against the wall  and he had  felt it strike his face in the dark     he looked at it  it was not at all dreamlike  but perfectly clear and  solid looking in the candle light  he saw the hairy body  and the short  feathery antennae  the jointed legs  even a place where the down was  rubbed from the wing  he suddenly felt angry with himself for being afraid  of a little insect     his landlady had got the servant to sleep with her that night  because she  was afraid to be alone  in addition she had locked the door  and put the  chest of drawers against it  they listened and talked in whispers after  they had gone to bed  but nothing occurred to alarm them  about eleven  they had ventured to put the candle out  and had both dozed off to sleep   they woke up with a start  and sat up in bed  listening in the darkness     then they heard slippered feet going to and fro in hapley s room  a chair  was overturned  and there was a violent dab at the wall  then a china  mantel ornament smashed upon the fender  suddenly the door of the room  opened  and they heard him upon the landing  they clung to one another   listening  he seemed to be dancing upon the staircase  now he would go  down three or four steps quickly  then up again  then hurry down into the  hall  they heard the umbrella stand go over  and the fanlight break  then  the bolt shot and the chain rattled  he was opening the door     they hurried to the window  it was a dim grey night  an almost unbroken  sheet of watery cloud was sweeping across the moon  and the hedge and  trees in front of the house were black against the pale roadway  they saw  hapley  looking like a ghost in his shirt and white trousers  running to  and fro in the road  and beating the air  now he would stop  now he would  dart very rapidly at something invisible  now he would move upon it with  stealthy strides  at last he went out of sight up the road towards the  down  then  while they argued who should go down and lock the door  he  returned  he was walking very fast  and he came straight into the house   closed the door carefully  and went quietly up to his bedroom  then  everything was silent      mrs  colville   said hapley  calling down the staircase next morning   i  hope i did not alarm you last night       you may well ask that   said mrs  colville      the fact is  i am a sleep walker  and the last two nights i have been  without my sleeping mixture  there is nothing to be alarmed about  really   i am sorry i made such an ass of myself  i will go over the down to  shoreham  and get some stuff to make me sleep soundly  i ought to have  done that yesterday      but half way over the down  by the chalk pits  the moth came upon hapley  again  he went on  trying to keep his mind upon chess problems  but it was  no good  the thing fluttered into his face  and he struck at it with his  hat in self defence  then rage  the old rage  the rage he had so often  felt against pawkins  came upon him again  he went on  leaping and  striking at the eddying insect  suddenly he trod on nothing  and fell  headlong     there was a gap in his sensations  and hapley found himself sitting on the  heap of flints in front of the opening of the chalk pits  with a leg  twisted back under him  the strange moth was still fluttering round his  head  he struck at it with his hand  and turning his head saw two men  approaching him  one was the village doctor  it occurred to hapley that  this was lucky  then it came into his mind with extraordinary vividness   that no one would ever be able to see the strange moth except himself  and  that it behoved him to keep silent about it     late that night  however  after his broken leg was set  he was feverish  and forgot his self restraint  he was lying flat on his bed  and he began  to run his eyes round the room to see if the moth was still about  he  tried not to do this  but it was no good  he soon caught sight of the  thing resting close to his hand  by the night light  on the green  table cloth  the wings quivered  with a sudden wave of anger he smote at  it with his fist  and the nurse woke up with a shriek  he had missed it      that moth   he said  and then   it was fancy  nothing      all the time he could see quite clearly the insect going round the cornice  and darting across the room  and he could also see that the nurse saw  nothing of it and looked at him strangely  he must keep himself in hand   he knew he was a lost man if he did not keep himself in hand  but as the  night waned the fever grew upon him  and the very dread he had of seeing  the moth made him see it  about five  just as the dawn was grey  he tried  to get out of bed and catch it  though his leg was afire with pain  the  nurse had to struggle with him     on account of this  they tied him down to the bed  at this the moth grew  bolder  and once he felt it settle in his hair  then  because he struck  out violently with his arms  they tied these also  at this the moth came  and crawled over his face  and hapley wept  swore  screamed  prayed for  them to take it off him  unavailingly     the doctor was a blockhead  a just qualified general practitioner  and  quite ignorant of mental science  he simply said there was no moth  had he  possessed the wit  he might still  perhaps  have saved hapley from his  fate by entering into his delusion  and covering his face with gauze  as  he prayed might be done  but  as i say  the doctor was a blockhead  and  until the leg was healed hapley was kept tied to his bed  and with the  imaginary moth crawling over him  it never left him while he was awake and  it grew to a monster in his dreams  while he was awake he longed for  sleep  and from sleep he awoke screaming     so now hapley is spending the remainder of his days in a padded room   worried by a moth that no one else can see  the asylum doctor calls it  hallucination  but hapley  when he is in his easier mood  and can talk   says it is the ghost of pawkins  and consequently a unique specimen and  well worth the trouble of catching             x       the treasure in the forest       the canoe was now approaching the land  the bay opened out  and a gap in  the white surf of the reef marked where the little river ran out to the  sea  the thicker and deeper green of the virgin forest showed its course  down the distant hill slope  the forest here came close to the beach  far  beyond  dim and almost cloudlike in texture  rose the mountains  like  suddenly frozen waves  the sea was still save for an almost imperceptible  swell  the sky blazed     the man with the carved paddle stopped   it should be somewhere here   he  said  he shipped the paddle and held his arms out straight before him     the other man had been in the fore part of the canoe  closely scrutinising  the land  he had a sheet of yellow paper on his knee      come and look at this  evans   he said     both men spoke in low tones  and their lips were hard and dry     the man called evans came swaying along the canoe until he could look over  his companion s shoulder     the paper had the appearance of a rough map  by much folding it was  creased and worn to the pitch of separation  and the second man held the  discoloured fragments together where they had parted  on it one could  dimly make out  in almost obliterated pencil  the outline of the bay      here   said evans   is the reef  and here is the gap   he ran his  thumb nail over the chart      this curved and twisting line is the river  i could do with a drink  now   and this star is the place       you see this dotted line   said the man with the map   it is a straight  line  and runs from the opening of the reef to a clump of palm trees  the  star comes just where it cuts the river  we must mark the place as we go  into the lagoon       it s queer   said evans  after a pause   what these little marks down  here are for  it looks like the plan of a house or something  but what all  these little dashes  pointing this way and that  may mean i can t get a  notion  and what s the writing       chinese   said the man with the map      of course   he  was a chinee   said evans      they all were   said the man with the map     they both sat for some minutes staring at the land  while the canoe  drifted slowly  then evans looked towards the paddle      your turn with the paddle now  hooker   said he     and his companion quietly folded up his map  put it in his pocket  passed  evans carefully  and began to paddle  his movements were languid  like  those of a man whose strength was nearly exhausted     evans sat with his eyes half closed  watching the frothy breakwater of the  coral creep nearer and nearer  the sky was like a furnace  for the sun was  near the zenith  though they were so near the treasure he did not feel the  exaltation he had anticipated  the intense excitement of the struggle for  the plan  and the long night voyage from the mainland in the unprovisioned  canoe had  to use his own expression   taken it out of him   he tried to  arouse himself by directing his mind to the ingots the chinamen had spoken  of  but it would not rest there  it came back headlong to the thought of  sweet water rippling in the river  and to the almost unendurable dryness  of his lips and throat  the rhythmic wash of the sea upon the reef was  becoming audible now  and it had a pleasant sound in his ears  the water  washed along the side of the canoe  and the paddle dripped between each  stroke  presently he began to doze     he was still dimly conscious of the island  but a queer dream texture  interwove with his sensations  once again it was the night when he and  hooker had hit upon the chinamen s secret  he saw the moonlit trees  the  little fire burning  and the black figures of the three chinamen  silvered  on one side by moonlight  and on the other glowing from the firelight  and  heard them talking together in pigeon english  for they came from  different provinces  hooker had caught the drift of their talk first  and  had motioned to him to listen  fragments of the conversation were  inaudible  and fragments incomprehensible  a spanish galleon from the  philippines hopelessly aground  and its treasure buried against the day of  return  lay in the background of the story  a shipwrecked crew thinned by  disease  a quarrel or so  and the needs of discipline  and at last taking  to their boats never to be heard of again  then chang hi  only a year  since  wandering ashore  had happened upon the ingots hidden for two  hundred years  had deserted his junk  and reburied them with infinite  toil  single handed but very safe  he laid great stress on the safety  it  was a secret of his  now he wanted help to return and exhume them   presently the little map fluttered and the voices sank  a fine story for  two  stranded british wastrels to hear  evans  dream shifted to the moment  when he had chang hi s pigtail in his hand  the life of a chinaman is  scarcely sacred like a european s  the cunning little face of chang hi   first keen and furious like a startled snake  and then fearful   treacherous  and pitiful  became overwhelmingly prominent in the dream  at  the end chang hi had grinned  a most incomprehensible and startling grin   abruptly things became very unpleasant  as they will do at times in  dreams  chang hi gibbered and threatened him  he saw in his dream heaps  and heaps of gold  and chang hi intervening and struggling to hold him  back from it  he took chang hi by the pig tail  how big the yellow brute  was  and how he struggled and grinned  he kept growing bigger  too  then  the bright heaps of gold turned to a roaring furnace  and a vast devil   surprisingly like chang hi  but with a huge black tail  began to feed him  with coals  they burnt his mouth horribly  another devil was shouting his  name   evans  evans  you sleepy fool    or was it hooker     he woke up  they were in the mouth of the lagoon      there are the three palm trees  it must be in a line with that clump of  bushes   said his companion   mark that  if we  go to those bushes and  then strike into the bush in a straight line from here  we shall come to  it when we come to the stream      they could see now where the mouth of the stream opened out  at the sight  of it evans revived   hurry up  man   he said   or by heaven i shall have  to drink sea water   he gnawed his hand and stared at the gleam of silver  among the rocks and green tangle     presently he turned almost fiercely upon hooker   give  me  the  paddle   he said     so they reached the river mouth  a little way up hooker took some water in  the hollow of his hand  tasted it  and spat it out  a little further he  tried again   this will do   he said  and they began drinking eagerly      curse this   said evans suddenly   it s too slow   and  leaning  dangerously over the fore part of the canoe  he began to suck up the water  with his lips     presently they made an end of drinking  and  running the canoe into a  little creek  were about to land among the thick growth that overhung the  water      we shall have to scramble through this to the beach to find our bushes  and get the line to the place   said evans      we had better paddle round   said hooker     so they pushed out again into the river and paddled back down it to the  sea  and along the shore to the place where the clump of bushes grew  here  they landed  pulled the light canoe far up the beach  and then went up  towards the edge of the jungle until they could see the opening of the  reef and the bushes in a straight line  evans had taken a native implement  out of the canoe  it was l shaped  and the transverse piece was armed with  polished stone  hooker carried the paddle   it is straight now in this  direction   said he   we must push through this till we strike the stream   then we must prospect      they pushed through a close tangle of reeds  broad fronds  and young  trees  and at first it was toilsome going  but very speedily the trees  became larger and the ground beneath them opened out  the blaze of the  sunlight was replaced by insensible degrees by cool shadow  the trees  became at last vast pillars that rose up to a canopy of greenery far  overhead  dim white flowers hung from their stems  and ropy creepers swung  from tree to tree  the shadow deepened  on the ground  blotched fungi and  a red brown incrustation became frequent     evans shivered   it seems almost cold here after the blaze outside       i hope we are keeping to the straight   said hooker     presently they saw  far ahead  a gap in the sombre darkness where white  shafts of hot sunlight smote into the forest  there also was brilliant  green undergrowth and coloured flowers  then they heard the rush of water      here is the river  we should be close to it now   said hooker     the vegetation was thick by the river bank  great plants  as yet unnamed   grew among the roots of the big trees  and spread rosettes of huge green  fans towards the strip of sky  many flowers and a creeper with shiny  foliage clung to the exposed stems  on the water of the broad  quiet pool  which the treasure seekers now overlooked there floated big oval leaves  and a waxen  pinkish white flower not unlike a water lily  further  as the  river bent away from them  the water suddenly frothed and became noisy in  a rapid      well   said evans      we have swerved a little from the straight   said hooker   that was to be  expected      he turned and looked into the dim cool shadows of the silent forest behind  them   if we beat a little way up and down the stream we should come to  something       you said    began evans       he  said there was a heap of stones   said hooker     the two men looked at each other for a moment      let us try a little down stream first   said evans     they advanced slowly  looking curiously about them  suddenly evans  stopped   what the devil s that   he said     hooker followed his finger   something blue   he said  it had come into  view as they topped a gentle swell of the ground  then he began to  distinguish what it was     he advanced suddenly with hasty steps  until the body that belonged to the  limp hand and arm had become visible  his grip tightened on the implement  he carried  the thing was the figure of a chinaman lying on his face  the   abandon  of the pose was unmistakable     the two men drew closer together  and stood staring silently at this  ominous dead body  it lay in a clear space among the trees  near by was a  spade after the chinese pattern  and further off lay a scattered heap of  stones  close to a freshly dug hole      somebody has been here before   said hooker  clearing his throat     then suddenly evans began to swear and rave  and stamp upon the ground     hooker turned white but said nothing  he advanced towards the prostrate  body  he saw the neck was puffed and purple  and the hands and ankles  swollen   pah   he said  and suddenly turned away and went towards the  excavation  he gave a cry of surprise  he shouted to evans  who was  following him slowly      you fool  it s all right  it s here still   then he turned again and  looked at the dead chinaman  and then again at the hole     evans hurried to the hole  already half exposed by the ill fated wretch  beside them lay a number of dull yellow bars  he bent down in the hole   and  clearing off the soil with his bare hands  hastily pulled one of the  heavy masses out  as he did so a little thorn pricked his hand  he pulled  the delicate spike out with his fingers and lifted the ingot      only gold or lead could weigh like this   he said exultantly     hooker was still looking at the dead chinaman  he was puzzled      he stole a march on his friends   he said at last   he came here alone   and some poisonous snake has killed him    i wonder how he found the  place      evans stood with the ingot in his hands  what did a dead chinaman signify    we shall have to take this stuff to the mainland piecemeal  and bury it  there for a while  how shall we get it to the canoe      he took his jacket off and spread it on the ground  and flung two or three  ingots into it  presently he found that another little thorn had punctured  his skin      this is as much as we can carry   said he  then suddenly  with a queer  rush of irritation   what are you staring at      hooker turned to him   i can t stand him      he nodded towards the  corpse   it s so like          rubbish   said evans   all chinamen are alike      hooker looked into his face   i m going to bury  that   anyhow   before i lend a hand with this stuff       don t be a fool  hooker   said evans   let that mass of corruption bide      hooker hesitated  and then his eye went carefully over the brown soil  about them   it scares me somehow   he said      the thing is   said evans   what to do with these ingots  shall we  re bury them over here  or take them across the strait in the canoe      hooker thought  his puzzled gaze wandered among the tall tree trunks  and  up into the remote sunlit greenery overhead  he shivered again as his eye  rested upon the blue figure of the chinaman  he stared searchingly among  the grey depths between the trees      what s come to you  hooker   said evans   have you lost your wits       let s get the gold out of this place  anyhow   said hooker     he took the ends of the collar of the coat in his hands  and evans took  the opposite corners  and they lifted the mass   which way   said evans    to the canoe       it s queer   said evans  when they had advanced only a few steps   but my  arms ache still with that paddling       curse it   he said   but they ache  i must rest      they let the coat down  evans  face was white  and little drops of sweat  stood out upon his forehead   it s stuffy  somehow  in this forest      then with an abrupt transition to unreasonable anger   what is the good of  waiting here all the day  lend a hand  i say  you have done nothing but  moon since we saw the dead chinaman      hooker was looking steadfastly at his companion s face  he helped raise  the coat bearing the ingots  and they went forward perhaps a hundred yards  in silence  evans began to breathe heavily   can t you speak   he said      what s the matter with you   said hooker     evans stumbled  and then with a sudden curse flung the coat from him  he  stood for a moment staring at hooker  and then with a groan clutched at  his own throat      don t come near me   he said  and went and leant against a tree  then in  a steadier voice   i ll be better in a minute      presently his grip upon the trunk loosened  and he slipped slowly down the  stem of the tree until he was a crumpled heap at its foot  his hands were  clenched convulsively  his face became distorted with pain  hooker  approached him      don t touch me  don t touch me   said evans in a stifled voice   put the  gold back on the coat       can t i do anything for you   said hooker      put the gold back on the coat      as hooker handled the ingots he felt a little prick on the ball of his  thumb  he looked at his hand and saw a slender thorn  perhaps two inches  in length     evans gave an inarticulate cry and rolled over     hooker s jaw dropped  he stared at the thorn for a moment with dilated  eyes  then he looked at evans  who was now crumpled together on the  ground  his back bending and straightening spasmodically  then he looked  through the pillars of the trees and net work of creeper stems  to where  in the dim grey shadow the blue clad body of the chinaman was still  indistinctly visible  he thought of the little dashes in the corner of the  plan  and in a moment he understood      god help me   he said  for the thorns were similar to those the dyaks  poison and use in their blowing tubes  he understood now what chang hi s  assurance of the safety of his treasure meant  he understood that grin  now      evans   he cried     but evans was silent and motionless  save for a horrible spasmodic  twitching of his limbs  a profound silence brooded over the forest     then hooker began to suck furiously at the little pink spot on the ball of  his thumb  sucking for dear life  presently he felt a strange aching pain  in his arms and shoulders  and his fingers seemed difficult to bend  then  he knew that sucking was no good     abruptly he stopped  and sitting down by the pile of ingots  and resting  his chin upon his hands and his elbows upon his knees  stared at the  distorted but still quivering body of his companion  chang hi s grin came  into his mind again  the dull pain spread towards his throat and grew  slowly in intensity  far above him a faint breeze stirred the greenery   and the white petals of some unknown flower came floating down through the  gloom             xi       the story of the late mr  elvesham       i set this story down  not expecting it will be believed  but  if  possible  to prepare a way of escape for the next victim  he  perhaps  may  profit by my misfortune  my own case  i know  is hopeless  and i am now in  some measure prepared to meet my fate     my name is edward george eden  i was born at trentham  in staffordshire   my father being employed in the gardens there  i lost my mother when i was  three years old  and my father when i was five  my uncle  george eden   then adopting me as his own son  he was a single man  self educated  and  well known in birmingham as an enterprising journalist  he educated me  generously  fired my ambition to succeed in the world  and at his death   which happened four years ago  left me his entire fortune  a matter of  about five hundred pounds after all outgoing charges were paid  i was then  eighteen  he advised me in his will to expend the money in completing my  education  i had already chosen the profession of medicine  and through  his posthumous generosity and my good fortune in a scholarship  competition  i became a medical student at university college  london  at  the time of the beginning of my story i lodged at   a university street in  a little upper room  very shabbily furnished and draughty  overlooking the  back of shoolbred s premises  i used this little room both to live in and  sleep in  because i was anxious to eke out my means to the very last  shillings worth     i was taking a pair of shoes to be mended at a shop in the tottenham court  road when i first encountered the little old man with the yellow face   with whom my life has now become so inextricably entangled  he was  standing on the kerb  and staring at the number on the door in a doubtful  way  as i opened it  his eyes  they were dull grey eyes  and reddish under  the rims  fell to my face  and his countenance immediately assumed an  expression of corrugated amiability      you come   he said   apt to the moment  i had forgotten the number of  your house  how do you do  mr  eden      i was a little astonished at his familiar address  for i had never set  eyes on the man before  i was a little annoyed  too  at his catching me  with my boots under my arm  he noticed my lack of cordiality      wonder who the deuce i am  eh  a friend  let me assure you  i have seen  you before  though you haven t seen me  is there anywhere where i can talk  to you      i hesitated  the shabbiness of my room upstairs was not a matter for every  stranger   perhaps   said i   we might walk down the street  i m  unfortunately prevented    my gesture explained the sentence before i had  spoken it      the very thing   he said  and faced this way  and then that   the street   which way shall we go   i slipped my boots down in the passage   look  here   he said abruptly   this business of mine is a rigmarole  come and  lunch with me  mr  eden  i m an old man  a very old man  and not good at  explanations  and what with my piping voice and the clatter of the  traffic         he laid a persuasive skinny hand that trembled a little upon my arm     i was not so old that an old man might not treat me to a lunch  yet at the  same time i was not altogether pleased by this abrupt invitation   i had  rather      i began   but i had rather   he said  catching me up   and a  certain civility is surely due to my grey hairs      and so i consented  and went with him     he took me to blavitiski s  i had to walk slowly to accommodate myself to  his paces  and over such a lunch as i had never tasted before  he fended  off my leading question  and i took a better note of his appearance  his  clean shaven face was lean and wrinkled  his shrivelled  lips fell over a  set of false teeth  and his white hair was thin and rather long  he seemed  small to me   though indeed  most people seemed small to me   and his  shoulders were rounded and bent  and watching him  i could not help but  observe that he too was taking note of me  running his eyes  with a  curious touch of greed in them  over me  from my broad shoulders to my  suntanned hands  and up to my freckled face again   and now   said he  as  we lit our cigarettes   i must tell you of the business in hand      i must tell you  then  that i am an old man  a very old man   he paused  momentarily   and it happens that i have money that i must presently be  leaving  and never a child have i to leave it to   i thought of the  confidence trick  and resolved i would be on the alert for the vestiges of  my five hundred pounds  he proceeded to enlarge on his loneliness  and the  trouble he had to find a proper disposition of his money   i have weighed  this plan and that plan  charities  institutions  and scholarships  and  libraries  and i have come to this conclusion at last    he fixed his eyes  on my face    that i will find some young fellow  ambitious  pure minded   and poor  healthy in body and healthy in mind  and  in short  make him my  heir  give him all that i have   he repeated   give him all that i have   so that he will suddenly be lifted out of all the trouble and struggle in  which his sympathies have been educated  to freedom and influence      i tried to seem disinterested  with a transparent hypocrisy i said   and  you want my help  my professional services maybe  to find that person      he smiled  and looked at me over his cigarette  and i laughed at his quiet  exposure of my modest pretence      what a career such a man might have   he said   it fills me with envy to  think how i have accumulated that another man may spend         but there are conditions  of course  burdens to be imposed  he must  for  instance  take my name  you cannot expect everything without some return   and i must go into all the circumstances of his life before i can accept  him  he  must  be sound  i must know his heredity  how his parents  and grandparents died  have the strictest inquiries made into his private  morals      this modified my secret congratulations a little      and do i understand   said i   that i          yes   he said  almost fiercely   you   you       i answered never a word  my imagination was dancing wildly  my innate  scepticism was useless to modify its transports  there was not a particle  of gratitude in my mind  i did not know what to say nor how to say it    but why me in particular   i said at last     he had chanced to hear of me from professor haslar  he said  as a  typically sound and sane young man  and he wished  as far as possible  to  leave his money where health and integrity were assured     that was my first meeting with the little old man  he was mysterious about  himself  he would not give his name yet  he said  and after i had answered  some questions of his  he left me at the blavitiski portal  i noticed that  he drew a handful of gold coins from his pocket when it came to paying for  the lunch  his insistence upon bodily health was curious  in accordance  with an arrangement we had made i applied that day for a life policy in  the loyal insurance company for a large sum  and i was exhaustively  overhauled by the medical advisers of that company in the subsequent week   even that did not satisfy him  and he insisted i must be re examined by  the great doctor henderson     it was friday in whitsun week before he came to a decision  he called me  down  quite late in the evening   nearly nine it was   from cramming  chemical equations for my preliminary scientific examination  he was  standing in the passage under the feeble gas lamp  and his face was a  grotesque interplay of shadows  he seemed more bowed than when i had first  seen him  and his cheeks had sunk in a little     his voice shook with emotion   everything is satisfactory  mr  eden   he  said   everything is quite  quite satisfactory  and this night of all  nights  you must dine with me and celebrate your  accession   he was  interrupted by a cough   you won t have long to wait  either   he said   wiping his handkerchief across his lips  and gripping my hand with his  long bony claw that was disengaged   certainly not very long to wait      we went into the street and called a cab  i remember every incident of  that drive vividly  the swift  easy motion  the vivid contrast of gas and  oil and electric light  the crowds of people in the streets  the place in  regent street to which we went  and the sumptuous dinner we were served  with there  i was disconcerted at first by the well dressed waiter s  glances at my rough clothes  bothered by the stones of the olives  but as  the champagne warmed my blood  my confidence revived  at first the old man  talked of himself  he had already told me his name in the cab  he was  egbert elvesham  the great philosopher  whose name i had known since i was  a lad at school  it seemed incredible to me that this man  whose  intelligence had so early dominated mine  this great abstraction  should  suddenly realise itself as this decrepit  familiar figure  i daresay every  young fellow who has suddenly fallen among celebrities has felt something  of my disappointment  he told me now of the future that the feeble streams  of his life would presently leave dry for me  houses  copyrights   investments  i had never suspected that philosophers were so rich  he  watched me drink and eat with a touch of envy   what a capacity for living  you have   he said  and then with a sigh  a sigh of relief i could have  thought it   it will not be long       ay   said i  my head swimming now with champagne   i have a future  perhaps  of a passing agreeable sort  thanks to you  i shall now have the  honour of your name  but you have a past  such a past as is worth all my  future      he shook his head and smiled  as i thought  with half sad appreciation of  my flattering admiration   that future   he said   would you in truth  change it   the waiter came with liqueurs   you will not perhaps mind  taking my name  taking my position  but would you indeed  willingly  take  my years       with your achievements   said i gallantly     he smiled again   kummel  both   he said to the waiter  and turned his  attention to a little paper packet he had taken from his pocket   this  hour   said he   this after dinner hour is the hour of small things  here  is a scrap of my unpublished wisdom   he opened the packet with his  shaking yellow fingers  and showed a little pinkish powder on the paper    this   said he   well  you must guess what it is  but kummel  put but a  dash of this powder in it  is himmel      his large greyish eyes watched mine with an inscrutable expression     it was a bit of a shock to me to find this great teacher gave his mind to  the flavour of liqueurs  however  i feigned an interest in his weakness   for i was drunk enough for such small sycophancy     he parted the powder between the little glasses  and  rising suddenly   with a strange unexpected dignity  held out his hand towards me  i  imitated his action  and the glasses rang   to a quick succession   said  he  and raised his glass towards his lips      not that   i said hastily   not that      he paused with the liqueur at the level of his chin  and his eyes blazing  into mine      to a long life   said i     he hesitated   to a long life   said he  with a sudden bark of laughter   and with eyes fixed on one another we tilted the little glasses  his eyes  looked straight into mine  and as i drained the stuff off  i felt a  curiously intense sensation  the first touch of it set my brain in a  furious tumult  i seemed to feel an actual physical stirring in my skull   and a seething humming filled my ears  i did not notice the flavour in my  mouth  the aroma that filled my throat  i saw only the grey intensity of  his gaze that burnt into mine  the draught  the mental confusion  the  noise and stirring in my head  seemed to last an interminable time   curious vague impressions of half forgotten things danced and vanished on  the edge of my consciousness  at last he broke the spell  with a sudden  explosive sigh he put down his glass      well   he said      it s glorious   said i  though i had not tasted the stuff     my head was spinning  i sat down  my brain was chaos  then my perception  grew clear and minute as though i saw things in a concave mirror  his  manner seemed to have changed into something nervous and hasty  he pulled  out his watch and grimaced at it   eleven seven  and to night i must    seven twenty five  waterloo  i must go at once   he called for the bill   and struggled with his coat  officious waiters came to our assistance  in  another moment i was wishing him good bye  over the apron of a cab  and  still with an absurd feeling of minute distinctness  as though  how can i  express it   i not only saw but  felt  through an inverted  opera glass      that stuff   he said  he put his hand to his forehead   i ought not to  have given it to you  it will make your head split to morrow  wait a  minute  here   he handed me out a little flat thing like a seidlitz powder    take that in water as you are going to bed  the other thing was a  drug  not till you re ready to go to bed  mind  it will clear your head   that s all  one more shake  futurus      i gripped his shrivelled claw   good bye   he said  and by the droop of  his eyelids i judged he too was a little under the influence of that  brain twisting cordial     he recollected something else with a start  felt in his breast pocket  and  produced another packet  this time a cylinder the size and shape of a  shaving stick   here   said he   i d almost forgotten  don t open this  until i come to morrow  but take it now      it was so heavy that i wellnigh dropped it   all ri    said i  and he  grinned at me through the cab window as the cabman flicked his horse into  wakefulness  it was a white packet he had given me  with red seals at  either end and along its edge   if this isn t money   said i   it s  platinum or lead      i stuck it with elaborate care into my pocket  and with a whirling brain  walked home through the regent street loiterers and the dark back streets  beyond portland road  i remember the sensations of that walk very vividly   strange as they were  i was still so far myself that i could notice my  strange mental state  and wonder whether this stuff i had had was opium  a  drug beyond my experience  it is hard now to describe the peculiarity of  my mental strangeness  mental doubling vaguely expresses it  as i was  walking up regent street i found in my mind a queer persuasion that it  was waterloo station  and had an odd impulse to get into the polytechnic  as a man might get into a train  i put a knuckle in my eye  and it was  regent street  how can i express it  you see a skilful actor looking  quietly at you  he pulls a grimace  and lo   another person  is it too  extravagant if i tell you that it seemed to me as if regent street had   for the moment  done that  then  being persuaded it was regent street  again  i was oddly muddled about some fantastic reminiscences that cropped  up   thirty years ago   thought i   it was here that i quarrelled with my  brother   then i burst out laughing  to the astonishment and encouragement  of a group of night prowlers  thirty years ago i did not exist  and never  in my life had i boasted a brother  the stuff was surely liquid folly  for  the poignant regret for that lost brother still clung to me  along  portland road the madness took another turn  i began to recall vanished  shops  and to compare the street with what it used to be  confused   troubled thinking is comprehensible enough after the drink i had taken   but what puzzled me were these curiously vivid phantasm memories that had  crept into my mind  and not only the memories that had crept in  but also  the memories that had slipped out  i stopped opposite stevens   the  natural history dealer s  and cudgelled my brains to think what he had to  do with me  a  bus went by  and sounded exactly like the rumbling of a  train  i seemed to be dipping into some dark  remote pit for the  recollection   of course   said i  at last   he has promised me three  frogs to morrow  odd i should have forgotten      do they still show children dissolving views  in those i remember one view  would begin like a faint ghost  and grow and oust another  in just that  way it seemed to me that a ghostly set of new sensations was struggling  with those of my ordinary self     i went on through euston road to tottenham court road  puzzled  and a  little frightened  and scarcely noticed the unusual way i was taking  for  commonly i used to cut through the intervening network of back streets  i  turned into university street  to discover that i had forgotten my number   only by a strong effort did i recall   a  and even then it seemed to me  that it was a thing some forgotten person had told me  i tried to steady  my mind by recalling the incidents of the dinner  and for the life of me i  could conjure up no picture of my host s face  i saw him only as a shadowy  outline  as one might see oneself reflected in a window through which one  was looking  in his place  however  i had a curious exterior vision of  myself  sitting at a table  flushed  bright eyed  and talkative      i must take this other powder   said i   this is getting impossible      i tried the wrong side of the hall for my candle and the matches  and had  a doubt of which landing my room might be on   i m drunk   i said   that s  certain   and blundered needlessly on the staircase to sustain the  proposition     at the first glance my room seemed unfamiliar   what rot   i said  and  stared about me  i seemed to bring myself back by the effort  and the odd  phantasmal quality passed into the concrete familiar  there was the old  glass still  with my notes on the albumens stuck in the corner of the  frame  my old everyday suit of clothes pitched about the floor  and yet it  was not so real after all  i felt an idiotic persuasion trying to creep  into my mind  as it were  that i was in a railway carriage in a train just  stopping  that i was peering out of the window at some unknown station  i  gripped the bed rail firmly to reassure myself   it s clairvoyance   perhaps   i said   i must write to the psychical research society      i put the rouleau on my dressing table  sat on my bed  and began to take  off my boots  it was as if the picture of my present sensations was  painted over some other picture that was trying to show through   curse  it   said i   my wits are going  or am i in two places at once    half undressed  i tossed the powder into a glass and drank it off  it  effervesced  and became a fluorescent amber colour  before i was in bed  my mind was already tranquillised  i felt the pillow at my cheek  and  thereupon i must have fallen asleep                                                 i awoke abruptly out of a dream of strange beasts  and found myself lying  on my back  probably every one knows that dismal  emotional dream from  which one escapes  awake indeed  but strangely cowed  there was a curious  taste in my mouth  a tired feeling in my limbs  a sense of cutaneous  discomfort  i lay with my head motionless on my pillow  expecting that my  feeling of strangeness and terror would pass away  and that i should then  doze off again to sleep  but instead of that  my uncanny sensations  increased  at first i could perceive nothing wrong about me  there was a  faint light in the room  so faint that it was the very next thing to  darkness  and the furniture stood out in it as vague blots of absolute  darkness  i stared with my eyes just over the bedclothes     it came into my mind that some one had entered the room to rob me of my  rouleau of money  but after lying for some moments  breathing regularly to  simulate sleep  i realised this was mere fancy  nevertheless  the uneasy  assurance of something wrong kept fast hold of me  with an effort i raised  my head from the pillow  and peered about me at the dark  what it was i  could not conceive  i looked at the dim shapes around me  the greater and  lesser darknesses that indicated curtains  table  fireplace  bookshelves   and so forth  then i began to perceive something unfamiliar in the forms  of the darkness  had the bed turned round  yonder should be the  bookshelves  and something shrouded and pallid rose there  something that  would not answer to the bookshelves  however i looked at it  it was far  too big to be my shirt thrown on a chair     overcoming a childish terror  i threw back the bedclothes and thrust my  leg out of bed  instead of coming out of my truckle bed upon the floor  i  found my foot scarcely reached the edge of the mattress  i made another  step  as it were  and sat up on the edge of the bed  by the side of my bed  should be the candle  and the matches upon the broken chair  i put out my  hand and touched  nothing  i waved my hand in the darkness  and it came  against some heavy hanging  soft and thick in texture  which gave a  rustling noise at my touch  i grasped this and pulled it  it appeared to  be a curtain suspended over the head of my bed     i was now thoroughly awake  and beginning to realise that i was in a  strange room  i was puzzled  i tried to recall the overnight  circumstances  and i found them now  curiously enough  vivid in my memory   the supper  my reception of the little packages  my wonder whether i was  intoxicated  my slow undressing  the coolness to my flushed face of my  pillow  i felt a sudden distrust  was that last night  or the night  before  at any rate  this room was strange to me  and i could not imagine  how i had got into it  the dim  pallid outline was growing paler  and i  perceived it was a window  with the dark shape of an oval toilet glass  against the weak intimation of the dawn that filtered through the blind  i  stood up  and was surprised by a curious feeling of weakness and  unsteadiness  with trembling hands outstretched  i walked slowly towards  the window  getting  nevertheless  a bruise on the knee from a chair by  the way  i fumbled round the glass  which was large  with handsome brass  sconces  to find the blind cord  i could not find any  by chance i took  hold of the tassel  and with the click of a spring the blind ran up     i found myself looking out upon a scene that was altogether strange to me   the night was overcast  and through the flocculent grey of the heaped  clouds there filtered a faint half light of dawn  just at the edge of the  sky the cloud canopy had a blood red rim  below  everything was dark and  indistinct  dim hills in the distance  a vague mass of buildings running  up into pinnacles  trees like spilt ink  and below the window a tracery of  black bushes and pale grey paths  it was so unfamiliar that for the moment  i thought myself still dreaming  i felt the toilet table  it appeared to  be made of some polished wood  and was rather elaborately furnished  there  were little cut glass bottles and a brush upon it  there was also a queer  little object  horse shoe shape it felt  with smooth  hard projections   lying in a saucer  i could find no matches nor candlestick     i turned my eyes to the room again  now the blind was up  faint spectres  of its furnishing came out of the darkness  there was a huge curtained  bed  and the fireplace at its foot had a large white mantel with something  of the shimmer of marble     i leant against the toilet table  shut my eyes and opened them again  and  tried to think  the whole thing was far too real for dreaming  i was  inclined to imagine there was still some hiatus in my memory  as a  consequence of my draught of that strange liqueur  that i had come into my  inheritance perhaps  and suddenly lost my recollection of everything since  my good fortune had been announced  perhaps if i waited a little  things  would be clearer to me again  yet my dinner with old elvesham was now  singularly vivid and recent  the champagne  the observant waiters  the  powder  and the liqueurs  i could have staked my soul it all happened a  few hours ago     and then occurred a thing so trivial and yet so terrible to me that i  shiver now to think of that moment  i spoke aloud  i said   how the devil  did i get here        and the voice was not my own      it was not my own  it was thin  the articulation was slurred  the  resonance of my facial bones was different  then  to reassure myself i ran  one hand over the other  and felt loose folds of skin  the bony laxity of  age   surely   i said  in that horrible voice that had somehow established  itself in my throat   surely this thing is a dream   almost as quickly as  if i did it involuntarily  i thrust my fingers into my mouth  my teeth  had gone  my finger tips ran on the flaccid surface of an even row of  shrivelled gums  i was sick with dismay and disgust     i felt then a passionate desire to see myself  to realise at once in its  full horror the ghastly change that had come upon me  i tottered to the  mantel  and felt along it for matches  as i did so  a barking cough sprang  up in my throat  and i clutched the thick flannel nightdress i found about  me  there were no matches there  and i suddenly realised that my  extremities were cold  sniffing and coughing  whimpering a little   perhaps  i fumbled back to bed   it is surely a dream   i whispered to  myself as i clambered back   surely a dream   it was a senile repetition   i pulled the bedclothes over my shoulders  over my ears  i thrust my  withered hand under the pillow  and determined to compose myself to sleep   of course it was a dream  in the morning the dream would be over  and i  should wake up strong and vigorous again to my youth and studies  i shut  my eyes  breathed regularly  and  finding myself wakeful  began to count  slowly through the powers of three     but the thing i desired would not come  i could not get to sleep  and the  persuasion of the inexorable reality of the change that had happened to me  grew steadily  presently i found myself with my eyes wide open  the powers  of three forgotten  and my skinny fingers upon my shrivelled gums  i was   indeed  suddenly and abruptly  an old man  i had in some unaccountable  manner fallen through my life and come to old age  in some way i had been  cheated of all the best of my life  of love  of struggle  of strength  and  hope  i grovelled into the pillow and tried to persuade myself that such  hallucination was possible  imperceptibly  steadily  the dawn grew  clearer     at last  despairing of further sleep  i sat up in bed and looked about me   a chill twilight rendered the whole chamber visible  it was spacious and  well furnished  better furnished than any room i had ever slept in before   a candle and matches became dimly visible upon a little pedestal in a  recess  i threw back the bedclothes  and  shivering with the rawness of  the early morning  albeit it was summer time  i got out and lit the  candle  then  trembling horribly  so that the extinguisher rattled on its  spike  i tottered to the glass and saw   elvesham s face   it was  none the less horrible because i had already dimly feared as much  he had  already seemed physically weak and pitiful to me  but seen now  dressed  only in a coarse flannel nightdress  that fell apart and showed the  stringy neck  seen now as my own body  i cannot describe its desolate  decrepitude  the hollow cheeks  the straggling tail of dirty grey hair   the rheumy bleared eyes  the quivering  shrivelled lips  the lower  displaying a gleam of the pink interior lining  and those horrible dark  gums showing  you who are mind and body together  at your natural years   cannot imagine what this fiendish imprisonment meant to me  to be young  and full of the desire and energy of youth  and to be caught  and  presently to be crushed in this tottering ruin of a body       but i wander from the course of my story  for some time i must have been  stunned at this change that had come upon me  it was daylight when i did  so far gather myself together as to think  in some inexplicable way i had  been changed  though how  short of magic  the thing had been done  i could  not say  and as i thought  the diabolical ingenuity of elvesham came home  to me  it seemed plain to me that as i found myself in his  so he must be  in possession of  my  body  of my strength  that is  and my future   but how to prove it  then  as i thought  the thing became so incredible   even to me  that my mind reeled  and i had to pinch myself  to feel my  toothless gums  to see myself in the glass  and touch the things about me   before i could steady myself to face the facts again  was all life  hallucination  was i indeed elvesham  and he me  had i been dreaming of  eden overnight  was there any eden  but if i was elvesham  i should  remember where i was on the previous morning  the name of the town in  which i lived  what happened before the dream began  i struggled with my  thoughts  i recalled the queer doubleness of my memories overnight  but  now my mind was clear  not the ghost of any memories but those proper to  eden could i raise      this way lies insanity   i cried in my piping voice  i staggered to my  feet  dragged my feeble  heavy limbs to the washhand stand  and plunged my  grey head into a basin of cold water  then  towelling myself  i tried  again  it was no good  i felt beyond all question that i was indeed eden   not elvesham  but eden in elvesham s body     had i been a man of any other age  i might have given myself up to my fate  as one enchanted  but in these sceptical days miracles do not pass  current  here was some trick of psychology  what a drug and a steady stare  could do  a drug and a steady stare  or some similar treatment  could  surely undo  men have lost their memories before  but to exchange memories  as one does umbrellas  i laughed  alas  not a healthy laugh  but a  wheezing  senile titter  i could have fancied old elvesham laughing at my  plight  and a gust of petulant anger  unusual to me  swept across my  feelings  i began dressing eagerly in the clothes i found lying about on  the floor  and only realised when i was dressed that it was an evening  suit i had assumed  i opened the wardrobe and found some more ordinary  clothes  a pair of plaid trousers  and an old fashioned dressing gown  i  put a venerable smoking cap on my venerable head  and  coughing a little  from my exertions  tottered out upon the landing     it was then  perhaps  a quarter to six  and the blinds were closely drawn  and the house quite silent  the landing was a spacious one  a broad   richly carpeted staircase went down into the darkness of the hall below   and before me a door ajar showed me a writing desk  a revolving bookcase   the back of a study chair  and a fine array of bound books  shelf upon  shelf      my study   i mumbled  and walked across the landing  then at the sound of  my voice a thought struck me  and i went back to the bedroom and put in  the set of false teeth  they slipped in with the ease of old  habit    that s better   said i  gnashing them  and so returned to the study     the drawers of the writing desk were locked  its revolving top was also  locked  i could see no indications of the keys  and there were none in the  pockets of my trousers  i shuffled back at once to the bedroom  and went  through the dress suit  and afterwards the pockets of all the garments i  could find  i was very eager  and one might have imagined that burglars  had been at work  to see my room when i had done  not only were there no  keys to be found  but not a coin  nor a scrap of paper  save only the  receipted bill of the overnight dinner     a curious weariness asserted itself  i sat down and stared at the garments  flung here and there  their pockets turned inside out  my first frenzy had  already flickered out  every moment i was beginning to realise the immense  intelligence of the plans of my enemy  to see more and more clearly the  hopelessness of my position  with an effort i rose and hurried hobbling  into the study again  on the staircase was a housemaid pulling up the  blinds  she stared  i think  at the expression of my face  i shut the door  of the study behind me  and  seizing a poker  began an attack upon the  desk  that is how they found me  the cover of the desk was split  the lock  smashed  the letters torn out of the pigeon holes  and tossed about the  room  in my senile rage i had flung about the pens and other such light  stationery  and overturned the ink  moreover  a large vase upon the mantel  had got broken  i do not know how  i could find no cheque book  no money   no indications of the slightest use for the recovery of my body  i was  battering madly at the drawers  when the butler  backed by two  women servants  intruded upon me                                                 that simply is the story of my change  no one will believe my frantic  assertions  i am treated as one demented  and even at this moment i am  under restraint  but i am sane  absolutely sane  and to prove it i have  sat down to write this story minutely as the things happened to me  i  appeal to the reader  whether there is any trace of insanity in the style  or method  of the story he has been reading  i am a young man locked away  in an old man s body  but the clear fact is incredible to everyone   naturally i appear demented to those who will not believe this  naturally  i do not know the names of my secretaries  of the doctors who come to see  me  of my servants and neighbours  of this town  wherever it is  where i  find myself  naturally i lose myself in my own house  and suffer  inconveniences of every sort  naturally i ask the oddest questions   naturally i weep and cry out  and have paroxysms of despair  i have no  money and no cheque book  the bank will not recognise my signature  for i  suppose that  allowing for the feeble muscles i now have  my handwriting  is still eden s  these people about me will not let me go to the bank  personally  it seems  indeed  that there is no bank in this town  and that  i have an account in some part of london  it seems that elvesham kept the  name of his solicitor secret from all his household  i can ascertain  nothing  elvesham was  of course  a profound student of mental science   and all my declarations of the facts of the case merely confirm the theory  that my insanity is the outcome of overmuch brooding upon psychology   dreams of the personal identity indeed  two days ago i was a healthy  youngster  with all life before me  now i am a furious old man  unkempt   and desperate  and miserable  prowling about a great  luxurious  strange  house  watched  feared  and avoided as a lunatic by everyone about me  and  in london is elvesham beginning life again in a vigorous body  and with  all the accumulated knowledge and wisdom of threescore and ten  he has  stolen my life     what has happened i do not clearly know  in the study are volumes of  manuscript notes referring chiefly to the psychology of memory  and parts  of what may be either calculations or ciphers in symbols absolutely  strange to me  in some passages there are indications that he was also  occupied with the philosophy of mathematics  i take it he has transferred  the whole of his memories  the accumulation that makes up his personality   from this old withered brain of his to mine  and  similarly  that he has  transferred mine to his discarded tenement  practically  that is  he has  changed bodies  but how such a change may be possible is without the range  of my philosophy  i have been a materialist for all my thinking life  but  here  suddenly  is a clear case of man s detachability from matter     one desperate experiment i am about to try  i sit writing here before  putting the matter to issue  this morning  with the help of a table knife  that i had secreted at breakfast  i succeeded in breaking open a fairly  obvious secret drawer in this wrecked writing desk  i discovered nothing  save a little green glass phial containing a white powder  round the neck  of the phial was a label  and thereon was written this one word     release    this may be  is most probably  poison  i can understand  elvesham placing poison in my way  and i should be sure that it was his  intention so to get rid of the only living witness against him  were it  not for this careful concealment  the man has practically solved the  problem of immortality  save for the spite of chance  he will live in my  body until it has aged  and then  again  throwing that aside  he will  assume some other victim s youth and strength  when one remembers his  heartlessness  it is terrible to think of the ever growing experience  that    how long has he been leaping from body to body     but i tire of  writing  the powder appears to be soluble in water  the taste is not  unpleasant                                                 there the narrative found upon mr  elvesham s desk ends  his dead body lay  between the desk and the chair  the latter had been pushed back  probably  by his last convulsions  the story was written in pencil and in a crazy  hand  quite unlike his usual minute characters  there remain only two  curious facts to record  indisputably there was some connection between  eden and elvesham  since the whole of elvesham s property was bequeathed  to the young man  but he never inherited  when elvesham committed suicide   eden was  strangely enough  already dead  twenty four hours before  he had  been knocked down by a cab and killed instantly  at the crowded crossing  at the intersection of gower street and euston road  so that the only  human being who could have thrown light upon this fantastic narrative is  beyond the reach of questions  without further comment i leave this  extraordinary matter to the reader s individual judgment             xii       under the knife        what if i die under it   the thought recurred again and again  as i  walked home from haddon s  it was a purely personal question  i was spared  the deep anxieties of a married man  and i knew there were few of my  intimate friends but would find my death troublesome chiefly on account of  their duty of regret  i was surprised indeed  and perhaps a little  humiliated  as i turned the matter over  to think how few could possibly  exceed the conventional requirement  things came before me stripped of  glamour  in a clear dry light  during that walk from haddon s house over  primrose hill  there were the friends of my youth  i perceived now that  our affection was a tradition  which we foregathered rather laboriously to  maintain  there were the rivals and helpers of my later career  i suppose  i had been cold blooded or undemonstrative  one perhaps implies the other   it may be that even the capacity for friendship is a question of physique   there had been a time in my own life when i had grieved bitterly enough at  the loss of a friend  but as i walked home that afternoon the emotional  side of my imagination was dormant  i could not pity myself  nor feel  sorry for my friends  nor conceive of them as grieving for me     i was interested in this deadness of my emotional nature  no doubt a  concomitant of my stagnating physiology  and my thoughts wandered off  along the line it suggested  once before  in my hot youth  i had suffered  a sudden loss of blood  and had been within an ace of death  i remembered  now that my affections as well as my passions had drained out of me   leaving scarce anything but a tranquil resignation  a dreg of self pity   it had been weeks before the old ambitions and tendernesses and all the  complex moral interplay of a man had reasserted themselves  it occurred to  me that the real meaning of this numbness might be a gradual slipping away  from the pleasure pain guidance of the animal man  it has been proven  i  take it  as thoroughly as anything can be proven in this world  that the  higher emotions  the moral feelings  even the subtle unselfishness of  love  are evolved from the elemental desires and fears of the simple  animal  they are the harness in which man s mental freedom goes  and it  may be that as death overshadows us  as our possibility of acting  diminishes  this complex growth of balanced impulse  propensity and  aversion  whose interplay inspires our acts  goes with it  leaving what     i was suddenly brought back to reality by an imminent collision with the  butcher boy s tray  i found that i was crossing the bridge over the  regent s park canal  which runs parallel with that in the zoological  gardens  the boy in blue had been looking over his shoulder at a black  barge advancing slowly  towed by a gaunt white horse  in the gardens a  nurse was leading three happy little children over the bridge  the trees  were bright green  the spring hopefulness was still unstained by the dusts  of summer  the sky in the water was bright and clear  but broken by long  waves  by quivering bands of black  as the barge drove through  the breeze  was stirring  but it did not stir me as the spring breeze used to do     was this dulness of feeling in itself an anticipation  it was curious that  i could reason and follow out a network of suggestion as clearly as ever   so  at least  it seemed to me  it was calmness rather than dulness that  was coming upon me  was there any ground for the relief in the  presentiment of death  did a man near to death begin instinctively to  withdraw himself from the meshes of matter and sense  even before the  cold hand was laid upon his  i felt strangely isolated  isolated without  regret  from the life and existence about me  the children playing in the  sun and gathering strength and experience for the business of life   the park keeper gossiping with a nursemaid  the nursing mother  the young  couple intent upon each other as they passed me  the trees by the wayside  spreading new pleading leaves to the sunlight  the stir in their  branches  i had been part of it all  but i had nearly done with it now     some way down the broad walk i perceived that i was tired  and that my  feet were heavy  it was hot that afternoon  and i turned aside and sat  down on one of the green chairs that line the way  in a minute i had dozed  into a dream  and the tide of my thoughts washed up a vision of the  resurrection  i was still sitting in the chair  but i thought myself  actually dead  withered  tattered  dried  one eye  i saw  pecked out by  birds   awake   cried a voice  and incontinently the dust of the path and  the mould under the grass became insurgent  i had never before thought of  regent s park as a cemetery  but now  through the trees  stretching as far  as eye could see  i beheld a flat plain of writhing graves and heeling  tombstones  there seemed to be some trouble  the rising dead appeared to  stifle as they struggled upward  they bled in their struggles  the red  flesh was torn away from the white bones   awake   cried a voice  but i  determined i would not rise to such horrors   awake   they would not let  me alone   wake up   said an angry voice  a cockney angel  the man who  sells the tickets was shaking me  demanding my penny     i paid my penny  pocketed my ticket  yawned  stretched my legs  and   feeling now rather less torpid  got up and walked on towards langham  place  i speedily lost myself again in a shifting maze of thoughts about  death  going across marylebone road into that crescent at the end of  langham place  i had the narrowest escape from the shaft of a cab  and  went on my way with a palpitating heart and a bruised shoulder  it struck  me that it would have been curious if my meditations on my death on the  morrow had led to my death that day     but i will not weary you with more of my experiences that day and the  next  i knew more and more certainly that i should die under the  operation  at times i think i was inclined to pose to myself  the doctors  were coming at eleven  and i did not get up  it seemed scarce worth while  to trouble about washing and dressing  and though i read my newspapers and  the letters that came by the first post  i did not find them very  interesting  there was a friendly note from addison  my old school friend   calling my attention to two discrepancies and a printer s error in my new  book  with one from langridge venting some vexation over minton  the rest  were business communications  i breakfasted in bed  the glow of pain at my  side seemed more massive  i knew it was pain  and yet  if you can  understand  i did not find it very painful  i had been awake and hot and  thirsty in the night  but in the morning bed felt comfortable  in the  night time i had lain thinking of things that were past  in the morning i  dozed over the question of immortality  haddon came  punctual to the  minute  with a neat black bag  and mowbray soon followed  their arrival  stirred me up a little  i began to take a more personal interest in the  proceedings  haddon moved the little octagonal table close to the bedside   and  with his broad back to me  began taking things out of his bag  i  heard the light click of steel upon steel  my imagination  i found  was  not altogether stagnant   will you hurt me much   i said in an off hand  tone      not a bit   haddon answered over his shoulder   we shall chloroform you   your heart s as sound as a bell   and as he spoke  i had a whiff of the  pungent sweetness of the anaesthetic     they stretched me out  with a convenient exposure of my side  and  almost  before i realised what was happening  the chloroform was being  administered  it stings the nostrils  and there is a suffocating sensation  at first  i knew i should die  that this was the end of consciousness for  me  and suddenly i felt that i was not prepared for death  i had a vague  sense of a duty overlooked  i knew not what  what was it i had not done  i  could think of nothing more to do  nothing desirable left in life  and yet  i had the strangest disinclination to death  and the physical sensation  was painfully oppressive  of course the doctors did not know they were  going to kill me  possibly i struggled  then i fell motionless  and  a great silence  a monstrous silence  and an impenetrable blackness came  upon me     there must have been an interval of absolute unconsciousness  seconds or  minutes  then with a chilly  unemotional clearness  i perceived that i was  not yet dead  i was still in my body  but all the multitudinous sensations  that come sweeping from it to make up the background of consciousness had  gone  leaving me free of it all  no  not free of it all  for as yet  something still held me to the poor stark flesh upon the bed  held me  yet  not so closely that i did not feel myself external to it  independent of  it  straining away from it  i do not think i saw  i do not think i heard   but i perceived all that was going on  and it was as if i both heard and  saw  haddon was bending over me  mowbray behind me  the scalpel  it was a  large scalpel  was cutting my flesh at the side under the flying ribs  it  was interesting to see myself cut like cheese  without a pang  without  even a qualm  the interest was much of a quality with that one might feel  in a game of chess between strangers  haddon s face was firm and his hand  steady  but i was surprised to perceive   how  i know not  that he  was feeling the gravest doubt as to his own wisdom in the conduct of the  operation     mowbray s thoughts  too  i could see  he was thinking that haddon s manner  showed too much of the specialist  new suggestions came up like bubbles  through a stream of frothing meditation  and burst one after another in  the little bright spot of his consciousness  he could not help noticing  and admiring haddon s swift dexterity  in spite of his envious quality and  his disposition to detract  i saw my liver exposed  i was puzzled at my  own condition  i did not feel that i was dead  but i was different in some  way from my living self  the grey depression  that had weighed on me for a  year or more and coloured all my thoughts  was gone  i perceived and  thought without any emotional tint at all  i wondered if everyone  perceived things in this way under chloroform  and forgot it again when he  came out of it  it would be inconvenient to look into some heads  and not  forget     although i did not think that i was dead  i still perceived quite clearly  that i was soon to die  this brought me back to the consideration of  haddon s proceedings  i looked into his mind  and saw that he was afraid  of cutting a branch of the portal vein  my attention was distracted from  details by the curious changes going on in his mind  his consciousness was  like the quivering little spot of light which is thrown by the mirror of a  galvanometer  his thoughts ran under it like a stream  some through the  focus bright and distinct  some shadowy in the half light of the edge   just now the little glow was steady  but the least movement on mowbray s  part  the slightest sound from outside  even a faint difference in the  slow movement of the living flesh he was cutting  set the light spot  shivering and spinning  a new sense impression came rushing up through the  flow of thoughts  and lo  the light spot jerked away towards it  swifter  than a frightened fish  it was wonderful to think that upon that unstable   fitful thing depended all the complex motions of the man  that for the  next five minutes  therefore  my life hung upon its movements  and he was  growing more and more nervous in his work  it was as if a little picture  of a cut vein grew brighter  and struggled to oust from his brain another  picture of a cut falling short of the mark  he was afraid  his dread of  cutting too little was battling with his dread of cutting too far     then  suddenly  like an escape of water from under a lock gate  a great  uprush of horrible realisation set all his thoughts swirling  and  simultaneously i perceived that the vein was cut  he started back with a  hoarse exclamation  and i saw the brown purple blood gather in a swift  bead  and run trickling  he was horrified  he pitched the red stained  scalpel on to the octagonal table  and instantly both doctors flung  themselves upon me  making hasty and ill conceived efforts to remedy the  disaster   ice   said mowbray  gasping  but i knew that i was killed   though my body still clung to me     i will not describe their belated endeavours to save me  though i  perceived every detail  my perceptions were sharper and swifter than they  had ever been in life  my thoughts rushed through my mind with incredible  swiftness  but with perfect definition  i can only compare their crowded  clarity to the effects of a reasonable dose of opium  in a moment it would  all be over  and i should be free  i knew i was immortal  but what would  happen i did not know  should i drift off presently  like a puff of smoke  from a gun  in some kind of half material body  an attenuated version of  my material self  should i find myself suddenly among the innumerable  hosts of the dead  and know the world about me for the phantasmagoria it  had always seemed  should i drift to some spiritualistic  seance    and there make foolish  incomprehensible attempts to affect a purblind  medium  it was a state of unemotional curiosity  of colourless  expectation  and then i realised a growing stress upon me  a feeling as  though some huge human magnet was drawing me upward out of my body  the  stress grew and grew  i seemed an atom for which monstrous forces were  fighting  for one brief  terrible moment sensation came back to me  that  feeling of falling headlong which comes in nightmares  that feeling a  thousand times intensified  that and a black horror swept across my  thoughts in a torrent  then the two doctors  the naked body with its cut  side  the little room  swept away from under me and vanished  as a speck  of foam vanishes down an eddy     i was in mid air  far below was the west end of london  receding  rapidly   for i seemed to be flying swiftly upward   and as it receded   passing westward like a panorama  i could see  through the faint haze of  smoke  the innumerable roofs chimney set  the narrow roadways  stippled  with people and conveyances  the little specks of squares  and the church  steeples like thorns sticking out of the fabric  but it spun away as the  earth rotated on its axis  and in a few seconds  as it seemed  i was over  the scattered clumps of town about ealing  the little thames a thread of  blue to the south  and the chiltern hills and the north downs coming up  like the rim of a basin  far away and faint with haze  up i rushed  and at  first i had not the faintest conception what this headlong rush upward  could mean     every moment the circle of scenery beneath me grew wider and wider  and  the details of town and field  of hill and valley  got more and more hazy  and pale and indistinct  a luminous grey was mingled more and more with  the blue of the hills and the green of the open meadows  and a little  patch of cloud  low and far to the west  shone ever more dazzlingly white   above  as the veil of atmosphere between myself and outer space grew  thinner  the sky  which had been a fair springtime blue at first  grew  deeper and richer in colour  passing steadily through the intervening  shades  until presently it was as dark as the blue sky of midnight  and  presently as black as the blackness of a frosty starlight  and at last as  black as no blackness i had ever beheld  and first one star  and then  many  and at last an innumerable host broke out upon the sky  more stars  than anyone has ever seen from the face of the earth  for the blueness of  the sky in the light of the sun and stars sifted and spread abroad  blindingly  there is diffused light even in the darkest skies of winter   and we do not see the stars by day only because of the dazzling  irradiation of the sun  but now i saw things  i know not how  assuredly  with no mortal eyes  and that defect of bedazzlement blinded me no longer   the sun was incredibly strange and wonderful  the body of it was a disc of  blinding white light  not yellowish  as it seems to those who live upon  the earth  but livid white  all streaked with scarlet streaks and rimmed  about with a fringe of writhing tongues of red fire  and shooting half way  across the heavens from either side of it and brighter than the milky way   were two pinions of silver white  making it look more like those winged  globes i have seen in egyptian sculpture than anything else i can remember  upon earth  these i knew for the solar corona  though i had never seen  anything of it but a picture during the days of my earthly life     when my attention came back to the earth again  i saw that it had fallen  very far away from me  field and town were long since indistinguishable   and all the varied hues of the country were merging into a uniform bright  grey  broken only by the brilliant white of the clouds that lay scattered  in flocculent masses over ireland and the west of england  for now i could  see the outlines of the north of france and ireland  and all this island  of britain  save where scotland passed over the horizon to the north  or  where the coast was blurred or obliterated by cloud  the sea was a dull  grey  and darker than the land  and the whole panorama was rotating slowly  towards the east     all this had happened so swiftly that until i was some thousand miles or  so from the earth i had no thought for myself  but now i perceived i had  neither hands nor feet  neither parts nor organs  and that i felt neither  alarm nor pain  all about me i perceived that the vacancy  for i had  already left the air behind  was cold beyond the imagination of man  but  it troubled me not  the sun s rays shot through the void  powerless to  light or heat until they should strike on matter in their course  i saw  things with a serene self forgetfulness  even as if i were god  and down  below there  rushing away from me   countless miles in a second   where a  little dark spot on the grey marked the position of london  two doctors  were struggling to restore life to the poor hacked and outworn shell i had  abandoned  i felt then such release  such serenity as i can compare to no  mortal delight i have ever known     it was only after i had perceived all these things that the meaning of  that headlong rush of the earth grew into comprehension  yet it was so  simple  so obvious  that i was amazed at my never anticipating the thing  that was happening to me  i had suddenly been cut adrift from matter  all  that was material of me was there upon earth  whirling away through space   held to the earth by gravitation  partaking of the earth inertia  moving  in its wreath of epicycles round the sun  and with the sun and the planets  on their vast march through space  but the immaterial has no inertia   feels nothing of the pull of matter for matter  where it parts from its  garment of flesh  there it remains  so far as space concerns it any  longer  immovable in space   i  was not leaving the earth  the earth  was leaving  me   and not only the earth but the whole solar system  was streaming past  and about me in space  invisible to me  scattered in  the wake of the earth upon its journey  there must be an innumerable  multitude of souls  stripped like myself of the material  stripped like  myself of the passions of the individual and the generous emotions of the  gregarious brute  naked intelligences  things of new born wonder and  thought  marvelling at the strange release that had suddenly come on them     as i receded faster and faster from the strange white sun in the black  heavens  and from the broad and shining earth upon which my being had  begun  i seemed to grow in some incredible manner vast  vast as regards  this world i had left  vast as regards the moments and periods of a human  life  very soon i saw the full circle of the earth  slightly gibbous  like  the moon when she nears her full  but very large  and the silvery shape of  america was now in the noonday blaze wherein  as it seemed  little england  had been basking but a few minutes ago  at first the earth was large  and  shone in the heavens  filling a great part of them  but every moment she  grew smaller and more distant  as she shrank  the broad moon in its third  quarter crept into view over the rim of her disc  i looked for the  constellations  only that part of aries directly behind the sun and the  lion  which the earth covered  were hidden  i recognised the tortuous   tattered band of the milky way with vega very bright between sun and  earth  and sirius and orion shone splendid against the unfathomable  blackness in the opposite quarter of the heavens  the pole star was  overhead  and the great bear hung over the circle of the earth  and away  beneath and beyond the shining corona of the sun were strange groupings of  stars i had never seen in my life  notably a dagger shaped group that i  knew for the southern cross  all these were no larger than when they had  shone on earth  but the little stars that one scarce sees shone now  against the setting of black vacancy as brightly as the first magnitudes  had done  while the larger worlds were points of indescribable glory and  colour  aldebaran was a spot of blood red fire  and sirius condensed to  one point the light of innumerable sapphires  and they shone steadily   they did not scintillate  they were calmly glorious  my impressions had an  adamantine hardness and brightness  there was no blurring softness  no  atmosphere  nothing but infinite darkness set with the myriads of these  acute and brilliant points and specks of light  presently  when i looked  again  the little earth seemed no bigger than the sun  and it dwindled and  turned as i looked  until in a second s space  as it seemed to me   it was  halved  and so it went on swiftly dwindling  far away in the opposite  direction  a little pinkish pin s head of light  shining steadily  was the  planet mars  i swam motionless in vacancy  and  without a trace of terror  or astonishment  watched the speck of cosmic dust we call the world fall  away from me     presently it dawned upon me that my sense of duration had changed  that my  mind was moving not faster but infinitely slower  that between each  separate impression there was a period of many days  the moon spun once  round the earth as i noted this  and i perceived clearly the motion of  mars in his orbit  moreover  it appeared as if the time between thought  and thought grew steadily greater  until at last a thousand years was but  a moment in my perception     at first the constellations had shone motionless against the black  background of infinite space  but presently it seemed as though the group  of stars about hercules and the scorpion was contracting  while orion and  aldebaran and their neighbours were scattering apart  flashing suddenly  out of the darkness there came a flying multitude of particles of rock   glittering like dust specks in a sunbeam  and encompassed in a faintly  luminous cloud  they swirled all about me  and vanished again in a  twinkling far behind  and then i saw that a bright spot of light  that  shone a little to one side of my path  was growing very rapidly larger   and perceived that it was the planet saturn rushing towards me  larger and  larger it grew  swallowing up the heavens behind it  and hiding every  moment a fresh multitude  of stars  i perceived its flattened  whirling  body  its disc like belt  and seven of its little satellites  it grew and  grew  till it towered enormous  and then i plunged amid a streaming  multitude of clashing stones and dancing dust particles and gas eddies   and saw for a moment the mighty triple belt like three concentric arches  of moonlight above me  its shadow black on the boiling tumult below  these  things happened in one tenth of the time it takes to tell them  the planet  went by like a flash of lightning  for a few seconds it blotted out the  sun  and there and then became a mere black  dwindling  winged patch  against the light  the earth  the mother mote of my being  i could no  longer see     so with a stately swiftness  in the profoundest silence  the solar system  fell from me as it had been a garment  until the sun was a mere star amid  the multitude of stars  with its eddy of planet specks lost in the  confused glittering of the remoter light  i was no longer a denizen of the  solar system  i had come to the outer universe  i seemed to grasp and  comprehend the whole world of matter  ever more swiftly the stars closed  in about the spot where antares and vega had vanished in a phosphorescent  haze  until that part of the sky had the semblance of a whirling mass of  nebulae  and ever before me yawned vaster gaps of vacant blackness  and  the stars shone fewer and fewer  it seemed as if i moved towards a point  between orion s belt and sword  and the void about that region opened  vaster and vaster every second  an incredible gulf of nothingness into  which i was falling  faster and ever faster the universe rushed by  a  hurry of whirling motes at last  speeding silently into the void  stars  glowing brighter and brighter  with their circling planets catching the  light in a ghostly fashion as i neared them  shone out and vanished again  into inexistence  faint comets  clusters of meteorites  winking specks of  matter  eddying light points  whizzed past  some perhaps a hundred  millions of miles or so from me at most  few nearer  travelling with  unimaginable rapidity  shooting constellations  momentary darts of fire   through that black  enormous night  more than anything else it was like a  dusty draught  sunbeam lit  broader and wider and deeper grew the starless  space  the vacant beyond  into which i was being drawn  at last a quarter  of the heavens was black and blank  and the whole headlong rush of stellar  universe closed in behind me like a veil of light that is gathered  together  it drove away from me like a monstrous jack o  lantern driven by  the wind  i had come out into the wilderness of space  ever the vacant  blackness grew broader  until the hosts of the stars seemed only like a  swarm of fiery specks hurrying away from me  inconceivably remote  and the  darkness  the nothingness and emptiness  was about me on every side  soon  the little universe of matter  the cage of points in which i had begun to  be  was dwindling  now to a whirling disc of luminous glittering  and now  to one minute disc of hazy light  in a little while it would shrink to a  point  and at last would vanish altogether     suddenly feeling came back to me  feeling in the shape of overwhelming  terror  such a dread of those dark vastitudes as no words can describe  a  passionate resurgence of sympathy and social desire  were there other  souls  invisible to me as i to them  about me in the blackness  or was i  indeed  even as i felt  alone  had i passed out of being into something  that was neither being nor not being  the covering of the body  the  covering of matter  had been torn from me  and the hallucinations of  companionship and security  everything was black and silent  i had ceased  to be  i was nothing  there was nothing  save only that infinitesimal dot  of light that dwindled in the gulf  i strained myself to hear and see  and  for a while there was naught but infinite silence  intolerable darkness   horror  and despair     then i saw that about the spot of light into which the whole world of  matter had shrunk there was a faint glow  and in a band on either side of  that the darkness was not absolute  i watched it for ages  as it seemed to  me  and through the long waiting the haze grew imperceptibly more  distinct  and then about the band appeared an irregular cloud of the  faintest  palest brown  i felt a passionate impatience  but the things  grew brighter so slowly that they scarce seemed to change  what was  unfolding itself  what was this strange reddish dawn in the interminable  night of space     the cloud s shape was grotesque  it seemed to be looped along its lower  side into four projecting masses  and  above  it ended in a straight line   what phantom was it  i felt assured i had seen that figure before  but i  could not think what  nor where  nor when it was  then the realisation  rushed upon me   it was a clenched hand   i was alone in space  alone  with this huge  shadowy hand  upon which the whole universe of matter lay  like an unconsidered speck of dust  it seemed as though i watched it  through vast periods of time  on the forefinger glittered a ring  and the  universe from which i had come was but a spot of light upon the ring s  curvature  and the thing that the hand gripped had the likeness of a black  rod  through a long eternity i watched this hand  with the ring and the  rod  marvelling and fearing and waiting helplessly on what might follow   it seemed as though nothing could follow  that i should watch for ever   seeing only the hand and the thing it held  and understanding nothing of  its import  was the whole universe but a refracting speck upon some  greater being  were our worlds but the atoms of another universe  and  those again of another  and so on through an endless progression  and what  was i  was i indeed immaterial  a vague persuasion of a body gathering  about me came into my suspense  the abysmal darkness about the hand filled  with impalpable suggestions  with uncertain  fluctuating shapes     then  suddenly  came a sound  like the sound of a tolling bell  faint  as  if infinitely far  muffled  as though heard through thick swathings of  darkness  a deep  vibrating resonance  with vast gulfs of silence between  each stroke  and the hand appeared to tighten on the rod  and i saw far  above the hand  towards the apex of the darkness  a circle of dim  phosphorescence  a ghostly sphere whence these sounds came throbbing  and  at the last stroke the hand vanished  for the hour had come  and i heard a  noise of many waters  but the black rod remained as a great band across  the sky  and then a voice  which seemed to run to the uttermost parts of  space  spoke  saying   there will be no more pain      at that an almost intolerable gladness and radiance rushed in upon me  and  i saw the circle shining white and bright  and the rod black and shining   and many things else distinct and clear  and the circle was the face of  the clock  and the rod the rail of my bed  haddon was standing at the  foot  against the rail  with a small pair of scissors on his fingers  and  the hands of my clock on the mantel over his shoulder were clasped  together over the hour of twelve  mowbray was washing something in a basin  at the octagonal table  and at my side i felt a subdued feeling that could  scarce be spoken of as pain     the operation had not killed me  and i perceived  suddenly  that the dull  melancholy of half a year was lifted from my mind             xiii       the sea raiders       i     until the extraordinary affair at sidmouth  the peculiar species   haploteuthis ferox  was known to science only generically  on the  strength of a half digested tentacle obtained near the azores  and a  decaying body pecked by birds and nibbled by fish  found early in      by  mr  jennings  near land s end     in no department of zoological science  indeed  are we quite so much in  the dark as with regard to the deep sea cephalopods  a mere accident  for  instance  it was that led to the prince of monaco s discovery of nearly a  dozen new forms in the summer of       a discovery in which the  before mentioned tentacle was included  it chanced that a cachalot was  killed off terceira by some sperm whalers  and in its last struggles  charged almost to the prince s yacht  missed it  rolled under  and died  within twenty yards of his rudder  and in its agony it threw up a number  of large objects  which the prince  dimly perceiving they were strange and  important  was  by a happy expedient  able to secure before they sank  he  set his screws in motion  and kept them circling in the vortices thus  created until a boat could be lowered  and these specimens were whole  cephalopods and fragments of cephalopods  some of gigantic proportions   and almost all of them unknown to science     it would seem  indeed  that these large and agile creatures  living in the  middle depths of the sea  must  to a large extent  for ever remain unknown  to us  since under water they are too nimble for nets  and it is only by  such rare  unlooked for accidents that specimens can be obtained  in the  case of  haploteuthis ferox   for instance  we are still altogether  ignorant of its habitat  as ignorant as we are of the breeding ground of  the herring or the sea ways of the salmon  and zoologists are altogether  at a loss to account for its sudden appearance on our coast  possibly it  was the stress of a hunger migration that drove it hither out of the deep   but it will be  perhaps  better to avoid necessarily inconclusive  discussion  and to proceed at once with our narrative     the first human being to set eyes upon a living  haploteuthis   the  first human being to survive  that is  for there can be little doubt now  that the wave of bathing fatalities and boating accidents that travelled  along the coast of cornwall and devon in early may was due to this  cause  was a retired tea dealer of the name of fison  who was stopping at  a sidmouth boarding house  it was in the afternoon  and he was walking  along the cliff path between sidmouth and ladram bay  the cliffs in this  direction are very high  but down the red face of them in one place a kind  of ladder staircase has been made  he was near this when his attention was  attracted by what at first he thought to be a cluster of birds struggling  over a fragment of food that caught the sunlight  and glistened  pinkish white  the tide was right out  and this object was not only far  below him  but remote across a broad waste of rock reefs covered with  dark seaweed and interspersed with silvery shining tidal pools  and he  was  moreover  dazzled by the brightness of the further water     in a minute  regarding this again  he perceived that his judgment was in  fault  for over this struggle circled a number of birds  jackdaws and  gulls for the most part  the latter gleaming blindingly when the sunlight  smote their wings  and they seemed minute in comparison with it  and his  curiosity was  perhaps  aroused all the more strongly because of his first  insufficient explanations     as he had nothing better to do than amuse himself  he decided to make this  object  whatever it was  the goal of his afternoon walk  instead of ladram  bay  conceiving it might perhaps be a great fish of some sort  stranded by  some chance  and flapping about in its distress  and so he hurried down  the long steep ladder  stopping at intervals of thirty feet or so to take  breath and scan the mysterious movement     at the foot of the cliff he was  of course  nearer his object than he had  been  but  on the other hand  it now came up against the incandescent sky   beneath the sun  so as to seem dark and indistinct  whatever was pinkish  of it was now hidden by a skerry of weedy boulders  but he perceived that  it was made up of seven rounded bodies distinct or connected  and that the  birds kept up a constant croaking and screaming  but seemed afraid to  approach it too closely     mr  fison  torn by curiosity  began picking his way across the wave worn  rocks  and finding the wet seaweed that covered them thickly rendered them  extremely slippery  he stopped  removed his shoes and socks  and rolled  his trousers above his knees  his object was  of course  merely to avoid  stumbling into the rocky pools about him  and perhaps he was rather glad   as all men are  of an excuse to resume  even for a moment  the sensations  of his boyhood  at any rate  it is to this  no doubt  that he owes his  life     he approached his mark with all the assurance which the absolute security  of this country against all forms of animal life gives its inhabitants   the round bodies moved to and fro  but it was only when he surmounted the  skerry of boulders i have mentioned that he realised the horrible nature  of the discovery  it came upon him with some suddenness     the rounded bodies fell apart as he came into sight over the ridge  and  displayed the pinkish object to be the partially devoured body of a human  being  but whether of a man or woman he was unable to say  and the rounded  bodies were new and ghastly looking creatures  in shape somewhat  resembling an octopus  with huge and very long and flexible tentacles   coiled copiously on the ground  the skin had a glistening texture   unpleasant to see  like shiny leather  the downward bend of the  tentacle surrounded mouth  the curious excrescence at the bend  the  tentacles  and the large intelligent eyes  gave the creatures a grotesque  suggestion of a face  they were the size of a fair sized swine about the  body  and the tentacles seemed to him to be many feet in length  there  were  he thinks  seven or eight at least of the creatures  twenty yards  beyond them  amid the surf of the now returning tide  two others were  emerging from the sea     their bodies lay flatly on the rocks  and their eyes regarded him with  evil interest  but it does not appear that mr  fison was afraid  or that  he realised that he was in any danger  possibly his confidence is to be  ascribed to the limpness of their attitudes  but he was horrified  of  course  and intensely excited and indignant  at such revolting creatures  preying upon human flesh  he thought they had chanced upon a drowned body   he shouted to them  with the idea of driving them off  and finding they  did not budge  cast about him  picked up a big rounded lump of rock  and  flung it at one     and then  slowly uncoiling their tentacles  they all began moving towards  him  creeping at first deliberately  and making a soft purring sound to  each other     in a moment mr  fison realised that he was in danger  he shouted again   threw both his boots  and started off  with a leap  forthwith  twenty  yards off he stopped and faced about  judging them slow  and behold  the  tentacles of their leader were already pouring over the rocky ridge on  which he had just been standing     at that he shouted again  but this time not threatening  but a cry of  dismay  and began jumping  striding  slipping  wading across the uneven  expanse between him and the beach  the tall red cliffs seemed suddenly at  a vast distance  and he saw  as though they were creatures in another  world  two minute workmen engaged in the repair of the ladder way  and  little suspecting the race for life that was beginning below them  at one  time he could hear the creatures splashing in the pools not a dozen feet  behind him  and once he slipped and almost fell     they chased him to the very foot of the cliffs  and desisted only when he  had been joined by the workmen at the foot of the ladder way up the cliff   all three of the men pelted them with stones for a time  and then hurried  to the cliff top and along the path towards sidmouth  to secure assistance  and a boat  and to rescue the desecrated body from the clutches of these  abominable creatures       ii     and  as if he had not already been in sufficient peril that day  mr  fison  went with the boat to point out the exact spot of his adventure     as the tide was down  it required a considerable detour to reach the spot   and when at last they came off the ladder way  the mangled body had  disappeared  the water was now running in  submerging first one slab of  slimy rock and then another  and the four men in the boat  the workmen   that is  the boatman  and mr  fison  now turned their attention from the  bearings off shore to the water beneath the keel     at first they could see little below them  save a dark jungle of  laminaria  with an occasional darting fish  their minds were set on  adventure  and they expressed their disappointment freely  but presently  they saw one of the monsters swimming through the water seaward  with a  curious rolling motion that suggested to mr  fison the spinning roll of a  captive balloon  almost immediately after  the waving streamers of  laminaria were extraordinarily perturbed  parted for a moment  and three  of these beasts became darkly visible  struggling for what was probably  some fragment of the drowned man  in a moment the copious olive green  ribbons had poured again over this writhing group     at that all four men  greatly excited  began beating the water with oars  and shouting  and immediately they saw a tumultuous movement among the  weeds  they desisted to see more clearly  and as soon as the water was  smooth  they saw  as it seemed to them  the whole sea bottom among the  weeds set with eyes      ugly swine   cried one of the men   why  there s dozens      and forthwith the things began to rise through the water about them  mr   fison has since described to the writer this startling eruption out of the  waving laminaria meadows  to him it seemed to occupy a considerable time   but it is probable that really it was an affair of a few seconds only  for  a time nothing but eyes  and then he speaks of tentacles streaming out and  parting the weed fronds this way and that  then these things  growing  larger  until at last the bottom was hidden by their intercoiling forms   and the tips of tentacles rose darkly here and there into the air above  the swell of the waters     one came up boldly to the side of the boat  and clinging to this with  three of its sucker set tentacles  threw four others over the gunwale  as  if with an intention either of oversetting the boat or of clambering into  it  mr  fison at once caught up the boat hook  and  jabbing furiously at  the soft tentacles  forced it to desist  he was struck in the back and  almost pitched overboard by the boatman  who was using his oar to resist a  similar attack on the other side of the boat  but the tentacles on either  side at once relaxed their hold  slid out of sight  and splashed into the  water      we d better get out of this   said mr  fison  who was trembling  violently  he went to the tiller  while the boatman and one of the workmen  seated themselves and began rowing  the other workman stood up in the fore  part of the boat  with the boat hook  ready to strike any more tentacles  that might appear  nothing else seems to have been said  mr  fison had  expressed the common feeling beyond amendment  in a hushed  scared mood   with faces white and drawn  they set about escaping from the position into  which they had so recklessly blundered     but the oars had scarcely dropped into the water before dark  tapering   serpentine ropes had bound them  and were about the rudder  and creeping  up the sides of the boat with a looping motion came the suckers again  the  men gripped their oars and pulled  but it was like trying to move a boat  in a floating raft of weeds   help here   cried the boatman  and mr  fison  and the second workman rushed to help lug at the oar     then the man with the boat hook  his name was ewan  or ewen  sprang up  with a curse and began striking downward over the side  as far as he could  reach  at the bank of tentacles that now clustered along the boat s  bottom  and  at the same time  the two rowers stood up to get a better  purchase for the recovery of their oars  the boatman handed his to mr   fison  who lugged desperately  and  meanwhile  the boatman opened a big  clasp knife  and leaning over the side of the boat  began hacking at the  spiring arms upon the oar shaft     mr  fison  staggering with the quivering rocking of the boat  his teeth  set  his breath coming short  and the veins starting on his hands as he  pulled at his oar  suddenly cast his eyes seaward  and there  not fifty  yards off  across the long rollers of the incoming tide  was a large boat  standing in towards them  with three women and a little child in it  a  boatman was rowing  and a little man in a pink ribboned straw hat and  whites stood in the stern hailing them  for a moment  of course  mr  fison  thought of help  and then he thought of the child  he abandoned his oar  forthwith  threw up his arms in a frantic gesture  and screamed to the  party in the boat to keep away  for god s sake   it says much for the  modesty and courage of mr  fison that he does not seem to be aware that  there was any quality of heroism in his action at this juncture  the oar  he had abandoned was at once drawn under  and presently reappeared  floating about twenty yards away     at the same moment mr  fison felt the boat under him lurch violently  and  a hoarse scream  a prolonged cry of terror from hill  the boatman  caused  him to forget the party of excursionists altogether  he turned  and saw  hill crouching by the forward row lock  his face convulsed with terror   and his right arm over the side and drawn tightly down  he gave now a  succession of short  sharp cries   oh  oh  oh   oh   mr  fison believes  that he must have been hacking at the tentacles below the water line  and  have been grasped by them  but  of course  it is quite impossible to say  now certainly what had happened  the boat was heeling over  so that the  gunwale was within ten inches of the water  and both ewan and the other  labourer were striking down into the water  with oar and boat hook  on  either side of hill s arm  mr  fison instinctively placed himself to  counterpoise them     then hill  who was a burly  powerful man  made a strenuous effort  and  rose almost to a standing position  he lifted his arm  indeed  clean out  of the water  hanging to it was a complicated tangle of brown ropes  and  the eyes of one of the brutes that had hold of him  glaring straight and  resolute  showed momentarily above the surface  the boat heeled more and  more  and the green brown water came pouring in a cascade over the side   then hill slipped and fell with his ribs across the side  and his arm and  the mass of tentacles about it splashed back into the water  he rolled  over  his boot kicked mr  fison s knee as that gentleman rushed forward to  seize him  and in another moment fresh tentacles had whipped about his  waist and neck  and after a brief  convulsive struggle  in which the boat  was nearly capsized  hill was lugged overboard  the boat righted with a  violent jerk that all but sent mr  fison over the other side  and hid the  struggle in the water from his eyes     he stood staggering to recover his balance for a moment  and as he did so  he became aware that the struggle and the inflowing tide had carried them  close upon the weedy rocks again  not four yards off a table of rock still  rose in rhythmic movements above the in wash of the tide  in a moment mr   fison seized the oar from ewan  gave one vigorous stroke  then dropping  it  ran to the bows and leapt  he felt his feet slide over the rock  and   by a frantic effort  leapt again towards a further mass  he stumbled over  this  came to his knees  and rose again      look out   cried someone  and a large drab body struck him  he was  knocked flat into a tidal pool by one of the workmen  and as he went down  he heard smothered  choking cries  that he believed at the time came from  hill  then he found himself marvelling at the shrillness and variety of  hill s voice  someone jumped over him  and a curving rush of foamy water  poured over him  and passed  he scrambled to his feet dripping  and  without looking seaward  ran as fast as his terror would let him  shoreward  before him  over the flat space of scattered rocks  stumbled  the two work men  one a dozen yards in front of the other     he looked over his shoulder at last  and seeing that he was not pursued   faced about  he was astonished  from the moment of the rising of the  cephalopods out of the water he had been acting too swiftly to fully  comprehend his actions  now it seemed to him as if he had suddenly jumped  out of an evil dream     for there were the sky  cloudless and blazing with the afternoon sun  the  sea weltering under its pitiless brightness  the soft creamy foam of the  breaking water  and the low  long  dark ridges of rock  the righted boat  floated  rising and falling gently on the swell about a dozen yards from  shore  hill and the monsters  all the stress and tumult of that fierce  fight for life  had vanished as though they had never been     mr  fison s heart was beating violently  he was throbbing to the  finger tips  and his breath came deep     there was something missing  for some seconds he could not think clearly  enough what this might be  sun  sky  sea  rocks  what was it  then he  remembered the boat load of excursionists  it had vanished  he wondered  whether he had imagined it  he turned  and saw the two workmen standing  side by side under the projecting masses of the tall pink cliffs  he  hesitated whether he should make one last attempt to save the man hill   his physical excitement seemed to desert him suddenly  and leave him  aimless and helpless  he turned shoreward  stumbling and wading towards  his two companions     he looked back again  and there were now two boats floating  and the one  farthest out at sea pitched clumsily  bottom upward         iii     so it was  haploteuthis ferox  made its appearance upon the  devonshire coast  so far  this has been its most serious aggression  mr   fison s account  taken together with the wave of boating and bathing  casualties to which i have already alluded  and the absence of fish from  the cornish coasts that year  points clearly to a shoal of these voracious  deep sea monsters prowling slowly along the sub tidal coast line  hunger  migration has  i know  been suggested as the force that drove them hither   but  for my own part  i prefer to believe the alternative theory of  hemsley  hemsley holds that a pack or shoal of these creatures may have  become enamoured of human flesh by the accident of a foundered ship  sinking among them  and have wandered in search of it out of their  accustomed zone  first waylaying and following ships  and so coming to our  shores in the wake of the atlantic traffic  but to discuss hemsley s  cogent and admirably stated arguments would be out of place here     it would seem that the appetites of the shoal were satisfied by the catch  of eleven people  for  so far as can be ascertained  there were ten people  in the second boat  and certainly these creatures gave no further signs of  their presence off sidmouth that day  the coast between seaton and  budleigh salterton was patrolled all that evening and night by four  preventive service boats  the men in which were armed with harpoons and  cutlasses  and as the evening advanced  a number of more or less similarly  equipped expeditions  organised by private individuals  joined them  mr   fison took no part in any of these expeditions     about midnight excited hails were heard from a boat about a couple of  miles out at sea to the south east of sidmouth  and a lantern was seen  waving in a strange manner to and fro and up and down  the nearer boats at  once hurried towards the alarm  the venturesome occupants of the boat  a  seaman  a curate  and two schoolboys  had actually seen the monsters  passing under their boat  the creatures  it seems  like most deep sea  organisms  were phosphorescent  and they had been floating  five fathoms  deep or so  like creatures of moonshine through the blackness of the  water  their tentacles retracted and as if asleep  rolling over and over   and moving slowly in a wedge like formation towards the south east     these people told their story in gesticulated fragments  as first one boat  drew alongside and then another  at last there was a little fleet of eight  or nine boats collected together  and from them a tumult  like the chatter  of a market place  rose into the stillness of the night  there was little  or no disposition to pursue the shoal  the people had neither weapons nor  experience for such a dubious chase  and presently  even with a certain  relief  it may be  the boats turned shoreward     and now to tell what is perhaps the most astonishing fact in this whole  astonishing raid  we have not the slightest knowledge of the subsequent  movements of the shoal  although the whole south west coast was now alert  for it  but it may  perhaps  be significant that a cachalot was stranded  off sark on june    two weeks and three days after this sidmouth affair  a  living  haploteuthis  came ashore on calais sands  it was alive   because several witnesses saw its tentacles moving in a convulsive way   but it is probable that it was dying  a gentleman named pouchet obtained a  rifle and shot it     that was the last appearance of a living  haploteuthis   no others  were seen on the french coast  on the   th of june a dead carcass  almost  complete  was washed ashore near torquay  and a few days later a boat from  the marine biological station  engaged in dredging off plymouth  picked up  a rotting specimen  slashed deeply with a cutlass wound  how the former  had come by its death it is impossible to say  and on the last day of  june  mr  egbert caine  an artist  bathing near newlyn  threw up his arms   shrieked  and was drawn under  a friend bathing with him made no attempt  to save him  but swam at once for the shore  this is the last fact to tell  of this extraordinary raid from the deeper sea  whether it is really the  last of these horrible creatures it is  as yet  premature to say  but it  is believed  and certainly it is to be hoped  that they have returned now   and returned for good  to the sunless depths of the middle seas  out of  which they have so strangely and so mysteriously arisen             xiv       the obliterated man       i was  you shall hear immediately why i am not now  egbert craddock  cummins  the name remains  i am still  heaven help me   dramatic critic to  the  fiery cross   what i shall be in a little while i do not know  i  write in great trouble and confusion of mind  i will do what i can to make  myself clear in the face of terrible difficulties  you must bear with me a  little  when a man is rapidly losing his own identity  he naturally finds  a difficulty in expressing himself  i will make it perfectly plain in a  minute  when once i get my grip upon the story  let me see  where   am  i  i wish i knew  ah  i have it  dead self  egbert craddock  cummins     in the past i should have disliked writing anything quite so full of  i   as this story must be  it is full of  i s  before and behind  like the  beast in revelation  the one with a head like a calf  i am afraid  but my  tastes have changed since i became a dramatic critic and studied the  masters  g a s   g b s   g r s   and the others  everything has changed  since then  at least the story is about myself  so that there is some  excuse for me  and it is really not egotism  because  as i say  since  those days my identity has undergone an entire alteration     that past     i was  in those days  rather a nice fellow  rather shy    taste for grey in my clothes  weedy little moustache  face  interesting    slight stutter which i had caught in my early life from a schoolfellow   engaged to a very nice girl  named delia  fairly new  she was    cigarettes  liked me because i was human and original  considered i was  like lamb  on the strength of the stutter  i believe  father  an eminent  authority on postage stamps  she read a great deal in the british museum    a perfect pairing ground for literary people  that british museum  you  should read george egerton and justin huntly m carthy and gissing and the  rest of them   we loved in our intellectual way  and shared the brightest  hopes   all gone now   and her father liked me because i seemed honestly  eager to hear about stamps  she had no mother  indeed  i had the happiest  prospects a young man could have  i never went to theatres in those days   my aunt charlotte before she died had told me not to     then barnaby  the editor of the  fiery cross   made me  in spite of  my spasmodic efforts to escape  dramatic critic  he is a fine  healthy  man  barnaby  with an enormous head of frizzy black hair and a convincing  manner  and he caught me on the staircase going to see wembly  he had been  dining  and was more than usually buoyant   hullo  cummins   he said   the  very man i want   he caught me by the shoulder or the collar or something   ran me up the little passage  and flung me over the waste paper basket  into the arm chair in his office   pray be seated   he said  as he did so   then he ran across the room and came back with some pink and yellow  tickets and pushed them into my hand   opera comique   he said   thursday   friday  the surrey  saturday  the frivolity  that s all  i think       but    i began      glad you re free   he said  snatching some proofs off the desk and  beginning to read      i don t quite understand   i said       eigh    he said  at the top of his voice  as though he thought i  had gone and was startled at my remark      do you want me to criticise these plays       do something with  em    did you think it was a treat       but i can t       did you call me a fool       well  i ve never been to a theatre in my life       virgin soil       but i don t know anything about it  you know       that s just it  new view  no habits  no  cliches  in stock  ours is  a live paper  not a bag of tricks  none of your clockwork professional  journalism in this office  and i can rely on your integrity          but i ve conscientious scruples         he caught me up suddenly and put me outside his door   go and talk to  wembly about that   he said   he ll explain      as i stood perplexed  he opened the door again  said   i forgot this    thrust a fourth ticket into my hand  it was for that night  in twenty  minutes  time  and slammed the door upon me  his expression was quite  calm  but i caught his eye     i hate arguments  i decided that i would take his hint and become  to my  own destruction  a dramatic critic  i walked slowly down the passage to  wembly  that barnaby has a remarkable persuasive way  he has made few  suggestions during our very pleasant intercourse of four years that he has  not ultimately won me round to adopting  it may be  of course  that i am  of a yielding disposition  certainly i am too apt to take my colour from  my circumstances  it is  indeed  to my unfortunate susceptibility to vivid  impressions that all my misfortunes are due  i have already alluded to the  slight stammer i had acquired from a schoolfellow in my youth  however   this is a digression    i went home in a cab to dress     i will not trouble the reader with my thoughts about the first night  audience  strange assembly as it is   those i reserve for my memoirs   nor  the humiliating story of how i got lost during the  entr acte  in a  lot of red plush passages  and saw the third act from the gallery  the  only point upon which i wish to lay stress was the remarkable effect of  the acting upon me  you must remember i had lived a quiet and retired  life  and had never been to the theatre before  and that i am extremely  sensitive to vivid impressions  at the risk of repetition i must insist  upon these points     the first effect was a profound amazement  not untinctured by alarm  the  phenomenal unnaturalness of acting is a thing discounted in the minds of  most people by early visits to the theatre  they get used to the fantastic  gestures  the flamboyant emotions  the weird mouthings  melodious  snortings  agonising yelps  lip gnawings  glaring horrors  and other  emotional symbolism of the stage  it becomes at last a mere deaf and dumb  language to them  which they read intelligently  pari passu  with the  hearing of the dialogue  but all this was new to me  the thing was called  a modern comedy  the people were supposed to be english and were dressed  like fashionable americans of the current epoch  and i fell into the  natural error of supposing that the actors were trying to represent human  beings  i looked round on my first night audience with a kind of wonder   discovered  as all new dramatic critics do  that it rested with me to  reform the drama  and  after a supper choked with emotion  went off to the  office to write a column  piebald with  new paragraphs   as all my stuff  is  it fills out so  and purple with indignation  barnaby was delighted     but i could not sleep that night  i dreamt of actors  actors glaring   actors smiting their chests  actors flinging out a handful of extended  fingers  actors smiling bitterly  laughing despairingly  falling  hopelessly  dying idiotically  i got up at eleven with a slight headache   read my notice in the  fiery cross   breakfasted  and went back to my  room to shave   it s my habit to do so   then an odd thing happened  i  could not find my razor  suddenly it occurred to me that i had not  unpacked it the day before      ah   said i  in front of the looking glass  then  hullo      quite involuntarily  when i had thought of my portmanteau  i had flung up  the left arm  fingers fully extended  and clutched at my diaphragm with my  right hand  i am an acutely self conscious man at all times  the gesture  struck me as absolutely novel for me  i repeated it  for my own  satisfaction   odd   then  rather puzzled  i turned to my portmanteau     after shaving  my mind reverted to the acting i had seen  and i  entertained myself before the cheval glass with some imitations of  jafferay s more exaggerated gestures   really  one might think it a  disease   i said   stage walkitis    there s many a truth spoken in jest    then  if i remember rightly  i went off to see wembly  and afterwards  lunched at the british museum with delia  we actually spoke about our  prospects  in the light of my new appointment     but that appointment was the beginning of my downfall  from that day i  necessarily became a persistent theatre goer  and almost insensibly i  began to change  the next thing i noticed after the gesture about the  razor was to catch myself bowing ineffably when i met delia  and stooping  in an old fashioned  courtly way over her hand  directly i caught myself   i straightened myself up and became very uncomfortable  i remember she  looked at me curiously  then  in the office  i found myself doing  nervous  business   fingers on teeth  when barnaby asked me a question i could not  very well answer  then  in some trifling difference with delia  i clasped  my hand to my brow  and i pranced through my social transactions at times  singularly like an actor  i tried not to  no one could be more keenly  alive to the arrant absurdity of the histrionic bearing  and i did     it began to dawn on me what it all meant  the acting  i saw  was too much  for my delicately strung nervous system  i have always  i know  been too  amenable to the suggestions of my circumstances  night after night of  concentrated attention to the conventional attitudes and intonation of the  english stage was gradually affecting my speech and carriage  i was giving  way to the infection of sympathetic imitation  night after night my  plastic nervous system took the print of some new amazing gesture  some  new emotional exaggeration  and retained it  a kind of theatrical veneer  threatened to plate over and obliterate my private individuality  altogether  i saw myself in a kind of vision  sitting by myself one night   my new self seemed to me to glide  posing and gesticulating  across the  room  he clutched his throat  he opened his fingers  he opened his legs in  walking like a high class marionette  he went from attitude to attitude   he might have been clockwork  directly after this i made an ineffectual  attempt to resign my theatrical work  but barnaby persisted in talking  about the polywhiddle divorce all the time i was with him  and i could get  no opportunity of saying what i wished     and then delia s manner began to change towards me  the ease of our  intercourse vanished  i felt she was learning to dislike me  i grinned   and capered  and scowled  and posed at her in a thousand ways  and  knew  with what a voiceless agony   that i did it all the time  i tried to  resign again  and barnaby talked about  x  and  z  and  y  in the  new  review   and gave me a strong cigar to smoke  and so routed me  and  then i walked up the assyrian gallery in the manner of irving to meet  delia  and so precipitated the crisis      ah    dear    i said  with more sprightliness and emotion in my  voice than had ever been in all my life before i became  to my own  undoing  a dramatic critic     she held out her hand rather coldly  scrutinising my face as she did so  i  prepared  with a new won grace  to walk by her side   egbert   she said   standing still  and thought  then she looked at me     i said nothing  i felt what was coming  i tried to be the old egbert  craddock cummins of shambling gait and stammering sincerity  whom she  loved  but i felt even as i did so that i was a new thing  a thing of  surging emotions and mysterious fixity  like no human being that ever  lived  except upon the stage   egbert   she said   you are not yourself       ah   involuntarily i clutched my diaphragm and averted my head  as is the  way with them       there   she said       what do you mean    i said  whispering in vocal italics  you know  how they do it  turning on her  perplexity on face  right hand down  left  on brow  i knew quite well what she meant  i knew quite well the dramatic  unreality of my behaviour  but i struggled against it in vain   what do  you mean   i said  and  in a kind of hoarse whisper   i don t understand      she really looked as though she disliked me   what do you keep on posing  for   she said   i don t like it  you didn t use to       didn t use to   i said slowly  repeating this twice  i glared up and down  the gallery with short  sharp glances   we are alone   i said swiftly     listen    i poked my forefinger towards her  and glared at her    i am under a curse      i saw her hand tighten upon her sunshade   you are under some bad  influence or other   said delia   you should give it up  i never knew  anyone change as you have done       delia   i said  lapsing into the pathetic   pity me  augh  delia    pit   y me      she eyed me critically    why  you keep playing the fool like this i  don t know   she said   anyhow  i really cannot go about with a man who  behaves as you do  you made us both ridiculous on wednesday  frankly  i  dislike you  as you are now  i met you here to tell you so  as it s about  the only place where we can be sure of being alone together          delia   said i  with intensity  knuckles of clenched hands white   you  don t mean          i do   said delia   a woman s lot is sad enough at the best of times  but  with you         i clapped my hand on my brow      so  good bye   said delia  without emotion      oh  delia   i said   not  this        good bye  mr  cummins   she said     by a violent effort i controlled myself and touched her hand  i tried to  say some word of explanation to her  she looked into my working face and  winced   i  must  do it   she said hopelessly  then she turned from  me and began walking rapidly down the gallery     heavens  how the human agony cried within me  i loved delia  but nothing  found expression  i was already too deeply crusted with my acquired self      good baye   i said at last  watching her retreating figure  how i hated  myself for doing it  after she had vanished  i repeated in a dreamy way    good baye   looking hopelessly round me  then  with a kind of  heart broken cry  i shook my clenched fists in the air  staggered to the  pedestal of a winged figure  buried my face in my arms  and made my  shoulders heave  something within me said  ass   as i did so   i had the  greatest difficulty in persuading the museum policeman  who was attracted  by my cry of agony  that i was not intoxicated  but merely suffering from  a transient indisposition      but even this great sorrow has not availed to save me from my fate  i see  it  everyone sees it  i grow more  theatrical  every day  and no one could  be more painfully aware of the pungent silliness of theatrical ways  the  quiet  nervous  but pleasing e c  cummins vanishes  i cannot save him  i  am driven like a dead leaf before the winds of march  my tailor even  enters into the spirit of my disorder  he has a peculiar sense of what is  fitting  i tried to get a dull grey suit from him this spring  and he  foisted a brilliant blue upon me  and i see he has put braid down the  sides of my new dress trousers  my hairdresser insists upon giving me a   wave      i am beginning to associate with actors  i detest them  but it is only in  their company that i can feel i am not glaringly conspicuous  their talk  infects me  i notice a growing tendency to dramatic brevity  to dashes and  pauses in my style  to a punctuation of bows and attitudes  barnaby has  remarked it too  i offended wembly by calling him  dear boy  yesterday  i  dread the end  but i cannot escape from it     the fact is  i am being obliterated  living a grey  retired life all my  youth  i came to the theatre a delicate sketch of a man  a thing of tints  and faint lines  their gorgeous colouring has effaced me altogether   people forget how much mode of expression  method of movement  are a  matter of contagion  i have heard of stage struck people before  and  thought it a figure of speech  i spoke of it jestingly  as a disease  it  is no jest  it is a disease  and i have got it badly  deep down within me  i protest against the wrong done to my personality  unavailingly  for  three hours or more a week i have to go and concentrate my attention on  some fresh play  and the suggestions of the drama strengthen their awful  hold upon me  my manners grow so flamboyant  my passions so professional   that i doubt  as i said at the outset  whether it is really myself that  behaves in such a manner  i feel merely the core to this dramatic casing   that grows thicker and presses upon me  me and mine  i feel like king  john s abbot in his cope of lead     i doubt  indeed  whether i should not abandon the struggle altogether    leave this sad world of ordinary life for which i am so ill fitted   abandon the name of cummins for some professional pseudonym  complete my  self effacement  and  a thing of tricks and tatters  of posing and  pretence  go upon the stage  it seems my only resort   to hold the mirror  up to nature   for in the ordinary life  i will confess  no one now seems  to regard me as both sane and sober  only upon the stage  i feel  convinced  will people take me seriously  that will be the end of it  i   know  that will be the end of it  and yet     i will frankly confess      all that marks off your actor from your common man     i   detest   i am still largely of my aunt charlotte s opinion  that  play acting is unworthy of a pure minded man s attention  much more  participation  even now i would resign my dramatic criticism and try a  rest  only i can t get hold of barnaby  letters of resignation he never  notices  he says it is against the etiquette of journalism to write to  your editor  and when i go to see him  he gives me another big cigar and  some strong whisky and soda  and then something always turns up to prevent  my explanation             xv       the plattner story       whether the story of gottfried plattner is to be credited or not is a  pretty question in the value of evidence  on the one hand  we have seven  witnesses  to be perfectly exact  we have six and a half pairs of eyes   and one undeniable fact  and on the other we have  what is it   prejudice   common sense  the inertia of opinion  never were there seven more  honest seeming witnesses  never was there a more undeniable fact than the  inversion of gottfried plattner s anatomical structure  and  never was  there a more preposterous story than the one they have to tell  the most  preposterous part of the story is the worthy gottfried s contribution  for  i count him as one of the seven   heaven forbid that i should be led into  giving countenance to superstition by a passion for impartiality  and so  come to share the fate of eusapia s patrons  frankly  i believe there is  something crooked about this business of gottfried plattner  but what that  crooked factor is  i will admit as frankly  i do not know  i have been  surprised at the credit accorded to the story in the most unexpected and  authoritative quarters  the fairest way to the reader  however  will be  for me to tell it without further comment     gottfried plattner is  in spite of his name  a freeborn englishman  his  father was an alsatian who came to england in the  sixties  married a  respectable english girl of unexceptionable antecedents  and died  after a  wholesome and uneventful life  devoted  i understand  chiefly to the  laying of parquet flooring   in       gottfried s age is seven and twenty   he is  by virtue of his heritage of three languages  modern languages  master in a small private school in the south of england  to the casual  observer he is singularly like any other modern languages master in any  other small private school  his costume is neither very costly nor very  fashionable  but  on the other hand  it is not markedly cheap or shabby   his complexion  like his height and his bearing  is inconspicuous  you  would notice  perhaps  that  like the majority of people  his face was not  absolutely symmetrical  his right eye a little larger than the left  and  his jaw a trifle heavier on the right side  if you  as an ordinary  careless person  were to bare his chest and feel his heart beating  you  would probably find it quite like the heart of anyone else  but here you  and the trained observer would part company  if you found his heart quite  ordinary  the trained observer would find it quite otherwise  and once the  thing was pointed out to you  you too would perceive the peculiarity  easily enough  it is that gottfried s heart beats on the right side of his  body     now  that is not the only singularity of gottfried s structure  although  it is the only one that would appeal to the untrained mind  careful  sounding of gottfried s internal arrangements by a well known surgeon  seems to point to the fact that all the other unsymmetrical parts of his  body are similarly misplaced  the right lobe of his liver is on the left  side  the left on his right  while his lungs  too  are similarly  contraposed  what is still more singular  unless gottfried is a consummate  actor  we must believe that his right hand has recently become his left   since the occurrences we are about to consider  as impartially as  possible   he has found the utmost difficulty in writing  except from  right to left across the paper with his left hand  he cannot throw with  his right hand  he is perplexed at meal times between knife and fork  and  his ideas of the rule of the road  he is a cyclist  are still a dangerous  confusion  and there is not a scrap of evidence to show that before these  occurrences gottfried was at all left handed     there is yet another wonderful fact in this preposterous business   gottfried produces three photographs of himself  you have him at the age  of five or six  thrusting fat legs at you from under a plaid frock  and  scowling  in that photograph his left eye is a little larger than his  right  and his jaw is a trifle heavier on the left side  this is the  reverse of his present living condition  the photograph of gottfried at  fourteen seems to contradict these facts  but that is because it is one of  those cheap  gem  photographs that were then in vogue  taken direct upon  metal  and therefore reversing things just as a looking glass would  the  third photograph represents him at one and twenty  and confirms the record  of the others  there seems here evidence of the strongest confirmatory  character that gottfried has exchanged his left side for his right  yet  how a human being can be so changed  short of a fantastic and pointless  miracle  it is exceedingly hard to suggest     in one way  of course  these facts might be explicable on the supposition  that plattner has undertaken an elaborate mystification  on the strength  of his heart s displacement  photographs may be faked  and left handedness  imitated  but the character of the man does not lend itself to any such  theory  he is quiet  practical  unobtrusive  and thoroughly sane  from the  nordau standpoint  he likes beer  and smokes moderately  takes walking  exercise daily  and has a healthily high estimate of the value of his  teaching  he has a good but untrained tenor voice  and takes a pleasure in  singing airs of a popular and cheerful character  he is fond  but not  morbidly fond  of reading   chiefly fiction pervaded with a vaguely pious  optimism   sleeps well  and rarely dreams  he is  in fact  the very last  person to evolve a fantastic fable  indeed  so far from forcing this story  upon the world  he has been singularly reticent on the matter  he meets  enquirers with a certain engaging  bashfulness is almost the word  that  disarms the most suspicious  he seems genuinely ashamed that anything so  unusual has occurred to him     it is to be regretted that plattner s aversion to the idea of post mortem  dissection may postpone  perhaps for ever  the positive proof that his  entire body has had its left and right sides transposed  upon that fact  mainly the credibility of his story hangs  there is no way of taking a man  and moving him about in space as ordinary people understand space  that  will result in our changing his sides  whatever you do  his right is still  his right  his left his left  you can do that with a perfectly thin and  flat thing  of course  if you were to cut a figure out of paper  any  figure with a right and left side  you could change its sides simply by  lifting it up and turning it over  but with a solid it is different   mathematical theorists tell us that the only way in which the right and  left sides of a solid body can be changed is by taking that body clean out  of space as we know it   taking it out of ordinary existence  that is  and  turning it somewhere outside space  this is a little abstruse  no doubt   but anyone with any knowledge of mathematical theory will assure the  reader of its truth  to put the thing in technical language  the curious  inversion of plattner s right and left sides is proof that he has moved  out of our space into what is called the fourth dimension  and that he has  returned again to our world  unless we choose to consider ourselves the  victims of an elaborate and motiveless fabrication  we are almost bound to  believe that this has occurred     so much for the tangible facts  we come now to the account of the  phenomena that attended his temporary disappearance from the world  it  appears that in the sussexville proprietary school  plattner not only  discharged the duties of modern languages master  but also taught  chemistry  commercial geography  bookkeeping  shorthand  drawing  and any  other additional subject to which the changing fancies of the boys   parents might direct attention  he knew little or nothing of these various  subjects  but in secondary as distinguished from board or elementary  schools  knowledge in the teacher is  very properly  by no means so  necessary as high moral character and gentlemanly tone  in chemistry he  was particularly deficient  knowing  he says  nothing beyond the three  gases  whatever the three gases may be   as  however  his pupils began by  knowing nothing  and derived all their information from him  this caused  him  or anyone  but little inconvenience for several terms  then a little  boy named whibble joined the school  who had been educated  it seems  by  some mischievous relative into an inquiring habit of mind  this little boy  followed plattner s lessons with marked and sustained interest  and in  order to exhibit his zeal on the subject  brought  at various times   substances for plattner to analyse  plattner  flattered by this evidence  of his power of awakening interest  and trusting to the boy s ignorance   analysed these  and even  made general statements as to their composition   indeed  he was so far stimulated by his pupil as to obtain a work upon  analytical chemistry  and study it during his supervision of the evening s  preparation  he was surprised to find chemistry quite an interesting  subject     so far the story is absolutely commonplace  but now the greenish powder  comes upon the scene  the source of that greenish powder seems   unfortunately  lost  master whibble tells a tortuous story of finding it  done up in a packet in a disused limekiln near the downs  it would have  been an excellent thing for plattner  and possibly for master whibble s  family  if a match could have been applied to that powder there and then   the young gentleman certainly did not bring it to school in a packet  but  in a common eight ounce graduated medicine bottle  plugged with masticated  newspaper  he gave it to plattner at the end of the afternoon school  four  boys had been detained after school prayers in order to complete some  neglected tasks  and plattner was supervising these in the small class room  in which the chemical teaching was conducted  the appliances for the  practical teaching of chemistry in the sussexville proprietary school  as  in most small schools in this country  are characterised by a severe  simplicity  they are kept in a small cupboard standing in a recess  and  having about the same capacity as a common travelling trunk  plattner   being bored with his passive superintendence  seems to have welcomed the  intervention of whibble with his green powder as an agreeable diversion   and  unlocking this cupboard  proceeded at once with his analytical  experiments  whibble sat  luckily for himself  at a safe distance   regarding him  the four malefactors  feigning a profound absorption in  their work  watched him furtively with the keenest interest  for even  within the limits of the three gases  plattner s practical chemistry was   i understand  temerarious     they are practically unanimous in their account of plattner s proceedings   he poured a little of the green powder into a test tube  and tried the  substance with water  hydrochloric acid  nitric acid  and sulphuric acid  in succession  getting no result  he emptied out a little heap  nearly  half the bottleful  in fact  upon a slate and tried a match  he held the  medicine bottle in his left hand  the stuff began to smoke and melt  and  then exploded with deafening violence and a blinding flash     the five boys  seeing the flash and being prepared for catastrophes   ducked below their desks  and were none of them seriously hurt  the window  was blown out into the playground  and the blackboard on its easel was  upset  the slate was smashed to atoms  some plaster fell from the ceiling   no other damage was done to the school edifice or appliances  and the boys  at first  seeing nothing of plattner  fancied he was knocked down and  lying out of their sight below the desks  they jumped out of their places  to go to his assistance  and were amazed to find the space empty  being  still confused by the sudden violence of the report  they hurried to the  open door  under the impression that he must have been hurt  and have  rushed out of the room  but carson  the foremost  nearly collided in the  doorway with the principal  mr  lidgett     mr  lidgett is a corpulent  excitable man with one eye  the boys describe  him as stumbling into the room mouthing some of those tempered expletives  irritable schoolmasters accustom themselves to use  lest worse befall    wretched mumchancer   he said   where s mr  plattner   the boys are  agreed on the very words    wobbler    snivelling puppy   and  mumchancer   are  it seems  among the ordinary small change of mr  lidgett s scholastic  commerce      where s mr  plattner  that was a question that was to be repeated many  times in the next few days  it really seemed as though that frantic  hyperbole   blown to atoms   had for once realised itself  there was not a  visible particle of plattner to be seen  not a drop of blood nor a stitch  of clothing to be found  apparently he had been blown clean out of  existence and left not a wrack behind  not so much as would cover a  sixpenny piece  to quote a proverbial expression  the evidence of his  absolute disappearance as a consequence of that explosion is indubitable     it is not necessary to enlarge here upon the commotion excited in the  sussexville proprietary school  and in sussexville and elsewhere  by this  event  it is quite possible  indeed  that some of the readers of these  pages may recall the hearing of some remote and dying version of that  excitement during the last summer holidays  lidgett  it would seem  did  everything in his power to suppress and minimise the story  he instituted  a penalty of twenty five lines for any mention of plattner s name among  the boys  and stated in the schoolroom that he was clearly aware of his  assistant s whereabouts  he was afraid  he explains  that the possibility  of an explosion happening  in spite of the elaborate precautions taken to  minimise the practical teaching of chemistry  might injure the reputation  of the school  and so might any mysterious quality in plattner s  departure  indeed  he did everything in his power to make the occurrence  seem as ordinary as possible  in particular  he cross examined the five  eye witnesses of the occurrence so searchingly that they began to doubt  the plain evidence of their senses  but  in spite of these efforts  the  tale  in a magnified and distorted state  made a nine days  wonder in the  district  and several parents withdrew their sons on colourable pretexts   not the least remarkable point in the matter is the fact that a large  number of people in the neighbourhood dreamed singularly vivid dreams of  plattner during the period of excitement before his return  and that these  dreams had a curious uniformity  in almost all of them plattner was seen   sometimes singly  sometimes in company  wandering about through a  coruscating iridescence  in all cases his face was pale and distressed   and in some he gesticulated towards the dreamer  one or two of the boys   evidently under the influence of nightmare  fancied that plattner  approached them with remarkable swiftness  and seemed to look closely into  their very eyes  others fled with plattner from the pursuit of vague and  extraordinary creatures of a globular shape  but all these fancies were  forgotten in inquiries and speculations when on the wednesday next but one  after the monday of the explosion  plattner returned     the circumstances of his return were as singular as those of his  departure  so far as mr  lidgett s somewhat choleric outline can be filled  in from plattner s hesitating statements  it would appear that on  wednesday evening  towards the hour of sunset  the former gentleman   having dismissed evening preparation  was engaged in his garden  picking  and eating strawberries  a fruit of which he is inordinately fond  it is a  large old fashioned garden  secured from observation  fortunately  by a  high and ivy covered red brick wall  just as he was stooping over a  particularly prolific plant  there was a flash in the air and a heavy  thud  and before he could look round  some heavy body struck him violently  from behind  he was pitched forward  crushing the strawberries he held in  his hand  and that so roughly  that his silk hat  mr  lidgett adheres to  the older ideas of scholastic costume  was driven violently down upon his  forehead  and almost over one eye  this heavy missile  which slid over him  sideways and collapsed into a sitting posture among the strawberry plants   proved to be our long lost mr  gottfried plattner  in an extremely  dishevelled condition  he was collarless and hatless  his linen was dirty   and there was blood upon his hands  mr  lidgett was so indignant and  surprised that he remained on all fours  and with his hat jammed down on  his eye  while he expostulated vehemently with plattner for his  disrespectful and unaccountable conduct     this scarcely idyllic scene completes what i may call the exterior version  of the plattner story  its exoteric aspect  it is quite unnecessary to  enter here into all the details of his dismissal by mr  lidgett  such  details  with the full names and dates and references  will be found in  the larger report of these occurrences that was laid before the society  for the investigation of abnormal phenomena  the singular transposition of  plattner s right and left sides was scarcely observed for the first day or  so  and then first in connection with his disposition to write from right  to left across the blackboard  he concealed rather than ostended this  curious confirmatory circumstance  as he considered it would unfavourably  affect his prospects in a new situation  the displacement of his heart was  discovered some months after  when he was having a tooth extracted under  anaesthetics  he then  very unwillingly  allowed a cursory surgical  examination to be made of himself  with a view to a brief account in the   journal of anatomy   that exhausts the statement of the material  facts  and we may now go on to consider plattner s account of the matter     but first let us clearly differentiate between the preceding portion of  this story and what is to follow  all i have told thus far is established  by such evidence as even a criminal lawyer would approve  every one of the  witnesses is still alive  the reader  if he have the leisure  may hunt the  lads out to morrow  or even brave the terrors of the redoubtable lidgett   and cross examine and trap and test to his heart s content  gottfried  plattner himself  and his twisted heart and his three photographs  are  producible  it may be taken as proved that he did disappear for nine days  as the consequence of an explosion  that he returned almost as violently   under circumstances in their nature annoying to mr  lidgett  whatever the  details of those circumstances may be  and that he returned inverted  just  as a reflection returns from a mirror  from the last fact  as i have  already stated  it follows almost inevitably that plattner  during those  nine days  must have been in some state of existence altogether out of  space  the evidence to these statements is  indeed  far stronger than that  upon which most murderers are hanged  but for his own particular account  of where he had been  with its confused explanations and wellnigh  self contradictory details  we have only mr  gottfried plattner s word  i  do not wish to discredit that  but i must point out  what so many writers  upon obscure psychic phenomena fail to do  that we are passing here from  the practically undeniable to that kind of matter which any reasonable man  is entitled to believe or reject as he thinks proper  the previous  statements render it plausible  its discordance with common experience  tilts it towards the incredible  i would prefer not to sway the beam of  the reader s judgment either way  but simply to tell the story as plattner  told it me     he gave me his narrative  i may state  at my house at chislehurst  and so  soon as he had left me that evening  i went into my study and wrote down  everything as i remembered it  subsequently he was good enough to read  over a type written copy  so that its substantial correctness is  undeniable     he states that at the moment of the explosion he distinctly thought he was  killed  he felt lifted off his feet and driven forcibly backward  it is a  curious fact for psychologists that he thought clearly during his backward  flight  and wondered whether he should hit the chemistry cupboard or the  blackboard easel  his heels struck ground  and he staggered and fell  heavily into a sitting position on something soft and firm  for a moment  the concussion stunned him  he became aware at once of a vivid scent of  singed hair  and he seemed to hear the voice of lidgett asking for him   you will understand that for a time his mind was greatly confused     at first he was under the impression that he was still standing in the  class room  he perceived quite distinctly the surprise of the boys and the  entry of mr  lidgett  he is quite positive upon that score  he did not  hear their remarks  but that he ascribed to the deafening effect of the  experiment  things about him seemed curiously dark and faint  but his mind  explained that on the obvious but mistaken idea that the explosion had  engendered a huge volume of dark smoke  through the dimness the figures of  lidgett and the boys moved  as faint and silent as ghosts  plattner s face  still tingled with the stinging heat of the flash  he  was  he says   all  muddled   his first definite thoughts seem to have been of his personal  safety  he thought he was perhaps blinded and deafened  he felt his limbs  and face in a gingerly manner  then his perceptions grew clearer  and he  was astonished to miss the old familiar desks and other schoolroom  furniture about him  only dim  uncertain  grey shapes stood in the place  of these  then came a thing that made him shout aloud  and awoke his  stunned faculties to instant activity   two of the boys  gesticulating   walked one after the other clean through him   neither manifested the  slightest consciousness of his presence  it is difficult to imagine the  sensation he felt  they came against him  he says  with no more force than  a wisp of mist     plattner s first thought after that was that he was dead  having been  brought up with thoroughly sound views in these matters  however  he was a  little surprised to find his body still about him  his second conclusion  was that he was not dead  but that the others were  that the explosion had  destroyed the sussexville proprietary school and every soul in it except  himself  but that  too  was scarcely satisfactory  he was thrown back upon  astonished observation     everything about him was profoundly dark  at first it seemed to have an  altogether ebony blackness  overhead was a black firmament  the only touch  of light in the scene was a faint greenish glow at the edge of the sky in  one direction  which threw into prominence a horizon of undulating black  hills  this  i say  was his impression at first  as his eye grew  accustomed to the darkness  he began to distinguish a faint quality of  differentiating greenish colour in the circumambient night  against this  background the furniture and occupants of the class room  it seems  stood  out like phosphorescent spectres  faint and impalpable  he extended his  hand  and thrust it without an effort through the wall of the room by the  fireplace     he describes himself as making a strenuous effort to attract attention  he  shouted to lidgett  and tried to seize the boys as they went to and fro   he only desisted from these attempts when mrs  lidgett  whom he  as an  assistant master  naturally disliked  entered the room  he says the  sensation of being in the world  and yet not a part of it  was an  extraordinarily disagreeable one  he compared his feelings  not inaptly   to those of a cat watching a mouse through a window  whenever he made a  motion to communicate with the dim  familiar world about him  he found an  invisible  incomprehensible barrier preventing intercourse     he then turned his attention to his solid environment  he found the  medicine bottle still unbroken in his hand  with the remainder of the  green powder therein  he put this in his pocket  and began to feel about  him  apparently he was sitting on a boulder of rock covered with a velvety  moss  the dark country about him he was unable to see  the faint  misty  picture of the schoolroom blotting it out  but he had a feeling  due  perhaps to a cold wind  that he was near the crest of a hill  and that a  steep valley fell away beneath his feet  the green glow along the edge of  the sky seemed to be growing in extent and intensity  he stood up  rubbing  his eyes     it would seem that he made a few steps  going steeply downhill  and then  stumbled  nearly fell  and sat down again upon a jagged mass of rock to  watch the dawn  he became aware that the world about him was absolutely  silent  it was as still as it was dark  and though there was a cold wind  blowing up the hill face  the rustle of grass  the soughing of the boughs  that should have accompanied it  were absent  he could hear  therefore  if  he could not see  that the hillside upon which he stood was rocky and  desolate  the green grew brighter every moment  and as it did so a faint   transparent blood red mingled with  but did not mitigate  the blackness of  the sky overhead and the rocky desolations about him  having regard to  what follows  i am inclined to think that that redness may have been an  optical effect due to contrast  something black fluttered momentarily  against the livid yellow green of the lower sky  and then the thin and  penetrating voice of a bell rose out of the black gulf below him  an  oppressive expectation grew with the growing light     it is probable that an hour or more elapsed while he sat there  the  strange green light growing brighter every moment  and spreading slowly   in flamboyant fingers  upward towards the zenith  as it grew  the spectral  vision of  our  world became relatively or absolutely fainter   probably both  for the time must have been about that of our earthly  sunset  so far as his vision of our world went  plattner  by his few steps  downhill  had passed through the floor of the class room  and was now  it  seemed  sitting in mid air in the larger schoolroom downstairs  he saw the  boarders distinctly  but much more faintly than he had seen lidgett  they  were preparing their evening tasks  and he noticed with interest that  several were cheating with their euclid riders by means of a crib  a  compilation whose existence he had hitherto never suspected  as the time  passed  they faded steadily  as steadily as the light of the green dawn  increased     looking down into the valley  he saw that the light had crept far down its  rocky sides  and that the profound blackness of the abyss was now broken  by a minute green glow  like the light of a glow worm  and almost  immediately the limb of a huge heavenly body of blazing green rose over  the basaltic undulations of the distant hills  and the monstrous  hill masses about him came out gaunt and desolate  in green light and  deep  ruddy black shadows  he became aware of a vast number of ball shaped  objects drifting as thistledown drifts over the high ground  there were  none of these nearer to him than the opposite side of the gorge  the bell  below twanged quicker and quicker  with something like impatient  insistence  and several lights moved hither and thither  the boys at work  at their desks were now almost imperceptibly faint     this extinction of our world  when the green sun of this other universe  rose  is a curious point upon which plattner insists  during the  other world night it is difficult to move about  on account of the  vividness with which the things of this world are visible  it becomes a  riddle to explain why  if this is the case  we in this world catch no  glimpse of the other world  it is due  perhaps  to the comparatively  vivid illumination of this world of ours  plattner describes the midday  of the other world  at its brightest  as not being nearly so bright as  this world at full moon  while its night is profoundly black   consequently  the amount of light  even in an ordinary dark room  is  sufficient to render the things of the other world invisible  on the  same principle that faint phosphorescence is only visible in the  profoundest darkness  i have tried  since he told me his story  to see  something of the other world by sitting for a long space in a  photographer s dark room at night  i have certainly seen indistinctly  the form of greenish slopes and rocks  but only  i must admit  very  indistinctly indeed  the reader may possibly be more successful  plattner  tells me that since his return he has dreamt and seen and recognised  places in the other world  but this is probably due to his memory  of these scenes  it seems quite possible that people with unusually  keen eyesight may occasionally catch a glimpse of this strange other world  about us     however  this is a digression  as the green sun rose  a long street of  black buildings became perceptible  though only darkly and indistinctly   in the gorge  and after some hesitation  plattner began to clamber down  the precipitous descent towards them  the descent was long and exceedingly  tedious  being so not only by the extraordinary steepness  but also by  reason of the looseness of the boulders with which the whole face of the  hill was strewn  the noise of his descent  now and then his heels struck  fire from the rocks  seemed now the only sound in the universe  for the  beating of the bell had ceased  as he drew nearer  he perceived that the  various edifices had a singular resemblance to tombs and mausoleums and  monuments  saving only that they were all uniformly black instead of being  white  as most sepulchres are  and then he saw  crowding out of the  largest building  very much as people disperse from church  a number of  pallid  rounded  pale green figures  these dispersed in several directions  about the broad street of the place  some going through side alleys and  reappearing upon the steepness of the hill  others entering some of the  small black buildings which lined the way     at the sight of these things drifting up towards him  plattner stopped   staring  they were not walking  they were indeed limbless  and they had  the appearance of human heads  beneath which a tadpole like body swung  he  was too astonished at their strangeness  too full  indeed  of strangeness   to be seriously alarmed by them  they drove towards him  in front of the  chill wind that was blowing uphill  much as soap bubbles drive before a  draught  and as he looked at the nearest of those approaching  he saw it  was indeed a human head  albeit with singularly large eyes  and wearing  such an expression of distress and anguish as he had never seen before  upon mortal countenance  he was surprised to find that it did not turn to  regard him  but seemed to be watching and following some unseen moving  thing  for a moment he was puzzled  and then it occurred to him that this  creature was watching with its enormous eyes something that was happening  in the world he had just left  nearer it came  and nearer  and he was too  astonished to cry out  it made a very faint fretting sound as it came  close to him  then it struck his face with a gentle pat  its touch was  very cold  and drove past him  and upward towards the crest of the hill     an extraordinary conviction flashed across plattner s mind that this head  had a strong likeness to lidgett  then he turned his attention to the  other heads that were now swarming thickly up the hill side  none made the  slightest sign of recognition  one or two  indeed  came close to his head  and almost followed the example of the first  but he dodged convulsively  out of the way  upon most of them he saw the same expression of unavailing  regret he had seen upon the first  and heard the same faint sounds of  wretchedness from them  one or two wept  and one rolling swiftly uphill  wore an expression of diabolical rage  but others were cold  and several  had a look of gratified interest in their eyes  one  at least  was almost  in an ecstasy of happiness  plattner does not remember that he recognised  any more likenesses in those he saw at this time     for several hours  perhaps  plattner watched these strange things  dispersing themselves over the hills  and not till long after they had  ceased to issue from the clustering black buildings in the gorge  did he  resume his downward climb  the darkness about him increased so much that  he had a difficulty in stepping true  overhead the sky was now a bright   pale green  he felt neither hunger nor thirst  later  when he did  he  found a chilly stream running down the centre of the gorge  and the rare  moss upon the boulders  when he tried it at last in desperation  was good  to eat     he groped about among the tombs that ran down the gorge  seeking vaguely  for some clue to these inexplicable things  after a long time he came to  the entrance of the big mausoleum like building from which the heads had  issued  in this he found a group of green lights burning upon a kind of  basaltic altar  and a bell rope from a belfry overhead hanging down into  the centre of the place  round the wall ran a lettering of fire in a  character unknown to him  while he was still wondering at the purport of  these things  he heard the receding tramp of heavy feet echoing far down  the street  he ran out into the darkness again  but he could see nothing   he had a mind to pull the bell rope  and finally decided to follow the  footsteps  but  although he ran far  he never overtook them  and his  shouting was of no avail  the gorge seemed to extend an interminable  distance  it was as dark as earthly starlight throughout its length  while  the ghastly green day lay along the upper edge of its precipices  there  were none of the heads  now  below  they were all  it seemed  busily  occupied along the upper slopes  looking up  he saw them drifting hither  and thither  some hovering stationary  some flying swiftly through the  air  it reminded him  he said  of  big snowflakes   only these were black  and pale green     in pursuing the firm  undeviating footsteps that he never overtook  in  groping into new regions of this endless devil s dyke  in clambering up  and down the pitiless heights  in wandering about the summits  and in  watching the drifting faces  plattner states that he spent the better part  of seven or eight days  he did not keep count  he says  though once or  twice he found eyes watching him  he had word with no living soul  he  slept among the rocks on the hillside  in the gorge things earthly were  invisible  because  from the earthly standpoint  it was far underground   on the altitudes  so soon as the earthly day began  the world became  visible to him  he found himself sometimes stumbling over the dark green  rocks  or arresting himself on a precipitous brink  while all about him  the green branches of the sussexville lanes were swaying  or  again  he  seemed to be walking through the sussexville streets  or watching unseen  the private business of some household  and then it was he discovered   that to almost every human being in our world there pertained some of  these drifting heads  that everyone in the world is watched intermittently  by these helpless disembodiments     what are they  these watchers of the living  plattner never learned  but  two  that presently found and followed him  were like his childhood s  memory of his father and mother  now and then other faces turned their  eyes upon him  eyes like those of dead people who had swayed him  or  injured him  or helped him in his youth and manhood  whenever they looked  at him  plattner was overcome with a strange sense of responsibility  to  his mother he ventured to speak  but she made no answer  she looked sadly   steadfastly  and tenderly  a little reproachfully  too  it seemed  into  his eyes     he simply tells this story  he does not endeavour to explain  we are left  to surmise who these watchers of the living may be  or  if they are indeed  the dead  why they should so closely and passionately watch a world they  have left for ever  it may be  indeed to my mind it seems just  that  when  our life has closed  when evil or good is no longer a choice for us  we  may still have to witness the working out of the train of consequences we  have laid  if human souls continue after death  then surely human  interests continue after death  but that is merely my own guess at the  meaning of the things seen  plattner offers no interpretation  for none  was given him  it is well the reader should understand this clearly  day  after day  with his head reeling  he wandered about this strange lit world  outside the world  weary and  towards the end  weak and hungry  by day  by  our earthly day  that is  the ghostly vision of the old familiar scenery  of sussexville  all about him  irked and worried him  he could not see  where to put his feet  and ever and again with a chilly touch one of these  watching souls would come against his face  and after dark the multitude  of these watchers about him  and their intent distress  confused his mind  beyond describing  a great longing to return to the earthly life that was  so near and yet so remote consumed him  the unearthliness of things about  him produced a positively painful mental distress  he was worried beyond  describing by his own particular followers  he would shout at them to  desist from staring at him  scold at them  hurry away from them  they were  always mute and intent  run as he might over the uneven ground  they  followed his destinies     on the ninth day  towards evening  plattner heard the invisible footsteps  approaching  far away down the gorge  he was then wandering over the broad  crest of the same hill upon which he had fallen in his entry into this  strange other world of his  he turned to hurry down into the gorge   feeling his way hastily  and was arrested by the sight of the thing that  was happening in a room in a back street near the school  both of the  people in the room he knew by sight  the windows were open  the blinds up   and the setting sun shone clearly into it  so that it came out quite  brightly at first  a vivid oblong of room  lying like a magic lantern  picture upon the black landscape and the livid green dawn  in addition to  the sunlight  a candle had just been lit in the room     on the bed lay a lank man  his ghastly white face terrible upon the  tumbled pillow  his clenched hands were raised above his head  a little  table beside the bed carried a few medicine bottles  some toast and water   and an empty glass  every now and then the lank man s lips fell apart   to indicate a word he could not articulate  but the woman did not notice  that he wanted anything  because she was busy turning out papers from an  old fashioned bureau in the opposite corner of the room  at first the  picture was very vivid indeed  but as the green dawn behind it grew  brighter and brighter  so it became fainter and more and more transparent     as the echoing footsteps paced nearer and nearer  those footsteps that  sound so loud in that other world and come so silently in this  plattner  perceived about him a great multitude of dim faces gathering together out  of the darkness and watching the two people in the room  never before had  he seen so many of the watchers of the living  a multitude had eyes only  for the sufferer in the room  another multitude  in infinite anguish   watched the woman as she hunted with greedy eyes for something she could  not find  they crowded about plattner  they came across his sight and  buffeted his face  the noise of their unavailing regrets was all about  him  he saw clearly only now and then  at other times the picture quivered  dimly  through the veil of green reflections upon their movements  in the  room it must have been very still  and plattner says the candle flame  streamed up into a perfectly vertical line of smoke  but in his ears each  footfall and its echoes beat like a clap of thunder  and the faces   two  more particularly near the woman s  one a woman s also  white and  clear featured  a face which might have once been cold and hard  but which  was now softened by the touch of a wisdom strange to earth  the other  might have been the woman s father  both were evidently absorbed in the  contemplation of some act of hateful meanness  so it seemed  which they  could no longer guard against and prevent  behind were others  teachers   it may be  who had taught ill  friends whose influence had failed  and  over the man  too  a multitude  but none that seemed to be parents or  teachers  faces that might once have been coarse  now purged to strength  by sorrow  and in the forefront one face  a girlish one  neither angry nor  remorseful  but merely patient and weary  and  as it seemed to plattner   waiting for relief  his powers of description fail him at the memory of  this multitude of ghastly countenances  they gathered on the stroke of the  bell  he saw them all in the space of a second  it would seem that he was  so worked on by his excitement that  quite involuntarily  his restless  fingers took the bottle of green powder out of his pocket and held it  before him  but he does not remember that     abruptly the footsteps ceased  he waited for the next  and there was  silence  and then suddenly  cutting through the unexpected stillness like  a keen  thin blade  came the first stroke of the bell  at that the  multitudinous faces swayed to and fro  and a louder crying began all about  him  the woman did not hear  she was burning something now in the candle  flame  at the second stroke everything grew dim  and a breath of wind  icy  cold  blew through the host of watchers  they swirled about him like an  eddy of dead leaves in the spring  and at the third stroke something was  extended through them to the bed  you have heard of a beam of light  this  was like a beam of darkness  and looking again at it  plattner saw that it  was a shadowy arm and hand     the green sun was now topping the black desolations of the horizon  and  the vision of the room was very faint  plattner could see that the white  of the bed struggled  and was convulsed  and that the woman looked round  over her shoulder at it  startled     the cloud of watchers lifted high like a puff of green dust before the  wind  and swept swiftly downward towards the temple in the gorge  then  suddenly plattner understood the meaning of the shadowy black arm that  stretched across his shoulder and clutched its prey  he did not dare turn  his head to see the shadow behind the arm  with a violent effort  and  covering his eyes  he set himself to run  made  perhaps  twenty strides   then slipped on a boulder  and fell  he fell forward on his hands  and the  bottle smashed and exploded as he touched the ground     in another moment he found himself  stunned and bleeding  sitting face to  face with lidgett in the old walled garden behind the school                                                 there the story of plattner s experiences ends  i have resisted  i believe  successfully  the natural disposition of a writer of fiction to dress up  incidents of this sort  i have told the thing as far as possible in the  order in which plattner told it to me  i have carefully avoided any  attempt at style  effect  or construction  it would have been easy  for  instance  to have worked the scene of the death bed into a kind of plot in  which plattner might have been involved  but  quite apart from the  objectionableness of falsifying a most extraordinary true story  any such  trite devices would spoil  to my mind  the peculiar effect of this dark  world  with its livid green illumination and its drifting watchers of the  living  which  unseen and unapproachable to us  is yet lying all about us     it remains to add that a death did actually occur in vincent terrace  just  beyond the school garden  and  so far as can be proved  at the moment of  plattner s return  deceased was a rate collector and insurance agent  his  widow  who was much younger than himself  married last month a mr   whymper  a veterinary surgeon of allbeeding  as the portion of this story  given here has in various forms circulated orally in sussexville  she has  consented to my use of her name  on condition that i make it distinctly  known that she emphatically contradicts every detail of plattner s account  of her husband s last moments  she burnt no will  she says  although  plattner never accused her of doing so  her husband made but one will  and  that just after their marriage  certainly  from a man who had never seen  it  plattner s account of the furniture of the room was curiously  accurate     one other thing  even at the risk of an irksome repetition  i must insist  upon  lest i seem to favour the credulous  superstitious view  plattner s  absence from the world for nine days is  i think  proved  but that does  not prove his story  it is quite conceivable that even outside space  hallucinations may be possible  that  at least  the reader must bear  distinctly in mind           xvi       the red room        i can assure you   said i   that it will take a very tangible ghost to  frighten me   and i stood up before the fire with my glass in my hand      it is your own choosing   said the man with the withered arm  and glanced  at me askance      eight and twenty years   said i   i have lived  and never a ghost have i  seen as yet      the old woman sat staring hard into the fire  her pale eyes wide open    ay   she broke in   and eight and twenty years you have lived and never  seen the likes of this house  i reckon  there s a many things to see  when  one s still but eight and twenty   she swayed her head slowly from side to  side   a many things to see and sorrow for      i half suspected the old people were trying to enhance the spiritual  terrors of their house by their droning insistence  i put down my empty  glass on the table and looked about the room  and caught a glimpse of  myself  abbreviated and broadened to an impossible sturdiness  in the  queer old mirror at the end of the room   well   i said   if i see  anything to night  i shall be so much the wiser  for i come to the  business with an open mind       it s your own choosing   said the man with the withered arm once more     i heard the sound of a stick and a shambling step on the flags in the  passage outside  and the door creaked on its hinges as a second old man  entered  more bent  more wrinkled  more aged even than the first  he  supported himself by a single crutch  his eyes were covered by a shade   and his lower lip  half averted  hung pale and pink from his decaying  yellow teeth  he made straight for an arm chair on the opposite side of  the table  sat down clumsily  and began to cough  the man with the  withered arm gave this new comer a short glance of positive dislike  the  old woman took no notice of his arrival  but remained with her eyes fixed  steadily on the fire      i said  it s your own choosing   said the man with the withered arm  when  the coughing had ceased for a while      it s my own choosing   i answered     the man with the shade became aware of my presence for the first time  and  threw his head back for a moment and sideways  to see me  i caught a  momentary glimpse of his eyes  small and bright and inflamed  then he  began to cough and splutter again      why don t you drink   said the man with the withered arm  pushing the  beer towards him  the man with the shade poured out a glassful with a  shaky hand that splashed half as much again on the deal table  a monstrous  shadow of him crouched upon the wall and mocked his action as he poured  and drank  i must confess i had scarce expected these grotesque  custodians  there is to my mind something inhuman in senility  something  crouching and atavistic  the human qualities seem to drop from old people  insensibly day by day  the three of them made me feel uncomfortable  with  their gaunt silences  their bent carriage  their evident unfriendliness to  me and to one another      if   said i   you will show me to this haunted room of yours  i will make  myself comfortable there      the old man with the cough jerked his head back so suddenly that it  startled me  and shot another glance of his red eyes at me from under the  shade  but no one answered me  i waited a minute  glancing from one to the  other      if   i said a little louder   if you will show me to this haunted room of  yours  i will relieve you from the task of entertaining me       there s a candle on the slab outside the door   said the man with the  withered arm  looking at my feet as he addressed me   but if you go to the  red room to night           this night of all nights   said the old woman       you go alone       very well   i answered   and which way do i go       you go along the passage for a bit   said he   until you come to a door   and through that is a spiral staircase  and half way up that is a landing  and another door covered with baize  go through that and down the long  corridor to the end  and the red room is on your left up the steps       have i got that right   i said  and repeated his directions  he corrected  me in one particular      and are you really going   said the man with the shade  looking at me  again for the third time  with that queer  unnatural tilting of the face       this night of all nights   said the old woman       it is what i came for   i said  and moved towards the door  as i did so   the old man with the shade rose and staggered round the table  so as to be  closer to the others and to the fire  at the door i turned and looked at  them  and saw they were all close together  dark against the firelight   staring at me over their shoulders  with an intent expression on their  ancient faces      good night   i said  setting the door open      it s your own choosing   said the man with the withered arm     i left the door wide open until the candle was well alight  and then i  shut them in and walked down the chilly  echoing passage     i must confess that the oddness of these three old pensioners in whose  charge her ladyship had left the castle  and the deep toned  old fashioned  furniture of the housekeeper s room in which they foregathered  affected  me in spite of my efforts to keep myself at a matter of fact phase  they  seemed to belong to another age  an older age  an age when things  spiritual were different from this of ours  less certain  an age when  omens and witches were credible  and ghosts beyond denying  their very  existence was spectral  the cut of their clothing  fashions born in dead  brains  the ornaments and conveniences of the room about them were  ghostly  the thoughts of vanished men  which still haunted rather than  participated in the world of to day  but with an effort i sent such  thoughts to the right about  the long  draughty subterranean passage was  chilly and dusty  and my candle flared and made the shadows cower and  quiver  the echoes rang up and down the spiral staircase  and a shadow  came sweeping up after me  and one fled before me into the darkness  overhead  i came to the landing and stopped there for a moment  listening  to a rustling that i fancied i heard  then  satisfied of the absolute  silence  i pushed open the baize covered door and stood in the corridor     the effect was scarcely what i expected  for the moonlight  coming in by  the great window on the grand staircase  picked out everything in vivid  black shadow or silvery illumination  everything was in its place  the  house might have been deserted on the yesterday instead of eighteen months  ago  there were candles in the sockets of the sconces  and whatever dust  had gathered on the carpets or upon the polished flooring was distributed  so evenly as to be invisible in the moonlight  i was about to advance  and  stopped abruptly  a bronze group stood upon the landing  hidden from me by  the corner of the wall  but its shadow fell with marvellous distinctness  upon the white panelling  and gave me the impression of someone crouching  to waylay me  i stood rigid for half a minute perhaps  then  with my hand  in the pocket that held my revolver  i advanced  only to discover a  ganymede and eagle glistening in the moonlight  that incident for a time  restored my nerve  and a porcelain chinaman on a buhl table  whose head  rocked silently as i passed him  scarcely startled me     the door to the red room and the steps up to it were in a shadowy corner   i moved my candle from side to side  in order to see clearly the nature of  the recess in which i stood before opening the door  here it was  thought  i  that my predecessor was found  and the memory of that story gave me a  sudden twinge of apprehension  i glanced over my shoulder at the ganymede  in the moonlight  and opened the door of the red room rather hastily  with  my face half turned to the pallid silence of the landing     i entered  closed the door behind me at once  turned the key i found in  the lock within  and stood with the candle held aloft  surveying the scene  of my vigil  the great red room of lorraine castle  in which the young  duke had died  or  rather  in which he had begun his dying  for he had  opened the door and fallen headlong down the steps i had just ascended   that had been the end of his vigil  of his gallant attempt to conquer the  ghostly tradition of the place  and never  i thought  had apoplexy better  served the ends of superstition  and there were other and older stories  that clung to the room  back to the half credible beginning of it all  the  tale of a timid wife and the tragic end that came to her husband s jest of  frightening her  and looking around that large sombre room  with its  shadowy window bays  its recesses and alcoves  one could well understand  the legends that had sprouted in its black corners  its germinating  darkness  my candle was a little tongue of light in its vastness  that  failed to pierce the opposite end of the room  and left an ocean of  mystery and suggestion beyond its island of light     i resolved to make a systematic examination of the place at once  and  dispel the fanciful suggestions of its obscurity before they obtained a  hold upon me  after satisfying myself of the fastening of the door  i  began to walk about the room  peering round each article of furniture   tucking up the valances of the bed  and opening its curtains wide  i  pulled up the blinds and examined the fastenings of the several windows  before closing the shutters  leant forward and looked up the blackness  of the wide chimney  and tapped the dark oak panelling for any secret  opening  there were two big mirrors in the room  each with a pair of  sconces bearing candles  and on the mantelshelf  too  were more candles in  china candlesticks  all these i lit one after the other  the fire was  laid  an unexpected consideration from the old housekeeper   and i lit it   to keep down any disposition to shiver  and when it was burning well  i  stood round with my back to it and regarded the room again  i had pulled  up a chintz covered arm chair and a table  to form a kind of barricade  before me  and on this lay my revolver ready to hand  my precise  examination had done me good  but i still found the remoter darkness of  the place  and its perfect stillness  too stimulating for the imagination   the echoing of the stir and crackling of the fire was no sort of comfort  to me  the shadow in the alcove at the end in particular  had that  undefinable quality of a presence  that odd suggestion of a lurking   living thing  that comes so easily in silence and solitude  at last  to  reassure myself  i walked with a candle into it  and satisfied myself that  there was nothing tangible there  i stood that candle upon the floor of  the alcove  and left it in that position     by this time i was in a state of considerable nervous tension  although to  my reason there was no adequate cause for the condition  my mind  however   was perfectly clear  i postulated quite unreservedly that nothing  supernatural could happen  and to pass the time i began to string some  rhymes together  ingoldsby fashion  of the original legend of the place  a  few i spoke aloud  but the echoes were not pleasant  for the same reason i  also abandoned  after a time  a conversation with myself upon the  impossibility of ghosts and haunting  my mind reverted to the three old  and distorted people downstairs  and i tried to keep it upon that topic   the sombre reds and blacks of the room troubled  me  even with seven  candles the place was merely dim  the one in the alcove flared in a  draught  and the fire flickering kept the shadows and penumbra perpetually  shifting and stirring  casting about for a remedy  i recalled the candles  i had seen in the passage  and  with a slight effort  walked out into the  moonlight  carrying a candle and leaving the door open  and presently  returned with as many as ten  these i put in various knick knacks of china  with which the room was sparsely adorned  lit and placed where the shadows  had lain deepest  some on the floor  some in the window recesses  until at  last my seventeen candles were so arranged that not an inch of the room  but had the direct light of at least one of them  it occurred to me that  when the ghost came  i could warn him not to trip over them  the room was  now quite brightly illuminated  there was something very cheery and  reassuring in these little streaming flames  and snuffing them gave me an  occupation  and afforded a helpful sense of the passage of time  even with  that  however  the brooding expectation of the vigil weighed heavily upon  me  it was after midnight that the candle in the alcove suddenly went out   and the black shadow sprang back to its place there  i did not see the  candle go out  i simply turned and saw that the darkness was there  as one  might start and see the unexpected presence of a stranger   by jove   said  i aloud   that draught s a strong one   and  taking the matches from the  table  i walked across the room in a leisurely manner  to relight the  corner again  my first match would not strike  and as i succeeded with the  second  something seemed to blink on the wall before me  i turned my head  involuntarily  and saw that the two candles on the little table by the  fireplace were extinguished  i rose at once to my feet      odd   i said   did i do that myself in a flash of absent mindedness      i walked back  relit one  and as i did so  i saw the candle in the right  sconce of one of the mirrors wink and go right out  and almost immediately  its companion followed it  there was no mistake about it  the flame  vanished  as if the wicks had been suddenly nipped between a finger and a  thumb  leaving the wick neither glowing nor smoking  but black  while i  stood gaping  the candle at the foot of the bed went out  and the shadows  seemed to take another step towards me      this won t do   said i  and first one and then another candle on the  mantelshelf followed      what s up   i cried  with a queer high note getting into my voice  somehow  at that the candle on the wardrobe went out  and the one i had  relit in the alcove followed      steady on   i said   these candles are wanted   speaking with a  half hysterical facetiousness  and scratching away at a match the while  for the mantel candlesticks  my hands trembled so much that twice i missed  the rough paper of the matchbox  as the mantel emerged from darkness again   two candles in the remoter end of the window were eclipsed  but with the  same match i also relit the larger mirror candles  and those on the floor  near the doorway  so that for the moment i seemed to gain on the  extinctions  but then in a volley there vanished four lights at once in  different corners of the room  and i struck another match in quivering  haste  and stood hesitating whither to take it     as i stood undecided  an invisible hand seemed to sweep out the two  candles on the table  with a cry of terror  i dashed at the alcove  then  into the corner  and then into the window  relighting three  as two more  vanished by the fireplace  then  perceiving a better way  i dropped the  matches on the iron bound deed box in the corner  and caught up the  bedroom candlestick  with this i avoided the delay of striking matches   but for all that the steady process of extinction went on  and the shadows  i feared and fought against returned  and crept in upon me  first a  step gained on this side of me and then on that  it was like a ragged  storm cloud sweeping out the stars  now and then one returned for a  minute  and was lost again  i was now almost frantic with the horror of  the coming darkness  and my self possession deserted me  i leaped panting  and dishevelled from candle to candle  in a vain struggle against that  remorseless advance     i bruised myself on the thigh against the table  i sent a chair headlong   i stumbled and fell and whisked the cloth from the table in my fall  my  candle rolled away from me  and i snatched another as i rose  abruptly  this was blown out  as i swung it off the table by the wind of my sudden  movement  and immediately the two remaining candles followed  but there  was light still in the room  a red light that staved off the shadows from  me  the fire  of course i could still thrust my candle between the bars  and relight it     i turned to where the flames were still dancing between the glowing coals   and splashing red reflections upon the furniture  made two steps towards  the grate  and incontinently the flames dwindled and vanished  the glow  vanished  the reflections rushed together and vanished  and as i thrust  the candle between the bars darkness closed upon me like the shutting of  an eye  wrapped about me in a stifling embrace  sealed my vision  and  crushed the last vestiges of reason from my brain  the candle fell from my  hand  i flung out my arms in a vain effort to thrust that ponderous  blackness away from me  and  lifting up my voice  screamed with all my  might  once  twice  thrice  then i think i must have staggered to my feet   i know i thought suddenly of the moonlit corridor  and  with my head bowed  and my arms over my face  made a run for the door     but i had forgotten the exact position of the door  and struck myself  heavily against the corner of the bed  i staggered back  turned  and was  either struck or struck myself against some other bulky furniture  i have  a vague memory of battering myself thus  to and fro in the darkness  of a  cramped struggle  and of my own wild crying as i darted to and fro  of a  heavy blow at last upon my forehead  a horrible sensation of falling that  lasted an age  of my last frantic effort to keep my footing  and then i  remember no more     i opened my eyes in daylight  my head was roughly bandaged  and the man  with the withered arm was watching my face  i looked about me  trying to  remember what had happened  and for a space i could not recollect  i  rolled my eyes into the corner  and saw the old woman  no longer  abstracted  pouring out some drops of medicine from a little blue phial  into a glass   where am i   i asked   i seem to remember you  and yet i  cannot remember who you are      they told me then  and i heard of the haunted red room as one who hears a  tale   we found you at dawn   said he   and there was blood on your  forehead and lips      it was very slowly i recovered my memory of my experience   you believe  now   said the old man   that the room is haunted   he spoke no longer as  one who greets an intruder  but as one who grieves for a broken friend      yes   said i   the room is haunted       and you have seen it  and we  who have lived here all our lives  have  never set eyes upon it  because we have never dared    tell us  is it  truly the old earl who          no   said i   it is not       i told you so   said the old lady  with the glass in her hand   it is his  poor young countess who was frightened          it is not   i said   there is neither ghost of earl nor ghost of countess  in that room  there is no ghost there at all  but worse  far worse          well   they said      the worst of all the things that haunt poor mortal man   said i   and  that is  in all its nakedness  fear that will not have light nor sound   that will not bear with reason  that deafens and darkens and overwhelms   it followed me through the corridor  it fought against me in the room         i stopped abruptly  there was an interval of silence  my hand went up to  my bandages     then the man with the shade sighed and spoke   that is it   said he   i  knew that was it  a power of darkness  to put such a curse upon a woman   it lurks there always  you can feel it even in the daytime  even of a  bright summer s day  in the hangings  in the curtains  keeping behind you  however you face about  in the dusk it creeps along the corridor and  follows you  so that you dare not turn  there is fear in that room of  hers  black fear  and there will be  so long as this house of sin  endures              xvii       the purple pileus      mr  coombes was sick of life  he walked away from his unhappy home  and   sick not only of his own existence but of everybody else s  turned aside  down gaswork lane to avoid the town  and  crossing the wooden bridge that  goes over the canal to starling s cottages  was presently alone in the  damp pine woods and out of sight and sound of human habitation  he would  stand it no longer  he repeated aloud with blasphemies unusual to him that  he would stand it no longer     he was a pale faced little man  with dark eyes and a fine and very black  moustache  he had a very stiff  upright collar slightly frayed  that gave  him an illusory double chin  and his overcoat  albeit shabby  was trimmed  with astrachan  his gloves were a bright brown with black stripes over the  knuckles  and split at the finger ends  his appearance  his wife had said  once in the dear  dead days beyond recall  before he married her  that  is  was military  but now she called him  it seems a dreadful thing to  tell of between husband and wife  but she called him  a little grub   it  wasn t the only thing she had called him  either     the row had arisen about that beastly jennie again  jennie was his wife s  friend  and  by no invitation of mr  coombes  she came in every blessed  sunday to dinner  and made a shindy all the afternoon  she was a big   noisy girl  with a taste for loud colours and a strident laugh  and this  sunday she had outdone all her previous intrusions by bringing in a fellow  with her  a chap as showy as herself  and mr  coombes  in a starchy  clean  collar and his sunday frock coat  had sat dumb and wrathful at his own  table  while his wife and her guests talked foolishly and undesirably  and  laughed aloud  well  he stood that  and after dinner  which   as usual    was late   what must miss jennie do but go to the piano and play banjo  tunes  for all the world as if it were a week day  flesh and blood could  not endure such goings on  they would hear next door  they would hear in  the road  it was a public announcement of their disrepute  he had to  speak     he had felt himself go pale  and a kind of rigour had affected his  respiration as he delivered himself  he had been sitting on one of the  chairs by the window  the new guest had taken possession of the arm chair   he turned his head   sun day   he said over the collar  in the voice of  one who warns   sun day   what people call a  nasty  tone  it was     jennie had kept on playing  but his wife  who was looking through some  music that was piled on the top of the piano  had stared at him   what s  wrong now   she said   can t people enjoy themselves       i don t mind rational  njoyment  at all   said little coombes   but i  ain t a going to have week day tunes playing on a sunday in this house       what s wrong with my playing now   said jennie  stopping and twirling  round on the music stool with a monstrous rustle of flounces     coombes saw it was going to be a row  and opened too vigorously  as is  common with your timid  nervous men all the world over   steady on with  that music stool   said he   it ain t made for  eavy weights       never you mind about weights   said jennie  incensed   what was you  saying behind my back about my playing       surely you don t  old with not having a bit of music on a sunday  mr   coombes   said the new guest  leaning back in the arm chair  blowing a  cloud of cigarette smoke and smiling in a kind of pitying way  and  simultaneously his wife said something to jennie about  never mind  im   you go on  jinny       i do   said mr  coombes  addressing the new guest      may i arst why   said the new guest  evidently enjoying both his  cigarette and the prospect of an argument  he was  by the by  a lank young  man  very stylishly dressed in bright drab  with a white cravat and a  pearl and silver pin  it had been better taste to come in a black coat   mr  coombes thought      because   began mr  coombes   it don t suit me  i m a business man  i   ave to study my connection  rational  njoyment        his connection   said mrs  coombes scornfully   that s what he s always  a saying  we got to do this  and we got to do that        if you don t mean to study my connection   said mr  coombes   what did  you marry me for       i wonder   said jennie  and turned back to the piano      i never saw such a man as you   said mrs  coombes      you ve altered all round since we were married  before       then jennie began at the turn  turn  turn again      look here   said mr  coombes  driven at last to revolt  standing up and  raising his voice   i tell you i won t have that   the frock coat heaved  with his indignation      no vi lence  now   said the long young man in drab  sitting up      who the juice are you   said mr  coombes fiercely     whereupon they all began talking at once  the new guest said he was  jennie s  intended   and meant to protect her  and mr  coombes said he was  welcome to do so anywhere but in his  mr  coombes   house  and mrs   coombes said he ought to be ashamed of insulting his guests  and  as i  have already mentioned  that he was getting a regular little grub  and the  end was  that mr  coombes ordered his visitors out of the house  and they  wouldn t go  and so he said he would go himself  with his face burning and  tears of excitement in his eyes  he went into the passage  and as he  struggled with his overcoat  his frock coat sleeves got concertinaed up  his arm  and gave a brush at his silk hat  jennie began again at the  piano  and strummed him insultingly out of the house  turn  turn  turn  he  slammed the shop door so that the house quivered  that  briefly  was the  immediate making of his mood  you will perhaps begin to understand his  disgust with existence     as he walked along the muddy path under the firs   it was late october   and the ditches and heaps of fir needles were gorgeous with clumps of  fungi   he recapitulated the melancholy history of his marriage  it was  brief and commonplace enough  he now perceived with sufficient clearness  that his wife had married him out of a natural curiosity and in order to  escape from her worrying  laborious  and uncertain life in the workroom   and  like the majority of her class  she was far too stupid to realise  that it was her duty to co operate with him in his business  she was  greedy of enjoyment  loquacious  and socially minded  and evidently  disappointed to find the restraints of poverty still hanging about her   his worries exasperated her  and the slightest attempt to control her  proceedings resulted in a charge of  grumbling   why couldn t he be nice    as he used to be  and coombes was such a harmless little man  too   nourished mentally on  self help   and with a meagre ambition of  self denial and competition  that was to end in a  sufficiency   then  jennie came in as a female mephistopheles  a gabbling chronicle of   fellers   and was always wanting his wife to go to theatres  and  all  that   and in addition were aunts of his wife  and cousins  male and  female  to eat up capital  insult him personally  upset business  arrangements  annoy good customers  and generally blight his life  it was  not the first occasion by many that mr  coombes had fled his home in wrath  and indignation  and something like fear  vowing furiously and even aloud  that he wouldn t stand it  and so frothing away his energy along the line  of least resistance  but never before had he been quite so sick of life as  on this particular sunday afternoon  the sunday dinner may have had its  share in his despair  and the greyness of the sky  perhaps  too  he was  beginning to realise his unendurable frustration as a business man as the  consequence of his marriage  presently bankruptcy  and after that      perhaps she might have reason to repent when it was too late  and destiny   as i have already intimated  had planted the path through the wood with  evil smelling fungi  thickly and variously planted it  not only on the  right side  but on the left     a small shopman is in such a melancholy position  if his wife turns out a  disloyal partner  his capital is all tied up in his business  and to leave  her means to join the unemployed in some strange part of the earth  the  luxuries of divorce are beyond him altogether  so that the good old  tradition of marriage for better or worse holds inexorably for him  and  things work up to tragic culminations  bricklayers kick their wives to  death  and dukes betray theirs  but it is among the small clerks and  shopkeepers nowadays that it comes most often to a cutting of throats   under the circumstances it is not so very remarkable  and you must take it  as charitably as you can  that the mind of mr  coombes ran for a while on  some such glorious close to his disappointed hopes  and that he thought of  razors  pistols  bread knives  and touching letters to the coroner  denouncing his enemies by name  and praying piously for forgiveness  after  a time his fierceness gave way to melancholia  he had been married in this  very overcoat  in his first and only frock coat that was buttoned up  beneath it  he began to recall their courting along this very walk  his  years of penurious saving to get capital  and the bright hopefulness of  his marrying days  for it all to work out like this  was there no  sympathetic ruler anywhere in the world  he reverted to death as a topic     he thought of the canal he had just crossed  and doubted whether he  shouldn t stand with his head out  even in the middle  and it was while  drowning was in his mind that the purple pileus caught his eye  he looked  at it mechanically for a moment  and stopped and stooped towards it to  pick it up  under the impression that it was some such small leather  object as a purse  then he saw that it was the purple top of a fungus  a  peculiarly poisonous looking purple  slimy  shiny  and emitting a sour  odour  he hesitated with his hand an inch or so from it  and the thought  of poison crossed his mind  with that he picked the thing  and stood up  again with it in his hand     the odour was certainly strong  acrid  but by no means disgusting  he  broke off a piece  and the fresh surface was a creamy white  that changed  like magic in the space of ten seconds to a yellowish green colour  it was  even an inviting looking change  he broke off two other pieces to see it  repeated  they were wonderful things these fungi  thought mr  coombes  and  all of them the deadliest poisons  as his father had often told him   deadly poisons     there is no time like the present for a rash resolve  why not here and  now  thought mr  coombes  he tasted a little piece  a very little piece  indeed  a mere crumb  it was so pungent that he almost spat it out again   then merely hot and full flavoured  a kind of german mustard with a touch  of horse radish and  well  mushroom  he swallowed it in the excitement of  the moment  did he like it or did he not  his mind was curiously careless   he would try another bit  it really wasn t bad  it was good  he forgot his  troubles in the interest of the immediate moment  playing with death it  was  he took another bite  and then deliberately finished a mouthful  a  curious  tingling sensation began in his finger tips and toes  his pulse  began to move faster  the blood in his ears sounded like a mill race   try  bi  more   said mr  coombes  he turned and looked about him  and found his  feet unsteady  he saw  and struggled towards  a little patch of purple a  dozen yards away   jol  goo  stuff   said mr  coombes   e  lomore ye    he  pitched forward and fell on his face  his hands outstretched towards the  cluster of pilei  but he did not eat any more of them  he forgot  forthwith     he rolled over and sat up with a look of astonishment on his face  his  carefully brushed silk hat had rolled away towards the ditch  he pressed  his hand to his brow  something had happened  but he could not rightly  determine what it was  anyhow  he was no longer dull  he felt bright   cheerful  and his throat was afire  he laughed in the sudden gaiety of his  heart  had he been dull  he did not know  but at any rate he would be dull  no longer  he got up and stood unsteadily  regarding the universe with an  agreeable smile  he began to remember  he could not remember very well   because of a steam roundabout that was beginning in his head  and he knew  he had been disagreeable at home  just because they wanted to be happy   they were quite right  life should be as gay as possible  he would go home  and make it up  and reassure them  and why not take some of this  delightful toadstool with him  for them to eat  a hatful  no less  some of  those red ones with white spots as well  and a few yellow  he had been a  dull dog  an enemy to merriment  he would make up for it  it would be gay  to turn his coat sleeves inside out  and stick some yellow gorse into his  waistcoat pockets  then home  singing   for a jolly evening     after the departure of mr  coombes  jennie discontinued playing  and  turned round on the music stool again   what a fuss about nothing   said  jennie      you see  mr  clarence  what i ve got to put up with   said mrs  coombes      he is a bit hasty   said mr  clarence judicially      he ain t got the slightest sense of our position   said mrs  coombes    that s what i complain of  he cares for nothing but his old shop  and if  i have a bit of company  or buy anything to keep myself decent  or get any  little thing i want out of the housekeeping money  there s disagreeables    economy  he says   struggle for life   and all that  he lies awake of  nights about it  worrying how he can screw me out of a shilling  he wanted  us to eat dorset butter once  if once i was to give in to him  there       of course   said jennie      if a man values a woman   said mr  clarence  lounging back in the  arm chair   he must be prepared to make sacrifices for her  for my own  part   said mr  clarence  with his eye on jennie   i shouldn t think of  marrying till i was in a position to do the thing in style  it s downright  selfishness  a man ought to go through the rough and tumble by himself   and not drag her        i don t agree altogether with that   said jennie   i don t see why a man  shouldn t have a woman s help  provided he doesn t treat her meanly  you  know  it s meanness        you wouldn t believe   said mrs  coombes   but i was a fool to  ave  im   i might  ave known  if it  adn t been for my father  we shouldn t  ave  ad  not a carriage to our wedding       lord  he didn t stick out at that   said mr  clarence  quite shocked      said he wanted the money for his stock  or some such rubbish  why  he  wouldn t have a woman in to help me once a week if it wasn t for my  standing out plucky  and the fusses he makes about money  comes to me   well  pretty near crying  with sheets of paper and figgers   if only we  can tide over this year   he says   the business is bound to go    if only  we can tide over this year   i says   then it ll be  if only we can tide  over next year  i know you   i says   and you don t catch me screwing  myself lean and ugly  why didn t you marry a slavey   i says   if you  wanted one  instead of a respectable girl   i says      so mrs  coombes  but we will not follow this unedifying conversation  further  suffice it that mr  coombes was very satisfactorily disposed of   and they had a snug little time round the fire  then mrs  coombes went to  get the tea  and jennie sat coquettishly on the arm of mr  clarence s  chair until the tea things clattered outside   what was that i heard    asked mrs  coombes playfully  as she entered  and there was badinage about  kissing  they were just sitting down to the little circular table when the  first intimation of mr  coombes  return was heard     this was a fumbling at the latch of the front door       ere s my lord   said mrs  coombes   went out like a lion and comes back  like a lamb  i ll lay      something fell over in the shop  a chair  it sounded like  then there was  a sound as of some complicated step exercise in the passage  then the door  opened and coombes appeared  but it was coombes transfigured  the  immaculate collar had been torn carelessly from his throat  his  carefully brushed silk hat  half full of a crush of fungi  was under one  arm  his coat was inside out  and his waistcoat adorned with bunches of  yellow blossomed furze  these little eccentricities of sunday costume   however  were quite overshadowed by the change in his face  it was livid  white  his eyes were unnaturally large and bright  and his pale blue lips  were drawn back in a cheerless grin   merry   he said  he had stopped  dancing to open the door   rational  njoyment  dance   he made three  fantastic steps into the room  and stood bowing      jim   shrieked mrs  coombes  and mr  clarence sat petrified  with a  dropping lower jaw      tea   said mr  coombes   jol  thing  tea  tose stools  too  brosher       he s drunk   said jennie in a weak voice  never before had she seen this  intense pallor in a drunken man  or such shining  dilated eyes     mr  coombes held out a handful of scarlet agaric to mr  clarence   jo   stuff   said he   ta  some      at that moment he was genial  then at the sight of their startled faces he  changed  with the swift transition of insanity  into overbearing fury  and  it seemed as if he had suddenly recalled the quarrel of his departure  in  such a huge voice as mrs  coombes had never heard before  he shouted   my  house  i m master  ere  eat what i give yer   he bawled this  as it  seemed  without an effort  without a violent gesture  standing there as  motionless as one who whispers  holding out a handful of fungus     clarence approved himself a coward  he could not meet the mad fury in  coombes  eyes  he rose to his feet  pushing back his chair  and turned   stooping  at that coombes rushed at him  jennie saw her opportunity  and   with the ghost of a shriek  made for the door     mrs  coombes followed her  clarence tried to dodge  over went the  tea table with a smash as coombes clutched him by the collar and tried to  thrust the fungus into his mouth  clarence was content to leave his collar  behind him  and shot out into the passage with red patches of fly agaric  still adherent to his face   shut  im in   cried mrs  coombes  and would  have closed the door  but her supports deserted her  jennie saw the shop  door open  and vanished thereby  locking it behind her  while clarence  went on hastily into the kitchen  mr  coombes came heavily against the  door  and mrs  coombes  finding the key was inside  fled upstairs and  locked herself in the spare bedroom     so the new convert to  joie de vivre  emerged upon the passage  his  decorations a little scattered  but that respectable hatful of fungi still  under his arm  he hesitated at the three ways  and decided on the kitchen   whereupon clarence  who was fumbling with the key  gave up the attempt to  imprison his host  and fled into the scullery  only to be captured before  he could open the door into the yard  mr  clarence is singularly reticent  of the details of what occurred  it seems that mr  coombes  transitory  irritation had vanished again  and he was once more a genial playfellow   and as there were knives and meat choppers about  clarence very generously  resolved to humour him and so avoid anything tragic  it is beyond dispute  that mr  coombes played with mr  clarence to his heart s content  they  could not have been more playful and familiar if they had known each other  for years  he insisted gaily on clarence trying the fungi  and  after a  friendly tussle  was smitten with remorse at the mess he was making of his  guest s face  it also appears that clarence was dragged under the sink and  his face scrubbed with the blacking brush  he being still resolved to  humour the lunatic at any cost  and that finally  in a somewhat  dishevelled  chipped  and discoloured condition  he was assisted to his  coat and shown out by the back door  the shopway being barred by jennie   mr  coombes  wandering thoughts then turned to jennie  jennie had been  unable to unfasten the shop door  but she shot the bolts against mr   coombes  latch key  and remained in possession of the shop for the rest of  the evening     it would appear that mr  coombes then returned to the kitchen  still in  pursuit of gaiety  and  albeit a strict good templar  drank  or spilt down  the front of the first and only frock coat  no less than five bottles of  the stout mrs  coombes insisted upon having for her health s sake  he made  cheerful noises by breaking off the necks of the bottles with several of  his wife s wedding present dinner plates  and during the earlier part of  this great drunk he sang divers merry ballads  he cut his finger rather  badly with one of the bottles  the only bloodshed in this story  and what  with that  and the systematic convulsion of his inexperienced physiology  by the liquorish brand of mrs  coombes  stout  it may be the evil of the  fungus poison was somehow allayed  but we prefer to draw a veil over the  concluding incidents of this sunday afternoon  they ended in the coal  cellar  in a deep and healing sleep     an interval of five years elapsed  again it was a sunday afternoon in  october  and again mr  coombes walked through the pine wood beyond the  canal  he was still the same dark eyed  black moustached little man that  he was at the outset of the story  but his double chin was now scarcely so  illusory as it had been  his overcoat was new  with a velvet lapel  and a  stylish collar with turn down corners  free of any coarse starchiness  had  replaced the original all round article  his hat was glossy  his gloves  newish  though one finger had split and been carefully mended  and a  casual observer would have noticed about him a certain rectitude of  bearing  a certain erectness of head that marks the man who thinks well of  himself  he was a master now  with three assistants  beside him walked a  larger sunburnt parody of himself  his brother tom  just back from  australia  they were recapitulating their early struggles  and mr  coombes  had just been making a financial statement      it s a very nice little business  jim   said brother tom   in these days  of competition you re jolly lucky to have worked it up so  and you re  jolly lucky  too  to have a wife who s willing to help like yours does       between ourselves   said mr  coombes   it wasn t always so  it wasn t  always like this  to begin with  the missus was a bit giddy  girls are  funny creatures       dear me       yes  you d hardly think it  but she was downright extravagant  and always  having slaps at me  i was a bit too easy and loving  and all that  and she  thought the whole blessed show was run for her  turned the  ouse into a  regular caravansery  always having her relations and girls from business  in  and their chaps  comic songs a  sunday  it was getting to  and driving  trade away  and she was making eyes at the chaps  too  i tell you  tom   the place wasn t my own       shouldn t  a  thought it       it was so  well  i reasoned with her  i said   i ain t a duke  to keep a  wife like a pet animal  i married you for  elp and company   i said   you  got to  elp and pull the business through   she wouldn t  ear of it   very  well   i says    i m a mild man till i m roused   i says   and it s  getting to that   but she wouldn t  ear of no warnings       well       it s the way with women  she didn t think i  ad it in me to be roused   women of her sort  between ourselves  tom  don t respect a man until  they re a bit afraid of him  so i just broke out to show her  in comes a  girl named jennie  that used to work with her  and her chap  we  ad a bit  of a row  and i came out  ere  it was just such another day as this  and i  thought it all out  then i went back and pitched into them       you did       i did  i was mad  i can tell you  i wasn t going to  it  er if i could   elp it  so i went back and licked into this chap  just to show  er what i  could do   e was a big chap  too  well  i chucked him  and smashed things  about  and gave  er a scaring  and she ran up and locked  erself into the  spare room       well       that s all  i says to  er the next morning   now you know   i says   what  i m like when i m roused   and i didn t have to say anything more       and you ve been happy ever after  eh       so to speak  there s nothing like putting your foot down with them  if it   adn t been for that afternoon i should  a  been tramping the roads now   and she d  a  been grumbling at me  and all her family grumbling for  bringing her to poverty  i know their little ways  but we re all right  now  and it s a very decent little business  as you say      they proceeded on their way meditatively   women are funny creatures    said brother tom      they want a firm hand   says coombes      what a lot of these funguses there are about here   remarked brother tom  presently   i can t see what use they are in the world      mr  coombes looked   i dessay they re sent for some wise purpose   said  mr  coombes     and that was as much thanks as the purple pileus ever got for maddening  this absurd little man to the pitch of decisive action  and so altering  the whole course of his life             xviii       a slip under the microscope       outside the laboratory windows was a watery grey fog  and within a close  warmth and the yellow light of the green shaded gas lamps that stood two  to each table down its narrow length  on each table stood a couple of  glass jars containing the mangled vestiges of the crayfish  mussels   frogs  and guinea pigs upon which the students had been working  and down  the side of the room  facing the windows  were shelves bearing bleached  dissections in spirits  surmounted by a row of beautifully executed  anatomical drawings in white wood frames and overhanging a row of cubical  lockers  all the doors of the laboratory were panelled with blackboard   and on these were the half erased diagrams of the previous day s work  the  laboratory was empty  save for the demonstrator  who sat near the  preparation room door  and silent  save for a low  continuous murmur and  the clicking of the rocker microtome at which he was working  but  scattered about the room were traces of numerous students  hand bags   polished boxes of instruments  in one place a large drawing covered by  newspaper  and in another a prettily bound copy of  news from  nowhere   a book oddly at variance with its surroundings  these things  had been put down hastily as the students had arrived and hurried at once  to secure their seats in the adjacent lecture theatre  deadened by the  closed door  the measured accents of the professor sounded as a  featureless muttering     presently  faint through the closed windows came the sound of the oratory  clock striking the hour of eleven  the clicking of the microtome ceased   and the demonstrator looked at his watch  rose  thrust his hands into his  pockets  and walked slowly down the laboratory towards the lecture theatre  door  he stood listening for a moment  and then his eye fell on the little  volume by william morris  he picked it up  glanced at the title  smiled   opened it  looked at the name on the fly leaf  ran the leaves through with  his hand  and put it down  almost immediately the even murmur of the  lecturer ceased  there was a sudden burst of pencils rattling on the desks  in the lecture theatre  a stirring  a scraping of feet  and a number of  voices speaking together  then a firm footfall approached the door  which  began to open  and stood ajar  as some indistinctly heard question  arrested the new comer     the demonstrator turned  walked slowly back past the microtome  and left  the laboratory by the preparation room door  as he did so  first one  and  then several students carrying notebooks entered the laboratory from the  lecture theatre  and distributed themselves among the little tables  or  stood in a group about the doorway  they were an exceptionally  heterogeneous assembly  for while oxford and cambridge still recoil from  the blushing prospect of mixed classes  the college of science anticipated  america in the matter years ago  mixed socially  too  for the prestige of  the college is high  and its scholarships  free of any age limit  dredge  deeper even than do those of the scotch universities  the class numbered  one and twenty  but some remained in the theatre questioning the  professor  copying the black board diagrams before they were washed off   or examining the special specimens he had produced to illustrate the day s  teaching  of the nine who had come into the laboratory three were girls   one of whom  a little fair woman  wearing spectacles and dressed in  greyish green  was peering out of the window at the fog  while the other  two  both wholesome looking  plain faced schoolgirls  unrolled and put on  the brown holland aprons they wore while dissecting  of the men  two went  down the laboratory to their places  one a pallid  dark bearded man  who  had once been a tailor  the other a pleasant featured  ruddy young man of  twenty  dressed in a well fitting brown suit  young wedderburn  the son of  wedderburn  the eye specialist  the others formed a little knot near the  theatre door  one of these  a dwarfed  spectacled figure  with a  hunchback  sat on a bent wood stool  two others  one a short  dark  youngster  and the other a flaxen haired  reddish complexioned young man   stood leaning side by side against the slate sink  while the fourth stood  facing them  and maintained the larger share of the conversation     this last person was named hill  he was a sturdily built young fellow  of  the same age as wedderburn  he had a white face  dark grey eyes  hair of  an indeterminate colour  and prominent  irregular features  he talked  rather louder than was needful  and thrust his hands deeply into his  pockets  his collar was frayed and blue with the starch of a careless  laundress  his clothes were evidently ready made  and there was a patch on  the side of his boot near the toe  and as he talked or listened to the  others  he glanced now and again towards the lecture theatre door  they  were discussing the depressing peroration of the lecture they had just  heard  the last lecture it was in the introductory course in zoology    from ovum to ovum is the goal of the higher vertebrata   the lecturer had  said in his melancholy tones  and so had neatly rounded off the sketch  of comparative anatomy he had been developing  the spectacled hunchback  had repeated it  with noisy appreciation  had tossed it towards the  fair haired student with an evident provocation  and had started one of  these vague  rambling discussions on generalities  so unaccountably dear  to the student mind all the world over      that is our goal  perhaps  i admit it  as far as science goes   said the  fair haired student  rising to the challenge   but there are things above  science       science   said hill confidently   is systematic knowledge  ideas that  don t come into the system  must anyhow  be loose ideas   he was not quite  sure whether that was a clever saying or a fatuity until his hearers took  it seriously      the thing i cannot understand   said the hunchback  at large   is whether  hill is a materialist or not       there is one thing above matter   said hill promptly  feeling he had a  better thing this time  aware  too  of someone in the doorway behind him   and raising his voice a trifle for her benefit   and that is  the delusion  that there is something above matter       so we have your gospel at last   said the fair student   it s all a  delusion  is it  all our aspirations to lead something more than dogs   lives  all our work for anything beyond ourselves  but see how  inconsistent you are  your socialism  for instance  why do you trouble  about the interests of the race  why do you concern yourself about the  beggar in the gutter  why are you bothering yourself to lend that book      he indicated william morris by a movement of the head   to everyone in the  lab        girl   said the hunchback indistinctly  and glanced guiltily over his  shoulder     the girl in brown  with the brown eyes  had come into the laboratory  and  stood on the other side of the table behind him  with her rolled up apron  in one hand  looking over her shoulder  listening to the discussion  she  did not notice the hunchback  because she was glancing from hill to his  interlocutor  hill s consciousness of her presence betrayed itself to her  only in his studious ignorance of the fact  but she understood that  and  it pleased her   i see no reason   said he   why a man should live like a  brute because he knows of nothing beyond matter  and does not expect to  exist a hundred years hence       why shouldn t he   said the fair haired student      why  should  he   said hill      what inducement has he       that s the way with all you religious people  it s all a business of  inducements  cannot a man seek after righteousness for righteousness   sake      there was a pause  the fair man answered  with a kind of vocal padding    but  you see  inducement  when i said inducement   to gain time  and then  the hunchback came to his rescue and inserted a question  he was a  terrible person in the debating society with his questions  and they  invariably took one form  a demand for a definition   what s your  definition of righteousness   said the hunchback at this stage     hill experienced a sudden loss of complacency at this question  but even  as it was asked  relief came in the person of brooks  the laboratory  attendant  who entered by the preparation room door  carrying a number of  freshly killed guinea pigs by their hind legs   this is the last batch of  material this session   said the youngster who had not previously spoken   brooks advanced up the laboratory  smacking down a couple of guinea pigs  at each table  the rest of the class  scenting the prey from afar  came  crowding in by the lecture theatre door  and the discussion perished  abruptly as the students who were not already in their places hurried to  them to secure the choice of a specimen  there was a noise of keys  rattling on split rings as lockers were opened and dissecting instruments  taken out  hill was already standing by his table  and his box of scalpels  was sticking out of his pocket  the girl in brown came a step towards him   and  leaning over his table  said softly   did you see that i returned  your book  mr  hill      during the whole scene she and the book had been vividly present in his  consciousness  but he made a clumsy pretence of looking at the book and  seeing it for the first time   oh  yes   he said  taking it up   i see   did you like it       i want to ask you some questions about it  some time       certainly   said hill   i shall be glad   he stopped awkwardly   you  liked it   he said      it s a wonderful book  only some things i don t understand      then suddenly the laboratory was hushed by a curious  braying noise  it  was the demonstrator  he was at the blackboard ready to begin the day s  instruction  and it was his custom to demand silence by a sound midway  between the  er  of common intercourse and the blast of a trumpet  the  girl in brown slipped back to her place  it was immediately in front of  hill s  and hill  forgetting her forthwith  took a notebook out of the  drawer of his table  turned over its leaves hastily  drew a stumpy pencil  from his pocket  and prepared to make a copious note of the coming  demonstration  for demonstrations and lectures are the sacred text of the  college students  books  saving only the professor s own  you may  it is  even expedient to  ignore     hill was the son of a landport cobbler  and had been hooked by a chance  blue paper the authorities had thrown out to the landport technical  college  he kept himself in london on his allowance of a guinea a week   and found that  with proper care  this also covered his clothing  allowance  an occasional waterproof collar  that is  and ink and needles  and cotton  and such like necessaries for a man about town  this was his  first year and his first session  but the brown old man in landport had  already got himself detested in many public houses by boasting of his son    the professor   hill was a vigorous youngster  with a serene contempt for  the clergy of all denominations  and a fine ambition to reconstruct the  world  he regarded his scholarship as a brilliant opportunity  he had  begun to read at seven  and had read steadily whatever came in his way   good or bad  since then  his worldly experience had been limited to the  island of portsea  and acquired chiefly in the wholesale boot factory in  which he had worked by day  after passing the seventh standard of the  board school  he had a considerable gift of speech  as the college  debating society  which met amidst the crushing machines and mine models  in the metallurgical theatre downstairs  already recognised  recognised by  a violent battering of desks whenever he rose  and he was just at that  fine emotional age when life opens at the end of a narrow pass like a  broad valley at one s feet  full of the promise of wonderful discoveries  and tremendous achievements  and his own limitations  save that he knew  that he knew neither latin nor french  were all unknown to him     at first his interest had been divided pretty equally between his  biological work at the college and social and theological theorising  an  employment which he took in deadly earnest  of a night  when the big  museum library was not open  he would sit on the bed of his room in  chelsea with his coat and a muffler on  and write out the lecture notes  and revise his dissection memoranda  until thorpe called him out by a  whistle  the landlady objected to open the door to attic visitors  and  then the two would go prowling about the shadowy  shiny  gas lit streets   talking  very much in the fashion of the sample just given  of the god  idea  and righteousness  and carlyle  and the reorganisation of society   and in the midst of it all  hill  arguing not only for thorpe  but for the  casual passer by  would lose the thread of his argument glancing at some  pretty painted face that looked meaningly at him as he passed  science and  righteousness  but once or twice lately there had been signs that a third  interest was creeping into his life  and he had found his attention  wandering from the fate of the mesoblastic somites or the probable meaning  of the blastopore  to the thought of the girl with the brown eyes who sat  at the table before him     she was a paying student  she descended inconceivable social altitudes to  speak to him  at the thought of the education she must have had  and the  accomplishments she must possess  the soul of hill became abject within  him  she had spoken to him first over a difficulty about the alisphenoid  of a rabbit s skull  and he had found that  in biology at least  he had no  reason for self abasement  and from that  after the manner of young people  starting from any starting point  they got to generalities  and while hill  attacked her upon the question of socialism  some instinct told him to  spare her a direct assault upon her religion  she was gathering resolution  to undertake what she told herself was his aesthetic education  she was a  year or two older than he  though the thought never occurred to him  the  loan of  news from nowhere  was the beginning of a series of cross  loans  upon some absurd first principle of his  hill had never  wasted  time  upon poetry  and it seemed an appalling deficiency to her  one day  in the lunch hour  when she chanced upon him alone in the little museum  where the skeletons were arranged  shamefully eating the bun that  constituted his midday meal  she retreated  and returned to lend him  with  a slightly furtive air  a volume of browning  he stood sideways towards  her and took the book rather clumsily  because he was holding the bun in  the other hand  and in the retrospect his voice lacked the cheerful  clearness he could have wished     that occurred after the examination in comparative anatomy  on the day  before the college turned out its students  and was carefully locked up by  the officials  for the christmas holidays  the excitement of cramming for  the first trial of strength had for a little while dominated hill  to the  exclusion of his other interests  in the forecasts of the result in which  everyone indulged he was surprised to find that no one regarded him as a  possible competitor for the harvey commemoration medal  of which this and  the two subsequent examinations disposed  it was about this time that  wedderburn  who so far had lived inconspicuously on the uttermost margin  of hill s perceptions  began to take on the appearance of an obstacle  by  a mutual agreement  the nocturnal prowlings with thorpe ceased for the  three weeks before the examination  and his landlady pointed out that she  really could not supply so much lamp oil at the price  he walked to and  fro from the college with little slips of mnemonics in his hand  lists of  crayfish appendages  rabbits  skull bones  and vertebrate nerves  for  example  and became a positive nuisance to foot passengers in the opposite  direction     but  by a natural reaction  poetry and the girl with the brown eyes ruled  the christmas holiday  the pending results of the examination became such  a secondary consideration that hill marvelled at his father s excitement   even had he wished it  there was no comparative anatomy to read in  landport  and he was too poor to buy books  but the stock of poets in the  library was extensive  and hill s attack was magnificently sustained  he  saturated himself with the fluent numbers of longfellow and tennyson  and  fortified himself with shakespeare  found a kindred soul in pope  and a  master in shelley  and heard and fled the siren voices of eliza cook and  mrs  hemans  but he read no more browning  because he hoped for the loan  of other volumes from miss haysman when he returned to london     he walked from his lodgings to the college with that volume of browning in  his shiny black bag  and his mind teeming with the finest general  propositions about poetry  indeed  he framed first this little speech and  then that with which to grace the return  the morning was an exceptionally  pleasant one for london  there was a clear  hard frost and undeniable blue  in the sky  a thin haze softened every outline  and warm shafts of  sunlight struck between the house blocks and turned the sunny side of the  street to amber and gold  in the hall of the college he pulled off his  glove and signed his name with fingers so stiff with cold that the  characteristic dash under the signature he cultivated became a quivering  line  he imagined miss haysman about him everywhere  he turned at the  staircase  and there  below  he saw a crowd struggling at the foot of the  notice board  this  possibly  was the biology list  he forgot browning and  miss haysman for the moment  and joined the scrimmage  and at last  with  his cheek flattened against the sleeve of the man on the step above him   he read the list      class i  h  j  somers wedderburn  william hill    and thereafter followed a second class that is outside our present  sympathies  it was characteristic that he did not trouble to look for  thorpe on the physics list  but backed out of the struggle at once  and in  a curious emotional state between pride over common second class humanity  and acute disappointment at wedderburn s success  went on his way  upstairs  at the top  as he was hanging up his coat in the passage  the  zoological demonstrator  a young man from oxford  who secretly regarded  him as a blatant  mugger  of the very worst type  offered his heartiest  congratulations     at the laboratory door hill stopped for a second to get his breath  and  then entered  he looked straight up the laboratory and saw all five girl  students grouped in their places  and wedderburn  the once retiring  wedderburn  leaning rather gracefully against the window  playing with the  blind tassel and talking  apparently  to the five of them  now  hill could  talk bravely enough and even overbearingly to one girl  and he could have  made a speech to a roomful of girls  but this business of standing at ease  and appreciating  fencing  and returning quick remarks round a group was   he knew  altogether beyond him  coming up the staircase his feelings for  wedderburn had been generous  a certain admiration perhaps  a willingness  to shake his hand conspicuously and heartily as one who had fought but the  first round  but before christmas wedderburn had never gone up to that end  of the room to talk  in a flash hill s mist of vague excitement condensed  abruptly to a vivid dislike of wedderburn  possibly his expression  changed  as he came up to his place  wedderburn nodded carelessly to him   and the others glanced round  miss haysman looked at him and away again   the faintest touch of her eyes   i can t agree with you  mr  wedderburn    she said      i must congratulate you on your first class  mr  hill   said the  spectacled girl in green  turning round and beaming at him      it s nothing   said hill  staring at wedderburn and miss haysman talking  together  and eager to hear what they talked about      we poor folks in the second class don t think so   said the girl in  spectacles     what was it wedderburn was saying  something about william morris  hill  did not answer the girl in spectacles  and the smile died out of his face   he could not hear  and failed to see how he could  cut in   confound  wedderburn  he sat down  opened his bag  hesitated whether to return the  volume of browning forthwith  in the sight of all  and instead drew out  his new notebooks for the short course in elementary botany that was now  beginning  and which would terminate in february  as he did so  a fat   heavy man  with a white face and pale grey eyes  bindon  the professor of  botany  who came up from kew for january and february  came in by the  lecture theatre door  and passed  rubbing his hands together and smiling   in silent affability down the laboratory                                                 in the subsequent six weeks hill experienced some very rapid and curiously  complex emotional developments  for the most part he had wedderburn in  focus  a fact that miss haysman never suspected  she told hill  for in the  comparative privacy of the museum she talked a good deal to him of  socialism and browning and general propositions  that she had met  wedderburn at the house of some people she knew  and  he s inherited his  cleverness  for his father  you know  is the great eye specialist        my  father is a cobbler   said hill  quite irrelevantly  and  perceived the want of dignity even as he said it  but the gleam of  jealousy did not offend her  she conceived herself the fundamental source  of it  he suffered bitterly from a sense of wedderburn s unfairness  and a  realisation of his own handicap  here was this wedderburn had picked up a  prominent man for a father  and instead of his losing so many marks on the  score of that advantage  it was counted to him for righteousness  and  while hill had to introduce himself and talk to miss haysman clumsily over  mangled guinea pigs in the laboratory  this wedderburn  in some backstairs  way  had access to her social altitudes  and could converse in a polished  argot that hill understood perhaps  but felt incapable of speaking  not   of course  that he wanted to  then it seemed to hill that for wedderburn  to come there day after day with cuffs unfrayed  neatly tailored   precisely barbered  quietly perfect  was in itself an ill bred  sneering  sort of proceeding  moreover  it was a stealthy thing for wedderburn to  behave insignificantly for a space  to mock modesty  to lead hill to fancy  that he himself was beyond dispute the man of the year  and then suddenly  to dart in front of him  and incontinently to swell up in this fashion  in  addition to these things  wedderburn displayed an increasing disposition  to join in any conversational grouping that included miss haysman  and  would venture  and indeed seek occasion  to pass opinions derogatory to  socialism and atheism  he goaded hill to incivilities by neat  shallow   and exceedingly effective personalities about the socialist leaders   until hill hated bernard shaw s graceful egotisms  william morris s  limited editions and luxurious wall papers  and walter crane s charmingly  absurd ideal working men  about as much as he hated wedderburn  the  dissertations in the laboratory  that had been his glory in the previous  term  became a danger  degenerated into inglorious tussels with  wedderburn  and hill kept to them only out of an obscure perception that  his honour was involved  in the debating society hill knew quite clearly  that  to a thunderous accompaniment of banged desks  he could have  pulverised wedderburn  only wedderburn never attended the debating society  to be pulverised  because  nauseous affectation   he  dined late      you must not imagine that these things presented themselves in quite such  a crude form to hill s perception  hill was a born generaliser  wedderburn  to him was not so much an individual obstacle as a type  the salient angle  of a class  the economic theories that  after infinite ferment  had shaped  themselves in hill s mind  became abruptly concrete at the contact  the  world became full of easy mannered  graceful  gracefully dressed   conversationally dexterous  finally shallow wedderburns  bishops  wedderburn  wedderburn m p  s  professors wedderburn  wedderburn  landlords  all with finger bowl shibboleths and epigrammatic cities of  refuge from a sturdy debater  and everyone ill clothed or ill dressed   from the cobbler to the cab runner  was a man and a brother  a  fellow sufferer  to hill s imagination  so that he became  as it were  a  champion of the fallen and oppressed  albeit to outward seeming only a  self assertive  ill mannered young man  and an unsuccessful champion at  that  again and again a skirmish over the afternoon tea that the girl  students had inaugurated left hill with flushed cheeks and a tattered  temper  and the debating society noticed a new quality of sarcastic  bitterness in his speeches     you will understand now how it was necessary  if only in the interests of  humanity  that hill should demolish wedderburn in the forthcoming  examination and outshine him in the eyes of miss haysman  and you will  perceive  too  how miss haysman fell into some common feminine  misconceptions  the hill wedderburn quarrel  for in his unostentatious way  wedderburn reciprocated hill s ill veiled rivalry  became a tribute to her  indefinable charm  she was the queen of beauty in a tournament of scalpels  and stumpy pencils  to her confidential friend s secret annoyance  it even  troubled her conscience  for she was a good girl  and painfully aware   from ruskin and contemporary fiction  how entirely men s activities are  determined by women s attitudes  and if hill never by any chance mentioned  the topic of love to her  she only credited him with the finer modesty for  that omission  so the time came on for the second examination  and hill s  increasing pallor confirmed the general rumour that he was working hard   in the aerated bread shop near south kensington station you would see him   breaking his bun and sipping his milk  with his eyes intent upon a paper  of closely written notes  in his bedroom there were propositions about  buds and stems round his looking glass  a diagram to catch his eye  if  soap should chance to spare it  above his washing basin  he missed several  meetings of the debating society  but he found the chance encounters with  miss haysman in the spacious ways of the adjacent art museum  or in the  little museum at the top of the college  or in the college corridors  more  frequent and very restful  in particular  they used to meet in a little  gallery full of wrought iron chests and gates  near the art library  and  there hill used to talk  under the gentle stimulus of her flattering  attention  of browning and his personal ambitions  a characteristic she  found remarkable in him was his freedom from avarice  he contemplated  quite calmly the prospect of living all his life on an income below a  hundred pounds a year  but he was determined to be famous  to make   recognisably in his own proper person  the world a better place to live  in  he took bradlaugh and john burns for his leaders and models  poor   even impecunious  great men  but miss haysman thought that such lives were  deficient on the aesthetic side  by which  though she did not know it  she  meant good wall paper and upholstery  pretty books  tasteful clothes   concerts  and meals nicely cooked and respectfully served     at last came the day of the second examination  and the professor of  botany  a fussy  conscientious man  rearranged all the tables in a long  narrow laboratory to prevent copying  and put his demonstrator on a chair  on a table  where he felt  he said  like a hindoo god   to see all the  cheating  and stuck a notice outside the door   door closed   for no  earthly reason that any human being could discover  and all the morning  from ten till one the quill of wedderburn shrieked defiance at hill s  and  the quills of the others chased their leaders in a tireless pack  and so  also it was in the afternoon  wedderburn was a little quieter than usual   and hill s face was hot all day  and his overcoat bulged with textbooks  and notebooks against the last moment s revision  and the next day  in the  morning and in the afternoon  was the practical examination  when sections  had to be cut and slides identified  in the morning hill was depressed  because he knew he had cut a thick section  and in the afternoon came the  mysterious slip     it was just the kind of thing that the botanical professor was always  doing  like the income tax  it offered a premium to the cheat  it was a  preparation under the microscope  a little glass slip  held in its place  on the stage of the instrument by light steel clips  and the inscription  set forth that the slip was not to be moved  each student was to go in  turn to it  sketch it  write in his book of answers what he considered it  to be  and return to his place  now  to move such a slip is a thing one  can do by a chance movement of the finger  and in a fraction of a second   the professor s reason for decreeing that the slip should not be moved  depended on the fact that the object he wanted identified was  characteristic of a certain tree stem  in the position in which it was  placed it was a difficult thing to recognise  but once the slip was moved  so as to bring other parts of the preparation into view  its nature was  obvious enough     hill came to this  flushed from a contest with staining re agents  sat  down on the little stool before the microscope  turned the mirror to get  the best light  and then  out of sheer habit  shifted the slips  at once  he remembered the prohibition  and  with an almost continuous motion of  his hands  moved it back  and sat paralysed with astonishment at his  action     then  slowly  he turned his head  the professor was out of the room  the  demonstrator sat aloft on his impromptu rostrum  reading the  q  jour   mi  sci    the rest of the examinees were busy  and with their backs to  him  should he own up to the accident now  he knew quite clearly what the  thing was  it was a lenticel  a characteristic preparation from the  elder tree  his eyes roved over his intent fellow students  and wedderburn  suddenly glanced over his shoulder at him with a queer expression in his  eyes  the mental excitement that had kept hill at an abnormal pitch of  vigour these two days gave way to a curious nervous tension  his book of  answers was beside him  he did not write down what the thing was  but with  one eye at the microscope he began making a hasty sketch of it  his mind  was full of this grotesque puzzle in ethics that had suddenly been sprung  upon him  should he identify it  or should he leave this question  unanswered  in that case wedderburn would probably come out first in the  second result  how could he tell now whether he might not have identified  the thing without shifting it  it was possible that wedderburn had failed  to recognise it  of course  suppose wedderburn too had shifted the slide   he looked up at the clock  there were fifteen minutes in which to make up  his mind  he gathered up his book of answers and the coloured pencils he  used in illustrating his replies and walked back to his seat     he read through his manuscript  and then sat thinking and gnawing his  knuckle  it would look queer now if he owned up  he  must  beat  wedderburn  he forgot the examples of those starry gentlemen  john burns  and bradlaugh  besides  he reflected  the glimpse of the rest of the slip  he had had was  after all  quite accidental  forced upon him by chance  a  kind of providential revelation rather than an unfair advantage  it was  not nearly so dishonest to avail himself of that as it was of broome  who  believed in the efficacy of prayer  to pray daily for a first class   five  minutes more   said the demonstrator  folding up his paper and becoming  observant  hill watched the clock hands until two minutes remained  then  he opened the book of answers  and  with hot ears and an affectation of  ease  gave his drawing of the lenticel its name     when the second pass list appeared  the previous positions of wedderburn  and hill were reversed  and the spectacled girl in green  who knew the  demonstrator in private life  where he was practically human   said that  in the result of the two examinations taken together hill had the  advantage of a mark      to     out of a possible      everyone admired  hill in a way  though the suspicion of  mugging  clung to him  but hill  was to find congratulations and miss haysman s enhanced opinion of him   and even the decided decline in the crest of wedderburn  tainted by an  unhappy memory  he felt a remarkable access of energy at first  and the  note of a democracy marching to triumph returned to his debating society  speeches  he worked at his comparative anatomy with tremendous zeal and  effect  and he went on with his aesthetic education  but through it all  a  vivid little picture was continually coming before his mind s eye  of a  sneakish person manipulating a slide     no human being had witnessed the act  and he was cocksure that no higher  power existed to see  it  but for all that it worried him  memories are  not dead things but alive  they dwindle in disuse  but they harden and  develop in all sorts of queer ways if they are being continually fretted   curiously enough  though at the time he perceived clearly that the  shifting was accidental  as the days wore on  his memory became confused  about it  until at last he was not sure  although he assured himself that  he  was  sure  whether the movement had been absolutely involuntary   then it is possible that hill s dietary was conducive to morbid  conscientiousness  a breakfast frequently eaten in a hurry  a midday bun   and  at such hours after five as chanced to be convenient  such meat as  his means determined  usually in a chop house in a back street off the  brompton road  occasionally he treated himself to threepenny or ninepenny  classics  and they usually represented a suppression of potatoes or chops   it is indisputable that outbreaks of self abasement and emotional revival  have a distinct relation to periods of scarcity  but apart from this  influence on the feelings  there was in hill a distinct aversion to  falsity that the blasphemous landport cobbler had inculcated by strap and  tongue from his earliest years  of one fact about professed atheists i am  convinced  they may be  they usually are  fools  void of subtlety   revilers of holy institutions  brutal speakers  and mischievous knaves   but they lie with difficulty  if it were not so  if they had the faintest  grasp of the idea of compromise  they would simply be liberal churchmen   and  moreover  this memory poisoned his regard for miss haysman  for she  now so evidently preferred him to wedderburn that he felt sure he cared  for her  and began reciprocating her attentions by timid marks of personal  regard  at one time he even bought a bunch of violets  carried it about in  his pocket  and produced it  with a stumbling explanation  withered and  dead  in the gallery of old iron  it poisoned  too  the denunciation of  capitalist dishonesty that had been one of his life s pleasures  and   lastly  it poisoned his triumph in wedderburn  previously he had been  wedderburn s superior in his own eyes  and had raged simply at a want of  recognition  now he began to fret at the darker suspicion of positive  inferiority  he fancied he found justifications for his position in  browning  but they vanished on analysis  at last  moved  curiously enough   by exactly the same motive forces that had resulted in his dishonesty  he  went to professor bindon  and made a clean breast of the whole affair  as  hill was a paid student  professor bindon did not ask him to sit down  and  he stood before the professor s desk as he made his confession      it s a curious story   said professor bindon  slowly realising how the  thing reflected on himself  and then letting his anger rise    a most  remarkable story  i can t understand your doing it  and i can t understand  this avowal  you re a type of student  cambridge men would never dream  i  suppose i ought to have thought  why  did  you cheat       i didn t cheat   said hill      but you have just been telling me you did       i thought i explained        either you cheated or you did not cheat       i said my motion was involuntary       i am not a metaphysician  i am a servant of science  of fact  you  were told not to move the slip  you did move the slip  if that is not  cheating        if i was a cheat   said hill  with the note of hysterics in his voice    should i come here and tell you       your repentance  of course  does you credit   said professor bindon   but  it does not alter the original facts       no  sir   said hill  giving in in utter self abasement      even now you cause an enormous amount of trouble  the examination list  will have to be revised       i suppose so  sir       suppose so  of course it must be revised  and i don t see how i can  conscientiously pass you       not pass me   said hill   fail me       it s the rule in all examinations  or where should we be  what else did  you expect  you don t want to shirk the consequences of your own acts       i thought  perhaps      said hill  and then   fail me  i thought  as i  told you  you would simply deduct the marks given for that slip       impossible   said bindon   besides  it would still leave you above  wedderburn  deduct only the marks  preposterous  the departmental  regulations distinctly say          but it s my own admission  sir       the regulations say nothing whatever of the manner in which the matter  comes to light  they simply provide          it will ruin me  if i fail this examination  they won t renew my  scholarship       you should have thought of that before       but  sir  consider all my circumstances          i cannot consider anything  professors in this college are machines  the  regulations will not even let us recommend our students for appointments   i am a machine  and you have worked me  i have to do          it s very hard  sir       possibly it is       if i am to be failed this examination  i might as well go home at once       that is as you think proper   bindon s voice softened a little  he  perceived he had been unjust  and  provided he did not contradict himself   he was disposed to amelioration   as a private person   he said   i think  this confession of yours goes far to mitigate your offence  but you have  set the machinery in motion  and now it must take its course  i  i am  really sorry you gave way      a wave of emotion prevented hill from answering  suddenly  very vividly   he saw the heavily lined face of the old landport cobbler  his father    good god  what a fool i have been   he said hotly and abruptly      i hope   said bindon   that it will be a lesson to you      but  curiously enough  they were not thinking of quite the same  indiscretion     there was a pause      i would like a day to think  sir  and then i will let you know  about  going home  i mean   said hill  moving towards the door                                                 the next day hill s place was vacant  the spectacled girl in green was  as  usual  first with the news  wedderburn and miss haysman were talking of a  performance of  the meistersingers  when she came up to them      have you heard   she said      heard what       there was cheating in the examination       cheating   said wedderburn  with his face suddenly hot   how       that slide        moved  never       it was  that slide that we weren t to move        nonsense   said wedderburn   why  how could they find out  who do they  say         it was mr  hill       hill        mr  hill       not  surely not the immaculate hill   said wedderburn  recovering      i don t believe it   said miss haysman   how do you know       i  didn t    said the girl in spectacles   but i know it now for a  fact  mr  hill went and confessed to professor bindon himself       by jove   said wedderburn   hill of all people  but i am always inclined  to distrust these philanthropists on principle        are you quite sure   said miss haysman  with a catch in her breath      quite  it s dreadful  isn t it  but  you know  what can you expect  his  father is a cobbler      then miss haysman astonished the girl in spectacles      i don t care  i will not believe it   she said  flushing darkly under her  warm tinted skin   i will not believe it until he has told me so himself    face to face  i would scarcely believe it then   and abruptly she turned  her back on the girl in spectacles  and walked to her own place      it s true  all the same   said the girl in spectacles  peering and  smiling at wedderburn     but wedderburn did not answer her  she was indeed one of those people who  seemed destined to make unanswered remarks             xix       the crystal egg       there was  until a year ago  a little and very grimy looking shop near  seven dials  over which  in weather worn yellow lettering  the name of  c   cave  naturalist and dealer in antiquities   was inscribed  the contents  of its window were curiously variegated  they comprised some elephant  tusks and an imperfect set of chessmen  beads and weapons  a box of eyes   two skulls of tigers and one human  several moth eaten stuffed monkeys   one holding a lamp   an old fashioned cabinet  a fly blown ostrich egg  or so  some fishing tackle  and an extraordinarily dirty  empty glass  fish tank  there was also  at the moment the story begins  a mass of  crystal  worked into the shape of an egg and brilliantly polished  and at  that two people who stood outside the window were looking  one of them a  tall  thin clergyman  the other a black bearded young man of dusky  complexion and unobtrusive costume  the dusky young man spoke with eager  gesticulation  and seemed anxious for his companion to purchase the  article     while they were there  mr  cave came into his shop  his beard still  wagging with the bread and butter of his tea  when he saw these men and  the object of their regard  his countenance fell  he glanced guiltily over  his shoulder  and softly shut the door  he was a little old man  with pale  face and peculiar watery blue eyes  his hair was a dirty grey  and he wore  a shabby blue frock coat  an ancient silk hat  and carpet slippers very  much down at heel  he remained watching the two men as they talked  the  clergyman went deep into his trouser pocket  examined a handful of money   and showed his teeth in an agreeable smile  mr  cave seemed still more  depressed when they came into the shop     the clergyman  without any ceremony  asked the price of the crystal egg   mr  cave glanced nervously towards the door leading into the parlour  and  said five pounds  the clergyman protested that the price was high  to his  companion as well as to mr  cave  it was  indeed  very much more than mr   cave had intended to ask when he had stocked the article  and an attempt  at bargaining ensued  mr  cave stepped to the shop door  and held it open    five pounds is my price   he said  as though he wished to save himself  the trouble of unprofitable discussion  as he did so  the upper portion of  a woman s face appeared above the blind in the glass upper panel of the  door leading into the parlour  and stared curiously at the two customers    five pounds is my price   said mr  cave  with a quiver in his voice     the swarthy young man had so far remained a spectator  watching cave  keenly  now he spoke   give him five pounds   he said  the clergyman  glanced at him to see if he were in earnest  and when he looked at mr   cave again  he saw that the latter s face was white   it s a lot of  money   said the clergyman  and  diving into his pocket  began counting  his resources  he had little more than thirty shillings  and he appealed  to his companion  with whom he seemed to be on terms of considerable  intimacy  this gave mr  cave an opportunity of collecting his thoughts   and he began to explain in an agitated manner that the crystal was not  as  a matter of fact  entirely free for sale  his two customers were naturally  surprised at this  and inquired why he had not thought of that before he  began to bargain  mr  cave became confused  but he stuck to his story   that the crystal was not in the market that afternoon  that a probable  purchaser of it had already appeared  the two  treating this as an attempt  to raise the price still further  made as if they would leave the shop   but at this point the parlour door opened  and the owner of the dark  fringe and the little eyes appeared     she was a coarse featured  corpulent woman  younger and very much larger  than mr  cave  she walked heavily  and her face was flushed   that crystal   is  for sale   she said   and five pounds is a good enough price for  it  i can t think what you re about  cave  not to take the gentleman s  offer      mr  cave  greatly perturbed by the irruption  looked angrily at her over  the rims of his spectacles  and  without excessive assurance  asserted his  right to manage his business in his own way  an altercation began  the two  customers watched the scene with interest and some amusement  occasionally  assisting mrs  cave with suggestions  mr  cave  hard driven  persisted in  a confused and impossible story of an inquiry for the crystal that  morning  and his agitation became painful  but he stuck to his point with  extraordinary persistence  it was the young oriental who ended this  curious controversy  he proposed that they should call again in the course  of two days  so as to give the alleged inquirer a fair chance   and then  we must insist   said the clergyman   five pounds   mrs  cave took it on  herself to apologise for her husband  explaining that he was sometimes  a  little odd   and as the two customers left  the couple prepared for a free  discussion of the incident in all its bearings     mrs  cave talked to her husband with singular directness  the poor little  man  quivering with emotion  muddled himself between his stories   maintaining on the one hand that he had another customer in view  and on  the other asserting that the crystal was honestly worth ten guineas   why  did you ask five pounds   said his wife    do  let me manage my  business my own way   said mr  cave     mr  cave had living with him a step daughter and a step son  and at supper  that night the transaction was re discussed  none of them had a high  opinion of mr  cave s business methods  and this action seemed a  culminating folly      it s my opinion he s refused that crystal before   said the step son  a  loose limbed lout of eighteen      but  five pounds    said the step daughter  an argumentative young  woman of six and twenty     mr  cave s answers were wretched  he could only mumble weak assertions  that he knew his own business best  they drove him from his half eaten  supper into the shop  to close it for the night  his ears aflame and tears  of vexation behind his spectacles  why had he left the crystal in the  window so long  the folly of it  that was the trouble closest in his mind   for a time he could see no way of evading sale     after supper his step daughter and step son smartened themselves up and  went out and his wife retired upstairs to reflect upon the business  aspects of the crystal  over a little sugar and lemon and so forth in hot  water  mr  cave went into the shop  and stayed there until late   ostensibly to make ornamental rockeries for gold fish cases  but really  for a private purpose that will be better explained later  the next day  mrs  cave found that the crystal had been removed from the window  and  was lying behind some second hand books on angling  she replaced it in a  conspicuous position  but she did not argue further about it  as a nervous  headache disinclined her from debate  mr  cave was always disinclined  the  day passed disagreeably  mr  cave was  if anything  more absent minded  than usual  and uncommonly irritable withal  in the afternoon  when his  wife was taking her customary sleep  he removed the crystal from the  window again     the next day mr  cave had to deliver a consignment of dog fish at one of  the hospital schools  where they were needed for dissection  in his  absence mrs  cave s mind reverted to the topic of the crystal  and the  methods of expenditure suitable to a windfall of five pounds  she had  already devised some very agreeable expedients  among others a dress of  green silk for herself and a trip to richmond  when a jangling of the  front door bell summoned her into the shop  the customer was an  examination coach who came to complain of the non delivery of certain  frogs asked for the previous day  mrs  cave did not approve of this  particular branch of mr  cave s business  and the gentleman  who had  called in a somewhat aggressive mood  retired after a brief exchange of  words  entirely civil  so far as he was concerned  mrs  cave s eye then  naturally turned to the window  for the sight of the crystal was an  assurance of the five pounds and of her dreams  what was her surprise to  find it gone     she went to the place behind the locker on the counter  where she had  discovered it the day before  it was not there  and she immediately began  an eager search about the shop     when mr  cave returned from his business with the dogfish  about a quarter  to two in the afternoon  he found the shop in some confusion  and his  wife  extremely exasperated and on her knees behind the counter  routing  among his taxidermic material  her face came up hot and angry over the  counter  as the jangling bell announced his return  and she forthwith  accused him of  hiding it       hid  what    asked mr  cave      the crystal      at that mr  cave  apparently much surprised  rushed to the window   isn t  it here   he said   great heavens  what has become of it      just then mr  cave s step son re entered the shop from  the inner room  he  had come home a minute or so before mr  cave  and he was blaspheming  freely  he was apprenticed to a second hand furniture dealer down the  road  but he had his meals at home  and he was naturally annoyed to find  no dinner ready     but when he heard of the loss of the crystal  he forgot his meal  and his  anger was diverted from his mother to his step father  their first idea   of course  was that he had hidden it  but mr  cave stoutly denied all  knowledge of its fate  freely offering his bedabbled affidavit in the  matter  and at last was worked up to the point of accusing  first  his  wife and then his stepson of having taken it with a view to a private  sale  so began an exceedingly acrimonious and emotional discussion  which  ended for mrs  cave in a peculiar nervous condition midway between  hysterics and amuck  and caused the step son to be half an hour late at  the furniture establishment in the afternoon  mr  cave took refuge from  his wife s emotions in the shop     in the evening the matter was resumed  with less passion and in a judicial  spirit  under the presidency of the step daughter  the supper passed  unhappily and culminated in a painful scene  mr  cave gave way at last to  extreme exasperation  and went out banging the front door violently  the  rest of the family  having discussed him with the freedom his absence  warranted  hunted the house from garret to cellar  hoping to light upon  the crystal     the next day the two customers called again  they were received by mrs   cave almost in tears  it transpired that no one  could  imagine all  that she had stood from cave at various times in her married pilgrimage       she also gave a garbled account of the disappearance  the clergyman  and the oriental laughed silently at one another  and said it was very  extraordinary  as mrs  cave seemed disposed to give them the complete  history of her life they made to leave the shop  thereupon mrs  cave   still clinging to hope  asked for the clergyman s address  so that  if she  could get anything out of cave  she might communicate it  the address was  duly given  but apparently was afterwards mislaid  mrs  cave can remember  nothing about it     in the evening of that day the caves seem to have exhausted their  emotions  and mr  cave  who had been out in the afternoon  supped in a  gloomy isolation that contrasted pleasantly with the impassioned  controversy of the previous days  for some time matters were very badly  strained in the cave household  but neither crystal nor customer  reappeared     now  without mincing the matter  we must admit that mr  cave was a liar   he knew perfectly well where the crystal was  it was in the rooms of mr   jacoby wace  assistant demonstrator at st  catherine s hospital   westbourne street  it stood on the sideboard partially covered by a black  velvet cloth  and beside a decanter of american whisky  it is from mr   wace  indeed  that the particulars upon which this narrative is based were  derived  cave had taken off the thing to the hospital hidden in the  dog fish sack  and there had pressed the young investigator to keep it for  him  mr  wace was a little dubious at first  his relationship to cave was  peculiar  he had a taste for singular characters  and he had more than  once invited the old man to smoke and drink in his rooms  and to unfold  his rather amusing views of life in general and of his wife in particular   mr  wace had encountered mrs  cave  too  on occasions when mr  cave was  not at home to attend to him  he knew the constant interference to which  cave was subjected  and having weighed the story judicially  he decided to  give the crystal a refuge  mr  cave promised to explain the reasons for  his remarkable affection for the crystal more fully on a later occasion   but he spoke distinctly of seeing visions therein  he called on mr  wace  the same evening     he told a complicated story  the crystal he said had come into his  possession with other oddments at the forced sale of another curiosity  dealer s effects  and not knowing what its value might be  he had ticketed  it at ten shillings  it had hung upon his hands at that price for some  months  and he was thinking of  reducing the figure   when he made a  singular discovery     at that time his health was very bad  and it must be borne in mind that   throughout all this experience  his physical condition was one of ebb  and  he was in considerable distress by reason of the negligence  the positive  ill treatment even  he received from his wife and step children  his wife  was vain  extravagant  unfeeling  and had a growing taste for private  drinking  his step daughter was mean and over reaching  and his step son  had conceived a violent dislike for him  and lost no chance of showing it   the requirements of his business pressed heavily upon him  and mr  wace  does not think that he was altogether free from occasional intemperance   he had begun life in a comfortable position  he was a man of fair  education  and he suffered  for weeks at a stretch  from melancholia and  insomnia  afraid to disturb his family  he would slip quietly from his  wife s side  when his thoughts became intolerable  and wander about the  house  and about three o clock one morning  late in august  chance  directed him into the shop     the dirty little place was impenetrably black except in one spot  where he  perceived an unusual glow of light  approaching this  he discovered it to  be the crystal egg  which was standing on the corner of the counter  towards the window  a thin ray smote through a crack in the shutters   impinged upon the object  and seemed as it were to fill its entire  interior     it occurred to mr  cave that this was not in accordance with the laws of  optics as he had known them in his younger days  he could understand the  rays being refracted by the crystal and coming to a focus in its interior   but this diffusion jarred with his physical conceptions  he approached the  crystal nearly  peering into it and round it  with a transient revival of  the scientific curiosity that in his youth had determined his choice of a  calling  he was surprised to find the light not steady  but writhing  within the substance of the egg  as though that object was a hollow sphere  of some luminous vapour  in moving about to get different points of view   he suddenly found that he had come between it and the ray  and that the  crystal none the less remained luminous  greatly astonished  he lifted it  out of the light ray and carried it to the darkest part of the shop  it  remained bright for some four or five minutes  when it slowly faded and  went out  he placed it in the thin streak of daylight  and its  luminousness was almost immediately restored     so far  at least  mr  wace was able to verify the remarkable story of mr   cave  he has himself repeatedly held this crystal in a ray of light  which  had to be of a less diameter than one millimetre   and in a perfect  darkness  such as could be produced by velvet wrapping  the crystal did  undoubtedly appear very faintly phosphorescent  it would seem  however   that the luminousness was of some exceptional sort  and not equally  visible to all eyes  for mr  harbinger  whose name will be familiar to the  scientific reader in connection with the pasteur institute  was quite  unable to see any light whatever  and mr  wace s own capacity for its  appreciation was out of comparison inferior to that of mr  cave s  even  with mr  cave the power varied very considerably  his vision was most  vivid during states of extreme weakness and fatigue     now  from the outset  this light in the crystal exercised a curious  fascination upon mr  cave  and it says more for his loneliness of soul  than a volume of pathetic writing could do  that he told no human being of  his curious observations  he seems to have been living in such an  atmosphere of petty spite that to admit the existence of a pleasure would  have been to risk the loss of it  he found that as the dawn advanced  and  the amount of diffused light increased  the crystal became to all  appearance non luminous  and for some time he was unable to see anything  in it  except at night time  in dark corners of the shop     but the use of an old velvet cloth  which he used as a background for a  collection of minerals  occurred to him  and by doubling this  and putting  it over his head and hands  he was able to get a sight of the luminous  movement within the crystal even in the day time  he was very cautious  lest he should be thus discovered by his wife  and he practised this  occupation only in the afternoons  while she was asleep upstairs  and then  circumspectly in a hollow under the counter  and one day  turning the  crystal about in his hands  he saw something  it came and went like a  flash  but it gave him the impression that the object had for a moment  opened to him the view of a wide and spacious and strange country  and  turning it about  he did  just as the light faded  see the same vision  again     now it would be tedious and unnecessary to state all the phases of mr   cave s discovery from this point  suffice that the effect was this  the  crystal  being peered into at an angle of about     degrees from the  direction of the illuminating ray  gave a clear and consistent picture of  a wide and peculiar country side  it was not dream like at all  it  produced a definite impression of reality  and the better the light the  more real and solid it seemed  it was a moving picture  that is to say   certain objects moved in it  but slowly in an orderly manner like real  things  and  according as the direction of the lighting and vision  changed  the picture changed also  it must  indeed  have been like looking  through an oval glass at a view  and turning the glass about to get at  different aspects     mr  cave s statements  mr  wace assures me  were extremely circumstantial   and entirely free from any of that emotional quality that taints  hallucinatory impressions  but it must be remembered that all the efforts  of mr  wace to see any similar clarity in the faint opalescence of the  crystal were wholly unsuccessful  try as he would  the difference in  intensity of the impressions received by the two men was very great  and  it is quite conceivable that what was a view to mr  cave was a mere  blurred nebulosity to mr  wace     the view  as mr  cave described it  was invariably of an extensive plain   and he seemed always to be looking at it from a considerable height  as if  from a tower or a mast  to the east and to the west the plain was bounded  at a remote distance by vast reddish cliffs  which reminded him of those  he had seen in some picture  but what the picture was mr  wace was unable  to ascertain  these cliffs passed north and south  he could tell the  points of the compass by the stars that were visible of a night  receding  in an almost illimitable perspective and fading into the mists of the  distance before they met  he was nearer the eastern set of cliffs  on the  occasion of his first vision the sun was rising over them  and black  against the sunlight and pale against their shadow appeared a multitude of  soaring forms that mr  cave regarded as birds  a vast range of buildings  spread below him  he seemed to be looking down upon them  and as they  approached the blurred and refracted edge of the picture they became  indistinct  there were also trees curious in shape  and in colouring a  deep mossy green and an exquisite grey  beside a wide and shining canal   and something great and brilliantly coloured flew across the picture  but  the first time mr  cave saw these pictures he saw only in flashes  his  hands shook  his head moved  the vision came and went  and grew foggy and  indistinct  and at first he had the greatest difficulty in finding the  picture again once the direction of it was lost     his next clear vision  which came about a week after the first  the  interval having yielded nothing but tantalising glimpses and some useful  experience  showed him the view down the length of the valley  the view  was different  but he had a curious persuasion  which his subsequent  observations abundantly confirmed  that he was regarding the strange world  from exactly the same spot  although he was looking in a different  direction  the long facade of the great building  whose roof he had looked  down upon before  was now receding in perspective  he recognised the roof   in the front of the facade was a terrace of massive proportions and  extraordinary length  and down the middle of the terrace  at certain  intervals  stood huge but very graceful masts  bearing small shiny objects  which reflected the setting sun  the import of these small objects did not  occur to mr  cave until some time after  as he was describing the scene to  mr  wace  the terrace overhung a thicket of the most luxuriant and  graceful vegetation  and beyond this was a wide grassy lawn on which  certain broad creatures  in form like beetles but enormously larger   reposed  beyond this again was a richly decorated causeway of pinkish  stone  and beyond that  and lined with dense red weeds  and passing up the  valley exactly parallel with the distant cliffs  was a broad and  mirror like expanse of water  the air seemed full of squadrons of great  birds  manoeuvring in stately curves  and across the river was a multitude  of splendid buildings  richly coloured and glittering with metallic tracery  and facets  among a forest of moss like and lichenous trees  and suddenly  something flapped repeatedly across the vision  like the fluttering of a  jewelled fan or the beating of a wing  and a face  or rather the upper  part of a face with very large eyes  came as it were close to his own and  as if on the other side of the crystal  mr  cave was so startled and so  impressed by the absolute reality of these eyes that he drew his head back  from the crystal to look behind it  he had become so absorbed in watching  that he was quite surprised to find himself in the cool darkness of his  little shop  with its familiar odour of methyl  mustiness  and decay  and  as he blinked about him  the glowing crystal faded and went out     such were the first general impressions of mr  cave  the story is  curiously direct and circumstantial  from the outset  when the valley  first flashed momentarily on his senses  his imagination was strangely  affected  and as he began to appreciate the details of the scene he saw   his wonder rose to the point of a passion  he went about his business  listless and distraught  thinking only of the time when he should be able  to return to his watching  and then a few weeks after his first sight of  the valley came the two customers  the stress and excitement of their  offer  and the narrow escape of the crystal from sale  as i have already  told     now  while the thing was mr  cave s secret  it remained a mere wonder  a  thing to creep to covertly and peep at  as a child might peep upon a  forbidden garden  but mr  wace has  for a young scientific investigator  a  particularly lucid and consecutive habit of mind  directly the crystal and  its story came to him  and he had satisfied himself  by seeing the  phosphorescence with his own eyes  that there really was a certain  evidence for mr  cave s statements  he proceeded to develop the matter  systematically  mr  cave was only too eager to come and feast his eyes on  this wonderland he saw  and he came every night from half past eight until  half past ten  and sometimes  in mr  wace s absence  during the day  on  sunday afternoons  also  he came  from the outset mr  wace made copious  notes  and it was due to his scientific method that the relation between  the direction from which the initiating ray entered the crystal and the  orientation of the picture were proved  and  by covering the crystal in a  box perforated only with a small aperture to admit the exciting ray  and  by substituting black holland for his buff blinds  he greatly improved the  conditions of the observations  so that in a little while they were able  to survey the valley in any direction they desired     so having cleared the way  we may give a brief account of this visionary  world within the crystal  the things were in all cases seen by mr  cave   and the method of working was invariably for him to watch the crystal and  report what he saw  while mr  wace  who as a science student had learnt  the trick of writing in the dark  wrote a brief note of his report  when  the crystal faded  it was put into its box in the proper position and the  electric light turned on  mr  wace asked questions  and suggested  observations to clear up difficult points  nothing  indeed  could have  been less visionary and more matter of fact     the attention of mr  cave had been speedily directed to the bird like  creatures he had seen so abundantly present in each of his earlier  visions  his first impression was soon corrected  and he considered for a  time that they might represent a diurnal species of bat  then he thought   grotesquely enough  that they might be cherubs  their heads were round and  curiously human  and it was the eyes of one of them that had so startled  him on his second observation  they had broad  silvery wings  not  feathered  but glistening almost as brilliantly as new killed fish and  with the same subtle play of colour  and these wings were not built on the  plan of bird wing or bat  mr  wace learned  but supported by curved ribs  radiating from the body   a sort of butterfly wing with curved ribs seems  best to express their appearance   the body was small  but fitted with two  bunches of prehensile organs  like long tentacles  immediately under the  mouth  incredible as it appeared to mr  wace  the persuasion at last  became irresistible that it was these creatures which owned the great  quasi human buildings and the magnificent garden that made the broad  valley so splendid  and mr  cave perceived that the buildings  with other  peculiarities  had no doors  but that the great circular windows  which  opened freely  gave the creatures egress and entrance  they would alight  upon their tentacles  fold their wings to a smallness almost rod like  and  hop into the interior  but among them was a multitude of smaller winged  creatures  like great dragon flies and moths and flying beetles  and  across the greensward brilliantly coloured gigantic ground beetles crawled  lazily to and fro  moreover  on the causeways and terraces  large headed  creatures similar to the greater winged flies  but wingless  were visible   hopping busily upon their hand like tangle of tentacles     allusion has already been made to the glittering objects upon masts that  stood upon the terrace of the nearer building  it dawned upon mr  cave   after regarding one of these masts very fixedly on one particularly vivid  day that the glittering object there was a crystal exactly like that into  which he peered  and a still more careful scrutiny convinced him that each  one in a vista of nearly twenty carried a similar object     occasionally one of the large flying creatures would flutter up to one   and folding its wings and coiling a number of its tentacles about the  mast  would regard the crystal fixedly for a space   sometimes for as long  as fifteen minutes  and a series of observations  made at the suggestion  of mr  wace  convinced both watchers that  so far as this visionary world  was concerned  the crystal into which they peered actually stood at the  summit of the end most mast on the terrace  and that on one occasion at  least one of these inhabitants of this other world had looked into mr   cave s face while he was making these observations     so much for the essential facts of this very singular story  unless we  dismiss it all as the ingenious fabrication of mr  wace  we have to  believe one of two things  either that mr  cave s crystal was in two  worlds at once  and that while it was carried about in one  it remained  stationary in the other  which seems altogether absurd  or else that it  had some peculiar relation of sympathy with another and exactly similar  crystal in this other world  so that what was seen in the interior of the  one in this world was  under suitable conditions  visible to an observer  in the corresponding crystal in the other world  and  vice versa   at  present  indeed  we do not know of any way in which two crystals could so  come  en rapport   but nowadays we know enough to understand that the  thing is not altogether impossible  this view of the crystals as  en  rapport  was the supposition that occurred to mr  wace  and to me at  least it seems extremely plausible       and where was this other world  on this  also  the alert intelligence of  mr  wace speedily threw light  after sunset  the sky darkened rapidly    there was a very brief twilight interval indeed  and the stars shone out   they were recognisably the same as those we see  arranged in the same  constellations  mr  cave recognised the bear  the pleiades  aldebaran  and  sirius  so that the other world must be somewhere in the solar system   and  at the utmost  only a few hundreds of millions of miles from our own   following up this clue  mr  wace learned that the midnight sky was a  darker blue even than our midwinter sky  and that the sun seemed a little  smaller   and there were two small moons    like our moon but  smaller  and quite differently marked   one of which moved so rapidly that  its motion was clearly visible as one regarded it  these moons were never  high in the sky  but vanished as they rose  that is  every time they  revolved they were eclipsed because they were so near their primary  planet  and all this answers quite completely  although mr  cave did not  know it  to what must be the condition of things on mars     indeed  it seems an exceedingly plausible conclusion that peering into  this crystal mr  cave did actually see the planet mars and its  inhabitants  and if that be the case  then the evening star that shone so  brilliantly in the sky of that distant vision was neither more nor less  than our own familiar earth     for a time the martians  if they were martians  do not seem to have known  of mr  cave s inspection  once or twice one would come to peer  and go  away very shortly to some other mast  as though the vision was  unsatisfactory  during this time mr  cave was able to watch the  proceedings of these winged people without being disturbed by their  attentions  and although his report is necessarily vague and fragmentary   it is nevertheless very suggestive  imagine the impression of humanity a  martian observer would get who  after a difficult process of preparation  and with considerable fatigue to the eyes  was able to peer at london from  the steeple of st  martin s church for stretches  at longest  of four  minutes at a time  mr  cave was unable to ascertain if the winged martians  were the same as the martians who hopped about the causeways and terraces   and if the latter could put on wings at will  he several times saw certain  clumsy bipeds  dimly suggestive of apes  white and partially translucent   feeding among certain of the lichenous trees  and once some of these fled  before one of the hopping  round headed martians  the latter caught one in  its tentacles  and then the picture faded suddenly and left mr  cave most  tantalisingly in the dark  on another occasion a vast thing  that mr  cave  thought at first was some gigantic insect  appeared advancing along the  causeway beside the canal with extraordinary rapidity  as this drew nearer  mr  cave perceived that it was a mechanism of shining metals and of  extraordinary complexity  and then  when he looked again  it had passed  out of sight     after a time mr  wace aspired to attract the attention of the martians   and the next time that the strange eyes of one of them appeared close to  the crystal mr  cave cried out and sprang away  and they immediately  turned on the light and began to gesticulate in a manner suggestive of  signalling  but when at last mr  cave examined the crystal again the  martian had departed     thus far these observations had progressed in early november  and then mr   cave  feeling that the suspicions of his family about the crystal were  allayed  began to take it to and fro with him in order that  as occasion  arose in the daytime or night  he might comfort himself with what was fast  becoming the most real thing in his existence     in december mr  wace s work in connection with a forthcoming examination  became heavy  the sittings were reluctantly suspended for a week  and for  ten or eleven days  he is not quite sure which  he saw nothing of cave  he  then grew anxious to resume these investigations  and  the stress of his  seasonal labours being abated  he went down to seven dials  at the corner  he noticed a shutter before a bird fancier s window  and then another at a  cobbler s  mr  cave s shop was closed     he rapped and the door was opened by the step son in black  he at once  called mrs  cave  who was  mr  wace could not but observe  in cheap but  ample widow s weeds of the most imposing pattern  without any very great  surprise mr  wace learnt that cave was dead and already buried  she was in  tears  and her voice was a little thick  she had just returned from  highgate  her mind seemed occupied with her own prospects and the  honourable details of the obsequies  but mr  wace was at last able to  learn the particulars of cave s death  he had been found dead in his shop  in the early morning  the day after his last visit to mr  wace  and the  crystal had been clasped in his stone cold hands  his face was smiling   said mrs  cave  and the velvet cloth from the minerals lay on the floor at  his feet  he must have been dead five or six hours when he was found     this came as a great shock to wace  and he began to reproach himself  bitterly for having neglected the plain symptoms of the old man s  ill health  but his chief thought was of the crystal  he approached that  topic in a gingerly manner  because he knew mrs  cave s peculiarities  he  was dumfounded to learn that it was sold     mrs  cave s first impulse  directly cave s body had been taken upstairs   had been to write to the mad clergyman who had offered five pounds for the  crystal  informing him of its recovery  but after a violent hunt  in which  her daughter joined her  they were convinced of the loss of his address   as they were without the means required to mourn and bury cave in the  elaborate style the dignity of an old seven dials inhabitant demands  they  had appealed to a friendly fellow tradesman in great portland street  he  had very kindly taken over a portion of the stock at a valuation  the  valuation was his own  and the crystal egg was included in one of the  lots  mr  wace  after a few suitable condolences  a little off handedly  proffered perhaps  hurried at once to great portland street  but there he  learned that the crystal egg had already been sold to a tall  dark man in  grey  and there the material facts in this curious  and to me at least  very suggestive  story come abruptly to an end  the great portland street  dealer did not know who the tall dark man in grey was  nor had he observed  him with sufficient attention to describe him minutely  he did not even  know which way this person had gone after leaving the shop  for a time mr   wace remained in the shop  trying the dealer s patience with hopeless  questions  venting his own exasperation  and at last  realising abruptly  that the whole thing had passed out of his hands  had vanished like a  vision of the night  he returned to his own rooms  a little astonished to  find the notes he had made still tangible and visible upon  his untidy  table     his annoyance and disappointment were naturally very great  he made a  second call  equally ineffectual  upon the great portland street dealer   and he resorted to advertisements in such periodicals as were lively to  come into the hands of a  bric a brac  collector  he also wrote  letters to  the daily chronicle  and  nature   but both those  periodicals  suspecting a hoax  asked him to reconsider his action before  they printed  and he was advised that such a strange story  unfortunately  so bare of supporting evidence  might imperil his reputation as an  investigator  moreover  the calls of his proper work were urgent  so that  after a month or so  save for an occasional reminder to certain dealers   he had reluctantly to abandon the quest for the crystal egg  and from that  day to this it remains undiscovered  occasionally  however  he tells me   and i can quite believe him  he has bursts of zeal  in which he abandons  his more urgent occupation and resumes the search     whether or not it will remain lost for ever  with the material and origin  of it  are things equally speculative at the present time  if the present  purchaser is a collector  one would have expected the enquiries of mr   wace to have reached him through the dealers  he has been able to discover  mr  cave s clergyman and  oriental   no other than the rev  james parker  and the young prince of bosso kuni in java  i am obliged to them for  certain particulars  the object of the prince was simply curiosity  and  extravagance  he was so eager to buy because cave was so oddly reluctant  to sell  it is just as possible that the buyer in the second instance was  simply a casual purchaser and not a collector at all  and the crystal egg   for all i know  may at the present moment be within a mile of me   decorating a drawing room or serving as a paper weight  its remarkable  functions all unknown  indeed  it is partly with the idea of such a  possibility that i have thrown this narrative into a form that will give  it a chance of being read by the ordinary consumer of fiction     my own ideas in the matter are practically identical with those of mr   wace  i believe the crystal on the mast in mars and the crystal egg of mr   cave s to be in some physical  but at present quite inexplicable  way   en rapport   and we both believe further that the terrestrial  crystal must have been  possibly at some remote date  sent hither from  that planet  in order to give the martians a near view of our affairs   possibly the fellows to the crystals on the other masts are also on our  globe  no theory of hallucination suffices for the facts             xx       the star       it was on the first day of the new year that the announcement was made   almost simultaneously from three observatories  that the motion of the  planet neptune  the outermost of all the planets that wheel about the sun   had become very erratic  ogilvy had already called attention to a  suspected retardation in its velocity in december  such a piece of news  was scarcely calculated to interest a world the greater portion of whose  inhabitants were unaware of the existence of the planet neptune  nor  outside the astronomical profession did the subsequent discovery of a  faint remote speck of light in the region of the perturbed planet cause  any very great excitement  scientific people  however  found the  intelligence remarkable enough  even before it became known that the new  body was rapidly growing larger and brighter  that its motion was quite  different from the orderly progress of the planets  and that the  deflection of neptune and its satellite was becoming now of an  unprecedented kind     few people without a training in science can realise the huge isolation of  the solar system  the sun with its specks of planets  its dust of  planetoids  and its impalpable comets  swims in a vacant immensity that  almost defeats the imagination  beyond the orbit of neptune there is  space  vacant so far as human observation has penetrated  without warmth  or light or sound  blank emptiness  for twenty million times a million  miles  that is the smallest estimate of the distance to be traversed  before the very nearest of the stars is attained  and  saving a few comets  more unsubstantial than the thinnest flame  no matter had ever to human  knowledge crossed this gulf of space until early in the twentieth century  this strange wanderer appeared  a vast mass of matter it was  bulky   heavy  rushing without warning out of the black mystery of the sky into  the radiance of the sun  by the second day it was clearly visible to any  decent instrument  as a speck with a barely sensible diameter  in the  constellation leo near regulus  in a little while an opera glass could  attain it     on the third day of the new year the newspaper readers of two hemispheres  were made aware for the first time of the real importance of this unusual  apparition in the heavens   a planetary collision   one london paper  headed the news  and proclaimed duchaine s opinion that this strange new  planet would probably collide with neptune  the leader writers enlarged  upon the topic  so that in most of the capitals of the world  on january   rd  there was an expectation  however vague  of some imminent phenomenon  in the sky  and as the night followed the sunset round the globe   thousands of men turned their eyes skyward to see  the old familiar stars  just as they had always been     until it was dawn in london and pollux setting and the stars overhead  grown pale  the winter s dawn it was  a sickly filtering accumulation of  daylight  and the light of gas and candles shone yellow in the windows to  show where people were astir  but the yawning policeman saw the thing  the  busy crowds in the markets stopped agape  workmen going to their work  betimes  milkmen  the drivers of news carts  dissipation going home jaded  and pale  homeless wanderers  sentinels on their beats  and  in the  country  labourers trudging afield  poachers slinking home  all over the  dusky quickening country it could be seen  and out at sea by seamen  watching for the day  a great white star  come suddenly into the westward  sky     brighter it was than any star in our skies  brighter than the evening star  at its brightest  it still glowed out white and large  no mere twinkling  spot of light  but a small  round  clear shining disc  an hour after the  day had come  and where science has not reached  men stared and feared   telling one another of the wars and pestilences that are foreshadowed by  these fiery signs in the heavens  sturdy boers  dusky hottentots  gold  coast negroes  frenchmen  spaniards  portuguese  stood in the warmth of  the sunrise watching the setting of this strange new star     and in a hundred observatories there had been suppressed excitement   rising almost to shouting pitch  as the two remote bodies had rushed  together  and a hurrying to and fro  to gather photographic apparatus and  spectroscope  and this appliance and that  to record this novel   astonishing sight  the destruction of a world  for it was a world  a  sister planet of our earth  far greater than our earth indeed  that had so  suddenly flashed into flaming death  neptune it was had been struck   fairly and squarely  by the strange planet from outer space  and the heat  of the concussion had incontinently turned two solid globes into one vast  mass of incandescence  round the world that day  two hours before the  dawn  went the pallid great white star  fading only as it sank westward  and the sun mounted above it  everywhere men marvelled at it  but of all  those who saw it none could have marvelled more than those sailors   habitual watchers of the stars  who far away at sea had heard nothing of  its advent and saw it now rise like a pigmy moon and climb zenithward and  hang overhead and sink westward with the passing of the night     and when next it rose over europe everywhere were crowds of watchers on  hilly slopes  on house roofs  in open spaces  staring eastward for the  rising of the great new star  it rose with a white glow in front of it   like the glare of a white fire  and those who had seen it come into  existence the night before cried out at the sight of it   it is larger    they cried   it is brighter   and indeed the moon  a quarter full and  sinking in the west  was in its apparent size beyond comparison  but  scarcely in all its breadth had it as much brightness now as the little  circle of the strange new star      it is brighter   cried the people clustering in the streets  but in the  dim observatories the watchers held their breath and peered at one  another    it is nearer    they said    nearer       and voice after voice repeated   it is nearer   and the clicking telegraph  took that up  and it trembled along telephone wires  and in a thousand  cities grimy compositors fingered the type   it is nearer   men writing in  offices  struck with a strange realisation  flung down their pens  men  talking in a thousand places suddenly came upon a grotesque possibility in  those words   it is nearer   it hurried along awakening streets  it was  shouted down the frost stilled ways of quiet villages  men who had read  these things from the throbbing tape stood in yellow lit doorways shouting  the news to the passers by   it is nearer   pretty women  flushed and  glittering  heard the news told jestingly between the dances  and feigned  an intelligent interest they did not feel   nearer  indeed  how curious   how very  very clever people must be to find out things like that      lonely tramps faring through the wintry night murmured those words to  comfort themselves  looking skyward   it has need to be nearer  for the  night s as cold as charity  don t seem much warmth from it if it  is   nearer  all the same       what is a new star to me   cried the weeping woman  kneeling beside her  dead     the schoolboy  rising early for his examination work  puzzled it out for  himself  with the great white star shining broad and bright through the  frost flowers of his window   centrifugal  centripetal   he said  with his  chin on his fist   stop a planet in its flight  rob it of its centrifugal  force  what then  centripetal has it  and down it falls into the sun  and  this        do  we  come in the way  i wonder       the light of that day went the way of its brethren  and with the later  watches of the frosty darkness rose the strange star again  and it was now  so bright that the waxing moon seemed but a pale yellow ghost of itself   hanging huge in the sunset  in a south african city a great man had  married  and the streets were alight to welcome his return with his bride    even the skies have illuminated   said the flatterer  under capricorn   two negro lovers  daring the wild beasts and evil spirits for love of one  another  crouched together in a cane brake where the fire flies hovered    that is our star   they whispered  and felt strangely comforted by the  sweet brilliance of its light     the master mathematician sat in his private room and pushed the papers from  him  his calculations were already finished  in a small white phial there  still remained a little of the drug that had kept him awake and active for  four long nights  each day  serene  explicit  patient as ever  he had  given his lecture to his students  and then had come back at once to this  momentous calculation  his face was grave  a little drawn and hectic from  his drugged activity  for some time he seemed lost in thought  then he  went to the window  and the blind went up with a click  half way up the  sky  over the clustering roofs  chimneys  and steeples of the city  hung  the star     he looked at it as one might look into the eyes of a brave enemy   you may  kill me   he said after a silence   but i can hold you  and all the  universe for that matter  in the grip of this small brain  i would not  change  even now      he looked at the little phial   there will be no need of sleep again   he  said  the next day at noon  punctual to the minute  he entered his lecture  theatre  put his hat on the end of the table as his habit was  and  carefully selected a large piece of chalk  it was a joke among his  students that he could not lecture without that piece of chalk to fumble  in his fingers  and once he had been stricken to impotence by their hiding  his supply  he came and looked under his grey eyebrows at the rising tiers  of young fresh faces  and spoke with his accustomed studied commonness of  phrasing      circumstances have arisen  circumstances beyond my control   he said  and  paused   which will debar me from completing the course i had designed   it would seem  gentlemen  if i may put the thing clearly and briefly   that  man has lived in vain      the students glanced at one another  had they heard aright  mad  raised  eyebrows and grinning lips there were  but one or two faces remained  intent upon his calm grey fringed face   it will be interesting   he was  saying   to devote this morning to an exposition  so far as i can make it  clear to you  of the calculations that have led me to this conclusion  let  us assume         he turned towards the blackboard  meditating a diagram in the way that was  usual to him   what was that about  lived in vain    whispered one student  to another   listen   said the other  nodding towards the lecturer     and presently they began to understand                                                 that night the star rose later  for its proper eastward motion had carried  it some way across leo towards virgo  and its brightness was so great that  the sky became a luminous blue as it rose  and every star was hidden in  its turn  save only jupiter near the zenith  capella  aldebaran  sirius   and the pointers of the bear  it was very white and beautiful  in many  parts of the world that night a pallid halo encircled it about  it was  perceptibly larger  in the clear refractive sky of the tropics it seemed  as if it were nearly a quarter the size of the moon  the frost was still  on the ground in england  but the world was as brightly lit as if it were  midsummer moonlight  one could see to read quite ordinary print by that  cold  clear light  and in the cities the lamps burnt yellow and wan     and everywhere the world was awake that night  and throughout christendom  a sombre murmur hung in the keen air over the country side like the  belling of bees in the heather  and this murmurous tumult grew to a  clangour in the cities  it was the tolling of the bells in a million  belfry towers and steeples  summoning the people to sleep no more  to sin  no more  but to gather in their churches and pray  and overhead  growing  larger and brighter  as the earth rolled on its way and the night passed   rose the dazzling star     and the streets and houses were alight in all the cities  the shipyards  glared  and whatever roads led to high country were lit and crowded all  night long  and in all the seas about the civilized lands  ships with  throbbing engines  and ships with bellying sails  crowded with men and  living creatures  were standing out to ocean and the north  for already  the warning of the master mathematician had been telegraphed all over the  world and translated into a hundred tongues  the new planet and neptune   locked in a fiery embrace  were whirling headlong  ever faster and faster  towards the sun  already every second this blazing mass flew a hundred  miles  and every second its terrific velocity increased  as it flew now   indeed  it must pass a hundred million of miles  wide of the earth and  scarcely affect it  but near its destined path  as yet only slightly  perturbed  spun the mighty planet jupiter and his moons sweeping splendid  round the sun  every moment now the attraction between the fiery star and  the greatest of the planets grew stronger  and the result of that  attraction  inevitably jupiter would be deflected from its orbit into  an elliptical path  and the burning star  swung by his attraction wide of  its sunward rush  would  describe a curved path   and perhaps collide  with  and certainly pass very close to  our earth   earthquakes  volcanic  outbreaks  cyclones  sea waves  floods  and a steady rise in temperature  to i know not what limit   so prophesied the master mathematician     and overhead  to carry out his words  lonely and cold and livid blazed the  star of the coming doom     to many who stared at it that night until their eyes ached it seemed that  it was visibly approaching  and that night  too  the weather changed  and  the frost that had gripped all central europe and france and england  softened towards a thaw     but you must not imagine  because i have spoken of people praying through  the night and people going aboard ships and people fleeing towards  mountainous country  that the whole world was already in a terror because  of the star  as a matter of fact  use and wont still ruled the world  and  save for the talk of idle moments and the splendour of the night  nine  human beings out of ten were still busy at their common occupations  in  all the cities the shops  save one here and there  opened and closed at  their proper hours  the doctor and the undertaker plied their trades  the  workers gathered in the factories  soldiers drilled  scholars studied   lovers sought one another  thieves lurked and fled  politicians planned  their schemes  the presses of the newspapers roared through the nights   and many a priest of this church and that would not open his holy building  to further what he considered a foolish panic  the newspapers insisted on  the lesson of the year       for then  too  people had anticipated the  end  the star was no star  mere gas  a comet  and were it a star it could  not possibly strike the earth  there was no precedent for such a thing   common sense was sturdy everywhere  scornful  jesting  a little inclined  to persecute the obdurate fearful  that night  at seven fifteen by  greenwich time  the star would be at its nearest to jupiter  then the  world would see the turn things would take  the master mathematician s  grim warnings were treated by many as so much mere elaborate  self advertisement  common sense at last  a little heated by argument   signified its unalterable convictions by going to bed  so  too  barbarism  and savagery  already tired of the novelty  went about their nightly  business  and  save for a howling dog here and there  the beast world left  the star unheeded     and yet  when at last the watchers in the european states saw the star  rise  an hour later  it is true  but no larger than it had been the night  before  there were still plenty awake to laugh at the master  mathematician  to take the danger as if it had passed     but hereafter the laughter ceased  the star grew  it grew with a terrible  steadiness hour after hour  a little larger each hour  a little nearer  the midnight zenith  and brighter and brighter  until it had turned night  into a second day  had it come straight to the earth instead of in a  curved path  had it lost no velocity to jupiter  it must have leapt the  intervening gulf in a day  but as it was  it took five days altogether to  come by our planet  the next night it had become a third the size of the  moon before it set to english eyes  and the thaw was assured  it rose over  america near the size of the moon  but blinding white to look at  and   hot   and a breath of hot wind blew now with its rising and  gathering strength  and in virginia  and brazil  and down the st  lawrence  valley  it shone intermittently through a driving reek of thunder clouds   flickering violet lightning  and hail unprecedented  in manitoba was a  thaw and devastating floods  and upon all the mountains of the earth the  snow and ice began to melt that night  and all the rivers coming out of  high country flowed thick and turbid  and soon  in their upper reaches    with swirling trees and the bodies of beasts and men  they rose steadily   steadily in the ghostly brilliance  and came trickling over their banks at  last  behind the flying population of their valleys     and along the coast of argentina and up the south atlantic the tides were  higher than had ever been in the memory of man  and the storms drove the  waters in many cases scores of miles inland  drowning whole cities  and so  great grew the heat during the night that the rising of the sun was like  the coming of a shadow  the earthquakes began and grew until all down  america from the arctic circle to cape horn  hillsides were sliding   fissures were opening  and houses and walls crumbling to destruction  the  whole side of cotopaxi slipped out in one vast convulsion  and a tumult of  lava poured out so high and broad and swift and liquid that in one day it  reached the sea     so the star  with the wan moon in its wake  marched across the pacific   trailed the thunder storms like the hem of a robe  and the growing tidal  wave that toiled behind it  frothing and eager  poured over island and  island and swept them clear of men  until that wave came at last  in a  blinding light and with the breath of a furnace  swift and terrible it  came  a wall of water  fifty feet high  roaring hungrily  upon the long  coasts of asia  and swept inland across the plains of china  for a space  the star  hotter now and larger and brighter than the sun in its strength   showed with pitiless brilliance the wide and populous country  towns and  villages with their pagodas and trees  roads  wide cultivated fields   millions of sleepless people staring in helpless terror at the  incandescent sky  and then  low and growing  came the murmur of the flood   and thus it was with millions of men that night  a flight nowhither  with  limbs heavy with heat and breath fierce and scant  and the flood like a  wall swift and white behind  and then death     china was lit glowing white  but over japan and java and all the islands  of eastern asia the great star was a ball of dull red fire because of the  steam and smoke and ashes the volcanoes were spouting forth to salute its  coming  above was the lava  hot gases and ash  and below the seething  floods  and the whole earth swayed and rumbled with the earthquake shocks   soon the immemorial snows of thibet and the himalaya were melting and  pouring down by ten million deepening converging channels upon the plains  of burmah and hindostan  the tangled summits of the indian jungles were  aflame in a thousand places  and below the hurrying waters around the  stems were dark objects that still struggled feebly and reflected the  blood red tongues of fire  and in a rudderless confusion a multitude of  men and women fled down the broad river ways to that one last hope of  men  the open sea     larger grew the star  and larger  hotter  and brighter with a terrible  swiftness now  the tropical ocean had lost its phosphorescence  and the  whirling steam rose in ghostly wreaths from the black waves that plunged  incessantly  speckled with storm tossed ships     and then came a wonder  it seemed to those who in europe watched for the  rising of the star that the world must have ceased its rotation  in a  thousand open spaces of down and upland the people who had fled thither  from the floods and the falling houses and sliding slopes of hill watched  for that rising in vain  hour followed hour through a terrible suspense   and the star rose not  once again men set their eyes upon the old  constellations they had counted lost to them for ever  in england it was  hot and clear overhead  though the ground quivered perpetually  but in the  tropics  sirius and capella and aldebaran showed through a veil of steam   and when at last the great star rose near ten hours late  the sun rose  close upon it  and in the centre of its white heart was a disc of black     over asia it was the star had begun to fall behind the movement of the  sky  and then suddenly  as it hung over india  its light had been veiled   all the plain of india from the mouth of the indus to the mouths of the  ganges was a shallow waste of shining water that night  out of which rose  temples and palaces  mounds and hills  black with people  every minaret  was a clustering mass of people  who fell one by one into the turbid  waters  as heat and terror overcame them  the whole land seemed a wailing   and suddenly there swept a shadow across that furnace of despair  and a  breath of cold wind  and a gathering of clouds  out of the cooling air   men looking up  near blinded  at the star  saw that a black disc was  creeping across the light  it was the moon  coming between the star and  the earth  and even as men cried to god at this respite  out of the east  with a strange inexplicable swiftness sprang the sun  and then star  sun   and moon rushed together across the heavens     so it was that presently to the european watchers star and sun rose close  upon each other  drove headlong for a space and then slower  and at last  came to rest  star and sun merged into one glare of flame at the zenith of  the sky  the moon no longer eclipsed the star but was lost to sight in the  brilliance of the sky  and though those who were still alive regarded it  for the most part with that dull stupidity that hunger  fatigue  heat and  despair engender  there were still men who could perceive the meaning of  these signs  star and earth had been at their nearest  had swung about one  another  and the star had passed  already it was receding  swifter and  swifter  in the last stage of its headlong journey downward into the sun     and then the clouds gathered  blotting out the vision of the sky  the  thunder and lightning wove a garment round the world  all over the earth  was such a downpour of rain as men had never before seen  and where the  volcanoes flared red against the cloud canopy there descended torrents of  mud  everywhere the waters were pouring off the land  leaving mud silted  ruins  and the earth littered like a storm worn beach with all that had  floated  and the dead bodies of the men and brutes  its children  for days  the water streamed off the land  sweeping away soil and trees and houses  in the way  and piling huge dykes and scooping out titanic gullies over  the country side  those were the days of darkness that followed the star  and the heat  all through them  and for many weeks and months  the  earthquakes continued     but the star had passed  and men  hunger driven and gathering courage only  slowly  might creep back to their ruined cities  buried granaries  and  sodden fields  such few ships as had escaped the storms of that time came  stunned and shattered and sounding their way cautiously through the new  marks and shoals of once familiar ports  and as the storms subsided men  perceived that everywhere the days were hotter than of yore  and the sun  larger  and the moon  shrunk to a third of its former size  took now  fourscore days between its new and new     but of the new brotherhood that grew presently among men  of the saving of  laws and books and machines  of the strange change that had come over  iceland and greenland and the shores of baffin s bay  so that the sailors  coming there presently found them green and gracious  and could scarce  believe their eyes  this story does not tell  nor of the movement of  mankind  now that the earth was hotter  northward and southward towards  the poles of the earth  it concerns itself only with the coming and the  passing of the star     the martian astronomers  for there are astronomers on mars  although they  are very different beings from men  were naturally profoundly interested  by these things  they saw them from their own standpoint of course    considering the mass and temperature of the missile that was flung  through our solar system into the sun   one wrote   it is astonishing what  a little damage the earth  which it missed so narrowly  has sustained  all  the familiar continental markings and the masses of the seas remain  intact  and indeed the only difference seems to be a shrinkage of the  white discolouration  supposed to be frozen water  round either pole    which only shows how small the vastest of human catastrophes may seem at a  distance of a few million miles             xxi       the man who could work miracles       a pantoum in prose       it is doubtful whether the gift was innate  for my own part  i think it  came to him suddenly  indeed  until he was thirty he was a sceptic  and  did not believe in miraculous powers  and here  since it is the most  convenient place  i must mention that he was a little man  and had eyes of  a hot brown  very erect red hair  a moustache with ends that he twisted  up  and freckles  his name was george mcwhirter fotheringay  not the sort  of name by any means to lead to any expectation of miracles  and he was  clerk at gomshott s  he was greatly addicted to assertive argument  it was  while he was asserting the impossibility of miracles that he had his first  intimation of his extraordinary powers  this particular argument was being  held in the bar of the long dragon  and toddy beamish was conducting the  opposition by a monotonous but effective  so  you  say   that drove  mr  fotheringay to the very limit of his patience     there were present  besides these two  a very dusty cyclist  landlord cox   and miss maybridge  the perfectly respectable and rather portly barmaid of  the dragon  miss maybridge was standing with her back to mr  fotheringay   washing glasses  the others were watching him  more or less amused by the  present ineffectiveness of the assertive method  goaded by the torres  vedras tactics of mr  beamish  mr  fotheringay determined to make an  unusual rhetorical effort   looky here  mr  beamish   said mr   fotheringay   let us clearly understand what a miracle is  it s something  contrariwise to the course of nature  done by power of will  something  what couldn t happen without being specially willed       so  you  say   said mr  beamish  repulsing him     mr  fotheringay appealed to the cyclist  who had hitherto been a silent  auditor  and received his assent  given with a hesitating cough and a  glance at mr  beamish  the landlord would express no opinion  and mr   fotheringay  returning to mr  beamish  received the unexpected concession  of a qualified assent to his definition of a miracle      for instance   said mr  fotheringay  greatly encouraged   here would be a  miracle  that lamp  in the natural course of nature  couldn t burn like  that upsy down  could it  beamish        you  say it couldn t   said beamish      and you   said fotheringay   you don t mean to say  eh       no   said beamish reluctantly   no  it couldn t       very well   said mr  fotheringay   then here comes someone  as it might  be me  along here  and stands as it might be here  and says to that lamp   as i might do  collecting all my will  turn upsy down without breaking   and go on burning steady  and  hullo      it was enough to make anyone say  hullo   the impossible  the incredible   was visible to them all  the lamp hung inverted in the air  burning  quietly with its flame pointing down  it was as solid  as indisputable as  ever a lamp was  the prosaic common lamp of the long dragon bar     mr  fotheringay stood with an extended forefinger and the knitted brows of  one anticipating a catastrophic smash  the cyclist  who was sitting next  the lamp  ducked and jumped across the bar  everybody jumped  more or  less  miss maybridge turned and screamed  for nearly three seconds the  lamp remained still  a faint cry of mental distress came from mr   fotheringay   i can t keep it up   he said   any longer   he staggered  back  and the inverted lamp suddenly flared  fell against the corner of  the bar  bounced aside  smashed upon the floor  and went out     it was lucky it had a metal receiver  or the whole place would have been  in a blaze  mr  cox was the first to speak  and his remark  shorn of  needless excrescences  was to the effect that fotheringay was a fool   fotheringay was beyond disputing even so fundamental a proposition as  that  he was astonished beyond measure at the thing that had occurred  the  subsequent conversation threw absolutely no light on the matter so far as  fotheringay was concerned  the general opinion not only followed mr  cox  very closely but very vehemently  everyone accused fotheringay of a silly  trick  and presented him to himself as a foolish destroyer of comfort and  security  his mind was in a tornado of perplexity  he was himself inclined  to agree with them  and he made a remarkably ineffectual opposition to the  proposal of his departure     he went home flushed and heated  coat collar crumpled  eyes smarting  and  ears red  he watched each of the ten street lamps nervously as he passed  it  it was only when he found himself alone in his little bedroom in  church row that he was able to grapple seriously with his memories of the  occurrence  and ask   what on earth happened      he had removed his coat and boots  and was sitting on the bed with his  hands in his pockets repeating the text of his defence for the seventeenth  time   i didn t want the confounded thing to upset   when it occurred to  him that at the precise moment he had said the commanding words he had  inadvertently willed the thing he said  and that when he had seen the lamp  in the air he had felt that it depended on him to maintain it there  without being clear how this was to be done  he had not a particularly  complex mind  or he might have stuck for a time at that  inadvertently  willed   embracing  as it does  the abstrusest problems of voluntary  action  but as it was  the idea came to him with a quite acceptable  haziness  and from that  following  as i must admit  no clear logical  path  he came to the test of experiment     he pointed resolutely to his candle and collected his mind  though he felt  he did a foolish thing   be raised up   he said  but in a second that  feeling vanished  the candle was raised  hung in the air one giddy moment   and as mr  fotheringay gasped  fell with a smash on his toilet table   leaving him in darkness save for the expiring glow of its wick     for a time mr  fotheringay sat in the darkness  perfectly still   it did  happen  after all   he said   and  ow  i m  to explain it i   don t  know   he sighed heavily  and began feeling in his pockets  for a match  he could find none  and he rose and groped about the  toilet table   i wish i had a match   he said  he resorted to his coat   and there was none there  and then it dawned upon him that miracles were  possible even with matches  he extended a hand and scowled at it in the  dark   let there be a match in that hand   he said  he felt some light  object fall across his palm and his fingers closed upon a match     after several ineffectual attempts to light this  he discovered it was a  safety match  he threw it down  and then it occurred to him that he might  have willed it lit  he did  and perceived it burning in the midst of his  toilet table mat  he caught it up hastily  and it went out  his perception  of possibilities enlarged  and he felt for and replaced the candle in its  candlestick   here   you  be lit   said mr  fotheringay  and  forthwith the candle was flaring  and he saw a little black hole in the  toilet cover  with a wisp of smoke rising from it  for a time he stared  from this to the little flame and back  and then looked up and met his own  gaze in the looking glass  by this help he communed with himself in  silence for a time      how about miracles now   said mr  fotheringay at last  addressing his  reflection     the subsequent meditations of mr  fotheringay were of a severe but  confused description  so far  he could see it was a case of pure willing  with him  the nature of his experiences so far disinclined him for any  further experiments  at least until he had reconsidered them  but he  lifted a sheet of paper  and turned a glass of water pink and then green   and he created a snail  which he miraculously annihilated  and got himself  a miraculous new tooth brush  somewhere in the small hours he had reached  the fact that his will power must be of a particularly rare and pungent  quality  a fact of which he had indeed had inklings before  but no certain  assurance  the scare and perplexity of his first discovery was now  qualified by pride in this evidence of singularity and by vague  intimations of advantage  he became aware that the church clock was  striking one  and as it did not occur to him that his daily duties at  gomshott s might be miraculously dispensed with  he resumed undressing  in  order to get to bed without further delay  as he struggled to get his  shirt over his head  he was struck with a brilliant idea   let me be in  bed   he said  and found himself so   undressed   he stipulated  and   finding the sheets cold  added hastily   and in my nightshirt  ho  in a  nice soft woollen nightshirt  ah   he said with immense enjoyment   and  now let me be comfortably asleep        he awoke at his usual hour and was pensive all through breakfast time   wondering whether his over night experience might not be a particularly  vivid dream  at length his mind turned again to cautious experiments  for  instance  he had three eggs for breakfast  two his landlady had supplied   good  but shoppy  and one was a delicious fresh goose egg  laid  cooked   and served by his extraordinary will  he hurried off to gomshott s in a  state of profound but carefully concealed excitement  and only remembered  the shell of the third egg when his landlady spoke of it that night  all  day he could do no work because of this astonishing new self knowledge   but this caused him no inconvenience  because he made up for it  miraculously in his last ten minutes     as the day wore on his state of mind passed from wonder to elation  albeit  the circumstances of his dismissal from the long dragon were still  disagreeable to recall  and a garbled account of the matter that had  reached his colleagues led to some badinage  it was evident he must be  careful how he lifted frangible articles  but in other ways his gift  promised more and more as he turned it over in his mind  he intended among  other things to increase his personal property by unostentatious acts of  creation  he called into existence a pair of very splendid diamond studs   and hastily annihilated them again as young gomshott came across the  counting house to his desk  he was afraid young gomshott might wonder how  he had come by them  he saw quite clearly the gift required caution and  watchfulness in its exercise  but so far as he could judge the  difficulties attending its mastery would be no greater than those he had  already faced in the study of cycling  it was that analogy  perhaps  quite  as much as the feeling that he would be unwelcome in the long dragon  that  drove him out after supper into the lane beyond the gasworks  to rehearse  a few miracles in private     there was possibly a certain want of originality in his attempts  for   apart from his will power  mr  fotheringay was not a very exceptional man   the miracle of moses  rod came to his mind  but the night was dark and  unfavourable to the proper control of large miraculous snakes  then he  recollected the story of  tannhaeuser  that he had read on the back of the  philharmonic programme  that seemed to him singularly attractive and  harmless  he stuck his walking stick  a very nice poona penang lawyer    into the turf that edged the footpath  and commanded the dry wood to  blossom  the air was immediately full of the scent of roses  and by means  of a match he saw for himself that this beautiful miracle was indeed  accomplished  his satisfaction was ended by advancing footsteps  afraid of  a premature discovery of his powers  he addressed the blossoming stick  hastily   go back   what he meant was  change back   but of course he was  confused  the stick receded at a considerable velocity  and incontinently  came a cry of anger and a bad word from the approaching person   who are  you throwing brambles at  you fool   cried a voice   that got me on the  shin       i m sorry  old chap   said mr  fotheringay  and then  realising the  awkward nature of the explanation  caught nervously at his moustache  he  saw winch  one of the three immering constables  advancing      what d yer mean by it   asked the constable   hullo  it s you  is it  the  gent that broke the lamp at the long dragon       i don t mean anything by it   said mr  fotheringay   nothing at all       what d yer do it for then       oh  bother   said mr  fotheringay      bother indeed  d yer know that stick hurt  what d yer do it for  eh      for the moment mr  fotheringay could not think what he had done it for   his silence seemed to irritate mr  winch   you ve been assaulting the  police  young man  this time  that s what  you  done       look here  mr  winch   said mr  fotheringay  annoyed and confused   i m  sorry  very  the fact is          well      he could think of no way but the truth   i was working a miracle   he  tried to speak in an off hand way  but try as he would he couldn t      working a     ere  don t you talk rot  working a miracle  indeed   miracle  well  that s downright funny  why  you s the chap that don t  believe in miracles    fact is  this is another of your silly conjuring  tricks  that s what this is  now  i tell you       but mr  fotheringay never heard what mr  winch was going to tell him  he  realised he had given himself away  flung his valuable secret to all the  winds of heaven  a violent gust of irritation swept him to action  he  turned on the constable swiftly and fiercely   here   he said   i ve had  enough of this  i have  i ll show you a silly conjuring trick  i will  go  to hades  go  now      he was alone     mr  fotheringay performed no more miracles that night  nor did he trouble  to see what had become of his flowering stick  he returned to the town   scared and very quiet  and went to his bedroom   lord   he said   it s a  powerful gift  an extremely powerful gift  i didn t hardly mean as much as  that  not really    i wonder what hades is like      he sat on the bed taking off his boots  struck by a happy thought he  transferred the constable to san francisco  and without any more  interference with normal causation went soberly to bed  in the night he  dreamt of the anger of winch     the next day mr  fotheringay heard two interesting items of news  someone  had planted a most beautiful climbing rose against the elder mr   gomshott s private house in the lullaborough road  and the river as far as  rawling s mill was to be dragged for constable winch     mr  fotheringay was abstracted and thoughtful all that day  and performed  no miracles except certain provisions for winch  and the miracle of  completing his day s work with punctual perfection in spite of all the  bee swarm of thoughts that hummed through his mind  and the extraordinary  abstraction and meekness of his manner was remarked by several people  and  made a matter for jesting  for the most part he was thinking of winch     on sunday evening he went to chapel  and oddly enough  mr  maydig  who  took a certain interest in occult matters  preached about  things that are  not lawful   mr  fotheringay was not a regular chapelgoer  but the system  of assertive scepticism  to which i have already alluded  was now very  much shaken  the tenor of the sermon threw an entirely new light on these  novel gifts  and he suddenly decided to consult mr  maydig immediately  after the service  so soon as that was determined  he found himself  wondering why he had not done so before     mr  maydig  a lean  excitable man with quite remarkably long wrists and  neck  was gratified at a request for a private conversation from a young  man whose carelessness in religious matters was a subject for general  remark in the town  after a few necessary delays  he conducted him to the  study of the manse  which was contiguous to the chapel  seated him  comfortably  and  standing in front of a cheerful fire  his legs threw a  rhodian arch of shadow on the opposite wall  requested mr  fotheringay to  state his business     at first mr  fotheringay was a little abashed  and found some difficulty  in opening the matter   you will scarcely believe me  mr  maydig  i am  afraid   and so forth for some time  he tried a question at last  and  asked mr  maydig his opinion of miracles     mr  maydig was still saying  well  in an extremely judicial tone  when mr   fotheringay interrupted again   you don t believe  i suppose  that some  common sort of person  like myself  for instance  as it might be sitting  here now  might have some sort of twist inside him that made him able to  do things by his will       it s possible   said mr  maydig   something of the sort  perhaps  is  possible       if i might make free with something here  i think i might show you by a  sort of experiment   said mr  fotheringay   now  take that tobacco jar on  the table  for instance  what i want to know is whether what i am going to  do with it is a miracle or not  just half a minute  mr  maydig  please      he knitted his brows  pointed to the tobacco jar and said   be a bowl of  vi lets      the tobacco jar did as it was ordered     mr  maydig started violently at the change  and stood looking from the  thaumaturgist to the bowl of flowers  he said nothing  presently he  ventured to lean over the table and smell the violets  they were  fresh picked and very fine ones  then he stared at mr  fotheringay again      how did you do that   he asked     mr  fotheringay pulled his moustache   just told it  and there you are  is  that a miracle  or is it black art  or what is it  and what do you think s  the matter with me  that s what i want to ask       it s a most extraordinary occurrence       and this day last week i knew no more that i could do things like that  than you did  it came quite sudden  it s something odd about my will  i  suppose  and that s as far as i can see       is that  the only thing  could you do other things besides that       lord  yes   said mr  fotheringay   just anything   he thought  and  suddenly recalled a conjuring entertainment he had seen   here   he  pointed   change into a bowl of fish  no  not that  change into a glass  bowl full of water with goldfish swimming in it  that s better  you see  that  mr  maydig       it s astonishing  it s incredible  you are either a most extraordinary     but no          i could change it into anything   said mr  fotheringay   just anything   here  be a pigeon  will you      in another moment a blue pigeon was fluttering round the room and making  mr  maydig duck every time it came near him   stop there  will you   said  mr  fotheringay  and the pigeon hung motionless in the air   i could  change it back to a bowl of flowers   he said  and after replacing the  pigeon on the table worked that miracle   i expect you will want your pipe  in a bit   he said  and restored the tobacco jar     mr  maydig had followed all these later changes in a sort of ejaculatory  silence  he stared at mr  fotheringay and in a very gingerly manner picked  up the tobacco jar  examined it  replaced it on the table    well     was the only expression of his feelings      now  after that it s easier to explain what i came about   said mr   fotheringay  and proceeded to a lengthy and involved narrative of his  strange experiences  beginning with the affair of the lamp in the long  dragon and complicated by persistent allusions to winch  as he went on   the transient pride mr  maydig s consternation had caused passed away  he  became the very ordinary mr  fotheringay of everyday intercourse again   mr  maydig listened intently  the tobacco jar in his hand  and his bearing  changed also with the course of the narrative  presently  while mr   fotheringay was dealing with the miracle of the third egg  the minister  interrupted with a fluttering  extended hand      it is possible   he said   it is credible  it is amazing  of course  but  it reconciles a number of amazing difficulties  the power to work miracles  is a gift  a peculiar quality like genius or second sight  hitherto it has  come very rarely and to exceptional people  but in this case   i have  always wondered at the miracles of mahomet  and at yogi s miracles  and  the miracles of madame blavatsky  but  of course  yes  it is simply a  gift  it carries out so beautifully the arguments of that great thinker     mr  maydig s voice sank   his grace the duke of argyll  here we plumb some  profounder law  deeper than the ordinary laws of nature  yes  yes  go on   go on      mr  fotheringay proceeded to tell of his misadventure with winch  and mr   maydig  no longer overawed or scared  began to jerk his limbs about and  interject astonishment   it s this what troubled me most   proceeded mr   fotheringay   it s this i m most mijitly in want of advice for  of course  he s at san francisco  wherever san francisco may be  but of course it s  awkward for both of us  as you ll see  mr  maydig  i don t see how he can  understand what has happened  and i daresay he s scared and exasperated  something tremendous  and trying to get at me  i daresay he keeps on  starting off to come here  i send him back  by a miracle  every few hours   when i think of it  and  of course  that s a thing he won t be able to  understand  and it s bound to annoy him  and  of course  if he takes a  ticket every time it will cost him a lot of money  i done the best i could  for him  but  of course  it s difficult for him to put himself in my  place  i thought afterwards that his clothes might have got scorched  you  know  if hades is all it s supposed to be  before i shifted him  in that  case i suppose they d have locked him up in san francisco  of course i  willed him a new suit of clothes on him directly i thought of it  but  you  see  i m already in a deuce of a tangle         mr  maydig looked serious   i see you are in a tangle  yes  it s a  difficult position  how you are to end it     he became diffuse and  inconclusive      however  we ll leave winch for a little and discuss the larger question   i don t think this is a case of the black art or anything of the sort  i  don t think there is any taint of criminality about it at all  mr   fotheringay  none whatever  unless you are suppressing material facts  no   it s miracles  pure miracles  miracles  if i may say so  of the very  highest class      he began to pace the hearthrug and gesticulate  while mr  fotheringay sat  with his arm on the table and his head on his arm  looking worried   i  don t see how i m to manage about winch   he said      a gift of working miracles  apparently a very powerful gift   said mr   maydig   will find a way about winch  never fear  my dear sir  you are a  most important man  a man of the most astonishing possibilities  as  evidence  for example  and in other ways  the things you may do         yes   i ve  thought of a thing or two   said mr  fotheringay   but    some of the things came a bit twisty  you saw that fish at first  wrong  sort of bowl and wrong sort of fish  and i thought i d ask someone       a proper course   said mr  maydig   a very proper course  altogether the  proper course   he stopped and looked at mr  fotheringay   it s  practically an unlimited gift  let us test your powers  for instance  if  they really  are      if they really are all they seem to be      and so  incredible as it may seem  in the study of the little house behind  the congregational chapel  on the evening of sunday  nov            mr   fotheringay  egged on and inspired by mr  maydig  began to work miracles   the reader s attention is specially and definitely called to the date  he  will object  probably has already objected  that certain points in this  story are improbable  that if any things of the sort already described had  indeed occurred  they would have been in all the papers at that time  the  details immediately following he will find particularly hard to accept   because among other things they involve the conclusion that he or she  the  reader in question  must have been killed in a violent and unprecedented  manner more than a year ago  now a miracle is nothing if not improbable   and as a matter of fact the reader  was  killed in a violent and  unprecedented manner in       in the subsequent course of this story that  will become perfectly clear and credible  as every right minded and  reasonable reader will admit  but this is not the place for the end of the  story  being but little beyond the hither side of the middle  and at first  the miracles worked by mr  fotheringay were timid little miracles  little  things with the cups and parlour fitments  as feeble as the miracles of  theosophists  and  feeble as they were  they were received with awe by his  collaborator  he would have preferred to settle the winch business out of  hand  but mr  maydig would not let him  but after they had worked a dozen  of these domestic trivialities  their sense of power grew  their  imagination began to show signs of stimulation  and their ambition  enlarged  their first larger enterprise was due to hunger and the  negligence of mrs  minchin  mr  maydig s housekeeper  the meal to which  the minister conducted mr  fotheringay was certainly ill laid and  uninviting as refreshment for two industrious miracle workers  but they  were seated  and mr  maydig was descanting in sorrow rather than in anger  upon his housekeeper s shortcomings  before it occurred to mr  fotheringay  that an opportunity lay before him   don t you think  mr  maydig   he  said   if it isn t a liberty   i           my dear mr  fotheringay  of course  no  i didn t think      mr  fotheringay waved his hand   what shall we have   he said  in a large   inclusive spirit  and  at mr  maydig s order  revised the supper very  thoroughly   as for me   he said  eyeing mr  maydig s selection   i am  always particularly fond of a tankard of stout and a nice welsh rarebit   and i ll order that  i ain t much given to burgundy   and forthwith stout  and welsh rarebit promptly appeared at his command  they sat long at their  supper  talking like equals  as mr  fotheringay presently perceived  with  a glow of surprise and gratification  of all the miracles they would  presently do   and  by the by  mr  maydig   said mr  fotheringay   i might  perhaps be able to help you  in a domestic way       don t quite follow   said mr  maydig  pouring out a glass of miraculous  old burgundy     mr  fotheringay helped himself to a second welsh rarebit out of vacancy   and took a mouthful   i was thinking   he said   i might be able   chum   chum   to work   chum  chum   a miracle with mrs  minchin    chum  chum    make her a better woman      mr  maydig put down the glass and looked doubtful      she s    she strongly objects to interference  you know  mr   fotheringay  and  as a matter of fact  it s well past eleven and she s  probably in bed and asleep  do you think  on the whole         mr  fotheringay considered these objections   i don t see that it  shouldn t be done in her sleep      for a time mr  maydig opposed the idea  and then he yielded  mr   fotheringay issued his orders  and a little less at their ease  perhaps   the two gentlemen proceeded with their repast  mr  maydig was enlarging on  the changes he might expect in his housekeeper next day  with an optimism   that seemed even to mr  fotheringay s supper senses a little forced and  hectic  when a series of confused noises from upstairs began  their eyes  exchanged interrogations  and mr  maydig left the room hastily  mr   fotheringay heard him calling up to his housekeeper and then his footsteps  going softly up to her     in a minute or so the minister returned  his step light  his face radiant    wonderful   he said   and touching  most touching      he began pacing the hearthrug   a repentance  a most touching repentance    through the crack of the door  poor woman  a most wonderful change  she  had got up  she must have got up at once  she had got up out of her sleep  to smash a private bottle of brandy in her box  and to confess it too      but this gives us  it opens  a most amazing vista of possibilities  if we  can work this miraculous change in  her          the thing s unlimited seemingly   said mr  fotheringay   and about mr   winch          altogether unlimited   and from the hearthrug mr  maydig  waving the  winch difficulty aside  unfolded a series of wonderful proposals    proposals he invented as he went along     now what those proposals were does not concern the essentials of this  story  suffice it that they were designed in a spirit of infinite  benevolence  the sort of benevolence that used to be called post prandial   suffice it  too  that the problem of winch remained unsolved  nor is it  necessary to describe how far that series got to its fulfilment  there  were astonishing changes  the small hours found mr  maydig and mr   fotheringay careering across the chilly market square under the still  moon  in a sort of ecstasy of thaumaturgy  mr  maydig all flap and  gesture  mr  fotheringay short and bristling  and no longer abashed at his  greatness  they had reformed every drunkard in the parliamentary division   changed all the beer and alcohol to water  mr  maydig had overruled mr   fotheringay on this point   they had  further  greatly improved the  railway communication of the place  drained flinder s swamp  improved the  soil of one tree hill  and cured the vicar s wart  and they were going to  see what could be done with the injured pier at south bridge   the place    gasped mr  maydig   won t be the same place to morrow  how surprised and  thankful everyone will be   and just at that moment the church clock  struck three      i say   said mr  fotheringay   that s three o clock  i must be getting  back  i ve got to be at business by eight  and besides  mrs  wimms          we re only beginning   said mr  maydig  full of the sweetness of  unlimited power   we re only beginning  think of all the good we re doing   when people wake          but       said mr  fotheringay     mr  maydig gripped his arm suddenly  his eyes were bright and wild   my  dear chap   he said   there s no hurry  look   he pointed to the moon at  the zenith   joshua       joshua   said mr  fotheringay      joshua   said mr  maydig   why not  stop it      mr  fotheringay looked at the moon      that s a bit tall   he said  after a pause      why not   said mr  maydig   of course it doesn t stop  you stop the  rotation of the earth  you know  time stops  it isn t as if we were doing  harm       h m   said mr  fotheringay   well   he sighed   i ll try  here      he buttoned up his jacket and addressed himself to the habitable globe   with as good an assumption of confidence as lay in his power   jest stop  rotating  will you   said mr  fotheringay     incontinently he was flying head over heels through the air at the rate of  dozens of miles a minute  in spite of the innumerable circles he was  describing per second  he thought  for thought is wonderful  sometimes as  sluggish as flowing pitch  sometimes as instantaneous as light  he thought  in a second  and willed   let me come down safe and sound  whatever else  happens  let me down safe and sound      he willed it only just in time  for his clothes  heated by his rapid  flight through the air  were already beginning to singe  he came down with  a forcible  but by no means injurious  bump in what appeared to be a mound  of fresh turned earth  a large mass of metal and masonry  extraordinarily  like the clock tower in the middle of the market square  hit the earth  near him  ricochetted over him  and flew into stonework  bricks  and  cement  like a bursting bomb  a hurtling cow hit one of the larger blocks  and smashed like an egg  there was a crash that made all the most violent  crashes of his past life seem like the sound of falling dust  and this was  followed by a descending series of lesser crashes  a vast wind roared  throughout earth and heaven  so that he could scarcely lift his head to  look  for a while he was too breathless and astonished even to see where  he was or what had happened  and his first movement was to feel his head  and reassure himself that his streaming hair was still his own      lord   gasped mr  fotheringay  scarce able to speak for the gale   i ve  had a squeak  what s gone wrong  storms and thunder  and only a minute ago  a fine night  it s maydig set me on to this sort of thing   what  a  wind  if i go on fooling in this way i m bound to have a thundering  accident         where s maydig      what a confounded mess everything s in      he looked about him so far as his flapping jacket would permit  the  appearance of things was really extremely strange   the sky s all right  anyhow   said mr  fotheringay   and that s about all that is all right   and even there it looks like a terrific gale coming up  but there s the  moon overhead  just as it was just now  bright as midday  but as for the  rest    where s the village  where s  where s anything  and what on earth  set this wind a blowing  i didn t order no wind      mr  fotheringay struggled to get to his feet in vain  and after one  failure  remained on all fours  holding on  he surveyed the moonlit world  to leeward  with the tails of his jacket streaming over his head   there s  something seriously wrong   said mr  fotheringay   and what it is    goodness knows      far and wide nothing was visible in the white glare through the haze of  dust that drove before a screaming gale but tumbled masses of earth and  heaps of inchoate ruins  no trees  no houses  no familiar shapes  only a  wilderness of disorder  vanishing at last into the darkness beneath the  whirling columns and streamers  the lightnings and thunderings of a  swiftly rising storm  near him in the livid glare was something that might  once have been an elm tree  a smashed mass of splinters  shivered from  boughs to base  and further a twisted mass of iron girders  only too  evidently the viaduct  rose out of the piled confusion     you see  when mr  fotheringay had arrested the rotation of the solid  globe  he had made no stipulation concerning the trifling movables upon  its surface  and the earth spins so fast that the surface at its equator  is travelling at rather more than a thousand miles an hour  and in these  latitudes at more than half that pace  so that the village  and mr   maydig  and mr  fotheringay  and everybody and everything had been jerked  violently forward at about nine miles per second  that is to say  much  more violently than if they had been fired out of a cannon  and every  human being  every living creature  every house  and every tree  all the  world as we know it  had been so jerked and smashed and utterly destroyed   that was all     these things mr  fotheringay did not  of course  fully appreciate  but he  perceived that his miracle had miscarried  and with that a great disgust  of miracles came upon him  he was in darkness now  for the clouds had  swept together and blotted out his momentary glimpse of the moon  and the  air was full of fitful struggling tortured wraiths of hail  a great  roaring of wind and waters filled earth and sky  and peering under his  hand through the dust and sleet to windward  he saw by the play of the  lightnings a vast wall of water pouring towards him      maydig   screamed mr  fotheringay s feeble voice amid the elemental  uproar   here   maydig      stop   cried mr  fotheringay to the advancing water   oh  for goodness   sake  stop      just a moment   said mr  fotheringay to the lightnings and thunder   stop  jest a moment while i collect my thoughts    and now what shall i do   he  said   what  shall  i do  lord  i wish maydig was about       i know   said mr  fotheringay   and for goodness  sake let s have it  right  this  time      he remained on all fours  leaning against the wind  very intent to have  everything right      ah   he said   let nothing what i m going to order happen until i say   off     lord  i wish i d thought of that before      he lifted his little voice against the whirlwind  shouting louder and  louder in the vain desire to hear himself speak   now then   here goes   mind about that what i said just now  in the first place  when all i ve  got to say is done  let me lose my miraculous power  let my will become  just like anybody else s will  and all these dangerous miracles be  stopped  i don t like them  i d rather i didn t work  em  ever so much   that s the first thing  and the second is  let me be back just before the  miracles begin  let everything be just as it was before that blessed lamp  turned up  it s a big job  but it s the last  have you got it  no more  miracles  everything as it was  me back in the long dragon just before i  drank my half pint  that s it  yes      he dug his fingers into the mould  closed his eyes  and said  off      everything became perfectly still  he perceived that he was standing  erect      so  you  say   said a voice     he opened his eyes  he was in the bar of the long dragon  arguing about  miracles with toddy beamish  he had a vague sense of some great thing  forgotten that instantaneously passed  you see that  except for the loss  of his miraculous powers  everything was back as it had been  his mind and  memory therefore were now just as they had been at the time when this  story began  so that he knew absolutely nothing of all that is told here    knows nothing of all that is told here to this day  and among other  things  of course  he still did not believe in miracles      i tell you that miracles  properly speaking  can t possibly happen   he  said   whatever you like to hold  and i m prepared to prove it up to the  hilt       that s what  you  think   said toddy beamish  and  prove it if you  can       looky here  mr  beamish   said mr  fotheringay   let us clearly  understand what a miracle is  it s something contrariwise to the course of  nature done by power of will                xxii       a vision of judgment       i     bru a a a     i listened  not understanding     wa ra ra ra      good lord   said i  still only half awake   what an infernal shindy      ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ta ra rra ra      it s enough   said i   to wake      and stopped short  where was i     ta rra rara  louder and louder      it s either some new invention         toora toora toora  deafening      no   said i  speaking loud in order to hear myself   that s the last  trump      tooo rraa       ii     the last note jerked me out of my grave like a hooked minnow     i saw my monument  rather a mean little affair  and i wished i knew who d  done it   and the old elm tree and the sea view vanished like a puff of  steam  and then all about me  a multitude no man could number  nations   tongues  kingdoms  peoples  children of all the ages  in an amphitheatral  space as vast as the sky  and over against us  seated on a throne of  dazzling white cloud  the lord god and all the host of his angels  i  recognised azrael by his darkness and michael by his sword  and the great  angel who had blown the trumpet stood with the trumpet still half raised       iii      prompt   said the little man beside me   very prompt  do you see the  angel with the book      he was ducking and craning his head about to see over and under and  between the souls that crowded round us   everybody s here   he said    everybody  and now we shall know       there s darwin   he said  going off at a tangent    he ll  catch it   and there  you see   that tall  important looking man trying to catch the  eye of the lord god  that s the duke  but there s a lot of people one  doesn t know      oh  there s priggles  the publisher  i have always wondered about  printers  overs  priggles was a clever man     but we shall know now  even  about him      i shall hear all that  i shall get most of the fun before      my   letter s s      he drew the air in between his teeth      historical characters  too  see  that s henry the eighth  there ll be a  good bit of evidence  oh  damn  he s tudor      he lowered his voice   notice this chap  just in front of us  all covered  with hair  paleolithic  you know  and there again       but i did not heed him  because i was looking at the lord god       iv      is this  all    asked the lord god     the angel at the book  it was one of countless volumes  like the british  museum reading room catalogue  glanced at us and seemed to count us in the  instant      that s all   he said  and added   it was  o god  a very little planet      the eyes of god surveyed us      let us begin   said the lord god       v     the angel opened the book and read a name  it was a name full of a s  and  the echoes of it came back out of the uttermost parts of space  i did not  catch it clearly  because the little man beside me said  in a sharp jerk     what s  that   it sounded like  ahab  to me  but it could not have  been the ahab of scripture     instantly a small black figure was lifted up to a puffy cloud at the very  feet of god  it was a stiff little figure  dressed in rich outlandish  robes and crowned  and it folded its arms and scowled      well   said god  looking down at him     we were privileged to hear the reply  and indeed the acoustic properties  of the place were marvellous      i plead guilty   said the little figure      tell them what you have done   said the lord god      i was a king   said the little figure   a great king  and i was lustful  and proud and cruel  i made wars  i devastated countries  i built palaces   and the mortar was the blood of men  hear  o god  the witnesses against  me  calling to you for vengeance  hundreds and thousands of witnesses   he  waved his hands towards us   and worse  i took a prophet  one of your  prophets          one of my prophets   said the lord god      and because he would not bow to me  i tortured him for four days and  nights  and in the end he died  i did more  o god  i blasphemed  i robbed  you of your honours          robbed me of my honours   said the lord god      i caused myself to be worshipped in your stead  no evil was there but i  practised it  no cruelty wherewith i did not stain my soul  and at last  you smote me  o god      god raised his eyebrows slightly      and i was slain in battle  and so i stand before you  meet for your  nethermost hell  out of your greatness daring no lies  daring no pleas   but telling the truth of my iniquities before all mankind      he ceased  his face i saw distinctly  and it seemed to me white and  terrible and proud and strangely noble  i thought of milton s satan      most of that is from the obelisk   said the recording angel  finger on  page      it is   said the tyrannous man  with a faint touch of surprise     then suddenly god bent forward and took this man in his hand  and held him  up on his palm as if to see him better  he was just a little dark stroke  in the middle of god s palm       did  he do all this   said the lord god     the recording angel flattened his book with his hand      in a way   said the recording angel  carelessly  now when i looked again  at the little man his face had changed in a very curious manner  he was  looking at the recording angel with a strange apprehension in his eyes   and one hand fluttered to his mouth  just the movement of a muscle or so   and all that dignity of defiance was gone      read   said the lord god     and the angel read  explaining very carefully and fully all the wickedness  of the wicked man  it was quite an intellectual treat   a little  daring   in places  i thought  but of course heaven has its privileges         vi     everybody was laughing  even the prophet of the lord whom the wicked man  had tortured had a smile on his face  the wicked man was really such a  preposterous little fellow      and then   read the recording angel  with a smile that set us all agog    one day  when he was a little irascible from over eating  he        oh  not  that    cried the wicked man   nobody knew of  that       it didn t happen   screamed the wicked man   i was bad  i was really bad   frequently bad  but there was nothing so silly  so absolutely silly       the angel went on reading      o god   cried the wicked man   don t let them know that  i ll repent   i ll apologise        the wicked man on god s hand began to dance and weep  suddenly shame  overcame him  he made a wild rush to jump off the ball of god s little  finger  but god stopped him by a dexterous turn of the wrist  then he made  a rush for the gap between hand and thumb  but the thumb closed  and all  the while the angel went on reading  reading  the wicked man rushed to and  fro across god s palm  and then suddenly turned about and fled up the  sleeve of god     i expected god would turn him out  but the mercy of god is infinite     the recording angel paused      eh   said the recording angel      next   said god  and before the recording angel could call the name a  hairy creature in filthy rags stood upon god s palm       vii      has god got hell up his sleeve then   said the little man beside me       is  there a hell   i asked      if you notice   he said  he peered between the feet of the great angels     there s no particular indication of a celestial city        ssh   said a little woman near us  scowling   hear this blessed saint        viii      he was lord of the earth  but i was the prophet of the god of heaven    cried the saint   and all the people marvelled at the sign  for i  o god   knew of the glories of thy paradise  no pain  no hardship  gashing with  knives  splinters thrust under my nails  strips of flesh flayed off  all  for the glory and honour of god      god smiled      and at last i went  i in my rags and sores  smelling of my holy  discomforts         gabriel laughed abruptly      and lay outside his gates  as a sign  as a wonder          as a perfect nuisance   said the recording angel  and began to read   heedless of the fact that the saint was still speaking of the gloriously  unpleasant things he had done that paradise might be his     and behold  in that book the record of the saint also was a revelation  a  marvel     it seemed not ten seconds before the saint also was rushing to and fro  over the great palm of god  not ten seconds  and at last he also shrieked  beneath that pitiless and cynical exposition  and fled also  even as the  wicked man had fled  into the shadow of the sleeve  and it was permitted  us to see into the shadow of the sleeve  and the two sat side by side   stark of all delusions  in the shadow of the robe of god s charity  like  brothers     and thither also i fled in my turn       ix      and now   said god  as he shook us out of his sleeve upon the planet he  had given us to live upon  the planet that whirled about green sirius for  a sun   now that you understand me and each other a little better    try  again      then he and his great angels turned themselves about and suddenly had  vanished       the throne had vanished     all about me was a beautiful land  more beautiful than any i had ever seen  before  waste  austere  and wonderful  and all about me were the  enlightened souls of men in new clean bodies               xxiii       jimmy goggles the god        it isn t every one who s been a god   said the sunburnt man   but it s  happened to me  among other things      i intimated my sense of his condescension      it don t leave much for ambition  does it   said the sunburnt man      i was one of those men who were saved from the  ocean pioneer    gummy  how time flies  it s twenty years ago  i doubt if you ll remember  anything of the  ocean pioneer       the name was familiar  and i tried to recall when and where i had read it   the  ocean pioneer    something about gold dust   i said vaguely    but the precise        that s it   he said   in a beastly little channel she hadn t no business  in  dodging pirates  it was before they d put the kybosh on that business   and there d been volcanoes or something and all the rocks was wrong   there s places about by soona where you fair have to follow the rocks  about to see where they re going next  down she went in twenty fathoms  before you could have dealt for whist  with fifty thousand pounds worth of  gold aboard  it was said  in one form or another       survivors       three       i remember the case now   i said   there was something about salvage         but at the word salvage the sunburnt man exploded into language so  extraordinarily horrible that i stopped aghast  he came down to more  ordinary swearing  and pulled himself up abruptly   excuse me   he said    but  salvage      he leant over towards me   i was in that job   he said   tried to make  myself a rich man  and got made a god instead  i ve got my feelings         it ain t all jam being a god   said the sunburnt man  and for some time  conversed by means of such pithy but unprogressive axioms  at last he took  up his tale again      there was me   said the sunburnt man   and a seaman named jacobs  and  always  the mate of the  ocean pioneer   and him it was that set the  whole thing going  i remember him now  when we was in the jolly boat   suggesting it all to our minds just by one sentence  he was a wonderful  hand at suggesting things   there was forty thousand pounds   he said   on  that ship  and it s for me to say just where she went down   it didn t  need much brains to tumble to that  and he was the leader from the first  to the last  he got hold of the sanderses and their brig  they were  brothers  and the brig was the  pride of banya   and he it was bought  the diving dress  a second hand one with a compressed air apparatus  instead of pumping  he d have done the diving too  if it hadn t made him  sick going down  and the salvage people were mucking about with a chart  he d cooked up  as solemn as could be  at starr race  a hundred and twenty  miles away      i can tell you we was a happy lot aboard that brig  jokes and drink and  bright hopes all the time  it all seemed so neat and clean and  straightforward  and what rough chaps call a  cert   and we used to  speculate how the other blessed lot  the proper salvagers  who d started  two days before us  were getting on  until our sides fairly ached  we all  messed together in the sanderses  cabin  it was a curious crew  all  officers and no men  and there stood the diving dress waiting its turn   young sanders was a humorous sort of chap  and there certainly was  something funny in the confounded thing s great fat head and its stare   and he made us see it too   jimmy goggles   he used to call it  and talk  to it like a christian  asked if he was married  and how mrs  goggles was   and all the little goggleses  fit to make you split  and every blessed day  all of us used to drink the health of jimmy goggles in rum  and unscrew  his eye and pour a glass of rum in him  until  instead of that nasty  mackintosheriness  he smelt as nice in his inside as a cask of rum  it was  jolly times we had in those days  i can tell you  little suspecting  poor  chaps  what was a coming      we weren t going to throw away our chances by any blessed hurry  you  know  and we spent a whole day sounding our way towards where the   ocean pioneer  had gone down  right between two chunks of ropy grey  rock  lava rocks that rose nearly out of the water  we had to lay off  about half a mile to get a safe anchorage  and there was a thundering row  who should stop on board  and there she lay just as she had gone down  so  that you could see the top of the masts that was still standing perfectly  distinctly  the row ended in all coming in the boat  i went down in the  diving dress on friday morning directly it was light      what a surprise it was  i can see it all now quite distinctly  it was a  queer looking place  and the light was just coming  people over here think  every blessed place in the tropics is a flat shore and palm trees and  surf  bless  em  this place  for instance  wasn t a bit that way  not  common rocks they were  undermined by waves  but great curved banks like  ironwork cinder heaps  with green slime below  and thorny shrubs and  things just waving upon them here and there  and the water glassy calm and  clear  and showing you a kind of dirty gray black shine  with huge flaring  red brown weeds spreading motionless  and crawling and darting things  going through it  and far away beyond the ditches and pools and the heaps  was a forest on the mountain flank  growing again after the fires and  cinder showers of the last eruption  and the other way forest  too  and a  kind of broken  what is it   amby theatre of black and rusty cinders  rising out of it all  and the sea in a kind of bay in the middle      the dawn  i say  was just coming  and there wasn t much colour about  things  and not a human being but ourselves anywhere in sight up or down  the channel  except the  pride of banya   lying out beyond a lump of  rocks towards the line of the sea      not a human being in sight   he repeated  and paused       i  don t know where they came from  not a bit  and we were feeling  so safe that we were all alone that poor young sanders was a singing  i  was in jimmy goggles  all except the helmet   easy   says always   there s  her mast   and after i d had just one squint over the gunwale  i caught up  the bogey  and almost tipped out as old sanders brought the boat round   when the windows were screwed and everything was all right  i shut the  valve from the air belt in order to help my sinking  and jumped overboard   feet foremost  for we hadn t a ladder  i left the boat pitching  and all  of them staring down into water after me  as my head sank down into the  weeds and blackness that lay about the mast  i suppose nobody  not the  most cautious chap in the world  would have bothered about a look out at  such a desolate place  it stunk of solitude      of course you must understand that i was a greenhorn at diving  none of  us were divers  we d had to muck about with the thing to get the way of  it  and this was the first time i d been deep  it feels damnable  your  ears hurt beastly  i don t know if you ve ever hurt yourself yawning or  sneezing  but it takes you like that  only ten times worse  and a pain  over the eyebrows here  splitting  and a feeling like influenza in the  head  and it isn t all heaven in your lungs and things  and going down  feels like the beginning of a lift  only it keeps on  and you can t turn  your head to see what s above you  and you can t get a fair squint at  what s happening to your feet without bending down something painful  and  being deep it was dark  let alone the blackness of the ashes and mud that  formed the bottom  it was like going down out of the dawn back into the  night  so to speak      the mast came up like a ghost out of the black  and then a lot of fishes   and then a lot of flapping red seaweed  and then whack i came with a kind  of dull bang on the deck of the  ocean pioneer   and the fishes that  had been feeding on the dead rose about me like a swarm of flies from road  stuff in summer time  i turned on the compressed air again  for the suit  was a bit thick and mackintoshery after all  in spite of the rum  and  stood recovering myself  it struck coolish down there  and that helped  take off the stuffiness a bit       when i began to feel easier  i started looking about me  it was an  extraordinary sight  even the light was extraordinary  a kind of  reddy coloured twilight  on account of the streamers of seaweed that  floated up on either side of the ship  and far overhead just a moony   deep green blue  the deck of the ship  except for a slight list to  starboard  was level  and lay all dark and long between the weeds  clear  except where the masts had snapped when she rolled  and vanishing into  black night towards the forecastle  there wasn t any dead on the decks   most were in the weeds alongside  i suppose  but afterwards i found two  skeletons lying in the passengers  cabins  where death had come to them   it was curious to stand on that deck and recognise it all  bit by bit  a  place against the rail where i d been fond of smoking by starlight  and  the corner where an old chap from sydney used to flirt with a widow we  had aboard  a comfortable couple they d been  only a month ago  and now  you couldn t have got a meal for a baby crab off either of them      i ve always had a bit of a philosophical turn  and i daresay i spent the  best part of five minutes in such thoughts before i went below to find  where the blessed dust was stored  it was slow work hunting  feeling it  was for the most part  pitchy dark  with confusing blue gleams down the  companion  and there were things moving about  a dab at my glass once  and  once a pinch at my leg  crabs  i expect  i kicked a lot of loose stuff  that puzzled me  and stooped and picked up something all knobs and spikes   what do you think  backbone  but i never had any particular feeling for  bones  we had talked the affair over pretty thoroughly  and always knew  just where the stuff was stowed  i found it that trip  i lifted a box one  end an inch or more      he broke off in his story   i ve lifted it   he said   as near as that   forty thousand pounds  worth of pure gold  gold  i shouted inside my  helmet as a kind of cheer  and hurt my ears  i was getting confounded  stuffy and tired by this time  i must have been down twenty five minutes  or more  and i thought this was good enough  i went up the companion  again  and as my eyes came up flush with the deck  a thundering great crab  gave a kind of hysterical jump and went scuttling off sideways  quite a  start it gave me  i stood up clear on deck and shut the valve behind the  helmet to let the air accumulate to carry me up again  i noticed a kind of  whacking from above  as though they were hitting the water with an oar   but i didn t look up  i fancied they were signalling me to come up      and then something shot down by me  something heavy  and stood a quiver  in the planks  i looked  and there was a long knife i d seen young sanders  handling  thinks i  he s dropped it  and i was still calling him this kind  of fool and that   for it might have hurt me serious  when i began to lift  and drive up towards the daylight  just about the level of the top spars  of the  ocean pioneer   whack  i came against something sinking down   and a boot knocked in front of my helmet  then something else  struggling  frightful  it was a big weight atop of me  whatever it was  and moving and  twisting about  i d have thought it a big octopus  or some such thing  if  it hadn t been for the boot  but octopuses don t wear boots  it was all in  a moment  of course      i felt myself sinking down again  and i threw my arms about to keep  steady  and the whole lot rolled free of me and shot down as i went up       he paused      i saw young sanders s face  over a naked black shoulder  and a spear  driven clean through his neck  and out of his mouth and neck what looked  like spirts of pink smoke in the water  and down they went clutching one  another  and turning over  and both too far gone to leave go  and in  another second my helmet came a whack  fit to split  against the niggers   canoe  it was niggers  two canoes full      it was lively times i tell you  overboard came always with three spears  in him  there was the legs of three or four black chaps kicking about me  in the water  i couldn t see much  but i saw the game was up at a glance   gave my valve a tremendous twist  and went bubbling down again after poor  always  in as awful a state of scare and astonishment as you can well  imagine  i passed young sanders and the nigger going up again and  struggling still a bit  and in another moment i was standing in the dim  again on the deck of the  ocean pioneer       gummy  thinks i  here s a fix  niggers  at first i couldn t see anything  for it but stifle below or stabs above  i didn t properly understand how  much air there was to last me out  but i didn t feel like standing very  much more of it down below  i was hot and frightfully heady  quite apart  from the blue funk i was in  we d never reckoned with these beastly  natives  filthy papuan beasts  it wasn t any good coming up where i was   but i had to do something  on the spur of the moment  i clambered over the  side of the brig and landed among the weeds  and set off through the  darkness as fast as i could  i just stopped once and knelt  and twisted  back my head in the helmet and had a look up  it was a most extraordinary  bright green blue above  and the two canoes and the boat floating there  very small and distant like a kind of twisted h  and it made me feel sick  to squint up at it  and think what the pitching and swaying of the three  meant      it was just about the most horrible ten minutes i ever had  blundering  about in that darkness  pressure something awful  like being buried in  sand  pain across the chest  sick with funk  and breathing nothing as it  seemed but the smell of rum and mackintosh  gummy  after a bit  i found  myself going up a steepish sort of slope  i had another squint to see if  anything was visible of the canoes and boats  and then kept on  i stopped  with my head a foot from the surface  and tried to see where i was going   but  of course  nothing was to be seen but the reflection of the bottom   then out i dashed  like knocking my head through a mirror  directly i got  my eyes out of the water  i saw i d come up a kind of beach near the  forest  i had a look round  but the natives and the brig were both hidden  by a big hummucky heap of twisted lava  the born fool in me suggested a  run for the woods  i didn t take the helmet off  but i eased open one of  the windows  and  after a bit of a pant  went on out of the water  you d  hardly imagine how clean and light the air tasted      of course  with four inches of lead in your boot soles  and your head in  a copper knob the size of a football  and been thirty five minutes under  water  you don t break any records running  i ran like a ploughboy going  to work  and half way to the trees i saw a dozen niggers or more  coming  out in a gaping  astonished sort of way to meet me      i just stopped dead  and cursed myself for all the fools out of london  i  had about as much chance of cutting back to the water as a turned turtle   i just screwed up my window again to leave my hands free  and waited for  them  there wasn t anything else for me to do      but they didn t come on very much  i began to suspect why   jimmy  goggles   i says   it s your beauty does it   i was inclined to be a  little lightheaded  i think  with all these dangers about and the change  in the pressure of the blessed air   who re ye staring at   i said  as if  the savages could hear me   what d ye take me for  i m hanged if i don t  give you something to stare at   i said  and with that i screwed up the  escape valve and turned on the compressed air from the belt  until i was  swelled out like a blown frog  regular imposing it must have been  i m  blessed if they d come on a step  and presently one and then another went  down on their hands and knees  they didn t know what to make of me  and  they was doing the extra polite  which was very wise and reasonable of  them  i had half a mind to edge back seaward and cut and run  but it  seemed too hopeless  a step back and they d have been after me  and out of  sheer desperation i began to march towards them up the beach  with slow   heavy steps  and waving my blown out arms about  in a dignified manner   and inside of me i was singing as small as a tomtit      but there s nothing like a striking appearance to help a man over a  difficulty   i ve found that before and since  people like ourselves   who re up to diving dresses by the time we re seven  can scarcely imagine  the effect of one on a simple minded savage  one or two of these niggers  cut and run  the others started in a great hurry trying to knock their  brains out on the ground  and on i went as slow and solemn and  silly looking and artful as a jobbing plumber  it was evident they took  me for something immense      then up jumped one and began pointing  making extraordinary gestures to  me as he did so  and all the others began sharing their attention between  me and something out at  sea   what s the matter now   i said  i turned  slowly on account of my dignity  and there i saw  coming round a point   the poor old  pride of banya  towed by a couple of canoes  the sight  fairly made me sick  but they evidently expected some recognition  so i  waved my arms in a striking sort of non committal manner  and then i  turned and stalked on towards the trees again  at that time i was praying  like mad  i remember  over and over again   lord help me through with it   lord help me through with it   it s only fools who know nothing of danger  can afford to laugh at praying       but these niggers weren t going to let me walk through and away like  that  they started a kind of bowing dance about me  and sort of pressed me  to take a pathway that lay through the trees  it was clear to me they  didn t take me for a british citizen  whatever else they thought of me   and for my own part i was never less anxious to own up to the old country      you d hardly believe it  perhaps  unless you re familiar with savages   but these poor  misguided  ignorant creatures took me straight to their  kind of joss place to present me to the blessed old black stone there  by  this time i was beginning to sort of realise the depth of their ignorance   and directly i set eyes on this deity i took my cue  i started a baritone  howl   wow wow   very long on one note  and began waving my arms about a  lot  and then very slowly and ceremoniously turned their image over on its  side and sat down on it  i wanted to sit down badly  for diving dresses  ain t much wear in the tropics  or  to put it different like  they re a  sight too much  it took away their breath  i could see  my sitting on  their joss  but in less time than a minute they made up their minds and  were hard at work worshipping me  and i can tell you i felt a bit relieved  to see things turning out so well  in spite of the weight on my shoulders  and feet      but what made me anxious was what the chaps in the canoes might think  when they came back  if they d seen me in the boat before i went down  and  without the helmet on  for they might have been spying and hiding since  over night  they would very likely take a different view from the others   i was in a deuce of a stew about that for hours  as it seemed  until the  shindy of the arrival began      but they took it down  the whole blessed village took it down  at the  cost of sitting up stiff and stern  as much like those sitting egyptian  images one sees as i could manage  for pretty nearly twelve hours  i  should guess at least  on end  i got over it  you d hardly think what it  meant in that heat and stink  i don t think any of them dreamt of the man  inside  i was just a wonderful leathery great joss that had come up with  luck out of the water  but the fatigue  the heat  the beastly closeness   the mackintosheriness and the rum  and the fuss  they lit a stinking fire  on a kind of lava slab there was before me  and brought in a lot of gory  muck  the worst parts of what they were feasting on outside  the beasts    and burnt it all in my honour  i was getting a bit hungry  but i  understand now how gods manage to do without eating  what with the smell  of burnt offerings about them  and they brought in a lot of the stuff  they d got off the brig and  among other stuff  what i was a bit relieved  to see  the kind of pneumatic pump that was used for the compressed air  affair  and then a lot of chaps and girls came in and danced about me  something disgraceful  it s extraordinary the different ways different  people have of showing respect  if i d had a hatchet handy i d have gone  for the lot of them  they made me feel that wild  all this time i sat as  stiff as company  not knowing anything better to do  and at last  when  nightfall came  and the wattle joss house place got a bit too shadowy for  their taste  all these here savages are afraid of the dark  you know  and  i started a sort of  moo  noise  they built big bonfires outside and left  me alone in peace in the darkness of my hut  free to unscrew my windows a  bit and think things over  and feel just as bad as i liked  and lord  i  was sick      i was weak and hungry  and my mind kept on behaving like a beetle on a  pin  tremendous activity and nothing done at the end of it  come round  just where it was before  there was sorrowing for the other chaps  beastly  drunkards certainly  but not deserving such a fate  and young sanders with  the spear through his neck wouldn t go out of my mind  there was the  treasure down there in the  ocean pioneer   and how one might get it  and hide it somewhere safer  and get away and come back for it  and there  was the puzzle where to get anything to eat  i tell you i was fair  rambling  i was afraid to ask by signs for food  for fear of behaving too  human  and so there i sat and hungered until very near the dawn  then the  village got a bit quiet  and i couldn t stand it any longer  and i went  out and got some stuff like artichokes in a bowl and some sour milk  what  was left of these i put away among the other offerings  just to give them  a hint of my tastes  and in the morning they came to worship  and found me  sitting up stiff and respectable on their previous god  just as they d  left me overnight  i d got my back against the central pillar of the hut   and  practically  i was asleep  and that s how i became a god among the  heathen  false god  no doubt  and blasphemous  but one can t always pick  and choose      now  i don t want to crack myself up as a god beyond my merits  but i  must confess that while i was god to these people they was extraordinary  successful  i don t say there s anything in it  mind you  they won a  battle with another tribe  i got a lot of offerings i didn t want through  it  they had wonderful fishing  and their crop of pourra was exceptional  fine  and they counted the capture of the brig among the benefits i  brought  em  i must say i don t think that was a poor record for a  perfectly new hand  and  though perhaps you d scarcely credit it  i was  the tribal god of those beastly savages for pretty nearly four months        what else could i do  man  but i didn t wear that diving dress all the  time  i made  em rig me up a sort of holy of holies  and a deuce of a time  i had too  making them understand what it was i wanted them to do  that  indeed was the great difficulty  making them understand my wishes  i  couldn t let myself down by talking their lingo badly  even if i d been  able to speak at all  and i couldn t go flapping a lot of gestures at  them  so i drew pictures in sand and sat down beside them and hooted like  one o clock  sometimes they did the things i wanted all right  and  sometimes they did them all wrong  they was always very willing   certainly  all the while i was puzzling how i was to get the confounded  business settled  every night before the dawn i used to march out in full  rig and go off to a place where i could see the channel in which the   ocean pioneer  lay sunk  and once even  one moonlight night  i tried  to walk out to her  but the weeds and rocks and dark clean beat me  i  didn t get back till full day  and then i found all those silly niggers  out on the beach praying their sea god to return to them  i was that vexed  and tired  messing and tumbling about  and coming up and going down again   i could have punched their silly heads all round when they started  rejoicing  hanged if i like so much ceremony      and then came the missionary  that missionary   what  a guy  gummy   it was in the afternoon  and i was sitting in state in my outer temple  place  sitting on that old black stone of theirs  when he came  i heard a  row outside and jabbering  and then his voice speaking to an interpreter    they worship stocks and stones   he said  and i knew what was up  in a  flash  i had one of my windows out for comfort  and i sang out straight  away on the spur of the moment   stocks and stones   i says   you come  inside   i says   and i ll punch your blooming exeter hall of a head       there was a kind of silence and more jabbering  and in he came  bible in  hand  after the manner of them  a little sandy chap in specks and a pith  helmet  i flatter myself that me sitting there in the shadows  with my  copper head and my big goggles  struck him a bit of a heap at first    well   i says   how s the trade in scissors   for i don t hold with  missionaries      i had a lark with that missionary  he was a raw hand  and quite  outclassed by a man like me  he gasped out who was i  and i told him to  read the inscription at my feet if he wanted to know  there wasn t no  inscription  why should there be  but down he goes to read  and his  interpreter  being of course as superstitious as any of them  more so by  reason of his seeing missionary close to  took it for an act of worship  and plumped down like a shot  all my people gave a howl of triumph  and  there wasn t any more business to be done in my village after that  journey  not by the likes of him      but  of course  i was a fool to choke him off like that  if i d had any  sense i should have told him straight away of the treasure and taken him  into co  i ve no doubt he d have come into co  a child  with a few hours  to think it over  could have seen the connection between my diving dress  and the loss of the  ocean pioneer   a week after he left i went out  one morning and saw the  motherhood   the salver s ship from starr  race  towing up the channel and sounding  the whole blessed game was up   and all my trouble thrown away  gummy  how wild i felt  and guying it in  that stinking silly dress  four months      the sunburnt man s story degenerated again   think of it   he said  when  he emerged to linguistic purity once more   forty thousand pounds  worth  of gold       did the little missionary come back   i asked      oh yes  bless him  and he pledged his reputation there was a man inside  the god  and started out to see as much with tremendous ceremony  but  wasn t  he got sold again  i always did hate scenes and explanations  and  long before he came i was out of it all  going home to banya along the  coast  hiding in bushes by day  and thieving food from the villages by  night  only weapon  a spear  no clothes  no money  nothing  my face  my  fortune  as the saying is  and just a squeak of eight thousand pounds of  gold  fifth share  but the natives cut up rusty  thank goodness  because  they thought it was him had driven their luck away              xxiv       miss winchelsea s heart       miss winchelsea was going to rome  the matter had filled her mind for a  month or more  and had overflowed so abundantly into her conversation that  quite a number of people who were not going to rome  and who were not  likely to go to rome  had made it a personal grievance against her  some  indeed had attempted quite unavailingly to convince her that rome was not  nearly such a desirable place as it was reported to be  and others had  gone so far as to suggest behind her back that she was dreadfully  stuck  up  about  that rome of hers   and little lily hardhurst had told her  friend mr  binns that so far as she was concerned miss winchelsea might   go to her old rome and stop there   she   miss lily hardhurst   wouldn t grieve   and the way in which miss winchelsea put herself upon  terms of personal tenderness with horace and benvenuto cellini and raphael  and shelley and keats  if she had been shelley s widow she could not have  professed a keener interest in his grave  was a matter of universal  astonishment  her dress was a triumph of tactful discretion  sensible  but  not too  touristy    miss winchelsea had a great dread of being   touristy   and her baedeker was carried in a cover of grey to hide its  glaring red  she made a prim and pleasant little figure on the charing  cross platform  in spite of her swelling pride  when at last the great day  dawned  and she could start for rome  the day was bright  the channel  passage would be pleasant  and all the omens promised well  there was the  gayest sense of adventure in this unprecedented departure     she was going with two friends who had been fellow students with her at  the training college  nice honest girls both  though not so good at  history and literature as miss winchelsea  they both looked up to her  immensely  though physically they had to look down  and she anticipated  some pleasant times to be spent in  stirring them up  to her own pitch of  aesthetic and historical enthusiasm  they had secured seats already  and  welcomed her effusively at the carriage door  in the instant criticism of  the encounter she noted that fanny had a slightly  touristy  leather  strap  and that helen had succumbed to a serge jacket with side pockets   into which her hands were thrust  but they were much too happy with  themselves and the expedition for their friend to attempt any hint at the  moment about these things  as soon as the first ecstasies were over    fanny s enthusiasm was a little noisy and crude  and consisted mainly  in emphatic repetitions of  just  fancy   we re going to rome  my  dear   rome    they gave their attention to their fellow travellers  helen  was anxious to secure a compartment to themselves  and  in order to  discourage intruders  got out and planted herself firmly on the step  miss  winchelsea peeped out over her shoulder  and made sly little remarks about  the accumulating people on the platform  at which fanny laughed gleefully     they were travelling with one of mr  thomas gunn s parties  fourteen days  in rome for fourteen pounds  they did not belong to the personally  conducted party  of course  miss winchelsea had seen to that  but they  travelled with it because of the convenience of that arrangement  the  people were the oddest mixture  and wonderfully amusing  there was a  vociferous red faced polyglot personal conductor in a pepper and salt  suit  very long in the arms and legs and very active  he shouted  proclamations  when he wanted to speak to people he stretched out an arm  and held them until his purpose was accomplished  one hand was full of  papers  tickets  counterfoils of tourists  the people of the personally  conducted party were  it seemed  of two sorts  people the conductor wanted  and could not find  and people he did not want and who followed him in a  steadily growing tail up and down the platform  these people seemed   indeed  to think that their one chance of reaching rome lay in keeping  close to him  three little old ladies were particularly energetic in his  pursuit  and at last maddened him to the pitch of clapping them into a  carriage and daring them to emerge again  for the rest of the time  one   two  or three of their heads protruded from the window wailing inquiries  about  a little wicker work box  whenever he drew near  there was a very  stout man with a very stout wife in shiny black  there was a little old  man like an aged hostler      what  can  such people want in rome   asked miss winchelsea   what  can it mean to them   there was a very tall curate in a very small straw  hat  and a very short curate encumbered by a long camera stand  the  contrast amused fanny very much  once they heard some one calling for   snooks    i always thought that name was invented by novelists   said  miss winchelsea   fancy  snooks  i wonder which  is  mr  snooks    finally they picked out a very stout and resolute little man in a large  check suit   if he isn t snooks  he ought to be   said miss winchelsea     presently the conductor discovered helen s attempt at a corner in  carriages   room for five   he bawled with a parallel translation on his  fingers  a party of four together  mother  father  and two daughters    blundered in  all greatly excited   it s all right  ma  you let me   said  one of the daughters  hitting her mother s bonnet with a handbag she  struggled to put in the rack  miss winchelsea detested people who banged  about and called their mother  ma   a young man travelling alone followed   he was not at all  touristy  in his costume  miss winchelsea observed  his  gladstone bag was of good pleasant leather with labels reminiscent of  luxembourg and ostend  and his boots  though brown  were not vulgar  he  carried an overcoat on his arm  before these people had properly settled  in their places  came an inspection of tickets and a slamming of doors   and behold  they were gliding out of charing cross station on their way to  rome      fancy   cried fanny   we are going to rome  my dear  rome  i don t seem  to believe it  even now      miss winchelsea suppressed fanny s emotions with a little smile  and the  lady who was called  ma  explained to people in general why they had  cut  it so close  at the station  the two daughters called her  ma  several  times  toned her down in a tactless  effective way  and drove her at last  to the muttered inventory of a basket of travelling requisites  presently  she looked up   lor   she said   i didn t bring  them    both the  daughters said  oh  ma   but what  them  was did not appear     presently fanny produced hare s  walks in rome   a sort of mitigated  guide book very popular among roman visitors  and the father of the two  daughters began to examine his books of tickets minutely  apparently in a  search after english words  when he had looked at the tickets for a long  time right way up  he turned them upside down  then he produced a fountain  pen and dated them with considerable care  the young man having completed  an unostentatious survey of his fellow travellers produced a book and fell  to reading  when helen and fanny were looking out of the window at  chislehurst  the place interested fanny because the poor dear empress of  the french used to live there  miss winchelsea took the opportunity to  observe the book the young man held  it was not a guide book but a little  thin volume of poetry   bound   she glanced at his face  it seemed a  refined  pleasant face to her hasty glance  he wore a little gilt   pince nez    do you think she lives there now   said fanny  and miss  winchelsea s inspection came to an end     for the rest of the journey miss winchelsea talked little  and what she  said was as agreeable and as stamped with refinement as she could make it   her voice was always low and clear and pleasant  and she took care that on  this occasion it was particularly low and clear and pleasant  as they came  under the white cliffs the young man put his book of poetry away  and when  at last the train stopped beside the boat  he displayed a graceful  alacrity with the impedimenta of miss winchelsea and her friends  miss  winchelsea  hated nonsense   but she was pleased to see the young man  perceived at once that they were ladies  and helped them without any  violent geniality  and how nicely he showed that his civilities were to be  no excuse for further intrusions  none of her little party had been out of  england before  and they were all excited and a little nervous at the  channel passage  they stood in a little group in a good place near the  middle of the boat  the young man had taken miss winchelsea s carry all  there and had told her it was a good place  and they watched the white  shores of albion recede and quoted shakespeare and made quiet fun of their  fellow travellers in the english way     they were particularly amused at the precautions the bigger sized people  had taken against the little waves  cut lemons and flasks prevailed  one  lady lay full length in a deck chair with a handkerchief over her face   and a very broad resolute man in a bright brown  touristy  suit walked all  the way from england to france along the deck  with his legs as widely  apart as providence permitted  these were all excellent precautions  and  nobody was ill  the personally conducted party pursued the conductor about  the deck with inquiries  in a manner that suggested to helen s mind the  rather vulgar image of hens with a piece of bacon rind  until at last he  went into hiding below  and the young man with the thin volume of poetry  stood at the stern watching england receding  looking rather lonely and  sad to miss winchelsea s eye     and then came calais and tumultuous novelties  and the young man had not  forgotten miss winchelsea s hold all and the other little things  all  three girls  though they had passed government examinations in french to  any extent  were stricken with a dumb shame of their accents  and the  young man was very useful  and he did not intrude  he put them in a  comfortable carriage and raised his hat and went away  miss winchelsea  thanked him in her best manner  a pleasing  cultivated manner  and fanny  said he was  nice  almost before he was out of earshot   i wonder what he  can be   said helen   he s going to italy  because i noticed green tickets  in his book   miss winchelsea almost told them of the poetry  and decided  not to do so  and presently the carriage windows seized hold upon them and  the young man was forgotten  it made them feel that they were doing an  educated sort of thing to travel through a country whose commonest  advertisements were in idiomatic french  and miss winchelsea made  unpatriotic comparisons because there were weedy little sign board  advertisements by the rail side instead of the broad hoardings that deface  the landscape in our land  but the north of france is really uninteresting  country  and after a time fanny reverted to hare s  walks   and helen  initiated lunch  miss winchelsea awoke out of a happy reverie  she had  been trying to realise  she said  that she was actually going to rome  but  she perceived at helen s suggestion that she was hungry  and they lunched  out of their baskets very cheerfully  in the afternoon they were tired and  silent until helen made tea  miss winchelsea might have dozed  only she  knew fanny slept with her mouth open  and as their fellow passengers were  two rather nice  critical looking ladies of uncertain age  who knew french  well enough to talk it  she employed herself in keeping fanny awake  the  rhythm of the train became insistent  and the streaming landscape outside  became at last quite painful to the eye  they were already dreadfully  tired of travelling before their night s stoppage came     the stoppage for the night was brightened by the appearance of the young  man  and his manners were all that could be desired and his french quite  serviceable     his coupons availed for the same hotel as theirs  and by chance  as it  seemed  he sat next miss winchelsea at the  table d hote   in spite  of her enthusiasm for rome  she had thought out some such possibility very  thoroughly  and when he ventured to make a remark upon the tediousness of  travelling  he let the soup and fish go by before he did this  she did not  simply assent to his proposition  but responded with another  they were  soon comparing their journeys  and helen and fanny were cruelly overlooked  in the conversation   it was to be the same journey  they found  one day  for the galleries at florence   from what i hear   said the young man   it  is barely enough    and the rest at rome  he talked of rome very  pleasantly  he was evidently quite well read  and he quoted horace about  soracte  miss winchelsea had  done  that book of horace for her  matriculation  and was delighted to cap his quotation  it gave a sort of  tone to things  this incident  a touch of refinement to mere chatting   fanny expressed a few emotions  and helen interpolated a few sensible  remarks  but the bulk of the talk on the girls  side naturally fell to  miss winchelsea     before they reached rome this young man was tacitly of their party  they  did not know his name nor what he was  but it seemed he taught  and miss  winchelsea had a shrewd idea he was an extension lecturer  at any rate he  was something of that sort  something gentlemanly and refined without  being opulent and impossible  she tried once or twice to ascertain whether  he came from oxford or cambridge  but he missed her timid opportunities   she tried to get him to make remarks about those places to see if he would  say  come up  to them instead of  go down    she knew that was how you  told a  varsity man  he used the word   varsity   not university  in quite  the proper way     they saw as much of mr  ruskin s florence as the brief time permitted  he  met them in the pitti gallery and went round with them  chatting brightly   and evidently very grateful for their recognition  he knew a great deal  about art  and all four enjoyed the morning immensely  it was fine to go  round recognising old favourites and finding new beauties  especially  while so many people fumbled helplessly with baedeker  nor was he a bit of  a prig  miss winchelsea said  and indeed she detested prigs  he had a  distinct undertone of humour  and was funny  for example  without being  vulgar  at the expense of the quaint work of beato angelico  he had a  grave seriousness beneath it all  and was quick to seize the moral lessons  of the pictures  fanny went softly among these masterpieces  she admitted   she knew so little about them   and she confessed that to her they were   all beautiful   fanny s  beautiful  inclined to be a little monotonous   miss winchelsea thought  she had been quite glad when the last sunny alp  had vanished  because of the staccato of fanny s admiration  helen said  little  but miss winchelsea had found her a trifle wanting on the  aesthetic side in the old days and was not surprised  sometimes she  laughed at the young man s hesitating  delicate jests and sometimes she  didn t  and sometimes she seemed quite lost to the art about them in the  contemplation of the dresses of the other visitors     at rome the young man was with them intermittently  a rather  touristy   friend of his took him away at times  he complained comically to miss  winchelsea   i have only two short weeks in rome   he said   and my friend  leonard wants to spend a whole day at tivoli looking at a waterfall       what is your friend leonard   asked miss winchelsea abruptly      he s the most enthusiastic pedestrian i ever met   the young man  replied  amusingly  but a little unsatisfactorily  miss winchelsea  thought     they had some glorious times  and fanny could not think what they would  have done without him  miss winchelsea s interest and fanny s enormous  capacity for admiration were insatiable  they never flagged  through  pictures and sculpture galleries  immense crowded churches  ruins and  museums  judas trees and prickly pears  wine carts and palaces  they  admired their way unflinchingly  they never saw a stone pine or a  eucalyptus but they named and admired it  they never glimpsed soracte but  they exclaimed  their common ways were made wonderful by imaginative play    here caesar may have walked   they would say   raphael may have seen  soracte from this very point   they happened on the tomb of bibulus   old  bibulus   said the young man   the oldest monument of republican rome    said miss winchelsea      i m dreadfully stupid   said fanny   but who  was  bibulus      there was a curious little pause      wasn t he the person who built the wall   said helen     the young man glanced quickly at her and laughed   that was balbus   he  said  helen reddened  but neither he nor miss winchelsea threw any light  upon fanny s ignorance about bibulus     helen was more taciturn than the other three  but then she was always  taciturn  and usually she took care of the tram tickets and things like  that  or kept her eye on them if the young man took them  and told him  where they were when he wanted them  glorious times they had  these young  people  in that pale brown cleanly city of memories that was once the  world  their only sorrow was the shortness of the time  they said indeed  that the electric trams and the     buildings  and that criminal  advertisement that glares upon the forum  outraged their aesthetic  feelings unspeakably  but that was only part of the fun  and indeed rome  is such a wonderful place that it made miss winchelsea forget some of her  most carefully prepared enthusiasms at times  and helen  taken unawares   would suddenly admit the beauty of unexpected things  yet fanny and helen  would have liked a shop window or so in the english quarter if miss  winchelsea s uncompromising hostility to all other english visitors had  not rendered that district impossible     the intellectual and aesthetic fellowship of miss winchelsea and the  scholarly young man passed insensibly towards a deeper feeling  the  exuberant fanny did her best to keep pace with their recondite admiration  by playing her  beautiful  with vigour  and saying  oh   let s  go    with enormous appetite whenever a new place of interest was mentioned  but  helen developed a certain want of sympathy towards the end that  disappointed miss winchelsea a little  she refused to see  anything  in  the face of beatrice cenci  shelley s beatrice cenci   in the barberini  gallery  and one day  when they were deploring the electric trams  she  said rather snappishly that  people must get about somehow  and it s  better than torturing horses up these horrid little hills   she spoke of  the seven hills of rome as  horrid little hills       and the day they went on the palatine  though miss winchelsea did not know  of this  she remarked suddenly to fanny   don t hurry like that  my dear    they  don t want us to overtake them  and we don t say the right  things for them when we  do  get near       i wasn t trying to overtake them   said fanny  slackening her excessive  pace   i wasn t indeed   and for a minute she was short of breath     but miss winchelsea had come upon happiness  it was only when she came to  look back across an intervening tragedy that she quite realised how happy  she had been pacing among the cypress shadowed ruins  and exchanging the  very highest class of information the human mind can possess  the most  refined impressions it is possible to convey  insensibly emotion crept  into their intercourse  sunning itself openly and pleasantly at last when  helen s modernity was not too near  insensibly their interest drifted from  the wonderful associations about them to their more intimate and personal  feelings  in a tentative way information was supplied  she spoke  allusively of her school  of her examination successes  of her gladness  that the days of  cram  were over  he made it quite clear that he also was  a teacher  they spoke of the greatness of their calling  of the necessity  of sympathy to face its irksome details  of a certain loneliness they  sometimes felt     that was in the colosseum  and it was as far as they got that day  because  helen returned with fanny  she had taken her into the upper galleries  yet  the private dreams of miss winchelsea  already vivid and concrete enough   became now realistic in the highest degree  she figured that pleasant  young man lecturing in the most edifying way to his students  herself  modestly prominent as his intellectual mate and helper  she figured a  refined little home  with two bureaus  with white shelves of high class  books  and autotypes of the pictures of rossetti and burne jones  with  morris s wall papers and flowers in pots of beaten copper  indeed she  figured many things  on the pincio the two had a few precious moments  together  while helen marched fanny off to see the  muro torto   and  he spoke at once plainly  he said he hoped their friendship was only  beginning  that he already found her company very precious to him  that  indeed it was more than that     he became nervous  thrusting at his glasses with trembling fingers as  though he fancied his emotions made them unstable   i should of course    he said   tell you things about myself  i know it is rather unusual my  speaking to you like this  only our meeting has been so accidental  or  providential  and i am snatching at things  i came to rome expecting a  lonely tour     and i have been so very happy  so very happy  quite  recently i have found myself in a position  i have dared to think       and         he glanced over his shoulder and stopped  he said  demn   quite  distinctly  and she did not condemn him for that manly lapse into  profanity  she looked and saw his friend leonard advancing  he drew  nearer  he raised his hat to miss winchelsea  and his smile was almost a  grin   i ve been looking for you everywhere  snooks   he said   you  promised to be on the piazza steps half an hour ago      snooks  the name struck miss winchelsea like a blow in the face  she did  not hear his reply  she thought afterwards that leonard must have  considered her the vaguest minded person  to this day she is not sure  whether she was introduced to leonard or not  nor what she said to him  a  sort of mental paralysis was upon her  of all offensive surnames  snooks     helen and fanny were returning  there were civilities  and the young men  were receding  by a great effort she controlled herself to face the  inquiring eyes of her friends  all that afternoon she lived the life of a  heroine under the indescribable outrage of that name  chatting  observing   with  snooks  gnawing at her heart  from the moment that it first rang  upon her ears  the dream of her happiness was prostrate in the dust  all  the refinement she had figured was ruined and defaced by that cognomen s  unavoidable vulgarity     what was that refined little home to her now  spite of autotypes  morris  papers  and bureaus  athwart it in letters of fire ran an incredible  inscription   mrs  snooks   that may seem a little thing to the reader   but consider the delicate refinement of miss winchelsea s mind  be as  refined as you can and then think of writing yourself down    snooks   she  conceived herself being addressed as mrs  snooks by all the people she  liked least  conceived the patronymic touched with a vague quality of  insult  she figured a card of grey and silver bearing  winchelsea   triumphantly effaced by an arrow  cupid s arrow  in favour of  snooks    degrading confession of feminine weakness  she imagined the terrible  rejoicings of certain girl friends  of certain grocer cousins from whom  her growing refinement had long since estranged her  how they would make  it sprawl across the envelope that would bring their sarcastic  congratulations  would even his pleasant company compensate her for that    it is impossible   she muttered   impossible   snooks       she was sorry for him  but not so sorry as she was for herself  for him  she had a touch of indignation  to be so nice  so refined  while all the  time he was  snooks   to hide under a pretentious gentility of demeanour  the badge sinister of his surname seemed a sort of treachery  to put it in  the language of sentimental science she felt he had  led her on      there were  of course  moments of terrible vacillation  a period even when  something almost like passion bid her throw refinement to the winds  and  there was something in her  an unexpurgated vestige of vulgarity that made  a strenuous attempt at proving that snooks was not so very bad a name  after all  any hovering hesitation flew before fanny s manner  when fanny  came with an air of catastrophe to tell that she also knew the horror   fanny s voice fell to a whisper when she said  snooks   miss  winchelsea would not give him any answer when at last  in the borghese   she could have a minute with him  but she promised him a note     she handed him that note in the little book of poetry he had lent her  the  little book that had first drawn them together  her refusal was ambiguous   allusive  she could no more tell him why she rejected him than she could  have told a cripple of his hump  he too must feel something of the  unspeakable quality of his name  indeed he had avoided a dozen chances of  telling it  she now perceived  so she spoke of  obstacles she could not  reveal    reasons why the thing he spoke of was impossible   she addressed  the note with a shiver   e k  snooks      things were worse than she had dreaded  he asked her to explain  how   could  she explain  those last two days in rome were dreadful  she  was haunted by his air of astonished perplexity  she knew she had given  him intimate hopes  she had not the courage to examine her mind thoroughly  for the extent of her encouragement  she knew he must think her the most  changeable of beings  now that she was in full retreat  she would not even  perceive his hints of a possible correspondence  but in that matter he did  a thing that seemed to her at once delicate and romantic  he made a  go between of fanny  fanny could not keep the secret  and came and told  her that night under a transparent pretext of needed advice   mr  snooks    said fanny   wants to write to me  fancy  i had no idea  but should i let  him   they talked it over long and earnestly  and miss winchelsea was  careful to keep the veil over her heart  she was already repenting his  disregarded hints  why should she not hear of him sometimes  painful  though his name must be to her  miss winchelsea decided it might be  permitted  and fanny kissed her good night with unusual emotion  after she  had gone miss winchelsea sat for a long time at the window of her little  room  it was moonlight  and down the street a man sang  santa lucia  with  almost heart dissolving tenderness    she sat very still     she breathed a word very softly to herself  the word was   snooks     then she got up with a profound sigh  and went to bed  the next morning he  said to her meaningly   i shall hear of you through your friend      mr  snooks saw them off from rome with that pathetic interrogative  perplexity still on his face  and if it had not been for helen he would  have retained miss winchelsea s hold all in his hand as a sort of  encyclopaedic keepsake  on their way back to england miss winchelsea on  six separate occasions made fanny promise to write to her the longest of  long letters  fanny  it seemed  would be quite near mr  snooks  her new  school  she was always going to new schools  would be only five miles from  steely bank  and it was in the steely bank polytechnic  and one or two  first class schools  that mr  snooks did his teaching  he might even see  her at times  they could not talk much of him  she and fanny always spoke  of  him   never of mr  snooks  because helen was apt to say unsympathetic  things about him  her nature had coarsened very much  miss winchelsea  perceived  since the old training college days  she had become hard and  cynical  she thought he had a weak face  mistaking refinement for weakness  as people of her stamp are apt to do  and when she heard his name was  snooks  she said she had expected something of the sort  miss winchelsea  was careful to spare her own feelings after that  but fanny was less  circumspect     the girls parted in london  and miss winchelsea returned  with a new  interest in life  to the girls  high school in which she had been an  increasingly valuable assistant for the last three years  her new interest  in life was fanny as a correspondent  and to give her a lead she wrote her  a lengthy descriptive letter within a fortnight of her return  fanny  answered  very disappointingly  fanny indeed had no literary gift  but it  was new to miss winchelsea to find herself deploring the want of gifts in  a friend  that letter was even criticised aloud in the safe solitude of  miss winchelsea s study  and her criticism  spoken with great bitterness   was  twaddle   it was full of just the things miss winchelsea s letter had  been full of  particulars of the school  and of mr  snooks  only this  much   i have had a letter from mr  snooks  and he has been over to see me  on two saturday afternoons running  he talked about rome and you  we both  talked about you  your ears must have burnt  my dear        miss winchelsea repressed a desire to demand more explicit information   and wrote the sweetest  long letter again   tell me all about yourself   dear  that journey has quite refreshed our ancient friendship  and i do so  want to keep in touch with you   about mr  snooks she simply wrote on the  fifth page that she was glad fanny had seen him  and that if he   should  ask after her  she was to be remembered to him  very  kindly   underlined   and fanny replied most obtusely in the key of  that  ancient friendship   reminding miss winchelsea of a dozen foolish  things of those old schoolgirl days at the training college  and saying  not a word about mr  snooks     for nearly a week miss winchelsea was so angry at the failure of fanny as  a go between that she could not write to her  and then she wrote less  effusively  and in her letter she asked point blank   have you seen mr   snooks   fanny s letter was unexpectedly satisfactory   i  have  seen  mr  snooks   she wrote  and having once named him she kept on about him   it was all snooks  snooks this and snooks that  he was to give a public  lecture  said fanny  among other things  yet miss winchelsea  after the  first glow of gratification  still found this letter a little  unsatisfactory  fanny did not report mr  snooks as saying anything about  miss winchelsea  nor as looking a little white and worn  as he ought to  have been doing  and behold  before she had replied  came a second letter  from fanny on the same theme  quite a gushing letter  and covering six  sheets with her loose feminine hand     and about this second letter was a rather odd little thing that miss  winchelsea only noticed as she re read it the third time  fanny s natural  femininity had prevailed even against the round and clear traditions of  the training college  she was one of those she creatures born to  make all her  m  s and  n  s and  u  s and  r  s and  e  s  alike  and to leave her  o  s and  a  s open and her  i  s  undotted  so that it was only after an elaborate comparison of word with  word that miss winchelsea felt assured mr  snooks was not really  mr   snooks  at all  in fanny s first letter of gush he was mr   snooks   in  her second the spelling was changed to mr   senoks   miss winchelsea s  hand positively trembled as she turned the sheet over  it meant so much to  her  for it had already begun to seem to her that even the name of mrs   snooks might be avoided at too great a price  and suddenly  this  possibility  she turned over the six sheets  all dappled with that  critical name  and everywhere the first letter had the form of an   e   for a time she walked the room with a hand pressed upon her  heart     she spent a whole day pondering this change  weighing a letter of inquiry  that should be at once discreet and effectual  weighing  too  what action  she should take after the answer came  she was resolved that if this  altered spelling was anything more than a quaint fancy of fanny s  she  would write forthwith to mr  snooks  she had now reached a stage when the  minor refinements of behaviour disappear  her excuse remained uninvented   but she had the subject of her letter clear in her mind  even to the hint  that  circumstances in my life have changed very greatly since we talked  together   but she never gave that hint  there came a third letter from  that fitful correspondent fanny  the first line proclaimed her  the  happiest girl alive      miss winchelsea crushed the letter in her hand  the rest unread  and sat  with her face suddenly very still  she had received it just before morning  school  and had opened it when the junior mathematicians were well under  way  presently she resumed reading with an appearance of great calm  but  after the first sheet she went on reading the third without discovering  the error    told him frankly i did not like his name   the third sheet  began   he told me he did not like it himself  you know that sort of  sudden  frank way he has   miss winchelsea did know   so i said   couldn t  you change it   he didn t see it at first  well  you know  dear  he had  told me what it really meant  it means sevenoaks  only it has got down to  snooks  both snooks and noaks  dreadfully vulgar surnames though they be   are really worn forms of sevenoaks  so i said  even i have my bright ideas  at times   if it got down from sevenoaks to snooks  why not get it back  from snooks to sevenoaks   and the long and the short of it is  dear  he  couldn t refuse me  and he changed his spelling there and then to senoks  for the bills of the new lecture  and afterwards  when we are married  we  shall put in the apostrophe and make it se noks  wasn t it kind of him to  mind that fancy of mine  when many men would have taken offence  but it is  just like him all over  he is as kind as he is clever  because he knew as  well as i did that i would have had him in spite of it  had he been ten  times snooks  but he did it all the same      the class was startled by the sound of paper being viciously torn  and  looked up to see miss winchelsea white in the face and with some very  small pieces of paper clenched in one hand  for a few seconds they stared  at her stare  and then her expression changed back to a more familiar one    has any one finished number three   she asked in an even tone  she  remained calm after that  but impositions ruled high that day  and she  spent two laborious evenings writing letters of various sorts to fanny   before she found a decent congratulatory vein  her reason struggled  hopelessly against the persuasion that fanny had behaved in an exceedingly  treacherous manner     one may be extremely refined and still capable of a very sore heart   certainly miss winchelsea s heart was very sore  she had moods of sexual  hostility  in which she generalised uncharitably about mankind   he forgot  himself with me   she said   but fanny is pink and pretty and soft and a  fool  a very excellent match for a man   and by way of a wedding present  she sent fanny a gracefully bound volume of poetry by george meredith  and  fanny wrote back a grossly happy letter to say that it was   all   beautiful   miss winchelsea hoped that some day mr  senoks might take up  that slim book and think for a moment of the donor  fanny wrote several  times before and about her marriage  pursuing that fond legend of their   ancient friendship   and giving her happiness in the fullest detail  and  miss winchelsea wrote to helen for the first time after the roman journey   saying nothing about the marriage  but expressing very cordial feelings     they had been in rome at easter  and fanny was married in the august  vacation  she wrote a garrulous letter to miss winchelsea  describing her  home coming and the astonishing arrangements of their  teeny  weeny   little house  mr  se noks was now beginning to assume a refinement in miss  winchelsea s memory out of all proportion to the facts of the case  and  she tried in vain to imagine his cultured greatness in a  teeny weeny   little house   am busy enamelling a cosy corner   said fanny  sprawling to  the end of her third sheet   so excuse more   miss winchelsea answered in  her best style  gently poking fun at fanny s arrangements  and hoping  intensely that mr  se noks might see the letter  only this hope enabled  her to write at all  answering not only that letter but one in november  and one at christmas     the two latter communications contained urgent invitations for her to come  to steely bank on a visit during the christmas holidays  she tried to  think that  he  had told her to ask that  but it was too much like  fanny s opulent good nature  she could not but believe that he must be  sick of his blunder by this time  and she had more than a hope that he  would presently write her a letter beginning  dear friend   something  subtly tragic in the separation was a great support to her  a sad  misunderstanding  to have been jilted would have been intolerable  but he  never wrote that letter beginning  dear friend      for two years miss winchelsea could not go to see her friends  in spite of  the reiterated invitations of mrs  sevenoaks  it became full sevenoaks in  the second year  then one day near the easter rest she felt lonely and  without a soul to understand her in the world  and her mind ran once more  on what is called platonic friendship  fanny was clearly happy and busy in  her new sphere of domesticity  but no doubt  he  had his lonely  hours  did he ever think of those days in rome  gone now beyond recalling   no one had understood her as he had done  no one in all the world  it  would be a sort of melancholy pleasure to talk to him again  and what harm  could it do  why should she deny herself  that night she wrote a sonnet   all but the last two lines of the octave  which would not come  and the  next day she composed a graceful little note to tell fanny she was coming  down     and so she saw him again     even at the first encounter it was evident he had changed  he seemed  stouter and less nervous  and it speedily appeared that his conversation  had already lost much of its old delicacy  there even seemed a  justification for helen s description of weakness in his face  in certain  lights it  was  weak  he seemed busy and preoccupied about his  affairs  and almost under the impression that miss winchelsea had come for  the sake of fanny  he discussed his dinner with fanny in an intelligent  way  they only had one good long talk together  and that came to nothing   he did not refer to rome  and spent some time abusing a man who had stolen  an idea he had had for a text book  it did not seem a very wonderful idea  to miss winchelsea  she discovered he had forgotten the names of more than  half the painters whose work they had rejoiced over in florence     it was a sadly disappointing week  and miss winchelsea was glad when it  came to an end  under various excuses she avoided visiting them again   after a time the visitor s room was occupied by their two little boys  and  fanny s invitations ceased  the intimacy of her letters had long since  faded away             xxv       a dream of armageddon       the man with the white face entered the carriage at rugby  he moved slowly  in spite of the urgency of his porter  and even while he was still on the  platform i noted how ill he seemed  he dropped into the corner over  against me with a sigh  made an incomplete attempt to arrange his  travelling shawl  and became motionless  with his eyes staring vacantly   presently he was moved by a sense of my observation  looked up at me  and  put out a spiritless hand for his newspaper  then he glanced again in my  direction     i feigned to read  i feared i had unwittingly embarrassed him  and in a  moment i was surprised to find him speaking      i beg your pardon   said i      that book   he repeated  pointing a lean finger   is about dreams       obviously   i answered  for it was fortnum roscoe s  dream states    and the title was on the cover     he hung silent for a space as if he sought words   yes   he said  at last    but they tell you nothing      i did not catch his meaning for a second      they don t know   he added     i looked a little more attentively at his face      there are dreams   he said   and dreams   that sort of proposition i  never dispute   i suppose      he hesitated   do you ever dream  i mean  vividly       i dream very little   i answered   i doubt if i have three vivid dreams  in a year       ah   he said  and seemed for a moment to collect his thoughts      your dreams don t mix with your memories   he asked abruptly   you don t  find yourself in doubt  did this happen or did it not       hardly ever  except just for a momentary hesitation now and then  i  suppose few people do       does  he  say      he indicated the book      says it happens at times and gives the usual explanation about intensity  of impression and the like to account for its not happening as a rule  i  suppose you know something of these theories          very little  except that they are wrong      his emaciated hand played with the strap of the window for a time  i  prepared to resume reading  and that seemed to precipitate his next  remark  he leant forward almost as though he would touch me      isn t there something called consecutive dreaming  that goes on night  after night       i believe there is  there are cases given in most books on mental  trouble       mental trouble  yes  i daresay there are  it s the right place for them   but what i mean      he looked at his bony knuckles   is that sort of  thing always dreaming   is  it dreaming  or is it something else   mightn t it be something else      i should have snubbed his persistent conversation but for the drawn  anxiety of his face  i remember now the look of his faded eyes and the  lids red stained  perhaps you know that look      i m not just arguing about a matter of opinion   he said   the thing s  killing me       dreams       if you call them dreams  night after night  vivid   so vivid     this      he indicated the landscape that went streaming by the window   seems  unreal in comparison  i can scarcely remember who i am  what business i am  on         he paused   even now        the dream is always the same  do you mean   i asked      it s over       you mean       i died       died       smashed and killed  and now so much of me as that dream was is dead  dead  for ever  i dreamt i was another man  you know  living in a different part  of the world and in a different time  i dreamt that night after night   night after night i woke into that other life  fresh scenes and fresh  happenings  until i came upon the last        when you died       when i died       and since then        no   he said   thank god  that was the end of the dream        it was clear i was in for this dream  and  after all  i had an hour before  me  the light was fading fast  and fortnum roscoe has a dreary way with  him   living in a different time   i said   do you mean in some different  age       yes       past       no  to come  to come       the year three thousand  for example       i don t know what year it was  i did when i was asleep  when i was  dreaming  that is  but not now  not now that i am awake  there s a lot of  things i have forgotten since i woke out of these dreams  though i knew  them at the time when i was  i suppose it was dreaming  they called the  year differently from our way of calling the year    what  did  they  call it   he put his hand to his forehead   no   said he   i forget      he sat smiling weakly  for a moment i feared he did not mean to tell me  his dream  as a rule  i hate people who tell their dreams  but this struck  me differently  i proffered assistance even   it began      i suggested      it was vivid from the first  i seemed to wake up in it suddenly  and it s  curious that in these dreams i am speaking of i never remembered this life  i am living now  it seemed as if the dream life was enough while it  lasted  perhaps    but i will tell you how i find myself when i do my  best to recall it all  i don t remember anything clearly until i found  myself sitting in a sort of loggia looking out over the sea  i had been  dozing  and suddenly i woke up  fresh and vivid  not a bit dreamlike    because the girl had stopped fanning me       the girl       yes  the girl  you must not interrupt or you will put me out      he stopped abruptly   you won t think i m mad   he said      no   i answered   you ve been dreaming  tell me your dream       i woke up  i say  because the girl had stopped fanning me  i was not  surprised to find myself there or anything of that sort  you understand  i  did not feel i had fallen into it suddenly  i simply took it up at that  point  whatever memory i had of  this  life  this nineteenth century  life  faded as i woke  vanished like a dream  i knew all about myself   knew that my name was no longer cooper but hedon  and all about my  position in the world  i ve forgotten a lot since i woke  there s a want  of connection  but it was all quite clear and matter of fact then      he hesitated again  gripping the window strap  putting his face forward   and looking up to me appealingly      this seems bosh to you       no  no   i cried   go on  tell me what this loggia was like       it was not really a loggia  i don t know what to call it  it faced south   it was small  it was all in shadow except the semicircle above the balcony  that showed the sky and sea and the corner where the girl stood  i was on  a couch  it was a metal couch with light striped cushions  and the girl  was leaning over the balcony with her back to me  the light of the sunrise  fell on her ear and cheek  her pretty white neck and the little curls that  nestled there  and her white shoulder were in the sun  and all the grace  of her body was in the cool blue shadow  she was dressed  how can i  describe it  it was easy and flowing  and altogether there she stood  so  that it came to me how beautiful and desirable she was  as though i had  never seen her before  and when at last i sighed and raised myself upon my  arm she turned her face to me       he stopped      i have lived three and fifty years in this world  i have had mother   sisters  friends  wife and daughters  all their faces  the play of their  faces  i know  but the face of this girl  it is much more real to me  i  can bring it back into memory so that i see it again  i could draw it or  paint it  and after all       he stopped  but i said nothing      the face of a dream  the face of a dream  she was beautiful  not that  beauty which is terrible  cold  and worshipful  like the beauty of a  saint  nor that beauty that stirs fierce passions  but a sort of  radiation  sweet lips that softened into smiles  and grave gray eyes  and  she moved gracefully  she seemed to have part with all pleasant and  gracious things       he stopped  and his face was downcast and hidden  then he looked up at me  and went on  making no further attempt to disguise his absolute belief in  the reality of his story      you see  i had thrown up my plans and ambitions  thrown up all i had ever  worked for or desired  for her sake  i had been a master man away there in  the north  with influence and property and a great reputation  but none of  it had seemed worth having beside her  i had come to the place  this city  of sunny pleasures  with her  and left all those things to wreck and ruin  just to save a remnant at least of my life  while i had been in love with  her before i knew that she had any care for me  before i had imagined that  she would dare  that we should dare  all my life had seemed vain and  hollow  dust and ashes  it  was  dust and ashes  night after night   and through the long days i had longed and desired  my soul had beaten  against the thing forbidden      but it is impossible for one man to tell another just these things  it s  emotion  it s a tint  a light that comes and goes  only while it s there   everything changes  everything  the thing is i came away and left them in  their crisis to do what they could       left whom   i asked  puzzled      the people up in the north there  you see  in this dream  anyhow  i had  been a big man  the sort of man men come to trust in  to group themselves  about  millions of men who had never seen me were ready to do things and  risk things because of their confidence in me  i had been playing that  game for years  that big laborious game  that vague  monstrous political  game amidst intrigues and betrayals  speech and agitation  it was a vast  weltering world  and at last i had a sort of leadership against the gang    you know it was called the gang  a sort of compromise of scoundrelly  projects and base ambitions and vast public emotional stupidities and  catch words  the gang that kept the world noisy and blind year by year   and all the while that it was drifting  drifting towards infinite  disaster  but i can t expect you to understand the shades and  complications of the year  the year something or other ahead  i had it  all  down to the smallest details  in my dream  i suppose i had been  dreaming of it before i awoke  and the fading outline of some queer new  development i had imagined still hung about me as i rubbed my eyes  it was  some grubby affair that made me thank god for the sunlight  i sat up on  the couch and remained looking at the woman  and rejoicing  rejoicing that  i had come away out of all that tumult and folly and violence before it  was too late  after all  i thought  this is life  love and beauty  desire  and delight  are they not worth all those dismal struggles for vague   gigantic ends  and i blamed myself for having ever sought to be a leader  when i might have given my days to love  but then  thought i  if i had not  spent my early days sternly and austerely  i might have wasted myself upon  vain and worthless women  and at the thought all my being went out in love  and tenderness to my dear mistress  my dear lady  who had come at last and  compelled me  compelled me by her invincible charm for me  to lay that  life aside       you are worth it   i said  speaking without intending her to hear   you  are worth it  my dearest one  worth pride and praise and all things  love   to have  you  is worth them all together   and at the murmur of my  voice she turned about       come and see   she cried  i can hear her now  come and see the sunrise  upon monte solaro       i remember how i sprang to my feet and joined her at the balcony  she put  a white hand upon my shoulder and pointed towards great masses of  limestone flushing  as it were  into life  i looked  but first i noted the  sunlight on her face caressing the lines of her cheeks and neck  how can i  describe to you the scene we had before us  we were at capri          i have been there   i said   i have clambered up monte solaro and drunk   vero capri   muddy stuff like cider  at the summit       ah   said the man with the white face   then perhaps you can tell me  you  will know if this was indeed capri  for in this life i have never been  there  let me describe it  we were in a little room  one of a vast  multitude of little rooms  very cool and sunny  hollowed out of the  limestone of a sort of cape  very high above the sea  the whole island   you know  was one enormous hotel  complex beyond explaining  and on the  other side there were miles of floating hotels  and huge floating stages  to which the flying machines came  they called it a pleasure city  of  course  there was none of that in your time  rather  i should say    is  none of that  now   of course  now   yes      well  this room of ours was at the extremity of the cape  so that one  could see east and west  eastward was a great cliff  a thousand feet high  perhaps  coldly grey except for one bright edge of gold  and beyond it the  isle of the sirens  and a falling coast that faded and passed into the hot  sunrise  and when one turned to the west  distinct and near was a little  bay  a little beach still in shadow  and out of that shadow rose solaro   straight and tall  flushed and golden crested  like a beauty throned  and  the white moon was floating behind her in the sky  and before us from east  to west stretched the many tinted sea all dotted with little  sailing boats      to the eastward  of course  these little boats were gray and very minute  and clear  but to the westward they were little boats of gold  shining  gold  almost like little flames  and just below us was a rock with an arch  worn through it  the blue sea water broke to green and foam all round the  rock  and a galley came gliding out of the arch       i know that rock   i said   i was nearly drowned there  it is called the  faraglioni        faraglioni   yes   she  called it that   answered the man with  the white face   there was some story  but that         he put his hand to his forehead again   no   he said   i forget that  story      well  that is the first thing i remember  the first dream i had  that  little shaded room and the beautiful air and sky and that dear lady of  mine  with her shining arms and her graceful robe  and how we sat and  talked in half whispers to one another  we talked in whispers  not because  there was any one to hear  but because there was still such a freshness of  mind between us that our thoughts were a little frightened  i think  to  find themselves at last in words  and so they went softly      presently we were hungry  and we went from our apartment  going by a  strange passage with a moving floor  until we came to the great  breakfast room  there was a fountain and music  a pleasant and joyful  place it was  with its sunlight and splashing  and the murmur of plucked  strings  and we sat and ate and smiled at one another  and i would not  heed a man who was watching me from a table near by      and afterwards we went on to the dancing hall  but i cannot describe  that hall  the place was enormous  larger than any building you have ever  seen  and in one place there was the old gate of capri  caught into the  wall of a gallery high overhead  light girders  stems and threads of gold   burst from the pillars like fountains  streamed like an aurora across the  roof and interlaced  like  like conjuring tricks  all about the great  circle for the dancers there were beautiful figures  strange dragons  and  intricate and wonderful grotesques bearing lights  the place was inundated  with artificial light that shamed the newborn day  and as we went through  the throng the people turned about and looked at us  for all through the  world my name and face were known  and how i had suddenly thrown up pride   and struggle to come to this place  and they looked also at the lady  beside me  though half the story of how at last she had come to me was  unknown or mistold  and few of the men who were there  i know  but judged  me a happy man  in spite of all the shame and dishonour that had come upon  my name      the air was full of music  full of harmonious scents  full of the rhythm  of beautiful motions  thousands of beautiful people swarmed about the  hall  crowded the galleries  sat in a myriad recesses  they were dressed  in splendid colours and crowned with flowers  thousands danced about the  great circle beneath the white images of the ancient gods  and glorious  processions of youths and maidens came and went  we two danced  not the  dreary monotonies of your days  of this time  i mean  but dances that were  beautiful  intoxicating  and even now i can see my lady dancing  dancing  joyously  she danced  you know  with a serious face  she danced with a  serious dignity  and yet she was smiling at me and caressing me  smiling  and caressing with her eyes      the music was different   he murmured   it went  i cannot describe it   but it was infinitely richer and more varied than any music that has ever  come to me awake      and then  it was when we had done dancing  a man came to speak to me  he  was a lean  resolute man  very soberly clad for that place  and already i  had marked his face watching me in the breakfasting hall  and afterwards  as we went along the passage i had avoided his eye  but now  as we sat in  a little alcove smiling at the pleasure of all the people who went to and  fro across the shining floor  he came and touched me  and spoke to me so  that i was forced to listen  and he asked that he might speak to me for a  little time apart       no   i said   i have no secrets from this lady  what do you want to tell  me       he said it was a trivial matter  or at least a dry matter  for a lady to  hear       perhaps for me to hear   said i      he glanced at her  as though almost he would appeal to her  then he asked  me suddenly if i  had heard of a great and avenging declaration that  gresham had made  now  gresham had always before been the man next to  myself in the leadership of that great party in the north  he was a  forcible  hard  and tactless man  and only i had been able to control and  soften him  it was on his account even more than my own  i think  that the  others had been so dismayed at my retreat  so this question about what he  had done re awakened my old interest in the life i had put aside just for  a moment       i have taken no heed of any news for many days   i said   what has  gresham been saying       and with that the man began  nothing loth  and i must confess ever  i was  struck by gresham s reckless folly in the wild and threatening words he  had used  and this messenger they had sent to me not only told me of  gresham s speech  but went on to ask counsel and to point out what need  they had of me  while he talked  my lady sat a little forward and watched  his face and mine      my old habits of scheming and organising reasserted themselves  i could  even see myself suddenly returning to the north  and all the dramatic  effect of it  all that this man said witnessed to the disorder of the  party indeed  but not to its damage  i should go back stronger than i had  come  and then i thought of my lady  you see  how can i tell you  there  were certain peculiarities of our relationship  as things are i need not  tell about that  which would render her presence with me impossible  i  should have had to leave her  indeed  i should have had to renounce her  clearly and openly  if i was to do all that i could do in the north  and  the man knew  that   even as he talked to her and me  knew it as well  as she did  that my steps to duty were  first  separation  then  abandonment  at the touch of that thought my dream of a return was  shattered  i turned on the man suddenly  as he was imagining his eloquence  was gaining ground with me       what have i to do with these things now   i said   i have done with  them  do you think i am coquetting with your people in coming here        no   he said   but           why cannot you leave me alone  i have done with these things  i have  ceased to be anything but a private man        yes   he answered   but have you thought   this talk of war  these  reckless challenges  these wild aggressions          i stood up       no   i cried   i won t hear you  i took count of all those things  i  weighed them  and i have come away       he seemed to consider the possibility of persistence  he looked from me  to where the lady sat regarding us       war   he said  as if he were speaking to himself  and then turned slowly  from me and walked away      i stood  caught in the whirl of thoughts his appeal had set going      i heard my lady s voice       dear   she said   but if they have need of you        she did not finish her sentence  she let it rest there  i turned to her  sweet face  and the balance of my mood swayed and reeled       they want me only to do the thing they dare not do themselves   i said    if they distrust gresham they must settle with him themselves       she looked at me doubtfully       but war    she said      i saw a doubt on her face that i had seen before  a doubt of herself and  me  the first shadow of the discovery that  seen strongly and completely   must drive us apart for ever      now  i was an older mind than hers  and i could sway her to this belief  or that       my dear one   i said   you must not trouble over these things  there  will be no war  certainly there will be no war  the age of wars is past   trust me to know the justice of this case  they have no right upon me   dearest  and no one has a right upon me  i have been free to choose my  life  and i have chosen this        but  war     she said      i sat down beside her  i put an arm behind her and took her hand in mine   i set myself to drive that doubt away  i set myself to fill her mind with  pleasant things again  i lied to her  and in lying to her i lied also to  myself  and she was only too ready to believe me  only too ready to  forget      very soon the shadow had gone again  and we were hastening to our  bathing place in the grotta del bovo marino  where it was our custom to  bathe every day  we swam and splashed one another  and in that buoyant  water i seemed to become something lighter and stronger than a man  and at  last we came out dripping and rejoicing and raced among the rocks  and  then i put on a dry bathing dress  and we sat to bask in the sun  and  presently i nodded  resting my head against her knee  and she put her hand  upon my hair and stroked it softly and i dozed  and behold  as it were  with the snapping of the string of a violin  i was awakening  and i was in  my own bed in liverpool  in the life of to day      only for a time i could not believe that all these vivid moments had been  no more than the substance of a dream      in truth  i could not believe it a dream  for all the sobering reality of  things about me  i bathed and dressed as it were by habit  and as i shaved  i argued why i of all men should leave the woman i loved to go back to  fantastic politics in the hard and strenuous north  even if gresham did  force the world back to war  what was that to me  i was a man  with the  heart of a man  and why should i feel the responsibility of a deity for  the way the world might go      you know that is not quite the way i think about affairs  about my real  affairs  i am a solicitor  you know  with a point of view      the vision was so real  you must understand  so utterly unlike a dream   that i kept perpetually recalling little irrelevant details  even the  ornament of a bookcover that lay on my wife s sewing machine in the  breakfast room recalled with the utmost vividness the gilt line that ran  about the seat in the alcove where i had talked with the messenger from my  deserted party  have you ever heard of a dream that had a quality like  that       like         so that afterwards you remembered little details you had forgotten      i thought  i had never noticed the point before  but he was right      never   i said   that is what you never seem to do with dreams       no   he answered   but that is just what i did  i am a solicitor  you  must understand  in liverpool  and i could not help wondering what the  clients and business people i found myself talking to in my office would  think if i told them suddenly i was in love with a girl who would be born  a couple of hundred years or so hence  and worried about the politics of  my great great great grandchildren  i was chiefly busy that day  negotiating a ninety nine year building lease  it was a private builder in  a hurry  and we wanted to tie him in every possible way  i had an  interview with him  and he showed a certain want of temper that sent me to  bed still irritated  that night i had no dream  nor did i dream the next  night  at least  to remember      something of that intense reality of conviction vanished  i began to feel  sure it  was  a dream  and then it came again      when the dream came again  nearly four days later  it was very different   i think it certain that four days had also elapsed  in  the dream   many things had happened in the north  and the shadow of them was back  again between us  and this time it was not so easily dispelled  i began  i  know  with moody musings  why  in spite of all  should i go back  go back  for all the rest of my days  to toil and stress  insults  and perpetual  dissatisfaction  simply to save hundreds of millions of common people   whom i did not love  whom too often i could not do other than despise   from the stress and anguish of war and infinite misrule  and  after all  i  might fail   they  all sought their own narrow ends  and why should  not i  why should not i also live as a man  and out of such thoughts her  voice summoned me  and i lifted my eyes      i found myself awake and walking  we had come out above the pleasure  city  we were near the summit of monte solaro and looking towards the bay   it was the late afternoon and very clear  far away to the left ischia hung  in a golden haze between sea and sky  and naples was coldly white against  the hills  and before us was vesuvius with a tall and slender streamer  feathering at last towards the south  and the ruins of torre dell   annunziata and castellammare glittering and near      i interrupted suddenly   you have been to capri  of course       only in this dream   he said   only in this dream  all across the bay  beyond sorrento were the floating palaces of the pleasure city moored and  chained  and northward were the broad floating stages that received the  aeroplanes  aeroplanes fell out of the sky every afternoon  each bringing  its thousands of pleasure seekers from the uttermost parts of the earth to  capri and its delights  all these things  i say  stretched below      but we noticed them only incidentally because of an unusual sight that  evening had to show  five war aeroplanes that had long slumbered useless  in the distant arsenals of the rhine mouth were manoeuvring now in the  eastward sky  gresham had astonished the world by producing them and  others  and sending them to circle here and there  it was the threat  material in the great game of bluff he was playing  and it had taken even  me by surprise  he was one of those incredibly stupid energetic people who  seem sent by heaven to create disasters  his energy to the first glance  seemed so wonderfully like capacity  but he had no imagination  no  invention  only a stupid  vast  driving force of will  and a mad faith in  his stupid idiot  luck  to pull him through  i remember how we stood out  upon the headland watching the squadron circling far away  and how i  weighed the full meaning of the sight  seeing clearly the way things must   go   and then even it was not too late  i might have gone back  i  think  and saved the world  the people of the north would follow me  i  knew  granted only that in one thing i respected their moral standards   the east and south would trust me as they would trust no other northern  man  and i knew i had only to put it to her and she would have let me  go    not because she did not love me      only i did not want to go  my will was all the other way about  i had so  newly thrown off the incubus of responsibility  i was still so fresh a  renegade from duty that the daylight clearness of what i  ought  to  do had no power at all to touch my will  my will was to live  to gather  pleasures  and make my dear lady happy  but though this sense of vast  neglected duties had no power to draw me  it could make me silent and  preoccupied  it robbed the days i had spent of half their brightness and  roused me into dark meditations in the silence of the night  and as i  stood and watched gresham s aeroplanes sweep to and fro  those birds of  infinite ill omen  she stood beside me  watching me  perceiving the  trouble indeed  but not perceiving it clearly  her eyes questioning my  face  her expression shaded with perplexity  her face was grey because the  sunset was fading out of the sky  it was no fault of hers that she held  me  she had asked me to go from her  and again in the night time and with  tears she had asked me to go      at last it was the sense of her that roused me from my mood  i turned  upon her suddenly and challenged her to race down the mountain slopes    no   she said  as if i jarred with her gravity  but i was resolved to end  that gravity and made her run  no one can be very grey and sad who is out  of breath   and when she stumbled i ran with my hand beneath her arm  we  ran down past a couple of men  who turned back staring in astonishment at  my behaviour  they must have recognised my face  and half way down the  slope came a tumult in the air  clang clank  clang clank  and we stopped   and presently over the hill crest those war things came flying one behind  the other      the man seemed hesitating on the verge of a description      what were  they like   i asked      they had never fought   he said   they were just like our ironclads are  nowadays  they had never fought  no one knew what they might do  with  excited men inside them  few even cared to speculate  they were great  driving things shaped like spear heads without a shaft  with a propeller  in the place of the shaft       steel       not steel       aluminium       no  no  nothing of that sort  an alloy that was very common  as common as  brass  for example  it was called  let me see    he squeezed his forehead  with the fingers of one hand   i am forgetting everything   he said      and they carried guns       little guns  firing high explosive shells  they fired the guns backwards   out of the base of the leaf  so to speak  and rammed with the beak  that  was the theory  you know  but they had never been fought  no one could  tell exactly what was going to happen  and meanwhile i suppose it was very  fine to go whirling through the air like a flight of young swallows  swift  and easy  i guess the captains tried not to think too clearly what the  real thing would be like  and these flying war machines  you know  were  only one sort of the endless war contrivances that had been invented and  had fallen into abeyance during the long peace  there were all sorts of  these things that people were routing out and furbishing up  infernal  things  silly things  things that had never been tried  big engines   terrible explosives  great guns  you know the silly way of these ingenious  sort of men who make these things  they turn  em out as beavers build  dams  and with no more sense of the rivers they re going to divert and the  lands they re going to flood      as we went down the winding stepway to our hotel again in the twilight i  foresaw it all  i saw how clearly and inevitably things were driving for  war in gresham s silly  violent hands  and i had some inkling of what war  was bound to be under these new conditions  and even then  though i knew  it was drawing near the limit of my opportunity  i could find no will to  go back      he sighed      that was my last chance      we did not go into the city until the sky was full of stars  so we walked  out upon the high terrace  to and fro  and  she counselled me to go back       my dearest   she said  and her sweet face looked up to me   this is  death  this life you lead is death  go back to them  go back to your  duty        she began to weep  saying between her sobs  and clinging to my arm as she  said it   go back  go back       then suddenly she fell mute  and glancing down at her face  i read in an  instant the thing she had thought to do  it was one of those moments when  one  sees        no   i said       no   she asked  in surprise  and i think a little fearful at the answer  to her thought       nothing   i said   shall send me back  nothing  i have chosen  love  i  have chosen  and the world must go  whatever happens  i will live this  life  i will live for  you   it  nothing shall turn me aside   nothing  my dear one  even if you died  even if you died         yes   she murmured  softly       then  i also would die       and before she could speak again i began to talk  talking eloquently  as  i  could  do in that life  talking to exalt love  to make the life we  were living seem heroic and glorious  and the thing i was deserting  something hard and enormously ignoble that it was a fine thing to set  aside  i bent all my mind to throw that glamour upon it  seeking not only  to convert her but myself to that  we talked  and she clung to me  torn  too between all that she deemed noble and all that she knew was sweet  and  at last i did make it heroic  made all the thickening disaster of the  world only a sort of glorious setting to our unparalleled love  and we two  poor foolish souls strutted there at last  clad in that splendid delusion   drunken rather with that glorious delusion  under the still stars      and so my moment passed      it was my last chance  even as we went to and fro there  the leaders of  the south and east were gathering their resolve  and the hot answer that  shattered gresham s bluffing for ever took shape and waited  and all over  asia  and the ocean  and the south  the air and the wires were throbbing  with their warnings to prepare  prepare      no one living  you know  knew what war was  no one could imagine  with  all these new inventions  what horror war might bring  i believe most  people still believed it would be a matter of bright uniforms and shouting  charges and triumphs and flags and bands  in a time when half the world  drew its food supply from regions ten thousand miles away         the man with the white face paused  i glanced at him  and his face was  intent on the floor of the carriage  a little railway station  a string of  loaded trucks  a signal box  and the back of a cottage shot by the  carriage window  and a bridge passed with a clap of noise  echoing the  tumult of the train      after that   he said   i dreamt often  for three weeks of nights that  dream was my life  and the worst of it was there were nights when i could  not dream  when i lay tossing on a bed in  this  accursed life  and   there   somewhere lost to me  things were happening  momentous   terrible things    i lived at nights  my days  my waking days  this life  i am living now  became a faded  far away dream  a drab setting  the cover  of the book      he thought      i could tell you all  tell you every little thing in the dream  but as to  what i did in the daytime  no  i could not tell  i do not remember  my  memory  my memory has gone  the business of life slips from me       he leant forward  and pressed his hands upon his eyes  for a long time he  said nothing      and then   said i      the war burst like a hurricane      he stared before him at unspeakable things      and then   i urged again      one touch of unreality   he said  in the low tone of a man who speaks to  himself   and they would have been nightmares  but they were not  nightmares  they were not nightmares   no       he was silent for so long that it dawned upon me that there was a danger  of losing the rest of the story  but he went on talking again in the same  tone of questioning self communion      what was there to do but flight  i had not thought the war would touch  capri  i had seemed to see capri as being out of it all  as the contrast  to it all  but two nights after the whole place was shouting and bawling   every woman almost and every other man wore a badge  gresham s badge  and  there was no music but a jangling war song over and over again  and  everywhere men enlisting  and in the dancing halls they were drilling  the  whole island was a whirl with rumours  it was said again and again  that  fighting had begun  i had not expected this  i had seen so little of the  life of pleasure that i had failed to reckon with this violence of the  amateurs  and as for me  i was out of it  i was like a man who might have  prevented the firing of a magazine  the time had gone  i was no one  the  vainest stripling with a badge counted for more than i  the crowd jostled  us and bawled in our ears  that accursed song deafened us  a woman  shrieked at my lady because no badge was on her  and we two went back to  our own place again  ruffled and insulted  my lady white and silent  and i  a quiver with rage  so furious was i  i could have quarrelled with her if  i could have found one shade of accusation in her eyes      all my magnificence had gone from me  i walked up and down our rock cell   and outside was the darkling sea and a light to the southward that flared  and passed and came again       we must get out of this place   i said over and over   i have made my  choice  and i will have no hand in these troubles  i will have nothing of  this war  we have taken our lives out of all these things  this is no  refuge for us  let us go       and the next day we were already in flight from the war that covered the  world      and all the rest was flight  all the rest was flight      he mused darkly      how much was there of it      he made no answer      how many days      his face was white and drawn and his hands were clenched  he took no heed  of my curiosity     i tried to draw him back to his story with questions      where did you go   i said      when       when you left capri       south west   he said  and glanced at me for a second   we went in a  boat       but i should have thought an aeroplane       they had been seized      i questioned him no more  presently i thought he was beginning again  he  broke out in an argumentative monotone      but why should it be  if  indeed  this battle  this slaughter and stress    is  life  why have we this craving for pleasure and beauty  if there   is  no refuge  if there is no place of peace  and if all our dreams  of quiet places are a folly and a snare  why have we such dreams  surely  it was no ignoble cravings  no base intentions  had brought us to this  it  was love had isolated us  love had come to me with her eyes and robed in  her beauty  more glorious than all else in life  in the very shape and  colour of life  and summoned me away  i had silenced all the voices  i had  answered all the questions  i had come to her  and suddenly there was  nothing but war and death      i had an inspiration   after all   i said   it could have been only a  dream       a dream   he cried  flaming upon me   a dream  when  even now       for the first time he became animated  a faint flush crept into his cheek   he raised his open hand and clenched it  and dropped it to his knee  he  spoke  looking away from me  and for all the rest of the time he looked  away   we are but phantoms   he said   and the phantoms of phantoms   desires like cloud shadows and wills of straw that eddy in the wind  the  days pass  use and wont carry us through as a train carries the shadow of  its lights  so be it  but one thing is real and certain  one thing is no  dream stuff  but eternal and enduring  it is the centre of my life  and  all other things about it are subordinate or altogether vain  i loved her   that woman of a dream  and she and i are dead together      a dream  how can it be a dream  when it drenched a living life with  unappeasable sorrow  when it makes all that i have lived for and cared for  worthless and unmeaning      until that very moment when she was killed i believed we had still a  chance of getting away   he said   all through the night and morning that  we sailed across the sea from capri to salerno we talked of escape  we  were full of hope  and it clung about us to the end  hope for the life  together we should lead  out of it all  out of the battle and struggle   the wild and empty passions  the empty  arbitrary  thou shalt  and  thou  shalt not  of the world  we were uplifted  as though our quest was a holy  thing  as though love for one another was a mission        even when from our boat we saw the fair face of that great rock capri    already scarred and gashed by the gun emplacements and hiding places that  were to make it a fastness  we reckoned nothing of the imminent slaughter   though the fury of preparation hung about in puffs and clouds of dust at a  hundred points amidst the grey  but  indeed  i made a text of that and  talked  there  you know  was the rock  still beautiful for all its scars   with its countless windows and arches and ways  tier upon tier  for a  thousand feet  a vast carving of grey  broken by vine clad terraces  and  lemon and orange groves  and masses of agave and prickly pear  and puffs  of almond blossom  and out under the archway that is built over the  piccola marina other boats were coming  and as we came round the cape and  within sight of the mainland  another little string of boats came into  view  driving before the wind towards the south west  in a little while a  multitude had come out  the remoter just little specks of ultramarine in  the shadow of the eastward cliff       it is love and reason   i said   fleeing from all this madness of war       and though we presently saw a squadron of aeroplanes flying across the  southern sky we did not heed it  there it was  a line of little dots in  the sky  and then more  dotting the south eastern horizon  and then still  more  until all that quarter of the sky was stippled with blue specks  now  they were all thin little strokes of blue  and now one and now a multitude  would heel and catch the sun and become short flashes of light  they came   rising and falling and growing larger  like some huge flight of gulls or  rooks or such like birds  moving with a marvellous uniformity  and ever as  they drew nearer they spread over a greater width of sky  the southward  wing flung itself in an arrow headed cloud athwart the sun  and then  suddenly they swept round to the eastward and streamed eastward  growing  smaller and smaller and clearer and clearer again until they vanished from  the sky  and after that we noted to the northward  and very high   gresham s fighting machines hanging high over naples like an evening swarm  of gnats      it seemed to have no more to do with us than a flight of birds      even the mutter of guns far away in the south east seemed to us to  signify nothing        each day  each dream after that  we were still exalted  still seeking  that refuge where we might live and love  fatigue had come upon us  pain  and many distresses  for though we were dusty and stained by our toilsome  tramping  and half starved  and with the horror of the dead men we had  seen and the flight of the peasants  for very soon a gust of fighting  swept up the peninsula  with these things haunting our minds it still  resulted only in a deepening resolution to escape  oh  but she was brave  and patient  she who had never faced hardship and exposure had courage for  herself  and me  we went to and fro seeking an outlet  over a country all  commandeered and ransacked by the gathering hosts of war  always we went  on foot  at first there were other fugitives  but we did not mingle with  them  some escaped northward  some were caught in the torrent of peasantry  that swept along the main roads  many gave themselves into the hands of  the soldiery and were sent northward  many of the men were impressed  but  we kept away from these things  we had brought no money to bribe a passage  north  and i feared for my lady at the hands of these conscript crowds  we  had landed at salerno  and we had been turned back from cava  and we had  tried to cross towards taranto by a pass over mount alburno  but we had  been driven back for want of food  and so we had come down among the  marshes by paestum  where those great temples stand alone  i had some  vague idea that by paestum it might be possible to find a boat or  something  and take once more to sea  and there it was the battle overtook  us      a sort of soul blindness had me  plainly i could see that we were being  hemmed in  that the great net of that giant warfare had us in its toils   many times we had seen the levies that had come down from the north going  to and fro  and had come upon them in the distance amidst the mountains  making ways for the ammunition and preparing the mounting of the guns   once we fancied they had fired at us  taking us for spies  at any rate a  shot had gone shuddering over us  several times we had hidden in woods  from hovering aeroplanes      but all these things do not matter now  these nights of flight and  pain    we were in an open place near those great temples at paestum  at  last  on a blank stony place dotted with spiky bushes  empty and desolate  and so flat that a grove of eucalyptus far away showed to the feet of its  stems  how i can see it  my lady was sitting down under a bush resting a  little  for she was very weak and weary  and i was standing up watching to  see if i could tell the distance of the firing that came and went  they  were still  you know  fighting far from each other  with these terrible  new weapons that had never before been used  guns that would carry beyond  sight  and aeroplanes that would do    what  they  would do no man  could foretell      i knew that we were between the two armies  and that they drew together   i knew we were in danger  and that we could not stop there and rest      though all those things were in my mind  they were in the background   they seemed to be affairs beyond our concern  chiefly  i was thinking of  my lady  an aching distress filled me  for the first time she had owned  herself beaten and had fallen a weeping  behind me i could hear her  sobbing  but i would not turn round to her because i knew she had need of  weeping  and had held herself so far and so long for me  it was well  i  thought  that she would weep and rest  and then we would toil on again   for i had no inkling of the thing that hung so near  even now i can see  her as she sat there  her lovely hair upon her shoulder  can mark again  the deepening hollow of her cheek       if we had parted   she said   if i had let you go         no   said i   even now i do not repent  i will not repent  i made my  choice  and i will hold on to the end       and then       overhead in the sky flashed something and burst  and all about us i heard  the bullets making a noise like a handful of peas suddenly thrown  they  chipped the stones about us  and whirled fragments from the bricks and  passed        he put his hand to his mouth  and then moistened his lips      at the flash i had turned about        you know  she stood up       she stood up  you know  and moved a step towards me       as though she wanted to reach me       and she had been shot through the heart      he stopped and stared at me  i felt all that foolish incapacity an  englishman feels on such occasions  i met his eyes for a moment  and then  stared out of the window  for a long space we kept silence  when at last i  looked at him he was sitting back in his corner  his arms folded and his  teeth gnawing at his knuckles     he bit his nail suddenly  and stared at it      i carried her   he said   towards the temples  in my arms  as though it  mattered  i don t know why  they seemed a sort of sanctuary  you know   they had lasted so long  i suppose      she must have died almost instantly  only  i talked to her  all the way      silence again      i have seen those temples   i said abruptly  and indeed he had brought  those still  sunlit arcades of worn sandstone very vividly before me      it was the brown one  the big brown one  i sat down on a fallen pillar  and held her in my arms    silent after the first babble was over  and  after a little while the lizards came out and ran about again  as though  nothing unusual was going on  as though nothing had changed    it was  tremendously still there  the sun high and the shadows still  even the  shadows of the weeds upon the entablature were still  in spite of the  thudding and banging that went all about the sky      i seem to remember that the aeroplanes came up out of the south  and that  the battle went away to the west  one aeroplane was struck  and overset  and fell  i remember that  though it didn t interest me in the least  it  didn t seem to signify  it was like a wounded gull  you know  flapping for  a time in the water  i could see it down the aisle of the temple  a black  thing in the bright blue water      three or four times shells burst about the beach  and then that ceased   each time that happened all the lizards scuttled in and hid for a space   that was all the mischief done  except that once a stray bullet gashed the  stone hard by  made just a fresh bright surface      as the shadows grew longer  the stillness seemed greater      the curious thing   he remarked  with the manner of a man who makes a  trivial conversation   is that i didn t  think   i didn t think at  all  i sat with her in my arms amidst the stones  in a sort of lethargy    stagnant      and i don t remember waking up  i don t remember dressing that day  i  know i found myself in my office  with my letters all slit open in front  of me  and how i was struck by the absurdity of being there  seeing that  in reality i was sitting  stunned  in that paestum temple with a dead  woman in my arms  i read my letters like a machine  i have forgotten what  they were about      he stopped  and there was a long silence     suddenly i perceived that we were running down the incline from chalk farm  to euston  i started at this passing of time  i turned on him with a  brutal question with the tone of  now or never       and did you dream again       yes      he seemed to force himself to finish  his voice was very low      once more  and as it were only for a few instants  i seemed to have  suddenly awakened out of a great apathy  to have risen into a sitting  position  and the body lay there on the stones beside me  a gaunt body   not her  you know  so soon  it was not her        i may have heard voices  i do not know  only i knew clearly that men were  coming into the solitude and that that was a last outrage      i stood up and walked through the temple  and then there came into  sight  first one man with a yellow face  dressed in a uniform of dirty  white  trimmed with blue  and then several  climbing to the crest of the  old wall of the vanished city  and crouching there  they were little  bright figures in the sunlight  and there they hung  weapon in hand   peering cautiously before them      and further away i saw others  and then more at another point in the  wall  it was a long lax line of men in open order      presently the man i had first seen stood up and shouted a command  and  his men came tumbling down the wall and into the high weeds towards the  temple  he scrambled down with them and led them  he came facing towards  me  and when he saw me he stopped      at first i had watched these men with a mere curiosity  but when i had  seen they meant to come to the temple i was moved to forbid them  i  shouted to the officer       you must not come here   i cried    i  am here  i am here with my  dead       he stared  and then shouted a question back to me in some unknown tongue      i repeated what i had said      he shouted again  and i folded my arms and stood still  presently he  spoke to his men and came forward  he carried a drawn sword      i signed to him to keep away  but he continued to advance  i told him  again very patiently and clearly   you must not come here  these are old  temples  and i am here with my dead       presently he was so close i could see his face clearly  it was a narrow  face  with dull grey eyes  and a black moustache  he had a scar on his  upper lip  and he was dirty and unshaven  he kept shouting unintelligible  things  questions perhaps  at me      i know now that he was afraid of me  but at the time that did not occur  to me  as i tried to explain to him he interrupted me in imperious tones   bidding me  i suppose  stand aside      he made to go past me  and i caught hold of him      i saw his face change at my grip       you fool   i cried   don t you know  she is dead       he started back  he looked at me with cruel eyes      i saw a sort of exultant resolve leap into them  delight  then suddenly   with a scowl  he swept his sword back   so   and thrust      he stopped abruptly     i became aware of a change in the rhythm of the train  the brakes lifted  their voices and the carriage jarred and jerked  this present world  insisted upon itself  became clamorous  i saw through the steamy window  huge electric lights glaring down from tall masts upon a fog  saw rows of  stationary empty carriages passing by  and then a signal box  hoisting its  constellation of green and red into the murky london twilight  marched  after them  i looked again at his drawn features      he ran me through the heart  it was with a sort of astonishment  no fear   no pain  but just amazement  that i felt it pierce me  felt the sword  drive home into my body  it didn t hurt  you know  it didn t hurt at all      the yellow platform lights came into the field of view  passing first  rapidly  then slowly  and at last stopping with a jerk  dim shapes of men  passed to and fro without      euston   cried a voice      do you mean         there was no pain  no sting or smart  amazement and then darkness  sweeping over everything  the hot  brutal face before me  the face of the  man who had killed me  seemed to recede  it swept out of existence        euston   clamoured the voices outside   euston      the carriage door opened  admitting a flood of sound  and a porter stood  regarding us  the sounds of doors slamming  and the hoof clatter of  cab horses  and behind these things the featureless remote roar of the  london cobble stones  came to my ears  a truck load of lighted lamps  blazed along the platform      a darkness  a flood of darkness that opened and spread and blotted out  all things       any luggage  sir   said the porter      and that was the end   i asked     he seemed to hesitate  then  almost inaudibly  he answered    no        you mean       i couldn t get to her  she was there on the other side of the temple    and then        yes   i insisted   yes       nightmares   he cried   nightmares indeed  my god  great birds that  fought and tore              xxvi       the valley of spiders       towards mid day the three pursuers came abruptly round a bend in the  torrent bed upon the sight of a very broad and spacious valley  the  difficult and winding trench of pebbles along which they had tracked the  fugitives for so long expanded to a broad slope  and with a common impulse  the three men left the trail  and rode to a little eminence set with  olive dun trees  and there halted  the two others  as became them  a  little behind the man with the silver studded bridle     for a space they scanned the great expanse below them with eager eyes  it  spread remoter and remoter  with only a few clusters of sere thorn bushes  here and there  and the dim suggestions of some now waterless ravine to  break its desolation of yellow grass  its purple distances melted at last  into the bluish slopes of the further hills  hills it might be of a  greener kind  and above them  invisibly supported  and seeming indeed to  hang in the blue  were the snow clad summits of mountains  that grew  larger and bolder to the northwestward as the sides of the valley drew  together  and westward the valley opened until a distant darkness under  the sky told where the forests began  but the three men looked neither  east nor west  but only steadfastly across the valley     the gaunt man with the scarred lip was the first to speak   nowhere   he  said  with a sigh of disappointment in his voice   but  after all  they  had a full day s start       they don t know we are after them   said the little man on the white  horse       she  would know   said the leader bitterly  as if speaking to  himself      even then they can t go fast  they ve got no beast but the mule  and all  to day the girl s foot has been bleeding         the man with the silver bridle flashed a quick intensity of rage on him    do you think i haven t seen that   he snarled      it helps  anyhow   whispered the little man to himself     the gaunt man with the scarred lip stared impassively   they can t be over  the valley   he said   if we ride hard         he glanced at the white horse and paused      curse all white horses   said the man with the silver bridle  and turned  to scan the beast his curse included     the little man looked down between the melancholy ears of his steed      i did my best   he said     the two others stared again across the valley for a space  the gaunt man  passed the back of his hand across the scarred lip      come up   said the man who owned the silver bridle  suddenly  the little  man started and jerked his rein  and the horse hoofs of the three made a  multitudinous faint pattering upon the withered grass as they turned back  towards the trail       they rode cautiously down the long slope before them  and so came through  a waste of prickly twisted bushes and strange dry shapes of thorny  branches that grew amongst the rocks  into the levels below  and there the  trail grew faint  for the soil was scanty  and the only herbage was this  scorched dead straw that lay upon the ground  still  by hard scanning  by  leaning beside the horses  necks and pausing ever and again  even these  white men could contrive to follow after their prey     there were trodden places  bent and broken blades of the coarse grass  and  ever and again the sufficient intimation of a footmark  and once the  leader saw a brown smear of blood where the half caste girl may have trod   and at that under his breath he cursed her for a fool     the gaunt man checked his leader s tracking  and the little man on the  white horse rode behind  a man lost in a dream  they rode one after  another  the man with the silver bridle led the way  and they spoke never  a word  after a time it came to the little man on the white horse that the  world was very still  he started out of his dream  besides the little  noises of their horses and equipment  the whole great valley kept the  brooding quiet of a painted scene     before him went his master and his fellow  each intently leaning forward  to the left  each impassively moving with the paces of his horse  their  shadows went before them  still  noiseless  tapering attendants  and  nearer a crouched cool shape was his own  he looked about him  what was it  had gone  then he remembered the reverberation from the banks of the gorge  and the perpetual accompaniment of shifting  jostling pebbles  and   moreover      there was no breeze  that was it  what a vast  still place  it was  a monotonous afternoon slumber  and the sky open and blank except  for a sombre veil of haze that had gathered in the upper valley     he straightened his back  fretted with his bridle  puckered his lips to  whistle  and simply sighed  he turned in his saddle for a time  and stared  at the throat of the mountain gorge out of which they had come  blank   blank slopes on either side  with never a sign of a decent beast or tree    much less a man  what a land it was  what a wilderness  he dropped again  into his former pose     it filled him with a momentary pleasure to see a wry stick of purple black  flash out into the form of a snake  and vanish amidst the brown  after  all  the infernal valley  was  alive  and then  to rejoice him still  more  came a little breath across his face  a whisper that came and went   the faintest inclination of a stiff black antlered bush upon a little  crest  the first intimations of a possible breeze  idly he wetted his  finger  and held it up     he pulled up sharply to avoid a collision with the gaunt man  who had  stopped at fault upon the trail  just at that guilty moment he caught his  master s eye looking towards him     for a time he forced an interest in the tracking  then  as they rode on  again  he studied his master s shadow and hat and shoulder  appearing and  disappearing behind the gaunt man s nearer contours  they had ridden four  days out of the very limits of the world into this desolate place  short  of water  with nothing but a strip of dried meat under their saddles  over  rocks and mountains  where surely none but these fugitives had ever been  before  for  that      and all this was for a girl  a mere wilful child  and the man had whole  cityfuls of people to do his basest bidding  girls  women  why in the name  of passionate folly  this  one in particular  asked the little man   and scowled at the world  and licked his parched lips with a blackened  tongue  it was the way of the master  and that was all he knew  just  because she sought to evade him       his eye caught a whole row of high plumed canes bending in unison  and  then the tails of silk that hung before his neck flapped and fell  the  breeze was growing stronger  somehow it took the stiff stillness out of  things  and that was well      hullo   said the gaunt man     all three stopped abruptly      what   asked the master   what       over there   said the gaunt man  pointing up the valley      what       something coming towards us      and as he spoke a yellow animal crested a rise and came bearing down upon  them  it was a big wild dog  coming before the wind  tongue out  at a  steady pace  and running with such an intensity of purpose that he did not  seem to see the horsemen he approached  he ran with his nose up   following  it was plain  neither scent nor quarry  as he drew nearer the  little man felt for his sword   he s mad   said the gaunt rider      shout   said the little man  and shouted     the dog came on  then when the little man s blade was already out  it  swerved aside and went panting by them and passed  the eyes of the little  man followed its flight   there was no foam   he said  for a space the man  with the silver studded bridle stared up the valley   oh  come on   he  cried at last   what does it matter   and jerked his horse into movement  again     the little man left the insoluble mystery of a dog that fled from nothing  but the wind  and lapsed into profound musings on human character   come  on   he whispered to himself   why should it be given to one man to say   come on   with that stupendous violence of effect  always  all his life   the man with the silver bridle has been saying that  if  i  said  it     thought the little man  but people marvelled when the master was  disobeyed even in the wildest things  this half caste girl seemed to him   seemed to every one  mad  blasphemous almost  the little man  by way of  comparison  reflected on the gaunt rider with the scarred lip  as stalwart  as his master  as brave and  indeed  perhaps braver  and yet for him there  was obedience  nothing but to give obedience duly and stoutly       certain sensations of the hands and knees called the little man back to  more immediate things  he became aware of something  he rode up beside his  gaunt fellow   do you notice the horses   he said in an undertone     the gaunt face looked interrogation      they don t like this wind   said the little man  and dropped behind as  the man with the silver bridle turned upon him      it s all right   said the gaunt faced man     they rode on again for a space in silence  the foremost two rode downcast  upon the trail  the hindmost man watched the haze that crept down the  vastness of the valley  nearer and nearer  and noted how the wind grew in  strength moment by moment  far away on the left he saw a line of dark  bulks  wild hog  perhaps  galloping down the valley  but of that he said  nothing  nor did he remark again upon the uneasiness of the horses     and then he saw first one and then a second great white ball  a great  shining white ball like a gigantic head of thistledown  that drove before  the wind athwart the path  these balls soared high in the air  and dropped  and rose again and caught for a moment  and hurried on and passed  but at  the sight of them the restlessness of the horses increased     then presently he saw that more of these drifting globes  and then soon  very many more  were hurrying towards him down the valley     they became aware of a squealing  athwart the path a huge boar rushed   turning his head but for one instant to glance at them  and then hurling  on down the valley again  and at that all three stopped and sat in their  saddles  staring into the thickening haze that was coming upon them      if it were not for this thistle down    began the leader     but now a big globe came drifting past within a score of yards of them  it  was really not an even sphere at all  but a vast  soft  ragged  filmy  thing  a sheet gathered by the corners  an aerial jelly fish  as it were   but rolling over and over as it advanced  and trailing long cobwebby  threads and streamers that floated in its wake      it isn t thistle down   said the little man      i don t like the stuff   said the gaunt man     and they looked at one another      curse it   cried the leader   the air s full of lit up there  if it keeps  on at this pace long  it will stop us altogether      an instinctive feeling  such as lines out a herd of deer at the approach  of some ambiguous thing  prompted them to turn their horses to the wind   ride forward for a few paces  and stare at that advancing multitude of  floating masses  they came on before the wind with a sort of smooth  swiftness  rising and falling noiselessly  sinking to earth  rebounding  high  soaring  all with a perfect unanimity  with a still  deliberate  assurance     right and left of the horsemen the pioneers of this strange army passed   at one that rolled along the ground  breaking shapelessly and trailing out  reluctantly into long grappling ribbons and bands  all three horses began  to shy and dance  the master was seized with a sudden  unreasonable  impatience  he cursed the drifting globes roundly   get on   he cried    get on  what do these things matter  how  can  they matter  back to  the trail   he fell swearing at his horse and sawed the bit across its  mouth     he shouted aloud with rage   i will follow that trail  i tell you   he  cried   where is the trail      he gripped the bridle of his prancing horse and searched amidst the grass   a long and clinging thread fell across his face  a grey streamer dropped  about his bridle arm  some big  active thing with many legs ran down the  back of his head  he looked up to discover one of those grey masses  anchored as it were above him by these things and flapping out ends as a  sail flaps when a boat comes about  but noiselessly     he had an impression of many eyes  of a dense crew of squat bodies  of  long  many jointed limbs hauling at their mooring ropes to bring the thing  down upon him  for a space he stared up  reining in his prancing horse  with the instinct born of years of horsemanship  then the flat of a sword  smote his back  and a blade flashed overhead and cut the drifting balloon  of spider web free  and the whole mass lifted softly and drove clear and  away      spiders   cried the voice of the gaunt man   the things are full of big  spiders  look  my lord      the man with the silver bridle still followed the mass that drove away      look  my lord      the master found himself staring down at a red smashed thing on the ground  that  in spite of partial obliteration  could still wriggle unavailing  legs  then  when the gaunt man pointed to another mass that bore down upon  them  he drew his sword hastily  up the valley now it was like a fog bank  torn to rags  he tried to grasp the situation      ride for it   the little man was shouting   ride for it down the valley      what happened then was like the confusion of a battle  the man with the  silver bridle saw the little man go past him  slashing furiously at  imaginary cobwebs  saw him cannon into the horse of the gaunt man and hurl  it and its rider to earth  his own horse went a dozen paces before he  could rein it in  then he looked up to avoid imaginary dangers  and then  back again to see a horse rolling on the ground  the gaunt man standing  and slashing over it at a rent and fluttering mass of grey that streamed  and wrapped about them both  and thick and fast as thistle down on waste  land on a windy day in july the cobweb masses were coming on     the little man had dismounted  but he dared not release his horse  he was  endeavouring to lug the struggling brute back with the strength of one  arm  while with the other he slashed aimlessly  the tentacles of a second  grey mass had entangled themselves with the struggle  and this second grey  mass came to its moorings  and slowly sank     the master set his teeth  gripped his bridle  lowered his head  and  spurred his horse forward  the horse on the ground rolled over  there was  blood and moving shapes upon the flanks  and the gaunt man suddenly  leaving it  ran forward towards his master  perhaps ten paces  his legs  were swathed and encumbered with grey  he made ineffectual movements with  his sword  grey streamers waved from him  there was a thin veil of grey  across his face  with his left hand he beat at something on his body  and  suddenly he stumbled and fell  he struggled to rise  and fell again  and  suddenly  horribly  began to howl   oh  ohoo  ohooh      the master could see the great spiders upon him  and others upon the  ground     as he strove to force his horse nearer to this gesticulating  screaming  grey object that struggled up and down  there came a clatter of hoofs  and  the little man  in act of mounting  swordless  balanced on his belly  athwart the white horse  and clutching its mane  whirled past  and again a  clinging thread of grey gossamer swept across the master s face  all about  him  and over him  it seemed this drifting  noiseless cobweb circled and  drew nearer him       to the day of his death he never knew just how the event of that moment  happened  did he  indeed  turn his horse  or did it really of its own  accord stampede after its fellow  suffice it that in another second he was  galloping full tilt down the valley with his sword whirling furiously  overhead  and all about him on the quickening breeze  the spiders   air ships  their air bundles and air sheets  seemed to him to hurry in a  conscious pursuit     clatter  clatter  thud  thud   the man with the silver bridle rode   heedless of his direction  with his fearful face looking up now right  now  left  and his sword arm ready to slash  and a few hundred yards ahead of  him  with a tail of torn cobweb trailing behind him  rode the little man  on the white horse  still but imperfectly in the saddle  the reeds bent  before them  the wind blew fresh and strong  over his shoulder the master  could see the webs hurrying to overtake       he was so intent to escape the spiders  webs that only as his horse  gathered together for a leap did he realise the ravine ahead  and then he  realised it only to misunderstand and interfere  he was leaning forward on  his horse s neck and sat up and back all too late     but if in his excitement he had failed to leap  at any rate he had not  forgotten how to fall  he was horseman again in mid air  he came off clear  with a mere bruise upon his shoulder  and his horse rolled  kicking  spasmodic legs  and lay still  but the master s sword drove its point into  the hard soil  and snapped clean across  as though chance refused him any  longer as her knight  and the splintered end missed his face by an inch or  so     he was on his feet in a moment  breathlessly scanning the on rushing  spider webs  for a moment he was minded to run  and then thought of the  ravine  and turned back  he ran aside once to dodge one drifting terror   and then he was swiftly clambering down the precipitous sides  and out of  the touch of the gale     there  under the lee of the dry torrent s steeper banks  he might crouch  and watch these strange  grey masses pass and pass in safety till the wind  fell  and it became possible to escape  and there for a long time he  crouched  watching the strange  grey  ragged masses trail their streamers  across his narrowed sky     once a stray spider fell into the ravine close beside him  a full foot it  measured from leg to leg and its body was half a man s hand  and after he  had watched its monstrous alacrity of search and escape for a little while  and tempted it to bite his broken sword  he lifted up his iron heeled boot  and smashed it into a pulp  he swore as he did so  and for a time sought  up and down for another     then presently  when he was surer these spider swarms could not drop into  the ravine  he found a place where he could sit down  and sat and fell  into deep thought and began  after his manner  to gnaw his knuckles and  bite his nails  and from this he was moved by the coming of the man with  the white horse     he heard him long before he saw him  as a clattering of hoofs  stumbling  footsteps  and a reassuring voice  then the little man appeared  a rueful  figure  still with a tail of white cobweb trailing behind him  they  approached each other without speaking  without a salutation  the little  man was fatigued and shamed to the pitch of hopeless bitterness  and came  to a stop at last  face to face with his seated master  the latter winced  a little under his dependent s eye   well   he said at last  with no  pretence of authority      you left him       my horse bolted       i know  so did mine      he laughed at his master mirthlessly      i say my horse bolted   said the man who once had a silver studded  bridle      cowards both   said the little man     the other gnawed his knuckle through some meditative moments  with his eye  on his inferior      don t call me a coward   he said at length      you are a coward  like myself       a coward possibly  there is a limit beyond which every man must fear   that i have learnt at last  but not like yourself  that is where the  difference comes in       i never could have dreamt you would have left him  he saved your life two  minutes before    why are you our lord      the master gnawed his knuckles again  and his countenance was dark      no man calls me a coward   he said   no     a broken sword is better  than none     one spavined white horse cannot be expected to carry two  men a four days  journey  i hate white horses  but this time it cannot be  helped  you begin to understand me  i perceive that you are minded  on the  strength of what you have seen and fancy  to taint my reputation  it is  men of your sort who unmake kings  besides which  i never liked you       my lord   said the little man      no   said the master    no       he stood up sharply as the little man moved  for a minute perhaps they  faced one another  overhead the spiders  balls went driving  there was a  quick movement among the pebbles  a running of feet  a cry of despair  a  gasp and a blow       towards nightfall the wind fell  the sun set in a calm serenity  and the  man who had once possessed the silver bridle came at last very cautiously  and by an easy slope out of the ravine again  but now he led the white  horse that once belonged to the little man  he would have gone back to his  horse to get his silver mounted bridle again  but he feared night and a  quickening breeze might still find him in the valley  and besides  he  disliked greatly to think he might discover his horse all swathed in  cobwebs and perhaps unpleasantly eaten     and as he thought of those cobwebs  and of all the dangers he had been  through  and the manner in which he had been preserved that day  his hand  sought a little reliquary that hung about his neck  and he clasped it for  a moment with heartfelt gratitude  as he did so his eyes went across the  valley      i was hot with passion   he said   and now she has met her reward  they  also  no doubt       and behold  far away out of the wooded slopes across the valley  but in  the clearness of the sunset  distinct and unmistakable  he saw a little  spire of smoke     at that his expression of serene resignation changed to an amazed anger   smoke  he turned the head of the white horse about  and hesitated  and as  he did so a little rustle of air went through the grass about him  far  away upon some reeds swayed a tattered sheet of grey  he looked at the  cobwebs  he looked at the smoke      perhaps  after all  it is not them   he said at last     but he knew better     after he had stared at the smoke for some time  he mounted the white  horse     as he rode  he picked his way amidst stranded masses of web  for some  reason there were many dead spiders on the ground  and those that lived  feasted guiltily on their fellows  at the sound of his horse s hoofs they  fled     their time had passed  from the ground  without either a wind to carry  them or a winding sheet ready  these things  for all their poison  could  do him little evil     he flicked with his belt at those he fancied came too near  once  where a  number ran together over a bare place  he was minded to dismount and  trample them with his boots  but this impulse he overcame  ever and again  he turned in his saddle  and looked back at the smoke      spiders   he muttered over and over again   spiders  well  well    the  next time i must spin a web              xxvii       the new accelerator       certainly  if ever a man found a guinea when he was looking for a pin  it  is my good friend professor gibberne  i have heard before of investigators  overshooting the mark  but never quite to the extent that he has done  he  has really  this time at any rate  without any touch of exaggeration in the  phrase  found something to revolutionise human life  and that when he was  simply seeking an all round nervous stimulant to bring languid people up  to the stresses of these pushful days  i have tasted the stuff now several  times  and i cannot do better than describe the effect the thing had on  me  that there are astonishing experiences in store for all in search of  new sensations will become apparent enough     professor gibberne  as many people know  is my neighbour in folkestone   unless my memory plays me a trick  his portrait at various ages has  already appeared in  the strand magazine   think late in      but i  am unable to look it up because i have lent that volume to someone who has  never sent it back  the reader may  perhaps  recall the high forehead and  the singularly long black eyebrows that give such a mephistophelean touch  to his face  he occupies one of those pleasant little detached houses in  the mixed style that make the western end of the upper sandgate road so  interesting  his is the one with the flemish gables and the moorish  portico  and it is in the little room with the mullioned bay window that  he works when he is down here  and in which of an evening we have so often  smoked and talked together  he is a mighty jester  but  besides  he likes  to talk to me about his work  he is one of those men who find a help and  stimulus in talking  and so i have been able to follow the conception of  the new accelerator right up from a very early stage  of course  the  greater portion of his experimental work is not done in folkestone  but in  gower street  in the fine new laboratory next to the hospital that he has  been the first to use     as every one knows  or at least as all intelligent people know  the  special department in which gibberne has gained so great and deserved a  reputation among physiologists is the action of drugs upon the nervous  system  upon soporifics  sedatives  and anaesthetics he is  i am told   unequalled  he is also a chemist of considerable eminence  and i suppose  in the subtle and complex jungle of riddles that centres about the  ganglion cell and the axis fibre there are little cleared places of his  making  little glades of illumination  that  until he sees fit to publish  his results  are still inaccessible to every other living man  and in the  last few years he has been particularly assiduous upon this question of  nervous stimulants  and already  before the discovery of the new  accelerator  very successful with them  medical science has to thank him  for at least three distinct and absolutely safe invigorators of unrivalled  value to practising men  in cases of exhaustion the preparation known as  gibberne s b syrup has  i suppose  saved more lives already than any  lifeboat round the coast      but none of these little things begin to satisfy me yet   he told me  nearly a year ago   either they increase the central energy without  affecting the nerves  or they simply increase the available energy by  lowering the nervous conductivity  and all of them are unequal and local  in their operation  one wakes up the heart and viscera and leaves the  brain stupefied  one gets at the brain champagne fashion  and does nothing  good for the solar plexus  and what i want  and what  if it s an earthly  possibility  i mean to have  is a stimulant that stimulates all round   that wakes you up for a time from the crown of your head to the tip of  your great toe  and makes you go two  or even three  to everybody else s  one  eh  that s the thing i m after       it would tire a man   i said      not a doubt of it  and you d eat double or treble  and all that  but just  think what the thing would mean  imagine yourself with a little phial like  this   he held up a little bottle of green glass and marked his points  with it   and in this precious phial is the power to think twice as fast   move twice as quickly  do twice as much work in a given time as you could  otherwise do       but is such a thing possible       i believe so  if it isn t  i ve wasted my time for a year  these various  preparations of the hypophosphites  for example  seem to show that  something of the sort    even if it was only one and a half times as fast  it would do       it  would  do   i said      if you were a statesman in a corner  for example  time rushing up against  you  something urgent to be done  eh       he could dose his private secretary   i said      and gain  double time  and think if  you   for example  wanted to  finish a book       usually   i said   i wish i d never begun  em       or a doctor  driven to death  wants to sit down and think out a case  or  a barrister  or a man cramming for an examination       worth a guinea a drop   said i   and more  to men like that       and in a duel  again   said gibberne   where it all depends on your  quickness in pulling the trigger       or in fencing   i echoed      you see   said gibberne   if i get it as an all round thing  it will  really do you no harm at all  except perhaps to an infinitesimal degree it  brings you nearer old age  you will just have lived twice to other  people s once        i suppose   i meditated   in a duel  it would be fair       that s a question for the seconds   said gibberne     i harked back further   and you really think such a thing  is   possible   i said      as possible   said gibberne  and glanced at something that went throbbing  by the window   as a motor bus  as a matter of fact       he paused and smiled at me deeply  and tapped slowly on the edge of his  desk with the green phial   i think i know the stuff    already i ve got  something coming   the nervous smile upon his face betrayed the gravity of  his revelation  he rarely talked of his actual experimental work unless  things were very near the end   and it may be  it may be  i shouldn t be  surprised  it may even do the thing at a greater rate than twice       it will be rather a big thing   i hazarded      it will be  i think  rather a big thing      but i don t think he quite knew what a big thing it was to be  for all  that     i remember we had several talks about the stuff after that   the new  accelerator  he called it  and his tone about it grew more confident on  each occasion  sometimes he talked nervously of unexpected physiological  results its use might have  and then he would get a little unhappy  at  others he was frankly mercenary  and we debated long and anxiously how the  preparation might be turned to commercial account   it s a good thing    said gibberne   a tremendous thing  i know i m giving the world something   and i think it only reasonable we should expect the world to pay  the  dignity of science is all very well  but i think somehow i must have the  monopoly of the stuff for  say  ten years  i don t see why  all  the  fun in life should go to the dealers in ham      my own interest in the coming drug certainly did not wane in the time  i  have always had a queer little twist towards metaphysics in my mind  i  have always been given to paradoxes about space and time  and it seemed to  me that gibberne was really preparing no less than the absolute  acceleration of life  suppose a man repeatedly dosed with such a  preparation  he would live an active and record life indeed  but he would  be an adult at eleven  middle aged at twenty five  and by thirty well on  the road to senile decay  it seemed to me that so far gibberne was only  going to do for any one who took his drug exactly what nature has done for  the jews and orientals  who are men in their teens and aged by fifty  and  quicker in thought and act than we are all the time  the marvel of drugs  has always been great to my mind  you can madden a man  calm a man  make  him incredibly strong and alert or a helpless log  quicken this passion  and allay that  all by means of drugs  and here was a new miracle to be  added to this strange armoury of phials the doctors use  but gibberne was  far too eager upon his technical points to enter very keenly into my  aspect of the question     it was the  th or  th of august when he told me the distillation that  would decide his failure or success for a time was going forward as we  talked  and it was on the   th that he told me the thing was done and the  new accelerator a tangible reality in the world  i met him as i was going  up the sandgate hill towards folkestone  i think i was going to get my  hair cut  and he came hurrying down to meet me  i suppose he was coming to  my house to tell me at once of his success  i remember that his eyes were  unusually bright and his face flushed  and i noted even then the swift  alacrity of his step      it s done   he cried  and gripped my hand  speaking very fast   it s more  than done  come up to my house and see       really       really   he shouted   incredibly  come up and see       and it does  twice       it does more  much more  it scares me  come up and see the stuff  taste  it  try it  it s the most amazing stuff on earth   he gripped my arm and   walking at such a pace that he forced me into a trot  went shouting with  me up the hill  a whole  char a banc  ful of people turned and stared  at us in unison after the manner of people in  chars a banc   it was  one of those hot  clear days that folkestone sees so much of  every colour  incredibly bright and every outline hard  there was a breeze  of course   but not so much breeze as sufficed under these conditions to keep me cool  and dry  i panted for mercy      i m not walking fast  am i   cried gibberne  and slackened his pace to a  quick march      you ve been taking some of this stuff   i puffed      no   he said   at the utmost a drop of water that stood in a beaker from  which i had washed out the last traces of the stuff  i took some last  night  you know  but that is ancient history now       and it goes twice   i said  nearing his doorway in a grateful  perspiration      it goes a thousand times  many thousand times   cried gibberne  with a  dramatic gesture  flinging open his early english carved oak gate      phew   said i  and followed him to the door      i don t know how many times it goes   he said  with his latch key in his  hand      and you          it throws all sorts of light on nervous physiology  it kicks the theory  of vision into a perfectly new shape      heaven knows how many thousand  times  we ll try all that after    the thing is to try the stuff now       try the stuff   i said  as we went along the passage      rather   said gibberne  turning on me in his study   there it is in that  little green phial there  unless you happen to be afraid      i am a careful man by nature  and only theoretically adventurous  i   was  afraid  but on the other hand  there is pride      well   i haggled   you say you ve tried it       i ve tried it   he said   and i don t look hurt by it  do i  i don t even  look livery  and i  feel          i sat down   give me the potion   i said   if the worst comes to the  worst it will save having my hair cut  and that  i think  is one of the  most hateful duties of a civilised man  how do you take the mixture       with water   said gibberne  whacking down a carafe     he stood up in front of his desk and regarded me in his easy chair  his  manner was suddenly affected by a touch of the harley street specialist    it s rum stuff  you know   he said     i made a gesture with my hand      i must warn you  in the first place  as soon as you ve got it down to  shut your eyes  and open them very cautiously in a minute or so s time   one still sees  the sense of vision is a question of length of vibration   and not of multitude of impacts  but there s a kind of shock to the  retina  a nasty giddy confusion just at the time if the eyes are open   keep  em shut       shut   i said   good       and the next thing is  keep still  don t begin to whack about  you may  fetch something a nasty rap if you do  remember you will be going several  thousand times faster than you ever did before  heart  lungs  muscles   brain  everything  and you will hit hard without knowing it  you won t  know it  you know  you ll feel just as you do now  only everything in the  world will seem to be going ever so many thousand times slower than it  ever went before  that s what makes it so deuced queer       lor   i said   and you mean          you ll see   said he  and took up a little measure  he glanced at the  material on his desk   glasses   he said   water  all here  mustn t take  too much for the first attempt      the little phial glucked out its precious contents   don t forget what i  told you   he said  turning the contents of the measure into a glass in  the manner of an italian waiter measuring whisky   sit with the eyes  tightly shut and in absolute stillness for two minutes   he said   then  you will hear me speak      he added an inch or so of water to the little dose in each glass      by the by   he said   don t put your glass down  keep it in your hand and  rest your hand on your knee  yes  so  and now         he raised his glass      the new accelerator   i said      the new accelerator   he answered  and we touched glasses and drank  and  instantly i closed my eyes     you know that blank non existence into which one drops when one has taken   gas   for an indefinite interval it was like that  then i heard gibberne  telling me to wake up  and i stirred and opened my eyes  there he stood as  he had been standing  glass still in hand  it was empty  that was all the  difference      well   said i      nothing out of the way       nothing  a slight feeling of exhilaration  perhaps  nothing more       sounds       things are still   i said   by jove  yes  they  are  still  except  the sort of faint pat  patter  like rain falling on different things  what  is it       analysed sounds   i think he said  but i am not sure  he glanced at the  window   have you ever seen a curtain before a window fixed in that way  before      i followed his eyes  and there was the end of the curtain  frozen  as it  were  corner high  in the act of flapping briskly in the breeze      no   said i   that s odd       and here   he said  and opened the hand that held the glass  naturally i  winced  expecting the glass to smash  but so far from smashing  it did not  even seem to stir  it hung in mid air  motionless   roughly speaking    said gibberne   an object in these latitudes falls    feet in the first  second  this glass is falling    feet in a second now  only  you see  it  hasn t been falling yet for the hundredth part of a second  that gives you  some idea of the pace of my accelerator      and he waved his hand round and round  over and under the slowly sinking  glass  finally he took it by the bottom  pulled it down and placed it very  carefully on the table   eh   he said to me  and laughed      that seems all right   i said  and began very gingerly to raise myself  from my chair  i felt perfectly well  very light and comfortable  and  quite confident in my mind  i was going fast all over  my heart  for  example  was beating a thousand times a second  but that caused me no  discomfort at all  i looked out of the window  an immovable cyclist  head  down and with a frozen puff of dust behind his driving wheel  scorched to  overtake a galloping  char a banc  that did not stir  i gaped in  amazement at this incredible spectacle   gibberne   i cried   how long  will this confounded stuff last       heaven knows   he answered   last time i took it i went to bed and slept  it off  i tell you  i was frightened  it must have lasted some minutes  i  think  it seemed like hours  but after a bit it slows down rather  suddenly  i believe      i was proud to observe that i did not feel frightened  i suppose because  there were two of us   why shouldn t we go out   i asked      why not       they ll see us       not they  goodness  no  why  we shall be going a thousand times faster  than the quickest conjuring trick that was ever done  come along  which  way shall we go  window  or door      and out by the window we went     assuredly of all the strange experiences that i have ever had  or  imagined  or read of other people having or imagining  that little raid i  made with gibberne on the folkestone leas  under the influence of the new  accelerator  was the strangest and maddest of all  we went out by his gate  into the road  and there we made a minute examination of the statuesque  passing traffic  the tops of the wheels and some of the legs of the horses  of this  char a banc   the end of the whip lash and the lower jaw of  the conductor  who was just beginning to yawn  were perceptibly in motion   but all the rest of the lumbering conveyance seemed still  and quite  noiseless except for a faint rattling that came from one man s throat  and  as parts of this frozen edifice there were a driver  you know  and a  conductor  and eleven people  the effect as we walked about the thing  began by being madly queer and ended by being  disagreeable  there they  were  people like ourselves and yet not like ourselves  frozen in careless  attitudes  caught in mid gesture  a girl and a man smiled at one another   a leering smile that threatened to last for evermore  a woman in a floppy  capelline rested her arm on the rail and stared at gibberne s house with  the unwinking stare of eternity  a man stroked his moustache like a figure  of wax  and another stretched a tiresome stiff hand with extended fingers  towards his loosened hat  we stared at them  we laughed at them  we made  faces at them  and then a sort of disgust of them came upon us  and we  turned away and walked round in front of the cyclist towards the leas      goodness   cried gibberne  suddenly   look there      he pointed  and there at the tip of his finger and sliding down the air  with wings flapping slowly and at the speed of an exceptionally languid  snail  was a bee     and so we came out upon the leas  there the thing seemed madder than ever   the band was playing in the upper stand  though all the sound it made for  us was a low pitched  wheezy rattle  a sort of prolonged last sigh that  passed at times into a sound like the slow  muffled ticking of some  monstrous clock  frozen people stood erect  strange  silent   self conscious looking dummies hung unstably in mid stride  promenading  upon the grass  i passed close to a little poodle dog suspended in the act  of leaping  and watched the slow movement of his legs as he sank to earth    lord  look  here    cried gibberne  and we halted for a moment  before a magnificent person in white faint  striped flannels  white shoes   and a panama hat  who turned back to wink at two gaily dressed ladies he  had passed  a wink  studied with such leisurely deliberation as we could  afford  is an unattractive thing  it loses any quality of alert gaiety   and one remarks that the winking eye does not completely close  that under  its drooping lid appears the lower edge of an eyeball and a little line of  white   heaven give me memory   said i   and i will never wink again       or smile   said gibberne  with his eye on the lady s answering teeth      it s infernally hot  somehow   said i   let s go slower       oh  come along   said gibberne     we picked our way among the bath chairs in the path  many of the people  sitting in the chairs seemed almost natural in their passive poses  but  the contorted scarlet of the bandsmen was not a restful thing to see  a  purple faced little gentleman was frozen in the midst of a violent  struggle to refold his newspaper against the wind  there were many  evidences that all these people in their sluggish way were exposed to a  considerable breeze  a breeze that had no existence so far as our  sensations went  we came out and walked a little way from the crowd  and  turned and regarded it  to see all that multitude changed to a picture   smitten rigid  as it were  into the semblance of realistic wax  was  impossibly wonderful  it was absurd  of course  but it filled me with an  irrational  an exultant sense of superior advantage  consider the wonder  of it  all that i had said  and thought  and done since the stuff had  begun to work in my veins had happened  so far as those people  so far as  the world in general went  in the twinkling of an eye   the new  accelerator      i began  but gibberne interrupted me      there s that infernal old woman   he said      what old woman       lives next door to me   said gibberne   has a lapdog that yaps  gods  the  temptation is strong      there is something very boyish and impulsive about gibberne at times   before i could expostulate with him he had dashed forward  snatched the  unfortunate animal out of visible existence  and was running violently  with it towards the cliff of the leas  it was most extraordinary  the  little brute  you know  didn t bark or wriggle or make the slightest sign  of vitality  it kept quite stiffly in an attitude of somnolent repose  and  gibberne held it by the neck  it was like running about with a dog of  wood   gibberne   i cried   put it down   then i said something else   if  you run like that  gibberne   i cried   you ll set your clothes on fire   your linen trousers are going brown as it is      he clapped his hand on his thigh and stood hesitating on the verge    gibberne   i cried  coming up   put it down  this heat is too much  it s  our running so  two or three miles a second  friction of the air       what   he said  glancing at the dog      friction of the air   i shouted   friction of the air  going too fast   like meteorites and things  too hot  and  gibberne  gibberne  i m all over  pricking and a sort of perspiration  you can see people stirring slightly   i believe the stuff s working off  put that dog down       eh   he said      it s working off   i repeated   we re too hot and the stuff s working  off  i m wet through      he stared at me  then at the band  the wheezy rattle of whose performance  was certainly going faster  then with a tremendous sweep of the arm he  hurled the dog away from him and it went spinning upward  still inanimate   and hung at last over the grouped parasols of a knot of chattering people   gibberne was gripping my elbow   by jove   he cried   i believe it  is  a sort of hot pricking and  yes  that man s moving his  pocket handkerchief  perceptibly  we must get out of this sharp      but we could not get out of it sharply enough  luckily  perhaps  for we  might have run  and if we had run we should  i believe  have burst into  flames  almost certainly we should have burst into flames  you know we had  neither of us thought of that    but before we could even begin to run  the action of the drug had ceased  it was the business of a minute  fraction of a second  the effect of the new accelerator passed like the  drawing of a curtain  vanished in the movement of a hand  i heard  gibberne s voice in infinite alarm   sit down   he said  and flop  down  upon the turf at the edge of the leas i sat  scorching as i sat  there is  a patch of burnt grass there still where i sat down  the whole stagnation  seemed to wake up as i did so  the disarticulated vibration of the band  rushed together into a blast of music  the promenaders put their feet down  and walked their ways  the papers and flags began flapping  smiles passed  into words  the winker finished his wink and went on his way complacently   and all the seated people moved and spoke     the whole world had come alive again  was going as fast as we were  or  rather we were going no faster than the rest of the world  it was like  slowing down as one comes into a railway station  everything seemed to  spin round for a second or two  i had the most transient feeling of  nausea  and that was all  and the little dog  which had seemed to hang for  a moment when the force of gibberne s arm was expended  fell with a swift  acceleration clean through a lady s parasol     that was the saving of us  unless it was for one corpulent old gentleman  in a bath chair  who certainly did start at the sight of us  and  afterwards regarded us at intervals with a darkly suspicious eye  and   finally  i believe  said something to his nurse about us  i doubt if a  solitary person remarked our sudden appearance among them  plop  we must  have appeared abruptly  we ceased to smoulder almost at once  though the  turf beneath me was uncomfortably hot  the attention of every one    including even the amusements  association band  which on this occasion   for the only time in its history  got out of tune  was arrested by the  amazing fact  and the still more amazing yapping and uproar caused by the  fact  that a respectable  over fed lapdog sleeping quietly to the east of  the bandstand should suddenly fall through the parasol of a lady on the  west  in a slightly singed condition due to the extreme velocity of its  movements through the air  in these absurd days  too  when we are all  trying to be as psychic  and silly  and superstitious as possible  people  got up and trod on other people  chairs were overturned  the leas  policeman ran  how the matter settled itself i do not know  we were much  too anxious to disentangle ourselves from the affair and get out of range  of the eye of the old gentleman in the bath chair to make minute  inquiries  as soon as we were sufficiently cool and sufficiently recovered  from our giddiness and nausea and confusion of mind to do so we stood up   and skirting the crowd  directed our steps back along the road below the  metropole towards gibberne s house  but amidst the din i heard very  distinctly the gentleman who had been sitting beside the lady of the  ruptured sunshade using quite unjustifiable threats and language to one of  those chair attendants who have  inspector  written on their caps   if you  didn t throw the dog   he said   who  did       the sudden return of movement and familiar noises  and our natural anxiety  about ourselves  our clothes were still dreadfully hot  and the fronts of  the thighs of gibberne s white trousers were scorched a drabbish brown    prevented the minute observations i should have liked to make on all these  things  indeed  i really made no observations of any scientific value on  that return  the bee  of course  had gone  i looked for that cyclist  but  he was already out of sight as we came into the upper sandgate road or  hidden from us by traffic  the  char a banc   however  with its  people now all alive and stirring  was clattering along at a spanking pace  almost abreast of the nearer church     we noted  however  that the window sill on which we had stepped in getting  out of the house was slightly singed  and that the impressions of our feet  on the gravel of the path were unusually deep     so it was i had my first experience of the new accelerator  practically we  had been running about and saying and doing all sorts of things in the  space of a second or so of time  we had lived half an hour while the band  had played  perhaps  two bars  but the effect it had upon us was that the  whole world had stopped for our convenient inspection  considering all  things  and particularly considering our rashness in venturing out of the  house  the experience might certainly have been much more disagreeable  than it was  it showed  no doubt  that gibberne has still much to learn  before his preparation is a manageable convenience  but its practicability  it certainly demonstrated beyond all cavil     since that adventure he has been steadily bringing its use under control   and i have several times  and without the slightest bad result  taken  measured doses under his direction  though i must confess i have not yet  ventured abroad again while under its influence  i may mention  for  example  that this story has been written at one sitting and without  interruption  except for the nibbling of some chocolate  by its means  i  began at       and my watch is now very nearly at the minute past the  half hour  the convenience of securing a long  uninterrupted spell of work  in the midst of a day full of engagements cannot be exaggerated  gibberne  is now working at the quantitative handling of his preparation  with  especial reference to its distinctive effects upon different types of  constitution  he then hopes to find a retarder  with which to dilute its  present rather excessive potency  the retarder will  of course  have the  reverse effect to the accelerator  used alone it should enable the patient  to spread a few seconds over many hours of ordinary time  and so to  maintain an apathetic inaction  a glacier like absence of alacrity  amidst  the most animated or irritating surroundings  the two things together must  necessarily work an entire revolution in civilised existence  it is the  beginning of our escape from that time garment of which carlyle speaks   while this accelerator will enable us to concentrate ourselves with  tremendous impact upon any moment or occasion that demands our utmost  sense and vigour  the retarder will enable us to pass in passive  tranquillity through infinite hardship and tedium  perhaps i am a little  optimistic about the retarder  which has indeed still to be discovered   but about the accelerator there is no possible sort of doubt whatever  its  appearance upon the market in a convenient  controllable  and assimilable  form is a matter of the next few months  it will be obtainable of all  chemists and druggists  in small green bottles  at a high but  considering  its extraordinary qualities  by no means excessive price  gibberne s  nervous accelerator it will be called  and he hopes to be able to supply  it in three strengths  one in      one in      and one in        distinguished by yellow  pink  and white labels respectively     no doubt its use renders a great number of very extraordinary things  possible  for  of course  the most remarkable and  possibly  even criminal  proceedings may be effected with impunity by thus dodging  as it were   into the interstices of time  like all potent preparations  it will be  liable to abuse  we have  however  discussed this aspect of the question  very thoroughly  and we have decided that this is purely a matter of  medical jurisprudence and altogether outside our province  we shall  manufacture and sell the accelerator  and as for the consequences  we  shall see             xxviii       the truth about pyecraft       he sits not a dozen yards away  if i glance over my shoulder i can see  him  and if i catch his eye  and usually i catch his eye  it meets me with  an expression        it is mainly an imploring look  and yet with suspicion in it     confound his suspicion  if i wanted to tell on him i should have told long  ago  i don t tell and i don t tell  and he ought to feel at his ease  as  if anything so gross and fat as he could feel at ease  who would believe  me if i did tell     poor old pyecraft  great  uneasy jelly of substance  the fattest clubman  in london     he sits at one of the little club tables in the huge bay by the fire   stuffing  what is he stuffing  i glance judiciously  and catch him biting  at a round of hot buttered teacake  with his eyes on me  confound him     with his eyes on me     that settles it  pyecraft  since you  will  be abject  since you   will  behave as though i was not a man of honour  here  right under  your embedded eyes  i write the thing down  the plain truth about  pyecraft  the man i helped  the man i shielded  and who has requited me by  making my club unendurable  absolutely unendurable  with his liquid  appeal  with the perpetual  don t tell  of his looks     and  besides  why does he keep on eternally eating     well  here goes for the truth  the whole truth  and nothing but the truth     pyecraft      i made the acquaintance of pyecraft in this very  smoking room  i was a young  nervous new member  and he saw it  i was  sitting all alone  wishing i knew more of the members  and suddenly he  came  a great rolling front of chins and abdomina  towards me  and  grunted and sat down in a chair close by me and wheezed for a space  and  scraped for a space with a match and lit a cigar  and then addressed me   i forget what he said  something about the matches not lighting properly   and afterwards as he talked he kept stopping the waiters one by one as  they went by  and telling them about the matches in that thin  fluty  voice he has  but  anyhow  it was in some such way we began our talking     he talked about various things and came round to games  and thence to my  figure and complexion    you  ought to be a good cricketer   he said   i suppose i am slender  slender to what some people would call lean  and i  suppose i am rather dark  still    i am not ashamed of having a hindu  great grandmother  but  for all that  i don t want casual strangers to see  through me at a glance to  her   so that i was set against pyecraft  from the beginning     but he only talked about me in order to get to himself      i expect   he said   you take no more exercise than i do  and probably  you eat no less    like all excessively obese people he fancied he ate  nothing    yet   and he smiled an oblique smile   we differ      and then he began to talk about his fatness and his fatness  all he did  for his fatness and all he was going to do for his fatness  what people  had advised him to do for his fatness and what he had heard of people  doing for fatness similar to his    a priori    he said   one would  think a question of nutrition could be answered by dietary and a question  of assimilation by drugs   it was stifling  it was dumpling talk  it made  me feel swelled to hear him     one stands that sort of thing once in a way at a club  but a time came  when i fancied i was standing too much  he took to me altogether too  conspicuously  i could never go into the smoking room but he would come  wallowing towards me  and sometimes he came and gormandised round and  about me while i had my lunch  he seemed at times almost to be clinging to  me  he was a bore  but not so fearful a bore as to be limited to me and  from the first there was something in his manner  almost as though he  knew  almost as though he penetrated to the fact that i  might   that  there was a remote  exceptional chance in me that no one else presented      i d give anything to get it down   he would say   anything   and peer at  me over his vast cheeks and pant  poor old pyecraft  he has just gonged   no doubt to order another buttered teacake     he came to the actual thing one day   our pharmacopoeia   he said   our  western pharmacopoeia  is anything but the last word of medical science   in the east  i ve been told         he stopped and stared at me  it was like being at an aquarium     i was quite suddenly angry with him   look here   i said   who told you  about my great grandmother s recipes       well   he fenced      every time we ve met for a week   i said   and we ve met pretty often    you ve given me a broad hint or so about that little secret of mine       well   he said   now the cat s out of the bag  i ll admit  yes  it is so   i had it          from pattison       indirectly   he said  which i believe was lying   yes       pattison   i said   took that stuff at his own risk   he pursed his mouth  and bowed      my great grandmother s recipes   i said   are queer things to handle  my  father was near making me promise          he didn t       no  but he warned me  he himself used one  once       ah      but do you think      suppose  suppose there did happen to be  one          the things are curious documents   i said   even the smell of  em      no      but after going so far pyecraft was resolved i should go farther  i was  always a little afraid if i tried his patience too much he would fall on  me suddenly and smother me  i own i was weak  but i was also annoyed with  pyecraft  i had got to that state of feeling for him that disposed me to  say   well   take  the risk   the little affair of pattison to which  i have alluded was a different matter altogether  what it was doesn t  concern us now  but i knew  anyhow  that the particular recipe i used then  was safe  the rest i didn t know so much about  and  on the whole  i was  inclined to doubt their safety pretty completely     yet even if pyecraft got poisoned        i must confess the poisoning of pyecraft struck me as an immense  undertaking     that evening i took that queer  odd scented sandal wood box out of my  safe  and turned the rustling skins over  the gentleman who wrote the  recipes for my great grandmother evidently had a weakness for skins of a  miscellaneous origin  and his handwriting was cramped to the last degree   some of the things are quite unreadable to me  though my family  with its  indian civil service associations  has kept up a knowledge of hindustani  from generation to generation  and none are absolutely plain sailing  but  i found the one that i knew was there soon enough  and sat on the floor by  my safe for some time looking at it      look here   said i to pyecraft next day  and snatched the slip away from  his eager grasp      so far as i can make it out  this is a recipe for loss of weight    ah    said pyecraft   i m not absolutely sure  but i think it s that  and if you  take my advice you ll leave it alone  because  you know  i blacken my  blood in your interest  pyecraft  my ancestors on that side were  so far  as i can gather  a jolly queer lot  see       let me try it   said pyecraft     i leant back in my chair  my imagination made one mighty effort and fell  flat within me   what in heaven s name  pyecraft   i asked   do you think  you ll look like when you get thin      he was impervious to reason  i made him promise never to say a word to me  about his disgusting fatness again whatever happened  never  and then i  handed him that little piece of skin      it s nasty stuff   i said      no matter   he said  and took it     he goggled at it   but  but    he said    he had just discovered that it wasn t english      to the best of my ability   i said   i will do you a translation      i did my best  after that we didn t speak for a fortnight  whenever he  approached me i frowned and motioned him away  and he respected our  compact  but at the end of the fortnight he was as fat as ever  and then  he got a word in      i must speak   he said   it isn t fair  there s something wrong  it s  done me no good  you re not doing your great grandmother justice       where s the recipe      he produced it gingerly from his pocket book     i ran my eye over the items   was the egg addled   i asked      no  ought it to have been       that   i said   goes without saying in all my poor dear  great grandmother s recipes  when condition or quality is not specified  you must get the worst  she was drastic or nothing    and there s one or  two possible alternatives to some of these other things  you got  fresh   rattlesnake venom       i got a rattlesnake from jamrach s  it cost  it cost          that s your affair anyhow  this last item          i know a man who          yes  h m  well  i ll write the alternatives down  so far as i know the  language  the spelling of this recipe is particularly atrocious   by the by  dog here probably means pariah dog      for a month after that i saw pyecraft constantly at the club and as fat  and anxious as ever  he kept our treaty  but at times he broke the spirit  of it by shaking his head despondently  then one day in the cloakroom he  said   your great grandmother          not a word against her   i said  and he held his peace     i could have fancied he had desisted  and i saw him one day talking to  three new members about his fatness as though he was in search of other  recipes  and then  quite unexpectedly  his telegram came      mr  formalyn   bawled a page boy under my nose  and i took the telegram  and opened it at once       for heaven s sake come     pyecraft        h m   said i  and to tell the truth i was so pleased at the  rehabilitation of my great grandmother s reputation this evidently  promised that i made a most excellent lunch     i got pyecraft s address from the hall porter  pyecraft inhabited the  upper half of a house in bloomsbury  and i went there so soon as i had  done my coffee and trappistine  i did not wait to finish my cigar      mr  pyecraft   said i  at the front door     they believed he was ill  he hadn t been out for two days      he expects me   said i  and they sent me up     i rang the bell at the lattice door upon the landing      he shouldn t have tried it  anyhow   i said to myself   a man who eats  like a pig ought to look like a pig      an obviously worthy woman  with an anxious face and a carelessly placed  cap  came and surveyed me through the lattice     i gave my name and she let me in in a dubious fashion      well   said i  as we stood together inside pyecraft s piece of the  landing       e said you was to come in if you came   she said  and regarded me   making no motion to show me anywhere  and then  confidentially    e s  locked in  sir       locked in       locked  imself in yesterday morning and  asn t let any one in since  sir   and ever and again  swearing   oh  my      i stared at the door she indicated by her glances   in there   i said      yes  sir       what s up      she shook her head sadly    e keeps on calling for vittles  sir     eavy  vittles  e wants  i get  im what i can  pork  e s had  sooit  puddin   sossiges  noo bread  everythink like that  left outside  if you  please  and me go away   e s eatin   sir  somethink  awful       there came a piping bawl from inside the door   that formalyn       that you  pyecraft   i shouted  and went and banged the door      tell her to go away      i did     then i could hear a curious pattering upon the door  almost like some one  feeling for the handle in the dark  and pyecraft s familiar grunts      it s all right   i said   she s gone      but for a long time the door didn t open     i heard the key turn  then pyecraft s voice said   come in      i turned the handle and opened the door  naturally i expected to see  pyecraft     well  you know  he wasn t there     i never had such a shock in my life  there was his sitting room in a state  of untidy disorder  plates and dishes among the books and writing things   and several chairs overturned  but pyecraft         it s all right  old man  shut the door   he said  and then i discovered  him     there he was  right up close to the cornice in the corner by the door  as  though some one had glued him to the ceiling  his face was anxious and  angry  he panted and gesticulated   shut the door   he said   if that  woman gets hold of it         i shut the door  and went and stood away from him and stared      if anything gives way and you tumble down   i said   you ll break your  neck  pyecraft       i wish i could   he wheezed      a man of your age and weight getting up to kiddish gymnastics          don t   he said  and looked agonised      i ll tell you   he said  and gesticulated      how the deuce   said i   are you holding on up there      and then abruptly i realised that he was not holding on at all  that he  was floating up there  just as a gas filled bladder might have floated in  the same position  he began a struggle to thrust himself away from the  ceiling and to clamber down the wall to me   it s that prescription   he  panted  as he did so   your great gran         he took hold of a framed engraving rather carelessly as he spoke and it  gave way  and he flew back to the ceiling again  while the picture smashed  on to the sofa  bump he went against the ceiling  and i knew then why he  was all over white on the more salient curves and angles of his person  he  tried again more carefully  coming down by way of the mantel     it was really a most extraordinary spectacle  that great  fat   apoplectic looking man upside down and trying to get from the ceiling  to the floor   that prescription   he said   too successful       how       loss of weight  almost complete      and then  of course  i understood      by jove  pyecraft   said i   what you wanted was a cure for fatness  but  you always called it weight  you would call it weight      somehow i was extremely delighted  i quite liked pyecraft for the time    let me help you   i said  and took his hand and pulled him down  he  kicked about  trying to get foothold somewhere  it was very like holding a  flag on a windy day      that table   he said  pointing   is solid mahogany and very heavy  if you  can put me under that         i did  and there he wallowed about like a captive balloon  while i stood  on his hearthrug and talked to him     i lit a cigar   tell me   i said   what happened       i took it   he said      how did it taste       oh   beastly       i should fancy they all did  whether one regards the ingredients or  the probable compound or the possible results  almost all my  great grandmother s remedies appear to me at least to be extraordinarily  uninviting  for my own part         i took a little sip first       yes       and as i felt lighter and better after an hour  i decided to take the  draught       my dear pyecraft       i held my nose   he explained   and then i kept on getting lighter and  lighter  and helpless  you know      he gave way suddenly to a burst of passion   what the goodness am i to   do    he said      there s one thing pretty evident   i said   that you mustn t do  if you  go out of doors you ll go up and up   i waved an arm upward   they d have  to send santos dumont after you to bring you down again       i suppose it will wear off      i shook my head   i don t think you can count on that   i said     and then there was another burst of passion  and he kicked out at adjacent  chairs and banged the floor  he behaved just as i should have expected a  great  fat  self indulgent man to behave under trying circumstances  that  is to say  very badly  he spoke of me and of my great grandmother with an  utter want of discretion      i never asked you to take the stuff   i said     and generously disregarding the insults he was putting upon me  i sat down  in his armchair and began to talk to him in a sober  friendly fashion     i pointed out to him that this was a trouble he had brought upon himself   and that it had almost an air of poetical justice  he had eaten too much   this he disputed  and for a time we argued the point     he became noisy and violent  so i desisted from this aspect of his lesson    and then   said i   you committed the sin of euphuism  you called it  not  fat  which is just and inglorious  but weight  you         he interrupted to say that he recognised all that  what was he to   do      i suggested he should adapt himself to his new conditions  so we came to  the really sensible part of the business  i suggested that it would not be  difficult for him to learn to walk about on the ceiling with his hands         i can t sleep   he said     but that was no great difficulty  it was quite possible  i pointed out  to  make a shake up under a wire mattress  fasten the under things on with  tapes  and have a blanket  sheet  and coverlet to button at the side  he  would have to confide in his housekeeper  i said  and after some  squabbling he agreed to that   afterwards it was quite delightful to see  the beautifully matter of fact way with which the good lady took all these  amazing inversions   he could have a library ladder in his room  and all  his meals could be laid on the top of his bookcase  we also hit on an  ingenious device by which he could get to the floor whenever he wanted   which was simply to put the  british encyclopaedia   tenth edition   on the top of his open shelves  he just pulled out a couple of volumes and  held on  and down he came  and we agreed there must be iron staples along  the skirting  so that he could cling to those whenever he wanted to get  about the room on the lower level     as we got on with the thing i found myself almost keenly interested  it  was i who called in the housekeeper and broke matters to her  and it was i  chiefly who fixed up the inverted bed  in fact  i spent two whole days at  his flat  i am a handy  interfering sort of man with a screw driver  and i  made all sorts of ingenious adaptations for him  ran a wire to bring his  bells within reach  turned all his electric lights up instead of down  and  so on  the whole affair was extremely curious and interesting to me  and  it was delightful to think of pyecraft like some great  fat blow fly   crawling about on his ceiling and clambering round the lintel of his doors  from one room to another  and never  never  never coming to the club any  more       then  you know  my fatal ingenuity got the better of me  i was sitting by  his fire drinking his whisky  and he was up in his favourite corner by the  cornice  tacking a turkey carpet to the ceiling  when the idea struck me    by jove  pyecraft   i said   all this is totally unnecessary      and before i could calculate the complete consequences of my notion i  blurted it out   lead underclothing   said i  and the mischief was done     pyecraft received the thing almost in tears   to be right ways up  again      he said     i gave him the whole secret before i saw where it would take me   buy  sheet lead   i said   stamp it into discs  sew  em all over your  underclothes until you have enough  have lead soled boots  carry a bag of  solid lead  and the thing is done  instead of being a prisoner here you  may go abroad again  pyecraft  you may travel         a still happier idea came to me   you need never fear a shipwreck  all you  need do is just slip off some or all of your clothes  take the necessary  amount of luggage in your hand  and float up in the air         in his emotion he dropped the tack hammer within an ace of my head   by  jove   he said   i shall be able to come back to the club again       the thing pulled me up short  by jove   i said  faintly   yes  of  course  you will      he did  he does  there he sits behind me now  stuffing  as i live   a  third go of buttered teacake  and no one in the whole world knows  except  his housekeeper and me   that he weighs practically nothing  that he is a  mere boring mass of assimilatory matter  mere clouds in clothing    niente  nefas   the most inconsiderable of men  there he sits  watching until i have done this writing  then  if he can  he will waylay  me  he will come billowing up to me       he will tell me over again all about it  how it feels  how it doesn t  feel  how he sometimes hopes it is passing off a little  and always  somewhere in that fat  abundant discourse he will say   the secret s  keeping  eh  if any one knew of it  i should be so ashamed    makes  a fellow look such a fool  you know  crawling about on a ceiling and all  that        and now to elude pyecraft  occupying  as he does  an admirable strategic  position between me and the door             xxix       the magic shop       i had seen the magic shop from afar several times  i had passed it once or  twice  a shop window of alluring little objects  magic balls  magic hens   wonderful cones  ventriloquist dolls  the material of the basket trick   packs of cards that  looked  all right  and all that sort of thing   but never had i thought of going in until one day  almost without warning   gip hauled me by my finger right up to the window  and so conducted  himself that there was nothing for it but to take him in  i had not  thought the place was there  to tell the truth  a modest sized frontage in  regent street  between the picture shop and the place where the chicks run  about just out of patent incubators   but there it was sure enough  i had  fancied it was down nearer the circus  or round the corner in oxford  street  or even in holborn  always over the way and a little inaccessible  it had been  with something of the mirage in its position  but here it was  now quite indisputably  and the fat end of gip s pointing finger made a  noise upon the glass      if i was rich   said gip  dabbing a finger at the disappearing egg   i d  buy myself that  and that   which was the crying baby  very human   and  that   which was a mystery  and called  so a neat card asserted   buy one  and astonish your friends       anything   said gip   will disappear under one of those cones  i have  read about it in a book      and there  dadda  is the vanishing halfpenny  only they ve put it this  way up so s we can t see how it s done      gip  dear boy  inherits his mother s breeding  and he did not propose to  enter the shop or worry in any way  only  you know  quite unconsciously   he lugged my finger doorward  and he made his interest clear      that   he said  and pointed to the magic bottle      if you had that   i said  at which promising inquiry he looked up with a  sudden radiance      i could show it to jessie   he said  thoughtful as ever of others      it s less than a hundred days to your birthday  gibbles   i said  and  laid my hand on the door handle     gip made no answer  but his grip tightened on my finger  and so we came  into the shop     it was no common shop this  it was a magic shop  and all the prancing  precedence gip would have taken in the matter of mere toys was wanting  he  left the burthen of the conversation to me     it was a little  narrow shop  not very well lit  and the door bell pinged  again with a plaintive note as we closed it behind us  for a moment or  so we were alone and could glance about us  there was a tiger in   papier mache  on the glass case that covered  the low counter  a  grave  kind eyed tiger that waggled his head in a methodical manner  there  were several crystal spheres  a china hand holding magic cards  a stock of  magic fish bowls in various sizes  and an immodest magic hat that  shamelessly displayed its springs  on the floor were magic mirrors  one to  draw you out long and thin  one to swell your head and vanish your legs   and one to make you short and fat like a draught  and while  we were  laughing at these the shopman  as i suppose  came in     at any rate  there he was behind the counter  a curious  sallow  dark man   with one ear larger than the other and a chin like the toe cap of a boot      what can we have the pleasure   he said  spreading his long magic fingers  on the glass case  and so with a start we were aware of him      i want   i said   to buy my little boy a few simple tricks       legerdemain   he asked   mechanical  domestic       anything amusing   said i      um   said the shopman  and scratched his head for a moment as if  thinking  then  quite distinctly  he drew from his head a glass ball    something in this way   he said  and held it out     the action was unexpected  i had seen the trick done at entertainments  endless times before  it s part of the common stock of conjurers  but i  had not expected it here   that s good   i said  with a laugh      isn t it   said the shopman     gip stretched out his disengaged hand to take this object and found merely  a blank palm      it s in your pocket   said the shopman  and there it was      how much will that be   i asked      we make no charge for glass balls   said the shopman politely   we get  them   he picked one out of his elbow as he spoke   free   he produced  another from the back of his neck  and laid it beside its predecessor on  the counter  gip regarded his glass ball sagely  then directed a look of  inquiry at the two on the counter  and finally brought his round eyed  scrutiny to the shopman  who smiled   you may have those two   said the  shopman   and  if you  don t  mind one from my mouth   so       gip counselled me mutely for a moment  and then in a profound silence put  away the four balls  resumed my reassuring finger  and nerved himself for  the next event      we get all our smaller tricks in that way   the shopman remarked     i laughed in the manner of one who subscribes to a jest   instead of going  to the wholesale shop   i said   of course  it s cheaper       in a way   the shopman said   though we pay in the end  but not so  heavily  as people suppose    our larger tricks  and our daily provisions  and all the other things we want  we get out of that hat    and you know   sir  if you ll excuse my saying it  there  isn t  a wholesale shop   not for genuine magic goods  sir  i don t know if you noticed our  inscription  the genuine magic shop   he drew a business card from his  cheek and handed it to me   genuine   he said  with his finger on the  word  and added   there is absolutely no deception  sir      he seemed to be carrying out the joke pretty thoroughly  i thought     he turned to gip with a smile of remarkable affability   you  you know   are the right sort of boy      i was surprised at his knowing that  because  in the interests of  discipline  we keep it rather a secret even at home  but gip received it  in unflinching silence  keeping a steadfast eye on him      it s only the right sort of boy gets through that doorway      and  as if by way of illustration  there came a rattling at the door  and  a squeaking little voice could be faintly heard   nyar  i  warn   a  go in there  dadda  i warn  a go in there  ny a a ah   and then the  accents of a downtrodden parent  urging consolations and propitiations    it s locked  edward   he said      but it isn t   said i      it is  sir   said the shopman   always  for that sort of child   and as  he spoke we had a glimpse of the other youngster  a little  white face   pallid from sweet eating and over sapid food  and distorted by evil  passions  a ruthless little egotist  pawing at the enchanted pane   it s  no good  sir   said the shopman  as i moved  with my natural helpfulness   doorward  and presently the spoilt child was carried off howling      how do you manage that   i said  breathing a little more freely      magic   said the shopman  with a careless wave of the hand  and behold   sparks of coloured fire flew out of his fingers and vanished into the  shadows of the shop      you were saying   he said  addressing himself to gip   before you came  in  that you would like one of our  buy one and astonish your friends   boxes      gip  after a gallant effort  said  yes       it s in your pocket      and leaning over the counter  he really had an extraordinary long body    this amazing person produced the article in the customary conjurer s  manner   paper   he said  and took a sheet out of the empty hat with the  springs   string   and behold his mouth was a string box  from which he  drew an unending thread  which when he had tied his parcel he bit off    and  it seemed to me  swallowed the ball of string  and then he lit a  candle at the nose of one of the ventriloquist s dummies  stuck one of his  fingers  which had become sealing wax red  into the flame  and so sealed  the parcel   then there was the disappearing egg   he remarked  and  produced one from within my coat breast and packed it  and also the crying  baby  very human  i handed each parcel to gip as it was ready  and he  clasped them to his chest     he said very little  but his eyes were eloquent  the clutch of his arms  was eloquent  he was the playground of unspeakable emotions  these  you  know  were  real  magics     then  with a start  i discovered something moving about in my hat    something soft and jumpy  i whipped it off  and a ruffled pigeon  no doubt  a confederate  dropped out and ran on the counter  and went  i fancy  into  a cardboard box behind the  papier mache  tiger      tut  tut   said the shopman  dexterously relieving  me of my headdress    careless bird  and  as i live  nesting      he shook my hat  and shook out into his extended hand  two or three eggs   a large marble  a watch  about half a dozen of the inevitable glass balls   and then crumpled  crinkled paper  more and more and more  talking all the  time of the way in which people neglect to brush their hats  inside   as well as out  politely  of course  but with a certain personal  application   all sorts of things accumulate  sir    not  you   of  course  in particular    nearly every customer    astonishing what they  carry about with them     the crumpled paper rose and billowed on the  counter more and more and more  until he was nearly hidden from us  until  he was altogether hidden  and still his voice went on and on   we none of  us know what the fair semblance of a human being may conceal  sir  are we  all then no better than brushed exteriors  whited sepulchres          his voice stopped  exactly like when you hit a neighbour s gramophone with  a well aimed brick  the same instant silence  and the rustle of the paper  stopped  and everything was still        have you done with my hat   i said  after an interval     there was no answer     i stared at gip  and gip stared at me  and there were our distortions in  the magic mirrors  looking very rum  and grave  and quiet        i think we ll go now   i said   will you tell me how much all this comes  to         i say   i said  on a rather louder note   i want the bill  and my hat   please      it might have been a sniff from behind the paper pile        let s look behind the counter  gip   i said   he s making fun of us      i led gip round the head wagging tiger  and what do you think there was  behind the counter  no one at all  only my hat on the floor  and a common  conjurer s lop eared white rabbit lost in meditation  and looking as  stupid and crumpled as only a conjurer s rabbit can do  i resumed my hat   and the rabbit lolloped a lollop or so out of my way      dadda   said gip  in a guilty whisper      what is it  gip   said i      i  do  like this shop  dadda       so should i   i said to myself   if the counter wouldn t suddenly extend  itself to shut one off from the door   but i didn t call gip s attention  to that   pussy   he said  with a hand out to the rabbit as it came  lolloping past us   pussy  do gip a magic   and his eyes followed it as it  squeezed through a door i had certainly not remarked a moment before  then  this door opened wider  and the man with one ear larger than the other  appeared again  he was smiling still  but his eye met mine with something  between amusement and defiance   you d like to see our showroom  sir   he  said  with an innocent suavity  gip tugged my finger forward  i glanced at  the counter and met the shopman s eye again  i was beginning to think the  magic just a little too genuine   we haven t  very  much time   i  said  but somehow we were inside the showroom before i could finish that      all goods of the same quality   said the shopman  rubbing his flexible  hands together   and that is the best  nothing in the place that isn t  genuine magic  and warranted thoroughly rum  excuse me  sir      i felt him pull at something that clung to my coat sleeve  and then i saw  he held a little  wriggling red demon by the tail  the little creature bit  and fought and tried to get at his hand  and in a moment he tossed it  carelessly behind a counter  no doubt the thing was only an image of  twisted indiarubber  but for the moment    and his gesture was exactly  that of a man who handles some petty biting bit of vermin  i glanced at  gip  but gip was looking at a magic rocking horse  i was glad he hadn t  seen the thing   i say   i said  in an undertone  and indicating gip and  the red demon with my eyes   you haven t many things like  that   about  have you       none of ours  probably brought it with you   said the shopman  also in an  undertone  and with a more dazzling smile than ever   astonishing what  people  will   carry about with them unawares   and then to gip   do  you see anything you fancy here      there were many things that gip fancied there     he turned to this astonishing tradesman with mingled confidence and  respect   is that a magic sword   he said      a magic toy sword  it neither bends  breaks  nor cuts the fingers  it  renders the bearer invincible in battle against any one under eighteen   half a crown to seven and sixpence  according to size  these panoplies on  cards are for juvenile knights errant and very useful  shield of safety   sandals of swiftness  helmet of invisibility       oh  dadda   gasped gip     i tried to find out what they cost  but the shopman did not heed me   he had got gip now  he had got him away from my finger  he had embarked  upon the exposition of all his confounded stock  and nothing was going to  stop him  presently i saw with a qualm of distrust and something very like  jealousy that gip had hold of this person s finger as usually he has hold  of mine  no doubt the fellow was interesting  i thought  and had an  interestingly faked lot of stuff  really  good  faked stuff   still        i wandered after them  saying very little  but keeping an eye on this  prestidigital fellow  after all  gip was enjoying it  and no doubt when  the time came to go we should be able to go quite easily     it was a long  rambling place  that showroom  a gallery broken up by  stands and stalls and pillars  with archways leading off to other  departments  in which the queerest looking assistants loafed and stared at  one  and with perplexing mirrors and curtains  so perplexing  indeed  were  these that i was presently unable to make out the door by which we had  come     the shopman showed gip magic trains that ran without steam or clockwork   just as you set the signals  and then some very  very valuable boxes of  soldiers that all came alive directly you took off the lid and said    i  myself haven t a very quick ear  and it was a tongue twisting sound  but  gip  he has his mother s ear  got it in no time   bravo   said the  shopman  putting the men back into the box unceremoniously and handing it  to gip   now   said the shopman  and in a moment gip had made them all  alive again      you ll take that box   asked the shopman      we ll take that box   said i   unless you charge its full value  in which  case it would need a trust magnate          dear heart   no    and the shopman swept the little men back again   shut the lid  waved the box in the air  and there it was  in brown paper   tied up and   with gip s full name and address on the paper      the shopman laughed at my amazement      this is the genuine magic   he said   the real thing       it s a little too genuine for my taste   i said again     after that he fell to showing gip tricks  odd tricks  and still odder the  way they were done  he explained them  he turned them inside out  and  there was the dear little chap nodding his busy bit of a head in the  sagest manner     i did not attend as well as i might   hey  presto   said the magic  shopman  and then would come the clear  small  hey  presto   of the boy   but i was distracted by other things  it was being borne in upon me just  how tremendously rum this place was  it was  so to speak  inundated by a  sense of rumness  there was something a little rum about the fixtures  even  about the ceiling  about the floor  about the casually distributed  chairs  i had a queer feeling that whenever i wasn t looking at them  straight they went askew  and moved about  and played a noiseless  puss in the corner behind my back  and the cornice had a serpentine design  with masks  masks altogether too expressive for proper plaster     then abruptly my attention was caught by one of the odd looking  assistants  he was some way off and evidently unaware of my presence  i  saw a sort of three quarter length of him over a pile of toys and through  an arch  and  you know  he was leaning against a pillar in an idle sort of  way doing the most horrid things with his features  the particular horrid  thing he did was with his nose  he did it just as though he was idle and  wanted to amuse himself  first of all it was a short  blobby nose  and  then suddenly he shot it out like a telescope  and then out it flew and  became thinner and thinner until it was like a long  red flexible whip   like a thing in a nightmare it was  he flourished it about and flung it  forth as a fly fisher flings his line     my instant thought was that gip mustn t see him  i turned about  and there  was gip quite preoccupied with the shopman  and thinking no evil  they  were whispering together and looking at me  gip was standing on a little  stool  and the shopman was holding a sort of big drum in his hand      hide and seek  dadda   cried gip   you re he      and before i could do anything to prevent it  the shopman had clapped the  big drum over him     i saw what was up directly   take that off   i cried   this instant   you ll frighten the boy  take it off      the shopman with the unequal ears did so without a word  and held the big  cylinder towards me to show its emptiness  and the little stool was  vacant  in that instant my boy had utterly disappeared        you know  perhaps  that sinister something that comes like a hand out of  the unseen and grips your heart about  you know it takes your common self  away and leaves you tense and deliberate  neither slow nor hasty  neither  angry nor afraid  so it was with me     i came up to this grinning shopman and kicked his stool aside      stop this folly   i said   where is my boy       you see   he said  still displaying the drum s interior   there is no  deception         i put out my hand to grip him  and he eluded me by a dexterous movement  i  snatched again  and he turned from me and pushed open a door to escape    stop   i said  and he laughed  receding  i leapt after him  into utter  darkness      thud       lor  bless my  eart  i didn t see you coming  sir      i was in regent street  and i had collided with a decent looking working  man  and a yard away  perhaps  and looking a little perplexed with  himself  was gip  there was some sort of apology  and then gip had turned  and come to me with a bright little smile  as though for a moment he had  missed me     and he was carrying four parcels in his arm     he secured immediate possession of my finger     for the second i was rather at a loss  i stared round to see the door of  the magic shop  and  behold  it was not there  there was no door  no shop   nothing  only the common pilaster between the shop where they sell  pictures and the window with the chicks         i did the only thing possible in that mental tumult  i walked straight to  the kerbstone and held up my umbrella for a cab       ansoms   said gip  in a note of culminating exultation     i helped him in  recalled my address with an effort  and got in also   something unusual proclaimed itself in my tail coat pocket  and i felt and  discovered a glass ball  with a petulant expression i flung it into the  street     gip said nothing     for a space neither of us spoke      dadda   said gip  at last   that  was  a proper shop      i came round with that to the problem of just how the whole thing had  seemed to him  he looked completely undamaged  so far  good  he was  neither scared nor unhinged  he was simply tremendously satisfied with the  afternoon s entertainment  and there in his arms were the four parcels     confound it  what could be in them      um   i said   little boys can t go to shops like that every day      he received this with his usual stoicism  and for a moment i was sorry i  was his father and not his mother  and so couldn t suddenly there    coram publico   in our hansom  kiss him  after all  i thought  the  thing wasn t so very bad     but it was only when we opened the parcels that i really began to be  reassured  three of them contained boxes of soldiers  quite ordinary lead  soldiers  but of so good a quality as to make gip altogether forget that  originally these parcels had been magic tricks of the only genuine sort   and the fourth contained a kitten  a little living white kitten  in  excellent health and appetite and temper     i saw this unpacking with a sort of provisional relief  i hung about in  the nursery for quite an unconscionable time       that happened six months ago  and now i am beginning to believe it is  all right  the kitten had only the magic natural to all kittens  and  the soldiers seemed as steady a company as any colonel could desire  and  gip         the intelligent parent will understand that i have to go cautiously with  gip     but i went so far as this one day  i said   how would you like your  soldiers to come alive  gip  and march about by themselves       mine do   said gip   i just have to say a word i know before i open the  lid       then they march about alone       oh   quite   dadda  i shouldn t like them if they didn t do that      i displayed no unbecoming surprise  and since then i have taken occasion  to drop in upon him once or twice  unannounced  when the soldiers were  about  but so far i have never discovered them performing in anything like  a magical manner       it s so difficult to tell     there s also a question of finance  i have an incurable habit of paying  bills  i have been up and down regent street several times looking for  that shop  i am inclined to think  indeed  that in that matter honour is  satisfied  and that  since gip s name and address are known to them  i may  very well leave it to these people  whoever they may be  to send in their  bill in their own time             xxx       the empire of the ants       when captain gerilleau received instructions to take his new gunboat  the   benjamin constant   to badama on the batemo arm of the guaramadema  and there assist the inhabitants against a plague of ants  he suspected  the authorities of mockery  his promotion had been romantic and irregular   the affections of a prominent brazilian lady and the captain s liquid eyes  had played a part in the process  and the  diario  and  o  futuro  had been lamentably disrespectful in their comments  he felt he  was to give further occasion for disrespect     he was a creole  his conceptions of etiquette and discipline were  pure blooded portuguese  and it was only to holroyd  the lancashire  engineer who had come over with the boat  and as an exercise in the use of  english  his  th  sounds were very uncertain  that he opened his heart      it is in effect   he said   to make me absurd  what can a man do against  ants  dey come  dey go       they say   said holroyd   that these don t go  that chap you said was a  sambo          zambo   it is a sort of mixture of blood       sambo  he said the people are going      the captain smoked fretfully for a time   dese tings  ave to happen   he  said at last   what is it  plagues of ants and suchlike as god wills  dere  was a plague in trinidad  the little ants that carry leaves  orl der  orange trees  all der mangoes  what does it matter  sometimes ant armies  come into your houses  fighting ants  a different sort  you go and they  clean the house  then you come back again   the house is clean  like new   no cockroaches  no fleas  no jiggers in the floor       that sambo chap   said holroyd   says these are a different sort of ant      the captain shrugged his shoulders  fumed  and gave his attention to a  cigarette     afterwards he reopened the subject   my dear  olroyd  what am i to do  about dese infernal ants      the captain reflected   it is ridiculous   he said  but in the afternoon  he put on his full uniform and went ashore  and jars and boxes came back  to the ship and subsequently he did  and holroyd sat on deck in the  evening coolness and smoked profoundly and marvelled at brazil  they were  six days up the amazon  some hundreds of miles from the ocean  and east  and west of him there was a horizon like the sea  and to the south nothing  but a sand bank island with some tufts of scrub  the water was always  running like a sluice  thick with dirt  animated with crocodiles and  hovering birds  and fed by some inexhaustible source of tree trunks  and  the waste of it  the headlong waste of it  filled his soul  the town of  alemquer  with its meagre church  its thatched sheds for houses  its  discoloured ruins of ampler days  seemed a little thing lost in this  wilderness of nature  a sixpence dropped on sahara  he was a young man   this was his first sight of the tropics  he came straight from england   where nature is hedged  ditched  and drained  into the perfection of  submission  and he had suddenly discovered the insignificance of man  for  six days they had been steaming up from the sea by unfrequented channels   and man had been as rare as a rare butterfly  one saw one day a canoe   another day a distant station  the next no men at all  he began to  perceive that man is indeed a rare animal  having but a precarious hold  upon this land     he perceived it more clearly as the days passed  and he made his devious  way to the batemo  in the company of this remarkable commander  who ruled  over one big gun  and was forbidden to waste his ammunition  holroyd was  learning spanish industriously  but he was still in the present tense and  substantive stage of speech  and the only other person who had any words  of english was a negro stoker  who had them all wrong  the second in  command was a portuguese  da cunha  who spoke french  but it was a  different sort of french from the french holroyd had learnt in southport   and their intercourse was confined to politenesses and simple propositions  about the weather  and the weather  like everything else in this amazing  new world  the weather had no human aspect  and was hot by night and hot  by day  and the air steam  even the wind was hot steam  smelling of  vegetation in decay  and the alligators and the strange birds  the flies  of many sorts and sizes  the beetles  the ants  the snakes and monkeys  seemed to wonder what man was doing in an atmosphere that had no gladness  in its sunshine and no coolness in its night  to wear clothing was  intolerable  but to cast it aside was to scorch by day  and expose an  ampler area to the mosquitoes by night  to go on deck by day was to be  blinded by glare and to stay below was to suffocate  and in the daytime  came certain flies  extremely clever and noxious about one s wrist and  ankle  captain gerilleau  who was holroyd s sole distraction from these  physical distresses  developed into a formidable bore  telling the simple  story of his heart s affections day by day  a string of anonymous women   as if he was telling beads  sometimes he suggested sport  and they shot at  alligators  and at rare intervals they came to human aggregations in the  waste of trees  and stayed for a day or so  and drank and sat about  and   one night  danced with creole girls  who found holroyd s poor elements of  spanish  without either past tense or future  amply sufficient for their  purposes  but these were mere luminous chinks in the long grey passage of  the streaming river  up which the throbbing engines beat  a certain  liberal heathen deity  in the shape of a demi john  held seductive court  aft  and  it is probable  forward     but gerilleau learnt things about the ants  more things and more  at this  stopping place and that  and became interested in his mission      dey are a new sort of ant   he said   we have got to be  what do you call  it   entomologie  big  five centimetres  some bigger  it is ridiculous  we  are like the monkeys   sent to pick insects    but dey are eating up the  country      he burst out indignantly   suppose  suddenly  there are complications with  europe  here am i  soon we shall be above the rio negro  and my gun   useless      he nursed his knee and mused      dose people who were dere at de dancing place  dey  ave come down  dey   ave lost all they got  de ants come to deir house one afternoon  everyone  run out  you know when de ants come one must  everyone runs out and they  go over the house  if you stayed they d eat you  see  well  presently dey  go back  dey say   the ants  ave gone       de ants   aven t  gone   dey try to go in  de son   e goes in  de ants fight       swarm over him       bite  im  presently he comes out again  screaming and running  he runs  past them to the river  see  he gets into de water and drowns de ants    yes   gerilleau paused  brought his liquid eyes close to holroyd s face   tapped holroyd s knee with his knuckle   that night he dies  just as if he  was stung by a snake       poisoned  by the ants       who knows   gerilleau shrugged his shoulders   perhaps they bit him  badly    when i joined dis service i joined to fight men  dese things   dese ants  dey come and go  it is no business for men      after that he talked frequently of the ants to holroyd  and whenever they  chanced to drift against any speck of humanity in that waste of water and  sunshine and distant trees  holroyd s improving knowledge of the language  enabled him to recognise the ascendant word  saueba   more and more  completely dominating the whole     he perceived the ants were becoming interesting  and the nearer he drew to  them the more interesting they became  gerilleau abandoned his old themes  almost suddenly  and the portuguese lieutenant became a conversational  figure  he knew something about the leaf cutting ant  and expanded his  knowledge  gerilleau sometimes rendered what he had to tell to holroyd  he  told of the little workers that swarm and fight  and the big workers that  command and rule  and how these latter always crawled to the neck and how  their bites drew blood  he told how they cut leaves and made fungus beds   and how their nests in caracas are sometimes a hundred yards across  two  days the three men spent disputing whether ants have eyes  the discussion  grew dangerously heated on the second afternoon  and holroyd saved the  situation by going ashore in a boat to catch ants and see  he captured  various specimens and returned  and some had eyes and some hadn t  also   they argued  do ants bite or sting      dese ants   said gerilleau  after collecting information at a rancho    have big eyes  they don t run about blind  not as most ants do  no  dey  get in corners and watch what you do       and they sting   asked holroyd      yes  dey sting  dere is poison in the sting   he meditated   i do not see  what men can do against ants  dey come and go       but these don t go       they will   said gerilleau     past tamandu there is a long low coast of eighty miles without any  population  and then one comes to the confluence of the main river and the  batemo arm like a great lake  and then the forest came nearer  came at  last intimately near  the character of the channel changes  snags abound   and the  benjamin constant  moored by a cable that night  under the  very shadow of dark trees  for the first time for many days came a spell  of coolness  and holroyd and gerilleau sat late  smoking cigars and  enjoying this delicious sensation  gerilleau s mind was full of ants and  what they could do  he decided to sleep at last  and lay down on a  mattress on deck  a man hopelessly perplexed  his last words  when he  already seemed asleep  were to ask  with a flourish of despair   what can  one do with ants     de whole thing is absurd      holroyd was left to scratch his bitten wrists  and meditate alone     he sat on the bulwark and listened to the little changes in gerilleau s  breathing until he was fast asleep  and then the ripple and lap of the  stream took his mind  and brought back that sense of immensity that had  been growing upon him since first he had left para and come up the river   the monitor showed but one small light  and there was first a little  talking forward and then stillness  his eyes went from the dim black  outlines of the middle works of the gunboat towards the bank  to the black  overwhelming mysteries of forest  lit now and then by a fire fly  and  never still from the murmur of alien and mysterious activities       it was the inhuman immensity of this land that astonished and oppressed  him  he knew the skies were empty of men  the stars were specks in an  incredible vastness of space  he knew the ocean was enormous and  untamable  but in england he had come to think of the land as man s  in  england it is indeed man s  the wild things live by sufferance  grow on  lease  everywhere the roads  the fences  and absolute security runs  in an  atlas  too  the land is man s  and all coloured to show his claim to it    in vivid contrast to the universal independent blueness of the sea  he had  taken it for granted that a day would come when everywhere about the  earth  plough and culture  light tramways and good roads  an ordered  security  would prevail  but now  he doubted     this forest was interminable  it had an air of being invincible  and man  seemed at best an infrequent precarious intruder  one travelled for miles   amidst the still  silent struggle of giant trees  of strangulating  creepers  of assertive flowers  everywhere the alligator  the turtle  and  endless varieties of birds and insects seemed at home  dwelt  irreplaceably  but man  man at most held a footing upon resentful  clearings  fought weeds  fought beasts and insects for the barest  foothold  fell a prey to snake and beast  insect and fever  and was  presently carried away  in many places down the river he had been  manifestly driven back  this deserted creek or that preserved the name of  a  casa   and here and there ruinous white walls and a shattered  tower enforced the lesson  the puma  the jaguar  were more the masters  here       who were the real masters     in a few miles of this forest there must be more ants than there are men  in the whole world  this seemed to holroyd a perfectly new idea  in a few  thousand years men had emerged from barbarism to a stage of civilisation  that made them feel lords of the future and masters of the earth  but what  was to prevent the ants evolving also  such ants as one knew lived in  little communities of a few thousand individuals  made no concerted  efforts against the greater world  but they had a language  they had an  intelligence  why should things stop at that any more than men had stopped  at the barbaric stage  suppose presently the ants began to store  knowledge  just as men had done by means of books and records  use  weapons  form great empires  sustain a planned and organised war     things came back to him that gerilleau had gathered about these ants they  were approaching  they used a poison like the poison of snakes  they  obeyed greater leaders even as the leaf cutting ants do  they were  carnivorous  and where they came they stayed       the forest was very still  the water lapped incessantly against the side   about the lantern overhead there eddied a noiseless whirl of phantom  moths     gerilleau stirred in the darkness and sighed   what can one  do    he  murmured  and turned over and was still again     holroyd was roused from meditations that were becoming sinister by the hum  of a mosquito       ii     the next morning holroyd learnt they were within forty kilometres of  badama  and his interest in the banks intensified  he came up whenever an  opportunity offered to examine his surroundings  he could see no signs of  human occupation whatever  save for a weedy ruin of a house and the  green stained facade of the long deserted monastery at moju  with a forest  tree growing out of a vacant window space  and great creepers netted across  its vacant portals  several flights of strange yellow butterflies with  semi transparent wings crossed the river that morning  and many alighted on  the monitor and were killed by the men  it was towards afternoon that they  came upon the derelict  cuberta      she did not at first appear to be derelict  both her sails were set and  hanging slack in the afternoon calm  and there was the figure of a man  sitting on the fore planking beside the shipped sweeps  another man  appeared to be sleeping face downwards on the sort of longitudinal bridge  these big canoes have in the waist  but it was presently apparent  from  the sway of her rudder and the way she drifted into the course of the  gunboat  that something was out of order with her  gerilleau surveyed her  through a field glass  and became interested in the queer darkness of the  face of the sitting man  a red faced man he seemed  without a nose    crouching he was rather than sitting  and the longer the captain looked  the less he liked to look at him  and the less able he was to take his  glasses away     but he did so at last  and went a little way to call up holroyd  then he  went back to hail the cuberta  he hailed her again  and so she drove past  him   santa rosa   stood out clearly as her name     as she came by and into the wake of the monitor  she pitched a little  and  suddenly the figure of the crouching man collapsed as though all its joints  had given way  his hat fell off  his head was not nice to look at  and his  body flopped lax and rolled out of sight behind the bulwarks      caramba   cried gerilleau  and resorted to holroyd forthwith     holroyd was half way up the companion   did you see dat   said the  captain      dead   said holroyd   yes  you d better send a boat aboard  there s  something wrong       did you  by any chance  see his face       what was it like       it was  ugh   i have no words   and the captain suddenly turned his back  on holroyd and became an active and strident commander     the gunboat came about  steamed parallel to the erratic course of the  canoe  and dropped the boat with lieutenant da cunha and three sailors to  board her  then the curiosity of the captain made him draw up almost  alongside as the lieutenant got aboard  so that the whole of the  santa  rosa   deck and hold  was visible to holroyd     he saw now clearly that the sole crew of the vessel was these two dead  men  and though he could not see their faces  he saw by their outstretched  hands  which were all of ragged flesh  that they had been subjected to  some strange exceptional process of decay  for a moment his attention  concentrated on those two enigmatical bundles of dirty clothes and laxly  flung limbs  and then his eyes went forward to discover the open hold  piled high with trunks and cases  and aft  to where the little cabin gaped  inexplicably empty  then he became aware that the planks of the middle  decking were dotted with moving black specks     his attention was riveted by these specks  they were all walking in  directions radiating from the fallen man in a manner  the image came  unsought to his mind  like the crowd dispersing from a bull fight     he became aware of gerilleau beside him   capo   he said   have you your  glasses  can you focus as closely as those planks there      gerilleau made an effort  grunted  and handed him the glasses     there followed a moment of scrutiny   it s ants   said the englishman  and  handed the focused field glass back to gerilleau     his impression of them was of a crowd of large black ants  very like  ordinary ants except for their size  and for the fact that some of the  larger of them bore a sort of clothing of grey  but at the time his  inspection was too brief for particulars  the head of lieutenant da cunha  appeared over the side of the cuberta  and a brief colloquy ensued      you must go aboard   said gerilleau     the lieutenant objected that the boat was full of ants      you have your boots   said gerilleau     the lieutenant changed the subject   how did these men die   he asked     captain gerilleau embarked upon speculations that holroyd could not  follow  and the two men disputed with a certain increasing vehemence   holroyd took up the field glass and resumed his scrutiny  first of the  ants and then of the dead man amidships     he has described these ants to me very particularly     he says they were as large as any ants he has ever seen  black and moving  with a steady deliberation very different from the mechanical fussiness of  the common ant  about one in twenty was much larger than its fellows  and  with an exceptionally large head  these reminded him at once of the master  workers who are said to rule over the leaf cutter ants  like them they  seemed to be directing and co ordinating the general movements  they  tilted their bodies back in a manner altogether singular as if they made  some use of the fore feet  and he had a curious fancy that he was too far  off to verify  that most of these ants of both kinds were wearing  accoutrements  had things strapped about their bodies by bright white  bands like white metal threads       he put down the glasses abruptly  realising that the question of  discipline between the captain and his subordinate had become acute      it is your duty   said the captain   to go aboard  it is my  instructions      the lieutenant seemed on the verge of refusing  the head of one of the  mulatto sailors appeared beside him      i believe these men were killed by the ants   said holroyd abruptly in  english     the captain burst into a rage  he made no answer to holroyd   i have  commanded you to go aboard   he screamed to his subordinate in portuguese    if you do not go aboard forthwith it is mutiny  rank mutiny  mutiny and  cowardice  where is the courage that should animate us  i will have you in  irons  i will have you shot like a dog   he began a torrent of abuse and  curses  he danced to and fro  he shook his fists  he behaved as if beside  himself with rage  and the lieutenant  white and still  stood looking at  him  the crew appeared forward  with amazed faces     suddenly  in a pause of this outbreak  the lieutenant came to some heroic  decision  saluted  drew himself together and clambered upon the deck of  the cuberta      ah   said gerilleau  and his mouth shut like a trap  holroyd saw the ants  retreating before da cunha s boots  the portuguese walked slowly to the  fallen man  stooped down  hesitated  clutched his coat and turned him  over  a black swarm of ants rushed out of the clothes  and da cunha  stepped back very quickly and trod two or three times on the deck     holroyd put up the glasses  he saw the scattered ants about the invader s  feet  and doing what he had never seen ants doing before  they had nothing  of the blind movements of the common ant  they were looking at him  as a  rallying crowd of men might look at some gigantic monster that had  dispersed it      how did he die   the captain shouted     holroyd understood the portuguese to say the body was too much eaten to  tell      what is there forward   asked gerilleau     the lieutenant walked a few paces  and began his answer in portuguese  he  stopped abruptly and beat off something from his leg  he made some  peculiar steps as if he was trying to stamp on something invisible  and  went quickly towards the side  then he controlled himself  turned about   walked deliberately forward to the hold  clambered up to the fore decking   from which the sweeps are worked  stooped for a time over the second man   groaned audibly  and made his way back and aft to the cabin  moving very  rigidly  he turned and began a conversation with his captain  cold and  respectful in tone on either side  contrasting vividly with the wrath and  insult of a few moments before  holroyd gathered only fragments of its  purport     he reverted to the field glass  and was surprised to find the ants had  vanished from all the exposed surfaces of the deck  he turned towards the  shadows beneath the decking  and it seemed to him they were full of  watching eyes     the cuberta  it was agreed  was derelict  but too full of ants to put men  aboard to sit and sleep  it must be towed  the lieutenant went forward to  take in and adjust the cable  and the men in the boat stood up to be ready  to help him  holroyd s glasses searched the canoe     he became more and more impressed by the fact that a great if minute and  furtive activity was going on  he perceived that a number of gigantic  ants  they seemed nearly a couple of inches in length  carrying  oddly shaped burthens for which he could imagine no use  were moving in  rushes from one point of obscurity to another  they did not move in columns  across the exposed places  but in open  spaced out lines  oddly suggestive  of the rushes of modern infantry advancing under fire  a number were  taking cover under the dead man s clothes  and a perfect swarm was  gathering along the side over which da cunha must presently go     he did not see them actually rush for the lieutenant as he returned  but  he has no doubt they did make a concerted rush  suddenly the lieutenant  was shouting and cursing and beating at his legs   i m stung   he shouted   with a face of hate and accusation towards gerilleau     then he vanished over the side  dropped into his boat  and plunged at once  into the water  holroyd heard the splash     the three men in the boat pulled him out and brought him aboard  and that  night he died     iii     holroyd and the captain came out of the cabin in which the swollen and  contorted body of the lieutenant lay and stood together at the stern of  the monitor  staring at the sinister vessel they trailed behind them  it  was a close  dark night that had only phantom flickerings of sheet  lightning to illuminate it  the cuberta  a vague black triangle  rocked  about in the steamer s wake  her sails bobbing and flapping  and the black  smoke from the funnels  spark lit ever and again  streamed over her  swaying masts     gerilleau s mind was inclined to run on the unkind things the lieutenant  had said in the heat of his last fever      he says i murdered  im   he protested   it is simply absurd  someone    ad  to go aboard  are we to run away from these confounded ants  whenever they show up      holroyd said nothing  he was thinking of a disciplined rush of little  black shapes across bare sunlit planking      it was his place to go   harped gerilleau   he died in the execution of  his duty  what has he to complain of  murdered     but the poor fellow  was  what is it   demented  he was not in his right mind  the poison  swelled him    u m      they came to a long silence      we will sink that canoe  burn it       and then      the inquiry irritated gerilleau  his shoulders went up  his hands flew out  at right angles from his body   what is one to  do    he said  his  voice going up to an angry squeak      anyhow   he broke out vindictively   every ant in dat cuberta   i will  burn dem alive      holroyd was not moved to conversation  a distant ululation of howling  monkeys filled the sultry night with foreboding sounds  and as the gunboat  drew near the black mysterious banks this was reinforced by a depressing  clamour of frogs      what is one to  do    the captain repeated after a vast interval   and suddenly becoming active and savage and blasphemous  decided to burn  the  santa rosa  without further delay  everyone aboard was pleased  by that idea  everyone helped with zest  they pulled in the cable  cut it   and dropped the boat and fired her with tow and kerosene  and soon the  cuberta was crackling and flaring merrily amidst the immensities of the  tropical night  holroyd watched the mounting yellow flare against the  blackness  and the livid flashes of sheet lightning that came and went  above the forest summits  throwing them into momentary silhouette  and his  stoker stood behind him watching also     the stoker was stirred to the depths of his linguistics    saueba  go  pop  pop   he said   wahaw  and laughed richly     but holroyd was thinking that these little creatures on the decked canoe  had also eyes and brains     the whole thing impressed him as incredibly foolish and wrong  but  what  was one to  do   this question came back enormously reinforced on the  morrow  when at last the gunboat reached badama     this place  with its leaf thatch covered houses and sheds  its  creeper invaded sugar mill  its little jetty of timber and canes  was very  still in the morning heat  and showed never a sign of living men  whatever  ants there were at that distance were too small to see      all the people have gone   said gerilleau   but we will do one thing  anyhow  we will  oot and vissel      so holroyd hooted and whistled     then the captain fell into a doubting fit of the worst kind   dere is one  thing we can do   he said presently   what s that   said holroyd       oot and vissel again      so they did     the captain walked his deck and gesticulated to himself  he seemed to have  many things on his mind  fragments of speeches came from his lips  he  appeared to be addressing some imaginary public tribunal either in spanish  or portuguese  holroyd s improving ear detected something about  ammunition  he came out of these preoccupations suddenly into english   my  dear  olroyd   he cried  and broke off with  but what  can  one do      they took the boat and the field glasses  and went close in to examine the  place  they made out a number of big ants  whose still postures had a  certain effect of watching them  dotted about the edge of the rude  embarkation jetty  gerilleau tried ineffectual pistol shots at these   holroyd thinks he distinguished curious earthworks running between the  nearer houses  that may have been the work of the insect conquerors of  those human habitations  the explorers pulled past the jetty  and became  aware of a human skeleton wearing a loin cloth  and very bright and clean  and shining  lying beyond  they came to a pause regarding this        i  ave all dose lives to consider   said gerilleau suddenly     holroyd turned and stared at the captain  realising slowly that he  referred to the unappetising mixture of races that constituted his crew      to send a landing party  it is impossible  impossible  they will be  poisoned  they will swell  they will swell up and abuse me and die  it is  totally impossible    if we land  i must land alone  alone  in thick  boots and with my life in my hand  perhaps i should live  or again  i  might not land  i do not know  i do not know      holroyd thought he did  but he said nothing      de whole thing   said gerilleau suddenly    as been got up to make me  ridiculous  de whole thing      they paddled about and regarded the clean white skeleton from various  points of view  and then they returned to the gunboat  then gerilleau s  indecisions became terrible  steam was got up  and in the afternoon the  monitor went on up the river with an air of going to ask somebody  something  and by sunset came back again and anchored  a thunderstorm  gathered and broke furiously  and then the night became beautifully cool  and quiet and everyone slept on deck  except gerilleau  who tossed about  and muttered  in the dawn he awakened holroyd      lord   said holroyd   what now       i have decided   said the captain      what  to land   said holroyd  sitting up brightly      no   said the captain  and was for a time very reserved   i have  decided   he repeated  and holroyd manifested symptoms of impatience      well   yes   said the captain    i shall fire de big gun       and he did  heaven knows what the ants thought of it  but he did  he fired  it twice with great sternness and ceremony  all the crew had wadding in  their ears  and there was an effect of going into action about the whole  affair  and first they hit and wrecked the old sugar mill  and then they  smashed the abandoned store behind the jetty  and then gerilleau  experienced the inevitable reaction      it is no good   he said to holroyd   no good at all  no sort of bally  good  we must go back  for instructions  dere will be de devil of a row  about dis ammunition  oh  de  devil  of a row  you don t know    olroyd        he stood regarding the world in infinite perplexity for a space      but what else was there to  do    he cried     in the afternoon the monitor started down stream again  and in the evening  a landing party took the body of the lieutenant and buried it on the bank  upon which the new ants have so far not appeared       iv     i heard this story in a fragmentary state from holroyd not three weeks  ago     these new ants have got into his brain  and he has come back to england  with the idea  as he says  of  exciting people  about them  before it is  too late   he says they threaten british guiana  which cannot be much over  a trifle of a thousand miles from their present sphere of activity  and  that the colonial office ought to get to work upon them at once  he  declaims with great passion   these are intelligent ants  just think what  that means      there can be no doubt they are a serious pest  and that the brazilian  government is well advised in offering a prize of five hundred pounds for  some effectual method of extirpation  it is certain too that since they  first appeared in the hills beyond badama  about three years ago  they  have achieved extraordinary conquests  the whole of the south bank of the  batemo river  for nearly sixty miles  they have in their effectual  occupation  they have driven men out completely  occupied plantations and  settlements  and boarded and captured at least one ship  it is even said  they have in some inexplicable way bridged the very considerable capuarana  arm and pushed many miles towards the amazon itself  there can be little  doubt that they are far more reasonable and with a far better social  organisation than any previously known ant species  instead of being in  dispersed societies they are organised into what is in effect a single  nation  but their peculiar and immediate formidableness lies not so much  in this as in the intelligent use they make of poison against their larger  enemies  it would seem this poison of theirs is closely akin to snake  poison  and it is highly probable they actually manufacture it  and that  the larger individuals among them carry the needle like crystals of it in  their attacks upon men     of course it is extremely difficult to get any detailed information about  these new competitors for the sovereignty of the globe  no eye witnesses  of their activity  except for such glimpses as holroyd s  have survived  the encounter  the most extraordinary legends of their prowess and  capacity are in circulation in the region of the upper amazon  and grow  daily as the steady advance of the invader stimulates men s imaginations  through their fears  these strange little creatures are credited not only  with the use of implements and a knowledge of fire and metals and with  organised feats of engineering that stagger our northern minds  unused as  we are to such feats as that of the sauebas of rio de janeiro  who in       drove a tunnel under the parahyba where it is as wide as the thames at  london bridge  but with an organised and detailed method of record and  communication analogous to our books  so far their action has been a  steady progressive settlement  involving the flight or slaughter of every  human being in the new areas they invade  they are increasing rapidly in  numbers  and holroyd at least is firmly convinced that they will finally  dispossess man over the whole of tropical south america     and why should they stop at tropical south america     well  there they are  anyhow  by      or thereabouts  if they go on as  they are going  they ought to strike the capuarana extension railway  and  force themselves upon the attention of the european capitalist     by      they will be half way down the amazon  i fix      or     at the  latest for the discovery of europe             xxxi       the door in the wall       i     one confidential evening  not three months ago  lionel wallace told me  this story of the door in the wall  and at the time i thought that so far  as he was concerned it was a true story     he told it me with such a direct simplicity of conviction that i could not  do otherwise than believe in him  but in the morning  in my own flat  i  woke to a different atmosphere  and as i lay in bed and recalled the  things he had told me  stripped of the glamour of his earnest slow voice   denuded of the focussed  shaded table light  the shadowy atmosphere that  wrapped about him and me  and the pleasant bright things  the dessert and  glasses and napery of the dinner we had shared  making them for the time a  bright little world quite cut off from everyday realities  i saw it all as  frankly incredible   he was mystifying   i said  and then   how well he  did it     it isn t quite the thing i should have expected him  of all  people  to do well      afterwards as i sat up in bed and sipped my morning tea  i found myself  trying to account for the flavour of reality that perplexed me in his  impossible reminiscences  by supposing they did in some way suggest   present  convey  i hardly know which word to use  experiences it was  otherwise impossible to tell     well  i don t resort to that explanation now  i have got over my  intervening doubts  i believe now  as i believed at the moment of telling   that wallace did to the very best of his ability strip the truth of his  secret for me  but whether he himself saw  or only thought he saw  whether  he himself was the possessor of an inestimable privilege or the victim of  a fantastic dream  i cannot pretend to guess  even the facts of his death   which ended my doubts for ever  throw no light on that     that much the reader must judge for himself     i forget now what chance comment or criticism of mine moved so reticent a  man to confide in me  he was  i think  defending himself against an  imputation of slackness and unreliability i had made in relation to a  great public movement  in which he had disappointed me  but he plunged  suddenly   i have   he said   a preoccupation         i know   he went on  after a pause   i have been negligent  the fact is    it isn t a case of ghosts or apparitions  but  it s an odd thing to tell  of  redmond  i am haunted  i am haunted by something  that rather takes  the light out of things  that fills me with longings        he paused  checked by that english shyness that so often overcomes us when  we would speak of moving or grave or beautiful things   you were at saint  aethelstan s all through   he said  and for a moment that seemed to me  quite irrelevant   well   and he paused  then very haltingly at first  but  afterwards more easily  he began to tell of the thing that was hidden in  his life  the haunting memory of a beauty and a happiness that filled his  heart with insatiable longings  that made all the interests and spectacle  of worldly life seem dull and tedious and vain to him     now that i have the clue to it  the thing seems written visibly in his  face  i have a photograph in which that look of detachment has been caught  and intensified  it reminds me of what a woman once said of him  a woman  who had loved him greatly   suddenly   she said   the interest goes out of  him  he forgets you  he doesn t care a rap for you  under his very  nose        yet the interest was not always out of him  and when he was holding his  attention to a thing wallace could contrive to be an extremely successful  man  his career  indeed  is set with successes  he left me behind him long  ago  he soared up over my head  and cut a figure in the world that i  couldn t cut  anyhow  he was still a year short of forty  and they say now  that he would have been in office and very probably in the new cabinet if  he had lived  at school he always beat me without effort  as it were by  nature  we were at school together at saint aethelstan s college in west  kensington for almost all our school time  he came into the school as my  coequal  but he left far above me  in a blaze of scholarships and  brilliant performance  yet i think i made a fair average running  and it  was at school i heard first of the  door in the wall   that i was to hear  of a second time only a month before his death     to him at least the door in the wall was a real door  leading through a  real wall to immortal realities  of that i am now quite assured     and it came into his life quite early  when he was a little fellow between  five and six  i remember how  as he sat making his confession to me with a  slow gravity  he reasoned and reckoned the date of it   there was   he  said   a crimson virginia creeper in it  all one bright uniform crimson   in a clear amber sunshine against a white wall  that came into the  impression somehow  though i don t clearly remember how  and there were  horse chestnut leaves upon the clean pavement outside the green door  they  were blotched yellow and green  you know  not brown nor dirty  so that  they must have been new fallen  i take it that means october  i look out  for horse chestnut leaves every year and i ought to know      if i m right in that  i was about five years and four months old      he was  he said  rather a precocious little boy  he learnt to talk at an  abnormally early age  and he was so sane and  old fashioned   as people  say  that he was permitted an amount of initiative that most children  scarcely attain by seven or eight  his mother died when he was two  and he  was under the less vigilant and authoritative care of a nursery governess   his father was a stern  preoccupied lawyer  who gave him little attention   and expected great things of him  for all his brightness he found life a  little grey and dull  i think  and one day he wandered     he could not recall the particular neglect that enabled him to get away   nor the course he took among the west kensington roads  all that had faded  among the incurable blurs of memory  but the white wall and the green door  stood out quite distinctly     as his memory of that childish experience ran  he did at the very first  sight of that door experience a peculiar emotion  an attraction  a desire  to get to the door and open it and walk in  and at the same time he had  the clearest conviction that either it was unwise or it was wrong of him    he could not tell which  to yield to this attraction  he insisted upon it  as a curious thing that he knew from the very beginning  unless memory has  played him the queerest trick  that the door was unfastened  and that he  could go in as he chose     i seem to see the figure of that little boy  drawn and repelled  and it  was very clear in his mind  too  though why it should be so was never  explained  that his father would be very angry if he went in through that  door     wallace described all these moments of hesitation to me with the utmost  particularity  he went right past the door  and then  with his hands in  his pockets and making an infantile attempt to whistle  strolled right  along beyond the end of the wall  there he recalls a number of mean dirty  shops  and particularly that of a plumber and decorator with a dusty  disorder of earthenware pipes  sheet lead  ball taps  pattern books of  wall paper  and tins of enamel  he stood pretending to examine these  things  and  coveting   passionately desiring  the green door     then  he said  he had a gust of emotion  he made a run for it  lest  hesitation should grip him again  he went plump with outstretched hand  through the green door and let it slam behind him  and so  in a trice  he  came into the garden that has haunted all his life     it was very difficult for wallace to give me his full sense of that garden  into which he came     there was something in the very air of it that exhilarated  that gave one  a sense of lightness and good happening and well being  there was  something in the sight of it that made all its colour clean and perfect  and subtly luminous  in the instant of coming into it one was exquisitely  glad  as only in rare moments  and when one is young and joyful one can be  glad in this world  and everything was beautiful there       wallace mused before he went on telling me   you see   he said  with the  doubtful inflection of a man who pauses at incredible things   there were  two great panthers there    yes  spotted panthers  and i was not afraid   there was a long wide path with marble edged flower borders on either  side  and these two huge velvety beasts were playing there with a ball   one looked up and came towards me  a little curious as it seemed  it came  right up to me  rubbed its soft round ear very gently against the small  hand i held out  and purred  it was  i tell you  an enchanted garden  i  know  and the size  oh  it stretched far and wide  this way and that  i  believe there were hills far away  heaven knows where west kensington had  suddenly got to  and somehow it was just like coming home      you know  in the very moment the door swung to behind me  i forgot the  road with its fallen chestnut leaves  its cabs and tradesmen s carts  i  forgot the sort of gravitational pull back to the discipline and obedience  of home  i forgot all hesitations and fear  forgot discretion  forgot all  the intimate realities of this life  i became in a moment a very glad and  wonder happy little boy  in another world  it was a world with a different  quality  a warmer  more penetrating and mellower light  with a faint clear  gladness in its air  and wisps of sun touched cloud in the blueness of its  sky  and before me ran this long wide path  invitingly  with weedless beds  on either side  rich with untended flowers  and these two great panthers   i put my little hands fearlessly on their soft fur  and caressed their  round ears and the sensitive corners under their ears  and played with  them  and it was as though they welcomed me home  there was a keen sense  of home coming in my mind  and when presently a tall  fair girl appeared  in the pathway and came to meet me  smiling  and said  well   to me  and  lifted me  and kissed me  and put me down  and led me by the hand  there  was no amazement  but only an impression of delightful rightness  of being  reminded of happy things that had in some strange way been overlooked   there were broad red steps  i remember  that came into view between spikes  of delphinium  and up these we went to a great avenue between very old and  shady dark trees  all down this avenue  you know  between the red chapped  stems  were marble seats of honour and statuary  and very tame and  friendly white doves        along this cool avenue my girl friend led me  looking down  i recall the  pleasant lines  the finely modelled chin of her sweet kind face  asking me  questions in a soft  agreeable voice  and telling me things  pleasant  things i know  though what they were i was never able to recall     presently a little capuchin monkey  very clean  with a fur of ruddy brown  and kindly hazel eyes  came down a tree to us and ran beside me  looking  up at me and grinning  and presently leapt to my shoulder  so we two went  on our way in great happiness      he paused      go on   i said      i remember little things  we passed an old man musing among laurels  i  remember  and a place gay with paroquets  and came through a broad shaded  colonnade to a spacious cool palace  full of pleasant fountains  full of  beautiful things  full of the quality and promise of heart s desire  and  there were many things and many people  some that still seem to stand out  clearly and some that are a little vague  but all these people were  beautiful and kind  in some way  i don t know how  it was conveyed to me  that they all were kind to me  glad to have me there  and filling me with  gladness by their gestures  by the touch of their hands  by the welcome  and love in their eyes  yes         he mused for a while   playmates i found there  that was very much to me   because i was a lonely little boy  they played delightful games in a  grass covered court where there was a sun dial set about with flowers  and  as one played one loved        but  it s odd  there s a gap in my memory  i don t remember the games we  played  i never remembered  afterwards  as a child  i spent long hours  trying  even with tears  to recall the form of that happiness  i wanted to  play it all over again  in my nursery  by myself  no  all i remember is  the happiness and two dear playfellows who were most with me    then  presently came a sombre dark woman  with a grave  pale face and dreamy  eyes  a sombre woman  wearing a soft long robe of pale purple  who carried  a book  and beckoned and took me aside with her into a gallery above a  hall  though my playmates were loth to have me go  and ceased their game  and stood watching as i was carried away  come back to us   they cried    come back to us soon   i looked up at her face  but she heeded them not  at all  her face was very gentle and grave  she took me to a seat in the  gallery  and i stood beside her  ready to look at her book as she opened  it upon her knee  the pages fell open  she pointed  and i looked   marvelling  for in the living pages of that book i saw myself  it was a  story about myself  and in it were all the things that had happened to me  since ever i was born        it was wonderful to me  because the pages of that book were not pictures   you understand  but realities      wallace paused gravely  looked at me doubtfully      go on   i said   i understand       they were realities   yes  they must have been  people moved and things  came and went in them  my dear mother  whom i had near forgotten  then my  father  stern and upright  the servants  the nursery  all the familiar  things of home  then the front door and the busy streets  with traffic to  and fro  i looked and marvelled  and looked half doubtfully again into the  woman s face and turned the pages over  skipping this and that  to see  more of this book and more  and so at last i came to myself hovering and  hesitating outside the green door in the long white wall  and felt again  the conflict and the fear       and next   i cried  and would have turned on  but the cool hand of the  grave woman delayed me       next   i insisted  and struggled gently with her hand  pulling up her  fingers with all my childish strength  and as she yielded and the page  came over she bent down upon me like a shadow and kissed my brow      but the page did not show the enchanted garden  nor the panthers  nor the  girl who had led me by the hand  nor the playfellows who had been so loth  to let me go  it showed a long grey street in west kensington  in that  chill hour of afternoon before the lamps are lit  and i was there  a  wretched little figure  weeping aloud  for all that i could do to restrain  myself  and i was weeping because i could not return to my dear  playfellows who had called after me   come back to us  come back to us  soon   i was there  this was no page in a book  but harsh reality  that  enchanted place and the restraining hand of the grave mother at whose knee  i stood had gone  whither had they gone      he halted again  and remained for a time staring into the fire      oh  the woefulness of that return   he murmured      well   i said  after a minute or so      poor little wretch i was   brought back to this grey world again  as i  realised the fulness of what had happened to me  i gave way to quite  ungovernable grief  and the shame and humiliation of that public weeping  and my disgraceful home coming remain with me still  i see again the  benevolent looking old gentleman in gold spectacles who stopped and spoke  to me  prodding me first with his umbrella   poor little chap   said he    and are you lost then    and me a london boy of five and more  and he  must needs bring in a kindly young policeman and make a crowd of me  and  so march me home  sobbing  conspicuous  and frightened  i came back from  the enchanted garden to the steps of my father s house      that is as well as i can remember my vision of that garden  the garden  that haunts me still  of course  i can convey nothing of that  indescribable quality of translucent unreality  that  difference   from the common things of experience that hung about it all  but that    that is what happened  if it was a dream  i am sure it was a day time and  altogether extraordinary dream    h m   naturally there followed a  terrible questioning  by my aunt  my father  the nurse  the governess    everyone        i tried to tell them  and my father gave me my first thrashing for  telling lies  when afterwards i tried to tell my aunt  she punished me  again for my wicked persistence  then  as i said  everyone was forbidden  to listen to me  to hear a word about it  even my fairytale books were  taken away from me for a time  because i was too  imaginative   eh  yes   they did that  my father belonged to the old school    and my story was  driven back upon myself  i whispered it to my pillow  my pillow that was  often damp and salt to my whispering lips with childish tears  and i added  always to my official and less fervent prayers this one heartfelt request    please god i may dream of the garden  oh  take me back to my garden    take me back to my garden  i dreamt often of the garden  i may have added  to it  i may have changed it  i do not know    all this  you understand   is an attempt to reconstruct from fragmentary memories a very early  experience  between that and the other consecutive memories of my boyhood  there is a gulf  a time came when it seemed impossible i should ever speak  of that wonder glimpse again      i asked an obvious question      no   he said   i don t remember that i ever attempted to find my way back  to the garden in those early years  this seems odd to me now  but i think  that very probably a closer watch was kept on my movements after this  misadventure to prevent my going astray  no  it wasn t till you knew me  that i tried for the garden again  and i believe there was a period    incredible as it seems now  when i forgot the garden altogether  when i  was about eight or nine it may have been  do you remember me as a kid at  saint aethelstan s       rather       i didn t show any signs  did i  in those days of having a secret dream        ii     he looked up with a sudden smile      did you ever play north west passage with me     no  of course you didn t  come my way       it was the sort of game   he went on   that every imaginative child plays  all day  the idea was the discovery of a north west passage to school  the  way to school was plain enough  the game consisted in finding some way  that wasn t plain  starting off ten minutes early in some almost hopeless  direction  and working my way round through unaccustomed streets to my  goal  and one day i got entangled among some rather low class streets on  the other side of campden hill  and i began to think that for once the  game would be against me and that i should get to school late  i tried  rather desperately a street that seemed a  cul de sac   and found a  passage at the end  i hurried through that with renewed hope   i shall do  it yet   i said  and passed a row of frowsy little shops that were  inexplicably familiar to me  and behold  there was my long white wall and  the green door that led to the enchanted garden      the thing whacked upon me suddenly  then  after all  that garden  that  wonderful garden  wasn t a dream      he paused      i suppose my second experience with the green door marks the world of  difference there is between the busy life of a schoolboy and the infinite  leisure of a child  anyhow  this second time i didn t for a moment think  of going in straight away  you see      for one thing  my mind was full of  the idea of getting to school in time  set on not breaking my record for  punctuality  i must surely have felt  some  little desire at least to  try the door  yes  i must have felt that    but i seem to remember the  attraction of the door mainly as another obstacle to my overmastering  determination to get to school  i was immensely interested by this  discovery i had made  of course  i went on with my mind full of it  but i  went on  it didn t check me  i ran past  tugging out my watch  found i had  ten minutes still to spare  and then i was going downhill into familiar  surroundings  i got to school  breathless  it is true  and wet with  perspiration  but in time  i can remember hanging up my coat and hat     went right by it and left it behind me  odd  eh      he looked at me thoughtfully   of course i didn t know then that it  wouldn t always be there  schoolboys have limited imaginations  i suppose  i thought it was an awfully jolly thing to have it there  to know my way  back to it  but there was the school tugging at me  i expect i was a good  deal distraught and inattentive that morning  recalling what i could of  the beautiful strange people i should presently see again  oddly enough i  had no doubt in my mind that they would be glad to see me    yes  i must  have thought of the garden that morning just as a jolly sort of place to  which one might resort in the interludes of a strenuous scholastic career      i didn t go that day at all  the next day was a half holiday  and that  may have weighed with me  perhaps  too  my state of inattention brought  down impositions upon me  and docked the margin of time necessary for the   detour   i don t know  what i do know is that in the meantime the  enchanted garden was so much upon my mind that i could not keep it to  myself      i told  what was his name   a ferrety looking youngster we used to call  squiff       young hopkins   said i      hopkins it was  i did not like telling him  i had a feeling that in some  way it was against the rules to tell him  but i did  he was walking part  of the way home with me  he was talkative  and if we had not talked about  the enchanted garden we should have talked of something else  and it was  intolerable to me to think about any other subject  so i blabbed      well  he told my secret  the next day in the play interval i found myself  surrounded by half a dozen bigger boys  half teasing  and wholly curious  to hear more of the enchanted garden  there was that big fawcett  you  remember him   and carnaby and morley reynolds  you weren t there by any  chance  no  i think i should have remembered if you were        a boy is a creature of odd feelings  i was  i really believe  in spite of  my secret self disgust  a little flattered to have the attention of these  big fellows  i remember particularly a moment of pleasure caused by the  praise of crawshaw  you remember crawshaw major  the son of crawshaw the  composer   who said it was the best lie he had ever heard  but at the same  time there was a really painful undertow of shame at telling what i felt  was indeed a sacred secret  that beast fawcett made a joke about the girl  in green         wallace s voice sank with the keen memory of that shame   i pretended not  to hear   he said   well  then carnaby suddenly called me a young liar   and disputed with me when i said the thing was true  i said i knew where  to find the green door  could lead them all there in ten minutes  carnaby  became outrageously virtuous  and said i d have to  and bear out my words  or suffer  did you ever have carnaby twist your arm  then perhaps you ll  understand how it went with me  i swore my story was true  there was  nobody in the school then to save a chap from carnaby  though crawshaw put  in a word or so  carnaby had got his game  i grew excited and red eared   and a little frightened  i behaved altogether like a silly little chap   and the outcome of it all was that instead of starting alone for my  enchanted garden  i led the way presently  cheeks flushed  ears hot  eyes  smarting  and my soul one burning misery and shame  for a party of six  mocking  curious  and threatening schoolfellows      we never found the white wall and the green door         you mean           i mean i couldn t find it  i would have found it if i could      and afterwards when i could go alone i couldn t find it  i never found  it  i seem now to have been always looking for it through my school boy  days  but i never came upon it  never       did the fellows  make it disagreeable       beastly    carnaby held a council over me for wanton lying  i remember  how i sneaked home and upstairs to hide the marks of my blubbering  but  when i cried myself to sleep at last it wasn t for carnaby  but for the  garden  for the beautiful afternoon i had hoped for  for the sweet  friendly women and the waiting playfellows  and the game i had hoped to  learn again  that beautiful forgotten game        i believed firmly that if i had not told      i had bad times after  that  crying at night and wool gathering by day  for two terms i slackened  and had bad reports  do you remember  of course you would  it was   you   your beating me in mathematics that brought me back to the  grind again        iii     for a time my friend stared silently into the red heart of the fire  then  he said   i never saw it again until i was seventeen      it leapt upon me for the third time  as i was driving to paddington on my  way to oxford and a scholarship  i had just one momentary glimpse  i was  leaning over the apron of my hansom smoking a cigarette  and no doubt  thinking myself no end of a man of the world  and suddenly there was the  door  the wall  the dear sense of unforgettable and still attainable  things      we clattered by  i too taken by surprise to stop my cab until we were  well past and round a corner  then i had a queer moment  a double and  divergent movement of my will  i tapped the little door in the roof of the  cab  and brought my arm down to pull out my watch   yes  sir   said the  cabman  smartly   er  well  it s nothing   i cried    my  mistake  we  haven t much time  go on   and he went on        i got my scholarship  and the night after i was told of that i sat over  my fire in my little upper room  my study  in my father s house  with his  praise  his rare praise  and his sound counsels ringing in my ears  and i  smoked my favourite pipe  the formidable bulldog of adolescence  and  thought of that door in the long white wall   if i had stopped   i  thought   i should have missed my scholarship  i should have missed  oxford  muddled all the fine career before me  i begin to see things  better   i fell musing deeply  but i did not doubt then this career of  mine was a thing that merited sacrifice      those dear friends and that clear atmosphere seemed very sweet to me   very fine but remote  my grip was fixing now upon the world  i saw another  door opening  the door of my career      he stared again into the fire  its red light picked out a stubborn  strength in his face for just one flickering moment  and then it vanished  again      well   he said and sighed   i have served that career  i have done  much  work  much hard work  but i have dreamt of the enchanted garden a thousand  dreams  and seen its door  or at least glimpsed its door  four times since  then  yes  four times  for a while this world was so bright and  interesting  seemed so full of meaning and opportunity  that the  half effaced charm of the garden was by comparison gentle and remote  who  wants to pat panthers on the way to dinner with pretty women and  distinguished men  i came down to london from oxford  a man of bold  promise that i have done something to redeem  something  and yet there  have been disappointments        twice i have been in love  i will not dwell on that  but once  as i went  to someone who  i knew  doubted whether i dared to come  i took a short  cut at a venture through an unfrequented road near earl s court  and so  happened on a white wall and a familiar green door   odd   said i to  myself   but i thought this place was on campden hill  it s the place i  never could find somehow  like counting stonehenge  the place of that  queer daydream of mine   and i went by it intent upon my purpose  it had  no appeal to me that afternoon      i had just a moment s impulse to try the door  three steps aside were  needed at the most  though i was sure enough in my heart that it would  open to me  and then i thought that doing so might delay me on the way to  that appointment in which i thought my honour was involved  afterwards i  was sorry for my punctuality  might at least have peeped in  i thought   and waved a hand to those panthers  but i knew enough by this time not to  seek again belatedly that which is not found by seeking  yes  that time  made me very sorry        years of hard work after that  and never a sight of the door  it s only  recently it has come back to me  with it there has come a sense as though  some thin tarnish had spread itself over my world  i began to think of it  as a sorrowful and bitter thing that i should never see that door again   perhaps i was suffering a little from overwork  perhaps it was what i ve  heard spoken of as the feeling of forty  i don t know  but certainly the  keen brightness that makes effort easy has gone out of things recently   and that just at a time  with all these new political developments  when i  ought to be working  odd  isn t it  but i do begin to find life toilsome   its rewards  as i come near them  cheap  i began a little while ago to  want the garden quite badly  yes  and i ve seen it three times       the garden       no   the door  and i haven t gone in      he leant over the table to me  with an enormous sorrow in his voice as he  spoke   thrice i have had my chance   thrice   if ever that door  offers itself to me again  i swore  i will go in  out of this dust and  heat  out of this dry glitter of vanity  out of these toilsome futilities   i will go and never return  this time i will stay    i swore it  and when  the time came   i didn t go       three times in one year have i passed that door and failed to enter   three times in the last year      the first time was on the night of the snatch division on the tenants   redemption bill  on which the government was saved by a majority of three   you remember  no one on our side  perhaps very few on the opposite side    expected the end that night  then the debate collapsed like eggshells  i  and hotchkiss were dining with his cousin at brentford  we were both  unpaired  and we were called up by telephone  and set off at once in his  cousin s motor  we got in barely in time  and on the way we passed my wall  and door  livid in the moonlight  blotched with hot yellow as the glare of  our lamps lit it  but unmistakable   my god   cried i   what   said  hotchkiss   nothing   i answered  and the moment passed       i ve made a great sacrifice   i told the whip as i got in   they all  have   he said  and hurried by      i do not see how i could have done otherwise then  and the next occasion  was as i rushed to my father s bedside to bid that stern old man farewell   then  too  the claims of life were imperative  but the third time was  different  it happened a week ago  it fills me with hot remorse to recall  it  i was with gurker and ralphs  it s no secret now  you know  that i ve  had my talk with gurker  we had been dining at frobisher s  and the talk  had become intimate between us  the question of my place in the  reconstructed ministry lay always just over the boundary of the  discussion  yes  yes  that s all settled  it needn t be talked about yet   but there s no reason to keep a secret from you    yes  thanks  thanks   but let me tell you my story      then  on that night things were very much in the air  my position was a  very delicate one  i was keenly anxious to get some definite word from  gurker  but was hampered by ralphs  presence  i was using the best power  of my brain to keep that light and careless talk not too obviously  directed to the point that concerned me  i had to  ralphs  behaviour since  has more than justified my caution    ralphs  i knew  would leave us  beyond the kensington high street  and then i could surprise gurker by a  sudden frankness  one has sometimes to resort to these little devices     and then it was that in the margin of my field of vision i became aware  once more of the white wall  the green door before us down the road      we passed it talking  i passed it  i can still see the shadow of gurker s  marked profile  his opera hat tilted forward over his prominent nose  the  many folds of his neck wrap going before my shadow and ralphs  as we  sauntered past      i passed within twenty inches of the door   if i say good night to them   and go in   i asked myself   what will happen   and i was all a tingle for  that word with gurker      i could not answer that question in the tangle of my other problems    they will think me mad   i thought   and suppose i vanish now    amazing  disappearance of a prominent politician   that weighed with me  a thousand  inconceivably petty worldlinesses weighed with me in that crisis      then he turned on me with a sorrowful smile  and  speaking slowly   here i  am   he said      here i am   he repeated   and my chance has gone from me  three times in  one year the door has been offered me  the door that goes into peace  into  delight  into a beauty beyond dreaming  a kindness no man on earth can  know  and i have rejected it  redmond  and it has gone          how do you know       i know  i know  i am left now to work it out  to stick to the tasks that  held me so strongly when my moments came  you say i have success  this  vulgar  tawdry  irksome  envied thing  i have it   he had a walnut in his  big hand   if that was my success   he said  and crushed it  and held it  out for me to see      let me tell you something  redmond  this loss is destroying me  for two  months  for ten weeks nearly now  i have done no work at all  except the  most necessary and urgent duties  my soul is full of inappeasable regrets   at nights  when it is less likely i shall be recognised  i go out  i  wander  yes  i wonder what people would think of that if they knew  a  cabinet minister  the responsible head of that most vital of all  departments  wandering alone  grieving  sometimes near audibly lamenting    for a door  for a garden        iv     i can see now his rather pallid face  and the unfamiliar sombre fire that  had come into his eyes  i see him very vividly to night  i sit recalling  his words  his tones  and last evening s  westminster gazette  still  lies on my sofa  containing the notice of his death  at lunch to day the  club was busy with his death  we talked of nothing else     they found his body very early yesterday morning in a deep excavation near  east kensington station  it is one of two shafts that have been made in  connection with an extension of the railway southward  it is protected  from the intrusion of the public by a hoarding upon the high road  in  which a small doorway has been cut for the convenience of some of the  workmen who live in that direction  the doorway was left unfastened  through a misunderstanding between two gangers  and through it he made his  way       my mind is darkened with questions and riddles     it would seem he walked all the way from the house that night  he has  frequently walked home during the past session  and so it is i figure his  dark form coming along the late and empty streets  wrapped up  intent  and  then did the pale electric lights near the station cheat the rough  planking into a semblance of white  did that fatal unfastened door awaken  some memory     was there  after all  ever any green door in the wall at all     i do not know  i have told his story as he told it to me  there are times  when i believe that wallace was no more than the victim of the coincidence  between a rare but not unprecedented type of hallucination and a careless  trap  but that indeed is not my profoundest belief  you may think me  superstitious  if you will  and foolish  but  indeed  i am more than  half convinced that he had  in truth  an abnormal gift  and a sense   something  i know not what   that in the guise of wall and door offered  him an outlet  a secret and peculiar passage of escape into another and  altogether more beautiful world  at any rate  you will say  it betrayed  him in the end  but did it betray him  there you touch the inmost mystery  of these dreamers  these men of vision and the imagination  we see our  world fair and common  the hoarding and the pit  by our daylight standard  he walked out of security into darkness  danger  and death     but did he see like that             xxxii       the country of the blind       three hundred miles and more from chimborazo  one hundred from the snows  of cotopaxi  in the wildest wastes of ecuador s andes  there lies that  mysterious mountain valley  cut off from the world of men  the country of  the blind  long years ago that valley lay so far open to the world that  men might come at last through frightful gorges and over an icy pass into  its equable meadows  and thither indeed men came  a family or so of  peruvian half breeds fleeing from the lust and tyranny of an evil spanish  ruler  then came the stupendous outbreak of mindobamba  when it was night  in quito for seventeen days  and the water was boiling at yaguachi and all  the fish floating dying even as far as guayaquil  everywhere along the  pacific slopes there were land slips and swift thawings and sudden floods   and one whole side of the old arauca crest slipped and came down in  thunder  and cut off the country of the blind for ever from the exploring  feet of men  but one of these early settlers had chanced to be on the  hither side of the gorges when the world had so terribly shaken itself   and he perforce had to forget his wife and his child and all the friends  and possessions he had left up there  and start life over again in the  lower world  he started it again but ill  blindness overtook him  and he  died of punishment in the mines  but the story he told begot a legend that  lingers along the length of the cordilleras of the andes to this day     he told of his reason for venturing back from that fastness  into which he  had first been carried lashed to a llama  beside a vast bale of gear  when  he was a child  the valley  he said  had in it all that the heart of man  could desire  sweet water  pasture  and even climate  slopes of rich brown  soil with tangles of a shrub that bore an excellent fruit  and on one side  great hanging forests of pine that held the avalanches high  far overhead   on three sides  vast cliffs of grey green rock were capped by cliffs of  ice  but the glacier stream came not to them but flowed away by the  farther slopes  and only now and then huge ice masses fell on the valley  side  in this valley it neither rained nor snowed  but the abundant  springs gave a rich green pasture  that irrigation would spread over all  the valley space  the settlers did well indeed there  their beasts did  well and multiplied  and but one thing marred their happiness  yet it was  enough to mar it greatly  a strange disease had come upon them  and had  made all the children born to them there  and indeed  several older  children also  blind  it was to seek some charm or antidote against this  plague of blindness that he had with fatigue and danger and difficulty  returned down the gorge  in those days  in such cases  men did not think  of germs and infections but of sins  and it seemed to him that the reason  of this affliction must lie in the negligence of these priestless  immigrants to set up a shrine so soon as they entered the valley  he  wanted a shrine  a handsome  cheap  effectual shrine  to be erected in the  valley  he wanted relics and such like potent things of faith  blessed  objects and mysterious medals and prayers  in his wallet he had a bar of  native silver for which he would not account  he insisted there was none  in the valley with something of the insistence of an inexpert liar  they  had all clubbed their money and ornaments together  having little need for  such treasure up there  he said  to buy them holy help against their ill   i figure this dim eyed young mountaineer  sunburnt  gaunt  and anxious   hat brim clutched feverishly  a man all unused to the ways of the lower  world  telling this story to some keen eyed  attentive priest before the  great convulsion  i can picture him presently seeking to return with pious  and infallible remedies against that trouble  and the infinite dismay with  which he must have faced the tumbled vastness where the gorge had once  come out  but the rest of his story of mischances is lost to me  save that  i know of his evil death after several years  poor stray from that  remoteness  the stream that had once made the gorge now bursts from the  mouth of a rocky cave  and the legend his poor  ill told story set going  developed into the legend of a race of blind men somewhere  over there   one may still hear to day     and amidst the little population of that now isolated and forgotten valley  the disease ran its course  the old became groping and purblind  the young  saw but dimly  and the children that were born to them saw never at all   but life was very easy in that snow rimmed basin  lost to all the world   with neither thorns nor briars  with no evil insects nor any beasts save  the gentle breed of llamas they had lugged and thrust and followed up the  beds of the shrunken rivers in the gorges up which they had come  the  seeing had become purblind so gradually that they scarcely noted their  loss  they guided the sightless youngsters hither and thither until they  knew the whole valley marvellously  and when at last sight died out among  them the race lived on  they had even time to adapt themselves to the  blind control of fire  which they made carefully in stoves of stone  they  were a simple strain of people at the first  unlettered  only slightly  touched with the spanish civilisation  but with something of a tradition  of the arts of old peru and of its lost philosophy  generation followed  generation  they forgot many things  they devised many things  their  tradition of the greater world they came from became mythical in colour  and uncertain  in all things save sight they were strong and able  and  presently the chance of birth and heredity sent one who had an original  mind and who could talk and persuade among them  and then afterwards  another  these two passed  leaving their effects  and the little community  grew in numbers and in understanding  and met and settled social and  economic problems that arose  generation followed generation  generation  followed generation  there came a time when a child was born who was  fifteen generations from that ancestor who went out of the valley with a  bar of silver to seek god s aid  and who never returned  thereabouts it  chanced that a man came into this community from the outer world  and this  is the story of that man     he was a mountaineer from the country near quito  a man who had been down  to the sea and had seen the world  a reader of books in an original way   an acute and enterprising man  and he was taken on by a party of  englishmen who had come out to ecuador to climb mountains  to replace one  of their three swiss guides who had fallen ill  he climbed here and he  climbed there  and then came the attempt on parascotopetl  the matterhorn  of the andes  in which he was lost to the outer world  the story of the  accident has been written a dozen times  pointer s narrative is the best   he tells how the little party worked their difficult and almost vertical  way up to the very foot of the last and greatest precipice  and how they  built a night shelter amidst the snow upon a little shelf of rock  and   with a touch of real dramatic power  how presently they found nunez had  gone from them  they shouted  and there was no reply  shouted and  whistled  and for the rest of that night they slept no more     as the morning broke they saw the traces of his fall  it seems impossible  he could have uttered a sound  he had slipped eastward towards the unknown  side of the mountain  far below he had struck a steep slope of snow  and  ploughed his way down it in the midst of a snow avalanche  his track went  straight to the edge of a frightful precipice  and beyond that everything  was hidden  far  far below  and hazy with distance  they could see trees  rising out of a narrow  shut in valley  the lost country of the blind  but  they did not know it was the lost country of the blind  nor distinguish it  in any way from any other narrow streak of upland valley  unnerved by this  disaster  they abandoned their attempt in the afternoon  and pointer was  called away to the war before he could make another attack  to this day  parascotopetl lifts an unconquered crest  and pointer s shelter crumbles  unvisited amidst the snows     and the man who fell survived     at the end of the slope he fell a thousand feet  and came down in the  midst of a cloud of snow upon a snow slope even steeper than the one  above  down this he was whirled  stunned and insensible  but without a  bone broken in his body  and then at last came to gentler slopes  and at  last rolled out and lay still  buried amidst a softening heap of the white  masses that had accompanied and saved him  he came to himself with a dim  fancy that he was ill in bed  then realised his position with a  mountaineer s intelligence  and worked himself loose and  after a rest or  so  out until he saw the stars  he rested flat upon his chest for a space   wondering where he was and what had happened to him  he explored his  limbs  and discovered that several of his buttons were gone and his coat  turned over his head  his knife had gone from his pocket and his hat was  lost  though he had tied it under his chin  he recalled that he had been  looking for loose stones to raise his piece of the shelter wall  his  ice axe had disappeared     he decided he must have fallen  and looked up to see  exaggerated by the  ghastly light of the rising moon  the tremendous flight he had taken  for  a while he lay  gazing blankly at that vast pale cliff towering above   rising moment by moment out of a subsiding tide of darkness  its  phantasmal  mysterious beauty held him for a space  and then he was seized  with a paroxysm of sobbing laughter       after a great interval of time he became aware that he was near the lower  edge of the snow  below  down what was now a moonlit and practicable  slope  he saw the dark and broken appearance of rock strewn turf  he  struggled to his feet  aching in every joint and limb  got down painfully  from the heaped loose snow about him  went downward until he was on the  turf  and there dropped rather than lay beside a boulder  drank deep from  the flask in his inner pocket  and instantly fell asleep       he was awakened by the singing of birds in the trees far below     he sat up and perceived he was on a little alp at the foot of a vast  precipice  that was grooved by the gully down which he and his snow had  come  over against him another wall of rock reared itself against the sky   the gorge between these precipices ran east and west and was full of the  morning sunlight  which lit to the westward the mass of fallen mountain  that closed the descending gorge  below him it seemed there was a  precipice equally steep  but behind the snow in the gully he found a sort  of chimney cleft dripping with snow water down which a desperate man might  venture  he found it easier than it seemed  and came at last to another  desolate alp  and then after a rock climb of no particular difficulty to a  steep slope of trees  he took his bearings and turned his face up the  gorge  for he saw it opened out above upon green meadows  among which he  now glimpsed quite distinctly a cluster of stone huts of unfamiliar  fashion  at times his progress was like clambering along the face of a  wall  and after a time the rising sun ceased to strike along the gorge   the voices of the singing birds died away  and the air grew cold and dark  about him  but the distant valley with its houses was all the brighter for  that  he came presently to talus  and among the rocks he noted  for he was  an observant man  an unfamiliar fern that seemed to clutch out of the  crevices with intense green hands  he picked a frond or so and gnawed its  stalk and found it helpful     about midday he came at last out of the throat of the gorge into the plain  and the sunlight  he was stiff and weary  he sat down in the shadow of a  rock  filled up his flask with water from a spring and drank it down  and  remained for a time resting before he went on to the houses     they were very strange to his eyes  and indeed the whole aspect of that  valley became  as he regarded it  queerer and more unfamiliar  the greater  part of its surface was lush green meadow  starred with many beautiful  flowers  irrigated with extraordinary care  and bearing evidence of  systematic cropping piece by piece  high up and ringing the valley about  was a wall  and what appeared to be a circumferential water channel  from  which the little trickles of water that fed the meadow plants came  and on  the higher slopes above this flocks of llamas cropped the scanty herbage   sheds  apparently shelters or feeding places for the llamas  stood against  the boundary wall here and there  the irrigation streams ran together into  a main channel down the centre of the valley  and this was enclosed on  either side by a wall breast high  this gave a singularly urban quality to  this secluded place  a quality that was greatly enhanced by the fact that  a number of paths paved with black and white stones  and each with a  curious little kerb at the side  ran hither and thither in an orderly  manner  the houses of the central village were quite unlike the casual and  higgledy piggledy agglomeration of the mountain villages he knew  they  stood in a continuous row on either side of a central street of  astonishing cleanness  here and there their particoloured facade was  pierced by a door  and not a solitary window broke their even frontage   they were particoloured with extraordinary irregularity  smeared with a  sort of plaster that was sometimes grey  sometimes drab  sometimes  slate coloured or dark brown  and it was the sight of this wild plastering  first brought the word  blind  into the thoughts of the explorer   the  good man who did that   he thought   must have been as blind as a bat      he descended a steep place  and so came to the wall and channel that ran  about the valley  near where the latter spouted out its surplus contents  into the deeps of the gorge in a thin and wavering thread of cascade  he  could now see a number of men and women resting on piled heaps of grass   as if taking a siesta  in the remoter part of the meadow  and nearer the  village a number of recumbent children  and then nearer at hand three men  carrying pails on yokes along a little path that ran from the encircling  wall towards the houses  these latter were clad in garments of llama cloth  and boots and belts of leather  and they wore caps of cloth with back and  ear flaps  they followed one another in single file  walking slowly and  yawning as they walked  like men who have been up all night  there was  something so reassuringly prosperous and respectable in their bearing that  after a moment s hesitation nunez stood forward as conspicuously as  possible upon his rock  and gave vent to a mighty shout that echoed round  the valley     the three men stopped  and moved their heads as though they were looking  about them  they turned their faces this way and that  and nunez  gesticulated with freedom  but they did not appear to see him for all his  gestures  and after a time  directing themselves towards the mountains far  away to the right  they shouted as if in answer  nunez bawled again  and  then once more  and as he gestured ineffectually the word  blind  came up  to the top of his thoughts   the fools must be blind   he said     when at last  after much shouting and wrath  nunez crossed the stream by a  little bridge  came through a gate in the wall  and approached them  he  was sure that they were blind  he was sure that this was the country of  the blind of which the legends told  conviction had sprung upon him  and a  sense of great and rather enviable adventure  the three stood side by  side  not looking at him  but with their ears directed towards him   judging him by his unfamiliar steps  they stood close together like men a  little afraid  and he could see their eyelids closed and sunken  as though  the very balls beneath had shrunk away  there was an expression near awe  on their faces      a man   one said  in hardly recognisable spanish   a man it is  a man or  a spirit  coming down from the rocks      but nunez advanced with the confident steps of a youth who enters upon  life  all the old stories of the lost valley and the country of the blind  had come back to his mind  and through his thoughts ran this old proverb   as if it were a refrain       in the country of the blind the one eyed man is king       in the country of the blind the one eyed man is king      and very civilly he gave them greeting  he talked to them and used his  eyes      where does he come from  brother pedro   asked one      down out of the rocks       over the mountains i come   said nunez   out of the country beyond  there  where men can see  from near bogota  where there are a hundred  thousands of people  and where the city passes out of sight       sight   muttered pedro   sight       he comes   said the second blind man   out of the rocks      the cloth of their coats nunez saw was curiously fashioned  each with a  different sort of stitching     they startled him by a simultaneous movement towards him  each with a hand  outstretched  he stepped back from the advance of these spread fingers      come hither   said the third blind man  following his motion and  clutching him neatly     and they held nunez and felt him over  saying no word further until they  had done so      carefully   he cried  with a finger in his eye  and found they thought  that organ  with its fluttering lids  a queer thing in him  they went over  it again      a strange creature  correa   said the one called pedro   feel the  coarseness of his hair  like a llama s hair       rough he is as the rocks that begot him   said correa  investigating  nunez s unshaven chin with a soft and slightly moist hand   perhaps he  will grow finer   nunez struggled a little under their examination  but  they gripped him firm      carefully   he said again      he speaks   said the third man   certainly he is a man       ugh   said pedro  at the roughness of his coat      and you have come into the world   asked pedro       out  of the world  over mountains and glaciers  right over above  there  half way to the sun  out of the great big world that goes down   twelve days  journey to the sea      they scarcely seemed to heed him   our fathers have told us men may be  made by the forces of nature   said correa   it is the warmth of things  and moisture  and rottenness  rottenness       let us lead him to the elders   said pedro      shout first   said correa   lest the children be afraid    this is a  marvellous occasion      so they shouted  and pedro went first and took nunez by the hand to lead  him to the houses     he drew his hand away   i can see   he said      see   said correa      yes  see   said nunez  turning towards him  and stumbled against pedro s  pail      his senses are still imperfect   said the third blind man   he stumbles   and talks unmeaning words  lead him by the hand       as you will   said nunez  and was led along  laughing     it seemed they knew nothing of sight     well  all in good time he would teach them     he heard people shouting  and saw a number of figures gathering together  in the middle roadway of the village     he found it tax his nerve and patience more than he had anticipated  that  first encounter with the population of the country of the blind  the place  seemed larger as he drew near to it  and the smeared plasterings queerer   and a crowd of children and men and women  the women and girls  he was  pleased to note  had some of them quite sweet faces  for all that their  eyes were shut and sunken  came about him  holding on to him  touching him  with soft  sensitive hands  smelling at him  and listening at every word  he spoke  some of the maidens and children  however  kept aloof as if  afraid  and indeed his voice seemed coarse and rude beside their softer  notes  they mobbed him  his three guides kept close to him with an effect  of proprietorship  and said again and again   a wild man out of the rock       bogota   he said   bogota  over the mountain crests       a wild man  using wild words   said pedro   did you hear that     bogota   his mind is hardly formed yet  he has only the beginnings  of speech      a little boy nipped his hand   bogota   he said mockingly      ay  a city to your village  i come from the great world  where men have  eyes and see       his name s bogota   they said      he stumbled   said correa   stumbled twice as we came hither       bring him to the elders      and they thrust him suddenly through a doorway into a room as black as  pitch  save at the end there faintly glowed a fire  the crowd closed in  behind him and shut out all but the faintest glimmer of day  and before he  could arrest himself he had fallen headlong over the feet of a seated man   his arm  outflung  struck the face of someone else as he went down  he  felt the soft impact of features and heard a cry of anger  and for a  moment he struggled against a number of hands that clutched him  it was a  one sided fight  an inkling of the situation came to him  and he lay  quiet      i fell down   he said   i couldn t see in this pitchy darkness      there was a pause as if the unseen persons about him tried to understand  his words  then the voice of correa said   he is but newly formed  he  stumbles as he walks and mingles words that mean nothing with his speech      others also said things about him that he heard or understood imperfectly      may i sit up   he asked  in a pause   i will not struggle against you  again      they consulted and let him rise     the voice of an older man began to question him  and nunez found himself  trying to explain the great world out of which he had fallen  and the sky  and mountains and sight and such like marvels  to these elders who sat in  darkness in the country of the blind  and they would believe and  understand nothing whatever he told them  a thing quite outside his  expectation  they would not even understand many of his words  for  fourteen generations these people had been blind and cut off from all the  seeing world  the names for all the things of sight had faded and changed   the story of the outer world was faded and changed to a child s story  and  they had ceased to concern themselves with anything beyond the rocky  slopes above their circling wall  blind men of genius had arisen among  them and questioned the shreds of belief and tradition they had brought  with them from their seeing days  and had dismissed all these things as  idle fancies  and replaced them with new and saner explanations  much of  their imagination had shrivelled with their eyes  and they had made for  themselves new imaginations with their ever more sensitive ears and  finger tips  slowly nunez realised this  that his expectation of wonder  and reverence at his origin and his gifts was not to be borne out  and  after his poor attempt to explain sight to them had been set aside as the  confused version of a new made being describing the marvels of his  incoherent sensations  he subsided  a little dashed  into listening to  their instruction  and the eldest of the blind men explained to him life  and philosophy and religion  how that the world  meaning their valley  had  been first an empty hollow in the rocks  and then had come  first   inanimate things without the gift of touch  and llamas and a few other  creatures that had little sense  and then men  and at last angels  whom  one could hear singing and making fluttering sounds  but whom no one could  touch at all  which puzzled nunez greatly until he thought of the birds     he went on to tell nunez how this time had been divided into the warm and  the cold  which are the blind equivalents of day and night  and how it was  good to sleep in the warm and work during the cold  so that now  but for  his advent  the whole town of the blind would have been asleep  he said  nunez must have been specially created to learn and serve the wisdom  they  had acquired  and that for all his mental incoherency and stumbling  behaviour he must have courage  and do his best to learn  and at that all  the people in the doorway murmured encouragingly  he said the night  for  the blind call their day night  was now far gone  and it behoved every one  to go back to sleep  he asked nunez if he knew how to sleep  and nunez  said he did  but that before sleep he wanted food     they brought him food  llama s milk in a bowl  and rough salted bread  and  led him into a lonely place  to eat out of their hearing  and afterwards  to slumber until the chill of the mountain evening roused them to begin  their day again  but nunez slumbered not at all     instead  he sat up in the place where they had left him  resting his limbs  and turning the unanticipated circumstances of his arrival over and over  in his mind     every now and then he laughed  sometimes with amusement  and sometimes  with indignation      unformed mind   he said   got no senses yet  they little know they ve  been insulting their heaven sent king and master  i see i must bring them  to reason  let me think  let me think      he was still thinking when the sun set     nunez had an eye for all beautiful things  and it seemed to him that the  glow upon the snowfields and glaciers that rose about the valley on every  side was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen  his eyes went from  that inaccessible glory to the village and irrigated fields  fast sinking  into the twilight  and suddenly a wave of emotion took him  and he thanked  god from the bottom of his heart that the power of sight had been given  him     he heard a voice calling to him from out of the village   ya ho there   bogota  come hither      at that he stood up smiling  he would show these people once and for all  what sight would do for a man  they would seek him  but not find him      you move not  bogota   said the voice     he laughed noiselessly  and made two stealthy steps aside from the path      trample not on the grass  bogota  that is not allowed      nunez had scarcely heard the sound he made himself  he stopped amazed     the owner of the voice came running up the piebald path towards him     he stepped back into the pathway   here i am   he said      why did you not come when i called you   said the blind man   must you be  led like a child  cannot you hear the path as you walk      nunez laughed   i can see it   he said      there is no such word as  see    said the blind man  after a pause    cease this folly  and follow the sound of my feet      nunez followed  a little annoyed      my time will come   he said      you ll learn   the blind man answered   there is much to learn in the  world       has no one told you   in the country of the blind the one eyed man is  king        what is blind   asked the blind man carelessly over his shoulder     four days passed  and the fifth found the king of the blind still  incognito  as a clumsy and useless stranger among his subjects     it was  he found  much more difficult to proclaim himself than he had  supposed  and in the meantime  while he meditated his  coup d etat    he did what he was told and learnt the manners and customs of the country  of the blind  he found working and going about at night a particularly  irksome thing  and he decided that that should be the first thing he would  change     they led a simple  laborious life  these people  with all the elements of  virtue and happiness  as these things can be understood by men  they  toiled  but not oppressively  they had food and clothing sufficient for  their needs  they had days and seasons of rest  they made much of music  and singing  and there was love among them  and little children     it was marvellous with what confidence and precision they went about their  ordered world  everything  you see  had been made to fit their needs  each  of the radiating paths of the valley area had a constant angle to the  others  and was distinguished by a special notch upon its kerbing  all  obstacles and irregularities of path or meadow had long since been cleared  away  all their methods and procedure arose naturally from their special  needs  their senses had become marvellously acute  they could hear and  judge the slightest gesture of a man a dozen paces away  could hear the  very beating of his heart  intonation had long replaced expression with  them  and touches gesture  and their work with hoe and spade and fork was  as free and confident as garden work can be  their sense of smell was  extraordinarily fine  they could distinguish individual differences as  readily as a dog can  and they went about the tending of the llamas  who  lived among the rocks above and came to the wall for food and shelter   with ease and confidence  it was only when at last nunez sought to assert  himself that he found how easy and confident their movements could be     he rebelled only after he had tried persuasion     he tried at first on several occasions to tell them of sight   look you  here  you people   he said   there are things you do not understand in  me      once or twice one or two of them attended to him  they sat with faces  downcast and ears turned intelligently towards him  and he did his best to  tell them what it was to see  among his hearers was a girl  with eyelids  less red and sunken than the others  so that one could almost fancy she  was hiding eyes  whom especially he hoped to persuade  he spoke of the  beauties of sight  of watching the mountains  of the sky and the sunrise   and they heard him with amused incredulity that presently became  condemnatory  they told him there were indeed no mountains at all  but  that the end of the rocks where the llamas grazed was indeed the end of  the world  thence sprang a cavernous roof of the universe  from which the  dew and the avalanches fell  and when he maintained stoutly the world had  neither end nor roof such as they supposed  they said his thoughts were  wicked  so far as he could describe sky and clouds and stars to them it  seemed to them a hideous void  a terrible blankness in the place of the  smooth roof to things in which they believed  it was an article of faith  with them that the cavern roof was exquisitely smooth to the touch  he saw  that in some manner he shocked them  and gave up that aspect of the matter  altogether  and tried to show them the practical value of sight  one  morning he saw pedro in the path called seventeen and coming towards the  central houses  but still too far off for hearing or scent  and he told  them as much   in a little while   he prophesied   pedro will be here   an  old man remarked that pedro had no business on path seventeen  and then   as if in confirmation  that individual as he drew near turned and went  transversely into path ten  and so back with nimble paces towards the  outer wall  they mocked nunez when pedro did not arrive  and afterwards   when he asked pedro questions to clear his character  pedro denied and  outfaced him  and was afterwards hostile to him     then he induced them to let him go a long way up the sloping meadows  towards the wall with one complacent individual  and to him he promised to  describe all that happened among the houses  he noted certain goings and  comings  but the things that really seemed to signify to these people  happened inside of or behind the windowless houses  the only things they  took note of to test him by  and of these he could see or tell nothing   and it was after the failure of this attempt  and the ridicule they could  not repress  that he resorted to force  he thought of seizing a spade and  suddenly smiting one or two of them to earth  and so in fair combat  showing the advantage of eyes  he went so far with that resolution as to  seize his spade  and then he discovered a new thing about himself  and  that was that it was impossible for him to hit a blind man in cold blood     he hesitated  and found them all aware that he had snatched up the spade   they stood alert  with their heads on one side  and bent ears towards him  for what he would do next      put that spade down   said one  and he felt a sort of helpless horror  he  came near obedience     then he thrust one backwards against a house wall  and fled past him and  out of the village     he went athwart one of their meadows  leaving a track of trampled grass  behind his feet  and presently sat down by the side of one of their ways   he felt something of the buoyancy that comes to all men in the beginning  of a fight  but more perplexity  he began to realise that you cannot even  fight happily with creatures who stand upon a different mental basis to  yourself  far away he saw a number of men carrying spades and sticks come  out of the street of houses  and advance in a spreading line along the  several paths towards him  they advanced slowly  speaking frequently to  one another  and ever and again the whole cordon would halt and sniff the  air and listen     the first time they did this nunez laughed  but afterwards he did not  laugh     one struck his trail in the meadow grass  and came stooping and feeling  his way along it     for five minutes he watched the slow extension of the cordon  and then his  vague disposition to do something forthwith became frantic  he stood up   went a pace or so towards the circumferential wall  turned  and went back  a little way  there they all stood in a crescent  still and listening     he also stood still  gripping his spade very tightly in both hands  should  he charge them     the pulse in his ears ran into the rhythm of  in the country of the blind  the one eyed man is king      should he charge them     he looked back at the high and unclimbable wall behind  unclimbable  because of its smooth plastering  but withal pierced with many little  doors  and at the approaching line of seekers  behind these others were  now coming out of the street of houses     should he charge them      bogota   called one   bogota  where are you      he gripped his spade still tighter  and advanced down the meadows towards  the place of habitations  and directly he moved they converged upon him    i ll hit them if they touch me   he swore   by heaven  i will  i ll hit    he called aloud   look here  i m going to do what i like in this valley   do you hear  i m going to do what i like and go where i like      they were moving in upon him quickly  groping  yet moving rapidly  it was  like playing blind man s buff  with everyone blindfolded except one   get  hold of him   cried one  he found himself in the arc of a loose curve of  pursuers  he felt suddenly he must be active and resolute      you don t understand   he cried in a voice that was meant to be great and  resolute  and which broke   you are blind  and i can see  leave me alone       bogota  put down that spade  and come off the grass      the last order  grotesque in its urban familiarity  produced a gust of  anger      i ll hurt you   he said  sobbing with emotion   by heaven  i ll hurt you   leave me alone      he began to run  not knowing clearly where to run  he ran from the nearest  blind man  because it was a horror to hit him  he stopped  and then made a  dash to escape from their closing ranks  he made for where a gap was wide   and the men on either side  with a quick perception of the approach of his  paces  rushed in on one another  he sprang forward  and then saw he must  be caught  and  swish   the spade had struck  he felt the soft thud  of hand and arm  and the man was down with a yell of pain  and he was  through     through  and then he was close to the street of houses again  and blind  men  whirling spades and stakes  were running with a sort of reasoned  swiftness hither and thither     he heard steps behind him just in time  and found a tall man rushing  forward and swiping at the sound of him  he lost his nerve  hurled his  spade a yard wide at his antagonist  and whirled about and fled  fairly  yelling as he dodged another     he was panic stricken  he ran furiously to and fro  dodging when there was  no need to dodge  and in his anxiety to see on every side of him at once   stumbling  for a moment he was down and they heard his fall  far away in  the circumferential wall a little doorway looked like heaven  and he set  off in a wild rush for it  he did not even look round at his pursuers  until it was gained  and he had stumbled across the bridge  clambered a  little way among the rocks  to the surprise and dismay of a young llama   who went leaping out of sight  and lay down sobbing for breath     and so his  coup d etat  came to an end     he stayed outside the wall of the valley of the blind for two nights and  days without food or shelter  and meditated upon the unexpected  during  these meditations he repeated very frequently and always with a profounder  note of derision the exploded proverb   in the country of the blind the  one eyed man is king   he thought chiefly of ways of fighting and  conquering these people  and it grew clear that for him no practicable way  was possible  he had no weapons  and now it would be hard to get one     the canker of civilisation had got to him even in bogota  and he could not  find it in himself to go down and assassinate a blind man  of course  if  he did that  he might then dictate terms on the threat of assassinating  them all  but  sooner or later he must sleep        he tried also to find food among the pine trees  to be comfortable under  pine boughs while the frost fell at night  and  with less confidence  to  catch a llama by artifice in order to try to kill it  perhaps by hammering  it with a stone  and so finally  perhaps  to eat some of it  but the  llamas had a doubt of him and regarded him with distrustful brown eyes   and spat when he drew near  fear came on him the second day and fits of  shivering  finally he crawled down to the wall of the country of the blind  and tried to make terms  he crawled along by the stream  shouting  until  two blind men came out to the gate and talked to him      i was mad   he said   but i was only newly made      they said that was better     he told them he was wiser now  and repented of all he had done     then he wept without intention  for he was very weak and ill now  and they  took that as a favourable sign     they asked him if he still thought he could   see       no   he said   that was folly  the word means nothing  less than  nothing      they asked him what was overhead      about ten times ten the height of a man there is a roof above the world    of rock  and very  very smooth        he burst again into hysterical  tears   before you ask me any more  give me some food or i shall die      he expected dire punishments  but these blind people were capable of  toleration  they regarded his rebellion as but one more proof of his  general idiocy and inferiority  and after they had whipped him they  appointed him to do the simplest and heaviest work they had for anyone to  do  and he  seeing no other way of living  did submissively what he was  told     he was ill for some days  and they nursed him kindly  that refined his  submission  but they insisted on his lying in the dark  and that was a  great misery  and blind philosophers came and talked to him of the wicked  levity of his mind  and reproved him so impressively for his doubts about  the lid of rock that covered their cosmic casserole that he almost doubted  whether indeed he was not the victim of hallucination in not seeing it  overhead     so nunez became a citizen of the country of the blind  and these people  ceased to be a generalised people and became individualities and familiar  to him  while the world beyond the mountains became more and more remote  and unreal  there was yacob  his master  a kindly man when not annoyed   there was pedro  yacob s nephew  and there was medina sarote  who was the  youngest daughter of yacob  she was little esteemed in the world of the  blind  because she had a clear cut face  and lacked that satisfying   glossy smoothness that is the blind man s ideal of feminine beauty  but  nunez thought her beautiful at first  and presently the most beautiful  thing in the whole creation  her closed eyelids were not sunken and red  after the common way of the valley  but lay as though they might open  again at any moment  and she had long eyelashes  which were considered a  grave disfigurement  and her voice was strong  and did not satisfy the  acute hearing of the valley swains  so that she had no lover     there came a time when nunez thought that  could he win her  he would be  resigned to live in the valley for all the rest of his days     he watched her  he sought opportunities of doing her little services  and  presently he found that she observed him  once at a rest day gathering  they sat side by side in the dim starlight  and the music was sweet  his  hand came upon hers and he dared to clasp it  then very tenderly she  returned his pressure  and one day  as they were at their meal in the  darkness  he felt her hand very softly seeking him  and as it chanced the  fire leapt then and he saw the tenderness of her face     he sought to speak to her     he went to her one day when she was sitting in the summer moonlight  spinning  the light made her a thing of silver and mystery  he sat down at  her feet and told her he loved her  and told her how beautiful she seemed  to him  he had a lover s voice  he spoke with a tender reverence that came  near to awe  and she had never before been touched by adoration  she made  him no definite answer  but it was clear his words pleased her     after that he talked to her whenever he could take an opportunity  the  valley became the world for him  and the world beyond the mountains where  men lived in sunlight seemed no more than a fairy tale he would some day  pour into her ears  very tentatively and timidly he spoke to her of sight     sight seemed to her the most poetical of fancies  and she listened to his  description of the stars and the mountains and her own sweet white lit  beauty as though it was a guilty indulgence  she did not believe  she  could only half understand  but she was mysteriously delighted  and it  seemed to him that she completely understood     his love lost its awe and took courage  presently he was for demanding  her of yacob and the elders in marriage  but she became fearful and  delayed  and it was one of her elder sisters who first told yacob that  medina sarote and nunez were in love     there was from the first very great opposition to the marriage of nunez  and medina sarote  not so much because they valued her as because they  held him as a being apart  an idiot  incompetent thing below the  permissible level of a man  her sisters opposed it bitterly as bringing  discredit on them all  and old yacob  though he had formed a sort of  liking for his clumsy  obedient serf  shook his head and said the thing  could not be  the young men were all angry at the idea of corrupting the  race  and one went so far as to revile and strike nunez  he struck back   then for the first time he found an advantage in seeing  even by twilight   and after that fight was over no one was disposed to raise a hand against  him  but they still found his marriage impossible     old yacob had a tenderness for his last little daughter  and was grieved  to have her weep upon his shoulder      you see  my dear  he s an idiot  he has delusions  he can t do anything  right       i know   wept medina sarote   but he s better than he was  he s getting  better  and he s strong  dear father  and kind  stronger and kinder than  any i other man in the world  and he loves me  and  father  i love him      old yacob was greatly distressed to find her inconsolable  and  besides    what made it more distressing  he liked nunez for many things  so he went  and sat in the windowless council chamber with the other elders and  watched the trend of the talk  and said  at the proper time   he s better  than he was  very likely  some day  we shall find him as sane as  ourselves      then afterwards one of the elders  who thought deeply  had an idea  he was  the great doctor among these people  their medicine man  and he had a very  philosophical and inventive mind  and the idea of curing nunez of his  peculiarities appealed to him  one day when yacob was present he returned  to the topic of nunez      i have examined bogota   he said   and the case is clearer to me  i think  very probably he might be cured       that is what i have always hoped   said old yacob      his brain is affected   said the blind doctor     the elders murmured assent      now   what  affects it       ah   said old yacob       this    said the doctor  answering his own question   those queer  things that are called the eyes  and which exist to make an agreeable soft  depression in the face  are diseased  in the case of bogota  in such a way  as to affect his brain  they are greatly distended  he has eyelashes  and  his eyelids move  and consequently his brain is in a state of constant  irritation and distraction       yes   said old yacob   yes       and i think i may say with reasonable certainty that  in order to cure  him completely  all that we need do is a simple and easy surgical  operation  namely  to remove these irritant bodies       and then he will be sane       then he will be perfectly sane  and a quite admirable citizen       thank heaven for science   said old yacob  and went forth at once to tell  nunez of his happy hopes     but nunez s manner of receiving the good news struck him as being cold and  disappointing      one might think   he said   from the tone you take  that you did not care  for my daughter      it was medina sarote who persuaded nunez to face the blind surgeons       you  do not want me   he said   to lose my gift of sight      she shook her head      my world is sight      her head drooped lower      there are the beautiful things  the beautiful little things  the flowers   the lichens among the rocks  the lightness and softness on a piece of fur   the far sky with its drifting down of clouds  the sunsets and the stars   and there is  you   for you alone it is good to have sight  to see  your sweet  serene face  your kindly lips  your dear  beautiful hands  folded together    it is these eyes of mine you won  these eyes that hold  me to you  that these idiots seek  instead  i must touch you  hear you   and never see you again  i must come under that roof of rock and stone and  darkness  that horrible roof under which your imagination stoops     no  you would not have me do that      a disagreeable doubt had arisen in him  he stopped  and left the thing a  question      i wish   she said   sometimes      she paused      yes   said he  a little apprehensively      i wish sometimes  you would not talk like that       like what       i know it s pretty  it s your imagination  i love it  but  now          he felt cold    now    he said faintly     she sat quite still      you mean  you think  i should be better  better perhaps          he was realising things very swiftly  he felt anger  indeed  anger at the  dull course of fate  but also sympathy for her lack of understanding  a  sympathy near akin to pity       dear    he said  and he could see by her whiteness how intensely  her spirit pressed against the things she could not say  he put his arms  about her  he kissed her ear  and they sat for a time in silence      if i were to consent to this   he said at last  in a voice that was very  gentle     she flung her arms about him  weeping wildly   oh  if you would   she  sobbed   if only you would                                                  for a week before the operation that was to raise him from his servitude  and inferiority to the level of a blind citizen  nunez knew nothing of  sleep  and all through the warm sunlit hours  while the others slumbered  happily  he sat brooding or wandered aimlessly  trying to bring his mind  to bear on his dilemma  he had given his answer  he had given his consent   and still he was not sure  and at last work time was over  the sun rose in  splendour over the golden crests  and his last day of vision began for  him  he had a few minutes with medina sarote before she went apart to  sleep      to morrow   he said   i shall see no more       dear heart   she answered  and pressed his hands with all her strength      they will hurt you but little   she said   and you are going through this  pain  you are going through it  dear lover  for  me     dear  if a  woman s heart and life can do it  i will repay you  my dearest one  my  dearest with the tender voice  i will repay      he was drenched in pity for himself and her     he held her in his arms  and pressed his lips to hers  and looked on her  sweet face for the last time   good bye   he whispered at that dear sight    good bye      and then in silence he turned away from her     she could hear his slow retreating footsteps  and something in the rhythm  of them threw her into a passion of weeping     he had fully meant to go to a lonely place where the meadows were  beautiful with white narcissus  and there remain until the hour of his  sacrifice should come  but as he went he lifted up his eyes and saw the  morning  the morning like an angel in golden armour  marching down the  steeps       it seemed to him that before this splendour he  and this blind world in  the valley  and his love  and all  were no more than a pit of sin     he did not turn aside as he had meant to do  but went on  and passed  through the wall of the circumference and out upon the rocks  and his eyes  were always upon the sunlit ice and snow     he saw their infinite beauty  and his imagination soared over them to the  things beyond he was now to resign for ever     he thought of that great free world he was parted from  the world that was  his own  and he had a vision of those further slopes  distance beyond  distance  with bogota  a place of multitudinous stirring beauty  a glory  by day  a luminous mystery by night  a place of palaces and fountains and  statues and white houses  lying beautifully in the middle distance  he  thought how for a day or so one might come down through passes  drawing  ever nearer and nearer to its busy streets and ways  he thought of the  river journey  day by day  from great bogota to the still vaster world  beyond  through towns and villages  forest and desert places  the rushing  river day by day  until its banks receded and the big steamers came  splashing by  and one had reached the sea  the limitless sea  with its  thousand islands  its thousands of islands  and its ships seen dimly far  away in their incessant journeyings round and about that greater world   and there  unpent by mountains  one saw the sky  the sky  not such a disc  as one saw it here  but an arch of immeasurable blue  a deep of deeps in  which the circling stars were floating       his eyes scrutinised the great curtain of the mountains with a keener  inquiry     for example  if one went so  up that gully and to that chimney there  then  one might come out high among those stunted pines that ran round in a sort  of shelf and rose still higher and higher as it passed above the gorge   and then  that talus might be managed  thence perhaps a climb might be  found to take him up to the precipice that came below the snow  and if  that chimney failed  then another farther to the east might serve his  purpose better  and then  then one would be out upon the amber lit snow  there  and half way up to the crest of those beautiful desolations     he glanced back at the village  then turned right round and regarded it  steadfastly     he thought of medina sarote  and she had become small and remote     he turned again towards the mountain wall  down which the day had come to  him     then very circumspectly he began to climb     when sunset came he was no longer climbing  but he was far and high  he  had been higher  but he was still very high  his clothes were torn  his  limbs were blood stained  he was bruised in many places  but he lay as if  he were at his ease  and there was a smile on his face     from where he rested the valley seemed as if it were in a pit and nearly a  mile below  already it was dim with haze and shadow  though the mountain  summits around him were things of light and fire  the mountain summits  around him were things of light and fire  and the little details of the  rocks near at hand were drenched with subtle beauty  a vein of green  mineral piercing the grey  the flash of crystal faces here and there  a  minute  minutely beautiful orange lichen close beside his face  there were  deep mysterious shadows in the gorge  blue deepening into purple  and  purple into a luminous darkness  and overhead was the illimitable vastness  of the sky  but he heeded these things no longer  but lay quite inactive  there  smiling as if he were satisfied merely to have escaped from the  valley of the blind in which he had thought to be king     the glow of the sunset passed  and the night came  and still he lay  peacefully contented under the cold clear stars             xxxiii       the beautiful suit       there was once a little man whose mother made him a beautiful suit of  clothes  it was green and gold  and woven so that i cannot describe how  delicate and fine it was  and there was a tie of orange fluffiness that  tied up under his chin  and the buttons in their newness shone like stars   he was proud and pleased by his suit beyond measure  and stood before the  long looking glass when first he put it on  so astonished and delighted  with it that he could hardly turn himself away  he wanted to wear it  everywhere  and show it to all sorts of people  he thought over all the  places he had ever visited  and all the scenes he had ever heard  described  and tried to imagine what the feel of it would be if he were to  go now to those scenes and places wearing his shining suit  and he wanted  to go out forthwith into the long grass and the hot sunshine of the meadow  wearing it  just to wear it  but his mother told him  no   she told him he  must take great care of his suit  for never would he have another nearly  so fine  he must save it and save it  and only wear it on rare and great  occasions  it was his wedding suit  she said  and she took the buttons and  twisted them up with tissue paper for fear their bright newness should be  tarnished  and she tacked little guards over the cuffs and elbows  and  wherever the suit was most likely to come to harm  he hated and resisted  these things  but what could he do  and at last her warnings and  persuasions had effect  and he consented to take off his beautiful suit  and fold it into its proper creases  and put it away  it was almost as  though he gave it up again  but he was always thinking of wearing it  and  of the supreme occasions when some day it might be worn without the  guards  without the tissue paper on the buttons  utterly and delightfully   never caring  beautiful beyond measure     one night  when he was dreaming of it after his habit  he dreamt he took  the tissue paper from one of the buttons  and found its brightness a  little faded  and that distressed him mightily in his dream  he polished  the poor faded button and polished it  and  if anything  it grew duller   he woke up and lay awake  thinking of the brightness a little dulled  and  wondering how he would feel if perhaps when the great occasion  whatever  it might be  should arrive  one button should chance to be ever so little  short of its first glittering freshness  and for days and days that  thought remained with him distressingly  and when next his mother let him  wear his suit  he was tempted and nearly gave way to the temptation just  to fumble off one little bit of tissue paper and see if indeed the buttons  were keeping as bright as ever     he went trimly along on his way to church  full of this wild desire  for  you must know his mother did  with repeated and careful warnings  let him  wear his suit at times  on sundays  for example  to and fro from church   when there was no threatening of rain  no dust blowing  nor anything to  injure it  with its buttons covered and its protections tacked upon it   and a sun shade in his hand to shadow it if there seemed too strong a  sunlight for its colours  and always  after such occasions  he brushed it  over and folded it exquisitely as she had taught him  and put it away  again     now all these restrictions his mother set to the wearing of his suit he  obeyed  always he obeyed them  until one strange night he woke up and saw  the moonlight shining outside his window  it seemed to him the moonlight  was not common moonlight  nor the night a common night  and for awhile he  lay quite drowsily  with this odd persuasion in his mind  thought joined  on to thought like things that whisper warmly in the shadows  then he sat  up in his little bed suddenly very alert  with his heart beating very  fast  and a quiver in his body from top to toe  he had made up his mind   he knew that now he was going to wear his suit as it should be worn  he  had no doubt in the matter  he was afraid  terribly afraid  but glad   glad     he got out of his bed and stood for a moment by the window looking at the  moonshine flooded garden  and trembling at the thing he meant to do  the  air was full of a minute clamour of crickets and murmurings  of the  infinitesimal shoutings of little living things  he went very gently  across the creaking boards  for fear that he might wake the sleeping  house  to the big dark clothes press wherein his beautiful suit lay  folded  and he took it out garment by garment  and softly and very eagerly  tore off its tissue paper covering and its tacked protections until there  it was  perfect and delightful as he had seen it when first his mother had  given it to him  a long time it seemed ago  not a button had tarnished   not a thread had faded on this dear suit of his  he was glad enough for  weeping as in a noiseless hurry he put it on  and then back he went  soft  and quick  to the window that looked out upon the garden  and stood there  for a minute  shining in the moonlight  with his buttons twinkling like  stars  before he got out on the sill  and  making as little of a rustling  as he could  clambered down to the garden path below  he stood before his  mother s house  and it was white and nearly as plain as by day  with every  window blind but his own shut like an eye that sleeps  the trees cast  still shadows like intricate black lace upon the wall     the garden in the moonlight was very different from the garden by day   moonshine was tangled in the hedges and stretched in phantom cobwebs from  spray to spray  every flower was gleaming white or crimson black  and the  air was a quiver with the thridding of small crickets and nightingales  singing unseen in the depths of the trees     there was no darkness in the world  but only warm  mysterious shadows   and all the leaves and spikes were edged and lined with iridescent jewels  of dew  the night was warmer than any night had ever been  the heavens  by some miracle at once vaster and nearer  and  spite of the great  ivory tinted moon that ruled the world  the sky was full of stars     the little man did not shout nor sing for all his infinite gladness  he  stood for a time like one awestricken  and then  with a queer small cry  and holding out his arms  he ran out as if he would embrace at once the  whole round immensity of the world  he did not follow the neat set paths  that cut the garden squarely  but thrust across the beds and through the  wet  tall  scented herbs  through the night stock and the nicotine and the  clusters of phantom white mallow flowers and through the thickets of  southernwood and lavender  and knee deep across a wide space of  mignonette  he came to the great hedge  and he thrust his way through it   and though the thorns of the brambles scored him deeply and tore threads  from his wonderful suit  and though burrs and goose grass and havers  caught and clung to him  he did not care  he did not care  for he knew it  was all part of the wearing for which he had longed   i am glad i put on  my suit   he said   i am glad i wore my suit      beyond the hedge he came to the duck pond  or at least to what was the  duck pond by day  but by night it was a great bowl of silver moonshine all  noisy with singing frogs  of wonderful silver moonshine twisted and  clotted with strange patternings  and the little man ran down into its  waters between the thin black rushes  knee deep and waist deep and to his  shoulders  smiting the water to black and shining wavelets with either  hand  swaying and shivering wavelets  amidst which the stars were netted  in the tangled reflections of the brooding trees upon the bank  he waded  until he swam  and so he crossed the pond and came out upon the other  side  trailing  as it seemed to him  not duckweed  but very silver in  long  clinging  dripping masses  and up he went through the transfigured  tangles of the willow herb and the uncut seeding grasses of the farther  bank  he came glad and breathless into the high road   i am glad   he  said   beyond measure  that i had clothes that fitted this occasion      the high road ran straight as an arrow flies  straight into the deep blue  pit of sky beneath the moon  a white and shining road between the singing  nightingales  and along it he went  running now and leaping  and now  walking and rejoicing  in the clothes his mother had made for him with  tireless  loving hands  the road was deep in dust  but that for him was  only soft whiteness  and as he went a great dim moth came fluttering round  his wet and shimmering and hastening figure  at first he did not heed the  moth  and then he waved his hands at it  and made a sort of dance with it  as it circled round his head   soft moth   he cried   dear moth  and  wonderful night  wonderful night of the world  do you think my clothes are  beautiful  dear moth  as beautiful as your scales and all this silver  vesture of the earth and sky      and the moth circled closer and closer until at last its velvet wings just  brushed his lips                                                   and next morning they found him dead  with his neck broken  in the bottom  of the stone pit  with his beautiful clothes a little bloody  and foul and  stained with the duckweed from the pond  but his face was a face of such  happiness that  had you seen it  you would have understood indeed how that  he had died happy  never knowing that cool and streaming silver for the  duckweed in the pond             etext                                                                      or        ebooks posted since

 monicken hebben weten te seggen   clericus edoctus non est semper sale  coctus   tot eene preuve van dien sal ik voor eerst maer seggen  dat als  een persoon van de eminentste qualiteyt in dese staet hem een gunstig  oogh had toegeworpen  soo quam hy in den jare      driftig herwaerts  aengeloopen  verhoopende  dat hy nevens d andre ouwe santen  weder op  het autaer souw werden geset  maer alsler ordre quam van de heeren  staten van ho land  dat hy uyt den lande sou hebben te vertrecken  soo  gingh hy heendruypen  als een hond  die sijne staert verlooren heeft   hier nevens sal ik noch voegen  dat als hy de babylonische hoer van hare  voorname quetsure ende hooftwonde  die de eerste reformateurs haer  pag      hebben gelastigeert  heeft willen cureren  wat heeft hy daer deur  anders uytgeright  als datter is geexciteert het  classicum belli  sacri   ende dat hy geprocureert heeft sijne eyge disgracie in het hof  van sweden  daer hy doen een minister af was  soo dat hy daer van daen  vertreckende  sich begeven heeft na rostock  daer hy is overleden  meer  en sal ik voor deestydt van hem niet seggen  alsoo dit genoeg is om aen  te wysen  dat groote luyden ook hare misslagen hebben  en daerom geen  wonder en is  indien hy het in desen brief soo heel fix niet en heeft   want niet seer ver van het begin komt de goede keyser justinianus  soo  hy seyt  te voorschijn   met de tranen in de ogen  klagende  dat sijne  wetten soo weynigh voldaen wierden  by het hof van holland  ende dat  bestaet hier in  als men in den selven asem seyt  dat het selve sich  aenmatight  van toesicht te dragen  ne provincia abundat malis  hominibus   waer in of justinianus of grotius eenighsincs missen  want  soo en luyden de woorden niet in den originelen text  hoewelle van den  sin niet t eenemael en devieren  ende nochtans schreyt die goede man  daer over  wat magh hem daer toe bewegen  dit namentelik  dat de  hollanders soo dom en bot waren  dat sy  syne wetten verkeerde  applicatien ende beduydingen aen wreven   willende doen het gene sijne  praesides in voorgaende tyden hebben gedaen  uyt misduydinge van woorden   even of  praesides provinciarum met die van president en raden  een en  deselve waren  maer voor eerst sal ik hier op seggen  dat die het hof  determineert binnen de palen van praesident en raden  het selve  verongelijkt  daer van afscheurende het eerste ende principaelste lid   namentlik den stadhouwer  de luyster en voorname eer van dat collegie   soo dat de heer de groot hier sich selfs vergist  als hebbende te voren  self geschreven  daer hy handelt van de gene die in het hof sitten    horum caput est ipse praefectus hollandae   daer naer sal ik vragen   indien de praeses provinciae een goed werk doed   conquirendo nefarios     curando ut malis hominibus careat provincia   hoe kan dat quaet sijn als  dat selve by het hof werd gedaen  hoe heeft het hof dien keiser sijne  pap soo qualik gebotert  dat et soo qualik by hem te hove staet  immers  soo ruym als de praesides provinciarum de souvereyniteyt aen den keyser  gelaten hebben  soo ruym laet het hof deselve aen de heeren staten van  holland  dan hoewel dit soo is  soo pecceert et niet alleen daer in dat  het wil procureren   ut malis hominibus careat provincia   maer ook  voornementlik daer in dat et  de steden van holland onder hare    pag     vrede of vooghdye wil nemen   dan indien men die woorden soo meent en  neemt  als die seggen  soo is het eene vuyle calumnie  want waer heeft  het hof  ofte yemand die niet dul en uytsinnigh is  geseyt   us pupillus  nihil facere potest sine auctoritate tutoris   alsoo ook niet de steden  van holland sonder overstaen van het hof  maer wil men het eene gesond  verstand geven  en daer deur verstaen  in sijn recht en gerechtigheyt  maintineren  ook helpen en succurreren  daer men te kort souw schieten   om uyt te voeren het gene betaemt gedaen te sijn  soo kan  t toegestaen  werden  ende sulx en wil het hof niet alleen doen  maer is ook gehouwen  te doen  want wat isser bekender alsdat het hof d eene stadt tegen de  andere in sijne gerechtigheydt maintineert  gelijk sulx in veele ende  verscheyden exempelen te sien is  ook grotius selve  sprekende van het  hof  seyt   ipsa quoque urbium controversia  abeque magna mementi hic  disceptantur   ende voorts  en is het niet in verscher memorie  dat als  die van delft onmachtigh waren om in hare stadt behoorlicke justitie te  administreren  het hof op haer versoek  haer de behulpsame hand heeft  geboden  ende door den fiscael eenen minne uyt hare stadt doen halen   die by het hof met den swaerde is geexecuteert  ende indien men die of  diergelijke tutele den hove wil toeschrijven  dat en sal  t niet  refugieren toe te staen  hoewel  t noyt selve in sulke termen heeft  gesproken  noch ook van meninge is te spreken  om gene verdere  lasteringen op den hals te halen  gelijk dan ook noyt  t selve geseyt en  heeft  dat het is praeses provintiae  versien met eene egale maght  als in  oude tyden de praesides inde overwonnen provintien hadden  want in  sommige delen heeft het hof minder  in sommige weerom meerder  als daer  in meerder  dat et recht doet tusschen en over steden  selfs sitplaets  hebbende in de staten van holland  daer ter contratie de praesides  provinciarum sulx niet en hadden  maer gereserveert was tot het oordeel  van de keiser  waer van veele exempelen bij de munimenten van de ouwe  schryvers te vinden sijn     maer om eens op te halen  waer van daen dese parnas bende de occasie  genomen heeft  het hof aen te wryven dese calumnie  van sich te  qualificeren praesidem provinciae  soo is het inder daed soo  dat mr   willem stoop  schout van dordrecht  schriftelik dolerende over sijne  suspensie  by het hof gedaen  poseerde twee saken  van welke het eene  was  dat hem by den hove ware gelast  op de articulen hem           pag     voorgehouwen werdende  soo te antwoorden  als hy met de ede sou konnen  verklaren  het tweede  dat hy niet en wist  wie voor het hof syne  beschuldigers of aenklagers ware geweest  waer op by commissarisen  vanden hove is geantwoord  dat het eerste eene loutere onwaerheyd was   ende sodanige eene onwaerheyd  die genoeghsaem sich selven refuteerde   want dat het eene seer bekende sake was  dat niemand wierde gelast onder  ede te verklaren  die tot sijnen eygen laste wierde gehoort  soo dat hy  een rechtsgeleerde ende officier sijnde men niet ken denken sodanigen  saek te  ignoreren   ende te vergeefs men dieshalven sou gesoght hebben  hem met eene blaes met bonen vervaert te maken  op het twede is by  gemelte commissarisen geantwoord dat het niet nieuw en is  dat jemand  sonder aanklager ofte beschuldiger wierde gecondemneert  ende dat daer  in tot een exempel kon dienen  claudius gorgus  quicum esset vir  clarissinius  nemine accusante  lenocinii damnatus est a divo severo    waar van wy den text hebben in  l     sec      de aduls   daer is by  gevoeght  dat tot deselve wijs van procederen behoort  het gene wy in  jure hebben geordineert de praesidibus   curare nempe eos debere  ut  malis hominibus provincia careat  eosque conquirant   waer van de text  is in  l      ff  de officio prasidis   waer mede over een komt het gene  dat  er staet in  l    sec     ff peculat  mandatis cavetur  ut prefides  sacrileges  latrones  plagiarios conquirant    ut quisque deliquerit   in eum animadvertant   illis enim qui conquirere tenentur  non est  expectandus accusator  cesiantes enim in inquirendo mandata principum  transgediuntur    in animadversionem eorum incurrunt  indien men nu hier  uyt magh besluyten  dat et hof is de keyser severus  soo magh men oock  wel daer uyt besluyten  dat het hof is praeses provinciae  ende dat  holland als eene geconquesteerde provincie aen het selve onderworpen is   maer soo het eerste niet geseyt of geconcludeert en kan werden  als by  geprosesside sottebollen  alsoo ook niet het twede  wie heeft oyt dus  geargumenteert  soo heeft de keyser geprocedeert  ende soo heeft  geprocedeert de praeses  ende soo oock procedeert het hof  ergo soo is  het hof de keyser  of het hof is de praeses  maer seer wel  soo heeft de  keyser geprocedeert  en soo heeft geprocedeert de praeses  ergo en is het  niet nieuws dat het hof mede soo procedeert  mits evenwel blyvende yder  in de palen van sijne jurisdictie  gelijck het hof in dese saeck van mr   willem stoop heeft gedaen  obseiverende daer in hetgene keyser carel  tot tweemalen heeft geordineert eerst in de instructie van den      pag     hove geemaneert in den jare       ende daer na inden jare       daer wel  uytdruckelick staet   de stadthouwer praesident en raden sullen  naerstelick monsteren  om te vernemen de abusen ende delicten vande  bailluwen  ende andre officiers  ende deselve gehoort sijnde te  corrigeren  na exigentie van saken  alwaer wel uytdruckelick  gedefinieert is wie dat inquireren en corrigeren sullen  namentelick de  stadthouwer praesident en raden  sonder de minste mentie van fiscael   aenklager ofte beschuldiger  daer na de last   sullen inquireren   ende  oock   naerstelick  sonder dissimulatie  ten derden  de ordre die  geobserveert moet werden  als eerst   inquireren   ten tweden   hooren    ten derden  corrigeren   sonder de minste mentie te maken van proces   het sy ordinaris of extraordinaris  het welcke dewyl men siet dat dit  klemt  soo souw men garen de gantsche instructie  als een ouwt kleed dat  afgesleten is t eenemael verwerpen  alsoo keyser carel selve sou seggen    dat by sich niet en kon inbeelden dat dit alles nu langer geobserveert  wierde  dewyl nu de souvereyn altijd tegenwoordig is   maer hoe sober  dese solutie is kan licht daer uyt afgenomen werden  dat op den eersten  rechtdagh van  t jaer de instructie van den selven keyser werd  vernieuwt  ende by de suppoosten wederom besworen  gelijck dan de heer  de groot in sijne tijden het selve verscheyde malen heeft gedaen  welcke  eer de wetten van justinianus noyt hier te lande hebben gehad  ende of  niet het voorengemelde articul in volkomen observantie is geweest binnen  den tijd van dertigh veertigh en meer jaren  souwen de exempelen van  veel schouten en bailluwen konnen aenwijsen  indien  t niet te langwylig  en ware  ik sal verder vragen  als heer de groot heeft voorgenomen te  handelen en aen te wysen   qua in bello fuerit  post bellum sit  batavorum respublica   of hy niet wel en had behoren aen te wijsen dat  dese instructie was geabollert en in ongebruyck geraakt  maer  mentioneert hy daer wel een woord van  ja en seyt hy niet ter contrarie    ordines eandum semper non rempublicum modo  sed   reipublica faciem  retinuerunt   waer komt dan dese abolitie van de instructie ende  vernietinge van daen  als dat die onder hare cramery in hare mersch niet  en past  alia tempora  alii mores  te voren sprack men van ordre   reglementen  van eenigheyd  nu roept men allesints met luyder kelen niet  anders als van liberteyt en vryheydt  soodanigh dat men tusschen die en  ongebondenheyd geene onderscheyten maekt  wat my belanght  ick      pag      ben in vreedsamige tyden  ende oock in een vry land gebooren  ende  gelijck ick hoop in vreedsamige tyden  alsoo hoop ick oock in een vry  land te sullen sterven  soo ver oock  dat ick van die hope ben  dat noch  ick  noch mijne kinderen  sal ofte sullen behoeve te sien  dat er een  hollandsch romen sal opstaen  daer de andre leden onder souwen moeten  suchten  sed ut sub specie boni   qui perniciose quandoque erratur  ita  sub specie libertatis saepe saevissima servitutis iniiciuntur vincula   waer van om andre voorby te gaen  de monicken ons exempelen genoeg  geven  die groote liberteyt belovende  jonge of onervarene luyden uyt de  gehoorsaemheid van ouwers of voogden trecken  ende in een eeuwige  slavernye van het klooster leven daer naer verdrucken  daerse van ouwers  of magistraet noyt uyt gereddert en konnen werden  ende siet eens of  hier niet na en sweemt het doen van de gene die nu tot dordrecht het  oppergesagh hebben  die quansuys de borgers willen schijnen vry te  maeken van het oppergesagh van stadhouwer praesident en raden  maer  alleen om dat sy alleen souwen mogen na haer believen heerschen  d andre  van hoger hand met alle gene hulp en hadden te verwachten  want al dit  gewoel  waerom men het land in roeren stelt  en is niet om de arme en  onnosele burgers in meerder vryheyd te stellen  maer op dat de geene   die nu het meesterschap menen in handen te hebben  inde schaepskoy wat  vryer en ruymer souwen mogen domineren  ende hare schotels met het vet   ende hare lendenen met de wol wat rijckelijcker te konnen versien  ende  om dat er sijn die haer selven niet garen tot eene proy souwen  overgeven  daerom heft men sulck een geschreeu op  daerom heeft het hof   dat haer inde weegh is  de lever gegeten  daerom werpe men sulck een  gesnater uyt   dat er geen reguard meer genomen en werd  of de rechter  en aengeklaeghde malkander te nabestaan  ende de berichter partye  ende  partye berichter was  dat het axiame extraterritorium  aut sine  auctoritate jus dicenti impune non paretur  dat  deliberante principe  nihil esse innovandum  wierden met de voet getreden   maer om de  waerheyde te seggen  veel geschreeus en weynigh wol  want hoe kan men  met eenige waerschijnlickheyd seegen  dat in al het dortsche werck de  aenklager ende rechter malkanderen te na hebben bestaen  daer het notoir  is dat geen recht by  t hof en is gedaen  als alleen inde saek van den  schout  en welke nochtans  als te voren is geseyt  gene aenklager en is  geweest  wat men nu met het woord  berichter  wil verstaen     pag       is my onbekent  dewijl sulx in de neerlandsche styl van procederen niet  en is bekent  gelijck ik mede niet en weet  dat in de roomsche  rechtspleginge yet diergelyx bekent is geweest  maer dat kan ick seggen   dat by aldien yemand in het hof souw hebben gesustineert duplicem  personam  van welcke d eene tegens d andre streed  dat sulx singulierlik  souw sijn gestraft geweest  ende sulx die dat seyt sonder nader bewys  een calumniateur is  dat geseyt werd  extra territorium jus dicenti  impune non paretur   hoe kan dit hier plaets hebben  daer het hof in  dese saek van stoop recht gedaen heeft hier in den haegh  inde ordinaris  residentie plaets  van over eenige honderd jaren daer voor bekent   immers soo inept is het dat men seyt  sine auctoritate jus dicenti    want wien is eene officier ratione officii anders onderworpen  als den  hove van holland  wat men nu ten laetsten daer by voeght   deliberante  principe nihil esse innovandum   dat komt hier in  t minste niet te pas   dewyl  t van het eerste begin dat die van dordrecht dese saek voor de  heeren staten hebben gebraght  gedecideert is  want syluyden  versoeckende  dat het hof geordineert sou werden stil te staen  soo en  is  t selve versoeck niet ingewillight  ende naderhand  het selve  versoeck geitereert sijnde  is bij de voorgaende resolutie  gepersisteert  ende vervolgens is verstaen  si non expresse  saltem  tacite  dat het hof souw mogen voortgaen  het welke die van dordrecht  daer na  maer te laet merkende  dat het hen obsteerde hebben versocht   dat die notulen uyt de resolutien van de gemelde heeren staten souwen  mogen werden gelight  het welk hen  te laet opsijnde  geweygert is  soo  dat daer uyt blijkt  dat hoewel op de saek ten principalen nader  deliberatien souwen mogen komen te vallen  dat evenwel die by de heeren  staten is gedetermineert  voor soo veel als de surchance ofte voortgangh  der proceduyren van  t hof aengaet  daerom  soulageert vry de dordsche  vriendetjes  et dot  deliberante   het sal haer immers soo wel helpen   als een papje na de dood     dese gedreyghde surchance dan uyt de weegh sijnde  isser te recht verder  voortgegaen met informeren  tot dat van de klachten consterende  de  eerste nominatie is gerejecteert  tot groot milcontentement van dese  parnas bende  dewelcke sustineert  dat sijne hoogheydt het recht niet en  heeft om in die saek te informeren  veel min om die nomenatie te niet te  doen  voornamentlick voor en al eer men partyen daer op hadde gehoort   soo dat men nu in alle vierscharen wel moght uitwissen  de seer     pag      bekende spreuke   aude   alteram partem   het welke  hoewel het in haer  selven sijn poincten van gene seer diepe speculatie  soo maektmen  nochtans daer seer groot bohey van  soo dat die niet verby gegaen en  konnen werden  om dan daer af yet te seggen  soo sal ik praemitteren   sijne hoogheyd van den ophef van dese saek niet van meninge te sijn  geweest  eenige proceduyren aen te vangen  ende dat hy sulx ook aen de  commissarisen heeft verklaert  als hy hen de articulen  in welke de  beswaernissen begrepen stonden  terhanden stelde  het welke ook  commissarisen ter vergaderinge hebben bekent gemaekt  wel expresselik  daer by voegende  dat de meninge niet en was van sijne hoogheydt of van  den hove  om civilic ofte criminelik te ageren  maer datmen alleen  verseerde in een naekt ondersoek van waerheydt  op dat sijne hoogheyt de  klaghten  by eenige burgers van dordrecht gedaen  niet lightvaerdigh  souw verwerpen  of ook de nominatie door sijne electie sou komen te  approberen  indiense misschien informeel moghte sijn  soo dat hier de  questie is  of soo een bloot ondersoek van waerheydt daer gene  rechtspleginge op en staet te volgen  sijne hoogheydt heeft mogen doen  of niet  eer ik hier yet op segge  soo sal ik praemitteren  dat gelijk de  nominatie de dekenen toekomt  van de mannen van achten  dat alsoo mede  aen sijne hoogheydt de electie toekomt  dat is gelijk de dekenen sijn  gehouwen eene rechte ende deughdelijke nominatie te doen  dat alsoo mede  sijne hoogheydt eene rechte ende deugdelijke electie  nam paria sunt   aliquid non facere    non facere debite   legitimo modo  sal nu sijne  hoogheydt debito   legitimo modo sijne electie doen  soo moet hy ook  toesien niet alleen  dat hy in sijne electie niet en exorbiteert  maer  ook  dat hy die niet en doed uyt eene nominatie  die informeel ende  onwettigh is  alsoo uyt eene informele nominatie gene wettige electie en  kan gedaen werden  immers al soo weynigh als eene electie kan gedaen  werden sonder nominatie  dewijl het geen informeel is  niet meer geacht  werd  als of het gansch niet en ware  ende daerom soo sal ik seggen  dat  sijne hoogheydt seer wel heeft vermogen  ja gehouwen is geweest  op de  waerheyt van de klaghten hem overgelevert  te informeren  het sy selve  ofte ook door andre  nam quae per alios facimus  ipsi facere videmur   quia nobis impellentibus fiunt  nu is het soodanigh  gelijk cicero seyt  officiorum primo   inprimis homini propriam esse veri inquisicionem  atque investigationem   ende   falli  errare  labi  decipitam dedicere   quam delirare   mente captum esse   is het  segh ik  soodanig     pag      waer past het beter de waerheyt te ondersoeken  als daer men verseert in  saken van staet  en daermen verseert in  t bestellen van de  magistrature  aen welke het welvaren hanght van landen ende steden  ende  is het soo schandelick te missen  vallen  bedrogen te werden  wien  voeght sulx minder  als personagien van soo eminente qualiteyt  als is  sijne hoogheydt  indien men hem wil constringeren om sonder  onderscheydt  uyt alle nominatien  hoedanigh die ook souwen mogen sijn   electie te doen  soo sal men hem bedwingen in sulk een perk  uyt het  welk hij sich niet en sal konnen redden  sonder mis te tasten  ende  sonder den lande grote ondienst toe te brengen  het welk van de grootste  iniquiteyt niet te excuseren en is  alle menschen  soo ver sy met  vernuft begaeft sijn  en sullen niet yetwes van eenige importantie  sijnde  by de hand nemen  of sy sullen niet alleen inquireren   ondersoeken en overleggen hoe het in haren boesem gelegen is  wegens het  gene sy voor hebben  maer examineren ook het gene buyten haer is   namentlik offer gene obstaculen sijn  die haer souwen konnen  verhinderen  gelijk yemand  die eene reys buyten s lands meent aen te  nemen  overleyt niet alleen  of dat nut voor hem sal sijn  maer ook  of  hy wel schuyt en wagen  tot sijne dienst sal konnen krijgen  of de wegen  door vyanden of stroopers niet beseten sijn  met noch vyfentwintigh  andre dingen meer  maer soo syne hoogheydt yet diergelyx doed  en dat in  eene sake van het groote gewichte  handen vande bank  dat sijn regalien   dat en komt hem niet toe  of moest bewesen werden  dat het hem  specialick vergunt was  maer my belangende  soo wil ik wel eens  gevraeght hebben  waer het ondersoeken  informeren  of horen van  getuygen  een speciael regael werd genoemt   t sy by de ouwe schryvers   die de consuetudines feudorum by een gevoeght hebben  of die haer  naderhand op dat spoor sijn gevolght  ende geen speciael regael sijnde   soo en kan het niet wel speciael gegeven geweest sijn  ja ick sal meer  seggen  dat het gene yder een toekomt jure naturali   omnibus communi   gelijk als dit doed  geen regael en is  ende ook niet sijn en kan  of de  natuer self moest omgekeert werden  ende by exempel  de verklaringen   die genomen werden  ad perpetuam rei memoriam  gelijkenen die wel  regalien  als  neemt dat ik aen een stuck leengoeds yet te kost geleyt  hebbe  het welk ik sou konnen repeteren  indien  t quame te         pag      vervallen  ende op dat daer van t alled tijden souw mogen blijken  ik  voor notaris en getuygen  of voor eenigen rechter  doe verklaringe  beleggen  usurpere ik daer mede regalien  wie heeft oyt sulx gehoort  wy  weten  dat jurisdictie te plegen  dat sijne hoogheydt binnen dordrecht  niet en heeft gepretendeert  een regael is  maer in het minste niet het  simple ende eenvoudige hooren van getuygen  daerom  als  ten tijde van  jan de eerste  sekere baillu van zuyt hollant begeerde met schepenen van  dordrecht  te ondersoeken op sommige saken ende misdaden   welk men doen  plagh te noemen  stille waerheydt besitten   die tot dordrecht waren  geschiet   soo hebben deselve schepenen sonder eenige discepatie    toegestaen voor die reyse met hem te sitten  niet om te oordelen en  rechten  maer om te ondersoeken   als wel wetende  dat het selfe   ondersoeken  henluyden in hare jurisdictie gene prejudicie en gaf    quia judicium a citatione  ut pragmatici loquuntur   initium sumit   of  soo justinianus spreekt sec  finali  de paena temere litiguntum   omnium  actionum instituendarum principium ab ea parte edicti proficiscitur  qua  prator edicit  de la jus vecando   maer als de graef selve over hare  borgers recht spreken ende oordelen wilde  soo hebben schepenen  die te  voren soo facyl tegen den baillu waren geweest  sich selven wel  ernstelick daer tegen gekant  seggende                onse handvest segget wel          dat wy ende niemand el          recht ende vonnes seggen mogen           over onse poorters van lagen van hogen           deese vryheyd gaf u oude vader          coninc willem  die wy allegader          hebben bezegelt en beschreven           dus ons van uwen ouwers bleven      het welke veele onlusten gebaert en haer in veele swarigheden heeft  geinvolveert  die sy standvastigh hebben uytgestaen  daerse niet  difficyl aen den baillu  als hy niet verder en pretendeerde als het   ondersoecken  ende horen van getuygen  haer hebben getoont  ik weet  wel  datmen ook kan informeren om een begin van een proces te maken  het  geen hier niet alleen niet en is geschiet  maer waer tegen men altydt  heeft geprotesteert  ende sulcx doet men ongelijck aen sijne        pag      hoogheydt  datmen hem uytmaeckt voor eene usurpueur van eens anders  jurisdictie  waerom en siet men hier niet in  als men in andere saken  gewoon is te doen  faciendi causam  volgens den wel bekenden regel    nonfactum  sed facienda causa inspicienda est   want soo leert ons  ulpianus in l      ff  de furtis   verum est  si meretricem  alunam  ancillam  rapuit quis  velcelavit  furtum non esse  nec enim factum  quantur se causa faciendi  causa autem facienda libide furt  non  furtum   en soo en heeft het informeren van sijn hoogheydt gene andre  oorsaeck gehad  als de begeerte van de waerheydt  ende niet usurpatie  van jurisdictie  gelijck oock het vervolg heeft getoont  nu voortgaende  sal ick seggen  hoewel dese dingen genoegh sijn om volkomentlick het  recht van sijne hoogheyt te adstrueren  soo sullen even wel wy eens  aenschouw nemen  wat de beschreven wetten disponeren   t gene tot  beweringe vande selve saek souw mogen dienen  ende daer vinden wy dan in  jure canonico  dat de gene die het confirmeren van een gekoren prelaet  toe komt  oock toekomt het ondersoeck vande keur of electie  en ook  vande bequaemheyt van den gekoren persoon  ende anders geschiedende  soo  heeft plaets dat er gestatueert is in  cap  nihil est     extr  de  election  non solum deiseiendus est indigne promotus  verum   indigne  promovens punlendus   op welcken text pinormitanus aenteyckent   debet  confirmator inquirere de electionis forma   meritis electi    hodie  facta confirmatione sine causa cognitione  est ipso sure nulla   nu soo  sich heeft de confirmatie tot de electie  soo heeft sich ook de electie  tot de nominatie  sulx dat men van het eene tot het andre valide magh  argumenteren  ende seggen  het gene plaets heeft in het eene  oock  plaets moet hebben in het andre  ende gelijck die de confirmatie heeft  oock moet inquireren op de voorgaende electie  oock soo moet inquireren   die de electie heeft  op de voorgaende nominatie  dewyl daer deselve  reden is  oock het selve recht moet plaets hebben  maer hier tegen  schrijft  soo men seyt  de heere de groot  dat justinianus verklaerde    dat dat maer alleen inde kerckelicke bedieninge  onder den paeus   plaets hadde  ende het selve aen sijne wetten geene prejuditie te  geven   dan ick geloof dat het dien goeden heer inde memorie sal sijn  geslagen  nu niet meer geheugende het gene hy te voren geweten heeft   dat geschiet inde classicale vergaderingen  na het beroep  namentlick   dat daer mede werd geexamineert de beroepinge ende beroepenes qualiteyt  beyde  ende nu niet meer geheugende het gene hy te vooren van       pag      het geestelijcke of canonyke recht selfs heeft geschreven  als mede dat  hy aen justinianus het meeste gelijck niet en doed  niet eens gedenkende  dat justinianus selfs is de gene  die het fundament van het canonyke  recht heeft gelegt  want dit recht is originelick gesproten uyt de  besluyten  regulen ofte canones inde synodale vergaderingen beraemt ende  vast gestelt  welcke  alsoose te vooren in sich selven ingesien  van  politique macht ende auctoriteyt waren gedestitueert  soo heeft  justinianus die  d allerste  daer by gedaen gevende haer de auctoriteyt   die sijne andre wetten hadden  als men sien kan in sijn novella      het  welck dan is geweest het begin van het jus canonicum  waer op gevolgt  is  dat inde verdere tyden de keisers selve  ofte uyt haren naem hare  volmagtigde inde concilien ofte synoden hebben de gepresideert  der  selver decreten ook  alsde voorgaende  kracht ende autoriteyt bekomen  hebben  hoewel datse van de gene niet in schrift geredigeert en zijn   die macht hadden om wetten te maken  moetende de keisers als aucteurs   ende de schrijvers als ministers geconsideruert worden  waer naer daer  by gevoeght zijn de decreten van de pausen  die op sekere voorvallen  zijn of wierden geconsulteert  tot welcke gregorius de ix  verscheyden  dingen  genomen ex jure civili  heeft bijgevoeght  self van sodanige   daer hy niet van geconsulteert en wierde  waer naer van d een en  d andere noch jet is aengelapt  ende dit dan soo zijnde  wilde ick wel  eens gevraght hebben  of justinianus sichs selvens niet soude vergeten  hebben  als hy alle auctoriteyt aen het jus canonicum souw schijnen te  derogeren  ende het niet eer te geloven is  dat hy justinianus hier in  niet wel en heeft verstaen  wat nu de heer de groot selve aengaet  die  hier toont sich selven niet meer te kennen  ofte ten minsten te geheugen  wat hy voor desen van dit recht heeft gehouwen  soo sullen wy hem in  fijne swackheyd te gemoed komen  en helpen herdencken  wat hy voor desen  van dit canonyke recht heeft geoordeelt  hij verhaelt dan in het derde  boeck de jure belli cap      met veel lof  dan met inde neerlandsche  oorlogen  de limit of frontierlanden  betalende sekere contributie  aen  wederzyden heeft gecultiveert  ende hy voeght daer by   hos mores  humanitatis magistri canones christianis omnibus  ut majorem ceteris  humanitatem debentibus ac profitentibus imitandes proponuns   ende om te  bewysen dat sulcx descendeert ex jure cononico  soo allegeert hy daer  toe cap     extr  de treuga   pace  het welck een decreet is        pag      gestatueert in concilio luateranensi  ten tijden van alexander de derde   soo dat klaer blijckt  dat hy daer het jus canonicum ver stelt boven het  jus civile of justinianeum  gelijck hy het selve mede doed in het twee  deel van het eerste boeck sijns hollandsche rechtsgeleertheyds  want na  dat hy van het roomsche recht gesproken heeft  gebruyckt hy dese  woorden   gelijk ook daer na gebeurt is  dat eenige saken in meerder  billickheyd zijnde overleyd   als wel justinianus heeft gedaen   by een  groot deel der christenheyd jet nader aengenomen  ende seer oneygentlik  bekomen hebbende de naem van geestelijke of pauselicke rechten  ook in  dese landen kracht van wet heeft bekomen   waer uyt wy dan besluyten   dat het gene hier te voren ex jure canonico is geallegeert wel ende te  recht geallegeert is  ende hier te lande in desen ook plaets moet  grypen  voornamentlik  daer in beyde de gevallen de selve rede  militeert  want dat is seker  dat de formaliteyten in het politijc soo  wel als in het ecclesiastijc moeten werden geobserveert  alsoo die  genegligeert zijnde  soo wel in  t eene als in  t andere  alle actitata  komen te vervallen  ende soo wel als het opsprakelik is  jemand  onbequaem zijnde  te vorderen tot kerkampten  alsoo wel is het mede  opsprakelik  jemand tot politike digniteyten te vorderen  die der selver  onbequaem souw mogen zijn  soo dat het geene expres gestatueert is in  approbatione  ex identitate rationis mede moet gerecipieert werden in  electione  ende al waer het schoon  dat wy dat fundament in jure  canonico niet en hadden  zijn wy daerom gedestitueert van andere ex jure  civili  is het niet soo wel eene regel juris civilis quam canonici   qui  vult consequens vult   antecedens   ende wederom   concesso aliquo etiam  ea concessa videntur  sine quibus illud expediri non potest   het welk  ook soo verregaet  dat al waer het  dat de uytvoeringe vande commissie  niet en kon werden geexecuteert  sonder  t exerceren van regalien  want  dat selve werd dan verstaen mede inde comissie begrepen te zijn  als te  sien is by rosenth  de feudis cap     concl      n     het welk ook de  leer is van cumanus  zafius  mozzius en andere  staetmen sijne hoogheyd  de electie toe  soo moetmen hem ook toestaen het gene sonder het welk hy  de electie niet en kan doen  ofte dat het selve is  niet behoorlik en  kan doen  dat is informeren op alles dat ontrent het selve subject te  indageren staet  en wil men daer van eene text ex jure civili  men sal  die vinden genoegsaem in terminis leggende  in l     c  si contra jus  vel utilitatem pub  daer de keiser constantinus rescribeert in      pag      deser voegen   eisi non cognitio sed excecutio mandatur  de veritate  precum inquiri oportet  ut si frans intervenerit  de omni negotio  cognoscatur   de saek is dus gelegen geweest  op de supplicatie van  seker persoon  heeft de keiser last gegeven aen pompejanus consulatis  campaniae  die doe onder den keiser dat quartier van italie regeerde  dat  sekere sententie  ten voordeele van den suppliant  soude ter executie  leggen  sonder jet meer daer by te voegen  pompejanus het werk by de  hand nemende  bevind dat  et soo glad niet en gaet  maer gelijk het  schijnt  datter oppositie valt  derhalven vind pompejanus sich verlegen   als siende dat sijne commissie niet verder en ley  als om te executeren   ende dat aen dit werk wat meerder vast was  als eene simpele en blote  executie  ende daerom neemt pompejanus sijn recours tot den keiser   gelijk sijne stadhouwers  in alle voorvallende swarigheid  gewoon zijn  geweest te doen  ende sulx soo geeft hy hem te kennen  hoe  t met die  saek gelegen was  waer op nu de keiser antwoord  hoewel hem met expresse  woorden niet en was aenbevolen  kennisse te nemen ende te oordelen vande  saek self  maer dat sijne commissie niet verder en sprak  als van de  executie  dat hy evenwel behoort te inquireren ende ondersoeken op de  waerheid van het te kennen geven van den suppliant  ende soo hy bevind  datter eenig bedrog mede vermengt is  ende dat de suppliant den keiser  geabuseert heeft  dat hy pompejanus dan sal kennisse nemen vande geheele  saek  ende die determineren  dit nu in effect zijnde het gene de keiser  verstaen heeft  gaet nu heen  segt dat het inquireren een regael is   datmen  t niet mach excerceren sonder expresse commissie  dat sijne  hoogheyd de nominatie niet mach voor onwettig verclaren  ende  diergelijke moye dingen meer  maer siet eens of al dit getuyt niet en  komt te vervallen door dese eene wet van constantinus alleen  ende om  noch verder te gaen  indien sijne hoogheyd  uyt dese lieve nominatie   electie hadde gedaen  ende daer mede deselve nominatie geapprobeert  wat  soude men daer af hebben moeten oordeelen volgens de dispositie vande  roomsche wetten  sou men niet moeten seggen  dat hij qualick hadde  gedaan  ende het gene niet en behoorde  buytentwyffel  ja  en so men  daer af begeert eene wet  ik salse mede geven genoegsaem in terminis   zijnde in ordre de twaelfde sub titulo digestorum de appellationibus   maer tot illucidatie van dien sal ik voor af seggen  antequam aliquis  duumvir crearetur  indici debuisse concilium publicum  quae indictio in  eo negotio requisita fuit solemnitas  soo als ons aengewesen        pag      werd in l  nominationes  c  de appellat  nu is het gebeurt  ut omissa  illa solemnitate  nulloque actu ex lege habito  aliquis popularium  vocibus duumvir postularetur  waer toe de stadhouwer sijn advoy ende  consent mede heeft gegeven  soo dat dien het duumvirat overdrongen was   goed gevonden heeft te appelleren  maer wat seyt de jurisconsultus  ulpianus daer van in illa lege duodecima  in  t reguard van den  stadhouder   eum comfontire non debuisse   ende in reguard van den  opgeworpen duumvir   in re aperta appellationem esse supervacuam   want  alles was nul en krachteloos  soo wel de proceduyren van  t volk  als  het advoy en consent vande stadhouwer  en waerom doch nul  niet om  dat et sou gedaen zijn by die gene  die gene nominatie of electie  of  recht van creeren en hadden  meer om dese eene informaliteyt  dat die  gerequireerde en solemnele convocatie niet en ware voorgegaen  en hier  in  t nomineren vande mannen van achten  hoe is  t daer mede toegegaen   komt het wel op eene aen  om andere informaliteyten nu verby te gaen  is  die niet geschiet ten overstaen van die daer niet en hadden behooren te  wesen  hebben niet mede nevens sommige dekens eenige overluyden gestemt   die het gans niet toe en komt  sijnse niet overstemt  die niet overstemt  en konnen werden  soo sijne hoogheyd hier sijn advoy ende consent mede  hadde toegebracht  en souw niet yder een met ulpiano moeten seggen  hebben   eum consentire non debuisse   maer neen sal men seggen  dit en  heeft hier gene plaets  want het gerecht hadde hier alrede in versien   ende de nominatie gelegitimeert  ende soo en had hy sulk eene censure  niet te vreesen  ja dat is soo dat men  t seyt  want die van dordrecht  schrijven sulx publijkelik  en willen  t van yder een mede soo gelooft  hebben  ende het is waer ik hoor mede seulken tael  maer die klinck my  inde oren  als of men seggen wilde  even gelijk een souverain een  basterd of onwettig geboren legitimeert  ende neven andre wettig  geboorne doed passeren  het selve gerecht also mede bevoegt is  eene  onwettige en informe nominatie wettig te maken  ende nevens andre  wettige en deugdelijke  als van een alloy ende valeur zijnde  te doen  deurgaen  ende in gevolge al isser overstemminge gevallen  daer gene  overstemminge plaets kan hebben  al is de nominatie geschiet in  tegenwoordigheid  ten overstaen ende directie vande gene die de  privilegien en wetten daer van submoveren  al nomineren mede de  gene die volghens privilegien gene qualiteyt en hebben  om te       pag      nomineren  al is de nominatie niet vry geschiet  maer door ongehoorde  cuperyen en dreygementen geforceert  als maer de aessem van het gerecht  daer over gaet  soo vallen alle seeren af  alle leemten verdwynen  en  men is van alle corruptien gesuyvert  ja soo seer als een duyfje dat de  pocken heeft  daer immer niet op en valt te smalen  ende daer mede gaet  soodanige nominatie deur nevens de beste die van alle ouwe tyden souwen  mogen sijn geschiet  is dat niet wel gesuyvert ende gelegitimeert  ik  heb dat wel geleert  dat voor desen aen den souverain het recht van  legitimeren plagh toe te komen  maer niet aen eenigh subaltern gerecht   altijdt niemand en souw voor desen sulx hebben derven sustineren  maer  onwettige actien en valsche positien voor wettige ende ware te  verklaren  en weet ik niet dat oyt voor desen eenig souverain heeft  gedaen  of oock sijne maght misbruykende  in het toekomende sal willen  doen  soo dat de majesteyt van dit gerecht  soo ver de souverainiteyt  van andre hooge machten te boven gaet  dan dit en is soo seer niet te  verwonderen  dewijl dit gerecht al noch yet meerder heeft  dat andere  recht bancken noch hoven van justitie niet en hebben  dat namentlik het  selve eens geoordeelt hebbende  andermael van de selve saeck magh  oordelen  het welcke soo niet en plagh te wesen  als wy in onse  jonckheyt uyt terentio hebben geleert  want wy hoorden den daer phormio  spotsgewijse aen demipho dese woorden te gemoet voeren               at tu  qui sapiens es  magistratus adi           judicium de eadem causa iterum ut reddant tibi           quandoquidem solus regnas  et soli licet          hic de eadem causa bis iudicium adipiscier       of alle de gene die in dat gerecht sitten  dese les wel geleert sullen  hebben en weet ick niet  maer dat tonen sy altijdt  dat die voor dees  tijdt  haer niet te pas en komt  want  na dat het selve gerecht  uyt  hare absolute en souvereyne maght  de nominatie  met kennis van saken   heeft gelegitimeert  en overgesonden  soo verstaet het dat by het selve  noch souw staen te examineren  offer in de selve nominatie eenige  abuysen of informaliteyten waren begaen  indien sijne hoogheydt  of  yemand anders  wilden sustineren  dat er eenige begaen waren  ende die  bevonden sijnde  soo souw het selve gerecht  na desselfs            pag      gewoonlicke billickheyt  deselve corrigeren en beteren  ende hier uyt  resulteert dan noch eene derde preeminentie boven alle hoven ende  rechtbancken  dat het soo doende  sal oordelen in sijne eygen saeck   want in  t examineren van de informaliteyten  sal mede in consideratie  konnen komen  of oock de oversendinge van de nominatie wel en op  behoorlicke tydt is gedaen  ten anderen  of het hooft van de nominatie  niet puyr valsch is  als sijnde in  t selve gestelt persoonen in wiens  presentie die souw sijn geschiet  die daer wel present hadden behooren  te sijn  maer inder daed daer niet en sijn geweest  ende verswygende   dat er die present sijn geweest  die daer gans niet en hoorden  ten  derden  of niet het gerechte selfs  t geen is geweest  dat de over  luyden heeft geauthoriseert op de nominatie van de mannen van achten  present te mogen sijn om door haer  in praejudicie van de dekens  de  maght van de nominatie in haer gewelt te krygen  ten vierden  of eenige  uyt den gerechte selfs haer niet en hebben vervorderd  tegens de wetten  aen  niet alleen schandelick te kuypen  maer ook dekenen hebben  geforceert door dreygementen ende beloften  siet  alle dese moye  dingetjes  en meer andre die het in  t geheel heeft gedaen  of voor een  goed gedeelte aen heeft geparticipeert  die sal het gerecht oordelen en  na meriten corrigeren  ende dat   t geene sonderlinge te noteren staet   na soo eene sine en solemnele legitimatie  ende daer het hof niet magh  oordelen van sijne competente jurisdictie  als dese parnas bende seyt   daer vermagh het gerecht van dordrecht dit niet alleen  maer oock alle  andre moye fraigheden  hier voren verhaelt  sijn dat niet moye bonen   want sy rollen als erten     maer dit  en wat er meer souw mogen sijn  souw men wel schoon en suyver   als men seyt  gedilueert hebben  immers soo wel geloof ick alsmen  t te  voren had gelegitimeert   hadden die van dordrecht sijne hoogheydt   wegens de gepretendeerde informaliteyten  esclaircessement ofte bericht  mogen geven  als de commissarisen van het hof  aen wiens jurisdictie sy  haer niet garen getrocken sagen  daer niet tegenwoordigh waren geweest    dan het en schort die lieden daer niet  want sy weten wel dat die  commissarissen in die saeck noyt jurisdictie en hebben geexerceert  maer  ook daer en boven publikelick hebben verklaert  daer in gene jurisdictie  civilik of criminelick te sullen exerceren  gelijck oock het soo klaer  als den dagh blyckt  dat sy  t tot noch toe niet en hebben          pag      gedaen  noch van meningh en sijn te doen  maer het bericht  dat men  geven wilde  dat woude men doen in crepusculo  als de vleer muysen en de  nacht uylen beginnen te vliegen    remotis arbitis  nu  waerom sy dat  soo wilden  weten sy selve wel  en die van sinnen niet berooft en is   kan het wel lichtelick denken  om dat men dan gedwongen werd het auter  te ontdecken  ende te toonen wat properheden daer onder schuylen  soo  moet ick seggen  dat sijne hoogheydt aen burgemeesteren ende regenten  van dordrecht geschreven hebbende  dat sy eenige uyt den gerechte wilden  senden  om op de aengebrachte klachten te werden gehoort  dat er oock op  den     december       des mergens te negen uyren eenige uyt den selve  gerechte  met hare secretarisen  voor hem sijn verschenen  hebbende hy  mede by hem daer ontboden degene  die als commissarisen te vooren te  dordrecht waren geweest  ende na dat de selve gedeputeerde waren gelast  neder te sitten  soo hebben sy aen hem overgelevert  hare credentialen   welcke gelesen sijnde  ende hy haer willende vragen  volgens sekere  opgestelde articulen  soo is by hen gedeputeerde geseyt  dat sy van den  out raedt of vroedschap prohibitive last hadden  om te antwoorden in  tegenwoordigheydt van commissarisen van den hove  waer op in effecte by  sijne hoogheydt is geantwoordt  dat dese sake den gerechte raekte  ende  geensins den out raed  wiens authoriteyt sy hier te vergeefs  pretexeerden  dat daer en boven de geallegeerde last  van niet te  antwoorden  directelick streed tegens hare credentialen aen  even te  vooren overgelevert  ende indien sy eenige andre last hadden  als de  credentialen mede brachten  datse die wilden overgeven  ende voor soo  veel de commissarisen aengingh  dat hy die geassumeert hadde om hem in  die sake te assisteren  ende nergens anders om  want  dat hy niet goed  gevonden hadt haer alleen te hooren  alsoo hy haer kende voor sulcke  luyden  die ontkennen dorsten  het gene hy wist waer te sijn  waer by is  gevoeght  door een van de commissarisen  dat sy gene de alderminste last  hadden  om eenige jurisdike actie daer te plegen  maer alleen daer  gekomen te sijn  als by sijne hoogheydt alrede was geseyt  doch op gene  van alle die redenen en heeft men yet weten seggen  noch oock eenige  nadre last produceren  en evenwel is men by sijne negative blyven  persisteren  sonder eene stip te avanceren  soo dat sijne hoogheyd  versocht  dat sy eens in een vertrek wilden gaen  ende met den      pag      andren consulteren  offe niet de geproponeerde difficulteyt konden over  stappen  ofte ook nader komen  maer wederom gekomen zijnde  hebben sy  inde voorschreve negative blyven persisteren  seggende dat sy alles aen  hare principalen souwen refereren  ende van het nader geresolveerde  raport doen  waer mede dan die sessie is geeyndigt  maer verwacht  werdende  dat sy na eene dag of twee  het beloofde raport souwen komen  doen  ende niet verschijnende  heeft sijne hoogheyd eene twede missive  laten afgaen  met versoek  dat sy weder voor hem wilden verschijnen op  den   van januar        gelijk sy dan ook gekomen zijn  maer hier en  heeft men nu niet de minste mentie gemaekt   t geen sonderling is te  noteren  dat men in tegenwoordightyd van commissarisen  die doe daer soo  wel verschenen waren  als te voren  niet en kost ofte wilde antwoorden   maer wel ter contrarie  dat men souw verklaringe doen  dan hoe dede men  dat  even als een leger  dat sigh voor sijnen vyand te swak bevindende   in het aftreken of retireren  noch wel eens vier geeft  niet soekende  hoe het vechten souw mogen  maer hoe dattet het vechten mach ontkomen   alsoo mede was haer antwoorden  want die en bestonden niet anders als in  subterfugien ende cavillatien  die de saek niet en raekten  als  datmen  distingueerde  tusschen de wettelickheyd ende de forme van de nominatie   daer nochtans de forme niet anders en is  als de overeenkomste van de  saek met de wet  ende de wet  niet anders als het rechtsnoer van de  forme  sulx dat wettigh te zijn  niet anders en is als te hebben de  form  die de wet prescribeert  wederom  datmen antwoorden wilde wel  generalleck  soo sy seyden  maer niet in specie  het welk sy soo  uytleyden  datse souwen verklaren  datter op de nominatie niet en waren  gebracht vreemdelingen  minderjarige  te na den andere in maegschap  bestaende   waer over noyt klachten en waren gevallen  sonder haer  verder te willen uyten  of op articulen te willen antwoorden  maer is by  een van hunne secretarisen  die mede inde commissie waren versocht  dat  sijne hoogheyd hen copie van de articulen wilde geven  het welke hy  toestond  indien sy wilden antwoorden  maer alsoo sy in die conditie  gene behagen en hadden  soo en hebben sy ook die articulen niet bekomen   ende daer mede is ook die tweede sessie geeyndicht  waer uyt dan  klaerlik blijkt  voor eerst  dat sijne hoogheyd seer onheusselik werd  getraduceert  als of hy geen bericht van die van dordrecht had      pag      willen ontfangen  ten anderen  dat het hof hier seer sinisterlik werd  ingetrocken  even of het selve  door presentie van eenige uyt den haren   als die van dordrecht wierden gehoort  sijne jurisdictie wouw vast  maken  ende extenderen over dien van dordrecht  ten derden  dat die van  den gerechte van dordrecht door dese weygeringe ende onwilligheyd sijn  geworden veri contumaces en wederhorig  soo dat alle de articulen  op  welcke sy niet en hebben willen antwoorden  te recht by sijne hoogheyd  voor soo veel gehouwen sijn als bekent  ten sulcken effecte  dat hy   gesien hebbende de verificatien vande selve articulen  wel heeft  vermogen de onwettige nominatie te rejecteren  ende weygeren eene  electie uyt deselve te doen  want hoewel het de plicht is van sijn  hoogheyd  om uyt een meerder getal de electie te doen  soo is hy evenwel  het selve niet anders gehouwen te doen  als uyt eene legitime  aen wiens  forme niet en manqueert  dewyl anders doende  de onwettigheyd vande  nomanatie  ook influeren souw inde electie  ende derhalven en souwer  niet alleen rede gegeven werden te klagen over de nominatie  maer over  nominatie ende electie beyde  als hiervoren overgenoeg aengewesen is   soo dat nu hier uyt seer klaer blijckt  wat voor fine lieden het moeten  zijn  die derven klagen  dat men sijne hoogheyt niet en heeft mogen  berichten  ende esclaircissement geven  indien nu alle dese voorschreve  redenen ende passagien van rechten eens op den parnas te voorschijn  werden gebracht  ende men aen de eene zijde sal beginnen te overwegen   wat voor eene bres dese grotiaensche brief daer deur heeft gekregen   ende aende andre zijde  watter al tot voordeel van sijne hoogheyd werd  by gebracht  soo en geloof ik niet  dat barnevelt vande selve meninge  sal blyven  om namentelik af te wachten de komste vanden primier  ende  hem gehoort gebbende  nader te delibereren op het intrecken  ofte  antiqueren van het jus civile  ofte corpus juris  want ik geloof dat hy  met al de bende  overluyd roepen sal  wech met dit gespuys dat ons al  dese brabbelinge maeckt  ja ik en kan niet anders dencken  of men sal  den vromen oldenbarnevelt komen last te geven   videat ne respublica  parnassicolarum quid detrimenti capiat   ende dat men hem expresse mede  ordineren sal  dat hy de justitie representerende maecht de schael met  het swaerd   t sy deur finesse   t sy anders  uyt de handen wringe   voort eene schop van achteren geve  ende soo late loopen  want      pag      heeft men in voorgaende tyden den stok wel derven trecken  ende en souw  men het nu niet doen  soo waer wel de pernas vol gecken  neen  men moet  mede toonen  datmen is  ende sich soo niet laten over de neus hacken   doch op dat de plaets van de verschovene sloot weder mocht werden  vervult  wat waer  er beter  als daer toe te consacreren en te wyen   mevrouwe  eygesucht   ende  om daer soo niet alleen te pronck te laten  staen  als die uytgeworpene slobbe tot noch toe heeft gedaen  wat waer   er gevoeglicker  als datter  na dese tyde wijse  tot camerier    archlistigheyd  wierde toegevoeght  versen met eene mensch  vol van  alle soorten van onwaerheden  gestoffeerde ende ongestoffeerde  ende tot  staet juffers de verwloose  onbeschaemtheyd   met hare suster   snatersnel   doch voor al diende wel besorght  dat dese geheyligde dame  wierde ter hand gestelt eene stempel  waer mede wierde getekent  alle  woorden  reden  en loyen  die op den parnas gangbaer sullen zijn  ende  de selve  van wat alloy of forme die oock mochten wesen  te legitineren   op de nieuw uytgevondene manier  verklarende alle het verdere voor  billoen  ende soo jemand hier souw willen inbrengen andre munt  al  droegse het keisers beelt  dat men hem nieten admittere  maer weer  omsende  ende wil hy daer tegen inbinden  dat  snatersnel   geassisteert  met hare suster  niet op en houwe hem alsoo te bejegenen  dat men sijne  rede soo weynigh sal komen in achtinge nemen  als men kan doen het  gesangh vande nachtegael  onder het geschreeuw van de esels  so dat het  voortaen best sal zijn  dat alle die niet van dese hoogvliegende  parnas vogels en zijn  de vinger op de mond leggen  nam  quis brachia  contra torrentem                                                   toe gift     dewyl het den missive schrijver belieft heeft ons te verhalen  wat er op  den parnas is geschiet  soo souwen wy insgelyx hem konnen verhalen   wat er in het rijck van de maen  dewelcke  na het gevoelen van  xenophanes  mede bewoond werd  is voorgevallen  ook sommige van onse  luyden sijn daer al droomende na toe gegaen  gaen  ende al          pag      droomende weerom gekomen sijnde  hebben dingen verhaeldt  die noyt en  sijn geschiet  noch geschieden en sullen  ende soo souwen wy hem met  gelijcke munt konnen betalen  ten ware dat et beter was eene ware  historie te vertellen  als verdichtselen  die min te achten  sijn  als  de fabulen van aesopus  of van den arabischen lokman  ick sal dan seggen   dat het inder daed is gebeurt  datter inde maend van october des  voorleden jaers       weynigh dagen voor de onwettig verklaerde  nominatie van de mannen van achten  ten huyse van den burgemeester  francken  in de voorzael is verschenen een goed ende aensienlick getal  van dekenen der respective gildens  dat aldaer  t selve rijckelick met  wijn is beschoncken  van  s achtermiddaghs te vier uyren tot des avonds  te seven uyren  en later  soo dat er by eenige de schroef al los  raeckte  en de men het koelvat mede voor eene water pot gebruyckte  dit  geselschap hier soo sijnde  is aengesproocken by den voorschreven heer  burgemeester francken  dewelcke verklaerde  dat sy daer ontboden waren   om haer te recommanderen de ouwe achten  ten eynde sy inde aenstaende  nominatie niet verby gegaen wierden  en aengaende de verdere   bemerckende dat over de selvige eenige beroeringe onder de dekens ware   versocht hy  dat sy boven de ouwe achten  soodanige wilde nomineren  die  na de sin en speculatie van de regeringe mochten sijn  want anders  doende  dat het van een schadelick gevolgh souw sijn  waer na de  burgemeester muys sijne welspreeckentheydt heeft getoont  ende heeft die  vrienden aengesproocken met de volgende                                                                          pag          harangue        mannen deeckens      alle  t geene de heer burgemeester francken uw daer geleght heeft  is  waer en waerachtigh  en daerom kan ick my niet onthouden van uw voor al  voor oogen te leggen de les van salomon  dewelcke dicteert  dat alle die  sigh mengen met die gene  die na veranderinge staen  met deselve vergaen  sullen  dese veranderinge nu die hier by sommige quaedtaerdige  en  ambitieuse menschen beooght  en geentameert wort  sal seeckerlijck naer  sigh slepcn een volkomen ruine van de stadt  en desselfs finantien  wy  hebben veel moeyten gehadt om de vervallen finantien van de stadt te  redresseren  wy hebben een fons uytgevonden  te vooren onbekent  waer  door de vervallene saecken weder sijn herstelt  wy hebben de kaeyen  gemaeckt  de havens

the diligence brought me here from caen in about two hours and a  half  the country  during the whole route  is open  well cultivated   occasionally gently undulating  but generally denuded of trees  many  pretty little churches  with delicate spires  peeped out to the right  and left during the journey  but the first view of the cathedral of  bayeux put all the others out of my recollection     there is  in fact  no proper approach to this interesting edifice  the  western end is suffocated with houses  here stands the post office   and with the most unsuspecting frankness  on the part of the owner   i had permission to examine  with my own hands  within doors  every  letter  under the expectation that there were some for myself  nor was  i disappointed     but you must come with me to the cathedral  and of course we must  enter together at the western front  there are five porticoes   the central one being rather large  and the two  on either side   comparatively small  formerly  these were covered with sculptured  figures and ornaments  but the calvinists in the sixteenth  and the  revolutionists in the eighteenth century  have contrived to render  their present aspect mutilated and repulsive in the extreme  on  entering  i was struck with the two large transverse norman arches  which bestride the area  or square  for the bases of the two towers   it is the boldest and finest piece of masonry in the whole building   the interior disappointed me  it is plain  solid  and divested of  ornament     hard by the cathedral stood formerly a magnificent episcopal palace   upon this palace the old writers dearly loved to expatiate  there is  now  however  nothing but a good large comfortable family mansion   sufficient for the purposes of such hospitality and entertainment as  the episcopal revenues will afford     it is high time that you should be introduced in proper form to the  famous bayeux tapestry  know then  in as few words as possible  that  this celebrated piece of tapestry represents chiefly the invasion of  england by william the conqueror  and the subsequent death of harold  at the battle of hastings  it measures about     english feet in  length  by about nineteen inches in width  and is supposed to have  been worked under the particular superintendence and direction of  matilda  the wife of the conqueror  it was formerly exclusively kept  and exhibited in the cathedral  but it is now justly retained in the  town hall  and treasured as the most precious relic among the archives  of the city     there is indeed every reason to consider it as one of the most  valuable historical monuments which france possesses  it has also  given rise to a great deal of archeological discussion  montfaucon   ducarel  and de la rue  have come forward successively  but more  especially the first and last  and montfaucon in particular has  favored the world with copper plate representations of the whole   montfaucon s plates are generally much too small  and the more  enlarged ones are too ornamental     it is right  first of all  that you should have an idea how this piece  of tapestry is preserved  or rolled up  you see it here  therefore   precisely as it appears after the person who shows it  takes off the  cloth with which it is usually covered  the first portion of the  needle work  representing the embassy of harold from edward the  confessor to william duke of normandy  is comparatively much  defaced  that is to say  the stitches are worn away  and little more  than the ground  or fine close linen cloth remains  it is not far from  the beginning  and where the color is fresh  and the stitches are   comparatively  preserved  that you observe the portrait of harold     you are to understand that the stitches  if they may be so called   are threads laid side by side  and bound down at intervals by cross  stitches  or fastenings  upon rather a fine linen cloth  and that the  parts intended to represent flesh are left untouched by the needle   i obtained a few straggling shreds of the worsted with which it is  worked  the colors are generally a faded or bluish green  crimson  and  pink  about the last five feet of this extraordinary roll are in a  yet more decayed and imperfect state than the first portion  but the  designer of the subject  whoever he was  had an eye throughout to  roman art  as it appeared in its later stages  the folds of the  draperies  and the proportions of the figures  are executed with this  feeling     i must observe that  both at top and at bottom of the principal  subject  there is a running allegorical ornament  of which i will not  incur the presumption to suppose myself a successful interpreter   the constellations  and the symbols of agriculture and of a rural  occupation form the chief subjects of this running ornament  all the  inscriptions are executed in capital letters of about an inch in  length  and upon the whole  whether this extraordinary and invaluable  relic be of the latter end of the eleventh  or the beginning or middle  of the twelfth century seems to me a matter of rather a secondary  consideration  that it is at once unique and important  must be  considered as a position to be neither doubted nor denied     i have learned even here  of what importance this tapestry roll was  considered in the time of bonaparte s threatened invasion of our  country  and that  after displaying it at paris for two or three  months  to awaken the curiosity and excite the love of conquest among  the citizens  it was conveyed to one or two sea port towns  and  exhibited upon the stage as a most important material in dramatic  effect           the chateau of henri iv  at pau a      footnote a  from  a tour through the pyrenees   by special  arrangement with  and by permission of  the publishers  henry holt    co  copyright            by hippolyte adolphe taine      pau is a pretty city  neat  of gay appearance  but the highway is  paved with little round stones  the side walks with small sharp  pebbles  so the horses walk on the heads of nails and foot passengers  on the points of them  from bordeaux to toulouse such is the usage   such the pavement  at the end of five minutes  your feet tell you in  the most intelligible manner that you are two hundred leagues away  from paris        here are the true countrymen of henry iv  as to the pretty ladies in  gauzy hats  whose swelling and rustling robes graze the horns of the  motionless oxen as they pass  you must not look at them  they would  carry your imagination back to the boulevard de gand  and you would  have gone two hundred leagues only to remain in the same place  i am  here on purpose to visit the sixteenth century  one makes a journey  for the sake of changing  not place  but ideas     it was eight  o clock in the morning  not a visitor at the castle  no one in the  courts nor on the terrace  i should not have been too much astonished  at meeting the bearnais   that lusty gallant  that very devil   who  was sharp enough to get for himself the name of  the good king      his chateau is very irregular  it is only when seen from the valley  that any graces and harmony can be found in it  above two rows of  pointed roofs and old houses  it stands out alone against the sky and  gazes upon the valley in the distance  two bell turrets project from  the front toward the west  the oblong body follows  and two massive  brick towers close the line with their esplanades and battlements  it  is connected with the city by a narrow old bridge  by a broad modern  one with the park  and the foot of its terrace is bathed by a dark but  lovely stream     near at hand  this arrangement disappears  a fifth tower upon the  north side deranges the symmetry  the great egg shaped court is a  mosaic of incongruous masonry  above the porch  a wall of pebbles from  the gave  and of red bricks crossed like a tapestry design  opposite   fixt to the wall  a row of medallions in stone  upon the sides  doors  of every form and age  dormer windows  windows square  pointed   embattled  with stone mullions garlanded with elaborate reliefs  this  masquerade of styles troubles the mind  yet not unpleasantly  it is  unpretending and artless  each century has built according to its own  fancy  without concerning itself about its neighbor     on the first floor is shown a great tortoise shell  which was the  cradle of henry iv  carved chests  dressing tables  tapestries  clocks  of that day  the bed and arm chair of jeanne d albret  a complete set  of furniture in the taste of the renaissance  striking and somber   painfully labored yet magnificent in style  carrying the mind at once  back toward that age of force and effort  of boldness in invention  of  unbridled pleasures and terrible toil  of sensuality and of heroism   jeanne d albret  mother of henry iv   crossed france in order that  she might  according to her promise  be confined in this castle   a  princess   says d aubigne   having nothing of the woman about her but  the sex  a soul entirely given to manly things  a mind mighty in great  affairs  a heart unconquerable by adversity      she sang an old bearnaise song when she brought him into the world   they say that the aged grandfather rubbed the lips of the new born  child with a clove of garlic  poured into his mouth a few drops of  jurancon wine  and carried him away in his dressing gown  the child  was born in the chamber which opens into the lower tower of mazeres   on the southwest corner     his mother  a warm and severe calvinist  when he was fifteen years  old  led him through the catholic army to la rochelle  and gave him to  her followers as their general  at sixteen years old  at the combat of  arnay le duc  he led the first charge of cavalry  what an education  and what men  their descendants were just now passing in the streets   going to school to compose latin verses and recite the pastorals of  massillon     those old wars are the most poetic in french history  they were made  for pleasure rather than interest  it was a chase in which adventures   dangers  emotions were found  in which men lived in the sunlight  on  horseback  amidst flashes of fire  and where the body  as well as  the soul  had its enjoyment and its exercise  henry carries it on as  briskly as a dance  with a gascon s fire and a soldier s ardor  with  abrupt sallies  and pursuing his point against the enemy as with the  ladies     this is no spectacle of great masses of well disciplined men  coming  heavily into collision and falling by thousands on the field   according to the rules of good tactics  the king leaves pau or nerac  with a little troop  picks up the neighboring garrisons on his way   scales a fortress  intercepts a body of arquebusiers as they pass   extricates himself pistol in hand from the midst of a hostile troop   and returns to the feet of mlle  de tignonville  they arrange their  plan from day to day  nothing is done unless unexpectedly and by  chance  enterprises are strokes of fortune        the park is a great wood on a hill  embedded among meadows and  harvests  you walk in long solitary alleys  under colonnades of superb  oaks  while to the left the lofty stems of the copses mount in close  ranks upon the back of the hill  the fog was not yet lifted  there was  no motion in the air  not a corner of the blue sky  not a sound in all  the country  the song of a bird came for an instant from the midst of  the ash trees  then sadly ceased  is that then the sky of the south   and was it necessary to come to the happy country of the bearnais to  find such melancholy impressions  a little by way brought us to a bank  of the gave  in a long pool of water was growing an army of reeds  twice the height of a man  their grayish spikes and their trembling  leaves bent and whispered under the wind  a wild flower near by shed a  vanilla perfume     we gazed on the broad country  the ranges of rounded hills  the silent  plain under the dull dome of the sky  three hundred paces away the  gave rolls between marshaled banks  which it has covered with sand  in  the midst of the waters may be seen the moss grown piles of a ruined  bridge  one is at ease here  and yet at the bottom of the heart  a vague unrest is felt  the soul is softened and loses itself in  melancholy and tender revery  suddenly the clock strikes  and one  is forced to go and prepare himself to eat his soup between two  commercial travelers     to day the sun shines  on my way to the place nationale  i remarked a  poor  half ruined church  which had been turned into a coach house   they have fastened upon it a carrier s sign  the arcades  in small  gray stones  still round themselves with an elegant boldness  beneath  are stowed away carts and casks and pieces of wood  here and there  workmen were handling wheels  a broad ray of light fell upon a pile of  straw  and made the somber corners seem yet darker  the pictures that  one meets with outweigh those one has come to seek     from the esplanade which is opposite  the whole valley and the  mountains beyond may be seen  this first sight of a southern sun  as  it breaks from the rainy mists  is admirable  a sheet of white light  stretches from one horizon to another without meeting a single cloud   the heart expands in this immense space  the very air is festal  the  dazzled eyes close beneath the brightness which deluges them and which  runs over  radiated from the burning dome of heaven  the current of  the river sparkles like a girdle of jewels  the chains of hills   yesterday veiled and damp  extend at their own sweet will beneath the  warming  penetrating rays  and mount range upon range to spread out  their green robe to the sun     in the distance  the blue pyrenees look like a bank of clouds  the air  that bathes them shapes them into aerial forms  vapory phantoms  the  farthest of which vanish in the canescent horizon  dim contours  that  might be taken for a fugitive sketch from the lightest of pencils  in  the midst of the serrate chain the peak midi d  ossau lifts its abrupt  cone  at this distance  forms are softened  colors are blended  the  pyrenees are only the graceful bordering of a smiling landscape and of  the magnificent sky  there is nothing imposing about them nor severe   the beauty here is serene  and the pleasure pure     the statue of henry iv   with an inscription in latin and in patois   is on the esplanade  the armor is finished so perfectly that it might  make an armorer jealous  but why does the king wear so sad an air  his  neck is ill at ease on his shoulders  his features are small and full  of care  he has lost his gayety  his spirit  his confidence in his  fortune  his proud bearing  his air is neither that of a great nor a  good man  nor of a man of intellect  his face is discontented  and one  would say that he was bored with pau  i am not sure that he was wrong   and yet the city passes for agreeable  the climate is very mild  and  invalids who fear the cold pass the winter in it           chateaux in the valley of the loire a      footnote a  from  outre mer   published by houghton  mifflin co      by henry wadsworth longfellow      in the beautiful month of october i made a foot excursion along the  banks of the loire  from orleans to tours  this luxuriant region is  justly called the garden of france  from orleans to blois  the whole  valley of the loire is one continued vineyard  the bright green  foliage of the vine spreads  like the undulations of the sea  over  the landscape  with here and there a silver flash of the river  a  sequestered hamlet  or the towers of an old chateau  to enliven and  variegate the scene     the vintage had already commenced  the peasantry were busy in the  fields  the song that cheered their labor was on the breeze  and  the heavy wagon tottered by  laden with the clusters of the vine   everything around me wore that happy look which makes the heart glad   in the morning i arose with the lark  and at night i slept where the  sunset overtook me     my first day s journey brought me at evening to  a village  whose name i have forgotten  situated about eight leagues  from orleans  it is a small  obscure hamlet  not mentioned in the  guide book  and stands upon the precipitous banks of a deep ravine   through which a noisy brook leaps to turn the ponderous wheel of a  thatch roofed mill  the village inn stands upon the highway  but the  village itself is not visible to the traveler as he passes  it is  completely hidden in the lap of a wooded valley  and so embowered  in trees that not a roof nor a chimney peeps out to betray its  hiding place     when i awoke in the morning  a brilliant autumnal sun was shining in  at my window  the merry song of birds mingled sweetly with the sound  of rustling leaves and the gurgle of the brook  the vintagers were  going forth to their toil  the wine press was busy in the shade  and  the clatter of the mill kept time to the miller s song  i loitered  about the village with a feeling of calm delight  i was unwilling to  leave the seclusion of this sequestered hamlet  but at length  with  reluctant step  i took the cross road through the vineyard  and in a  moment the little village had sunk again  as if by enchantment  into  the bosom of the earth     i breakfasted at the town of mer  and  leaving the high road to blois  on the right  passed down to the banks of the loire  through a long   broad avenue of poplars and sycamores  i crossed the river in a boat   and in the after part of the day i found myself before the high and  massive walls of the chateau of chambord  this chateau is one of the  finest specimens of the ancient gothic castle to be found in europe   the little river cosson fills its deep and ample moat  and above  it the huge towers and heavy battlements rise in stern and solemn  grandeur  moss grown with age  and blackened by the storms of three  centuries  within  all is mournful and deserted  the grass has  overgrown the pavement of the courtyard  and the rude sculpture upon  the walls is broken and defaced        my third day s journey brought me to the ancient city of blois  the  chief town of the department of loire et cher  this city is celebrated  for the purity with which even the lower classes of its inhabitants  speak their native tongue  it rises precipitously from the northern  bank of the loire  and many of its streets are so steep as to be  almost impassable for carriages  on the brow of the hill  overlooking  the roofs of the city  and commanding a fine view of the loire and its  noble bridge  and the surrounding country  sprinkled with cottages and  chateaux  runs an ample terrace  planted with trees  and laid out as a  public walk  the view from this terrace is one of the most beautiful  in france  but what most strikes the eye of the traveler at blois is  an old  tho still unfinished  castle  its huge parapets of hewn stone  stand upon either side of the street  but they have walled up the wide  gateway  from which the colossal drawbridge was to have sprung high in  air  connecting together the main towers of the building  and the two  hills upon whose slope its foundations stand  the aspect of this vast  pile is gloomy and desolate  it seems as if the strong hand of the  builder had been arrested in the midst of his task by the stronger  hand of death  and the unfinished fabric stands a lasting monument  both of the power and weakness of man  of his vast desires  his  sanguine hopes  his ambitious purposes  and of the unlooked for  conclusion  where all these desires  and hopes  and purposes are so  often arrested  there is also at blois another ancient chateau  to  which some historic interest is attached as being the scene of the  massacre of the duke of guise     on the following day  i left blois for amboise  and  after walking  several leagues along the dusty highway  crossed the river in a boat  to the little village of moines  which lies amid luxuriant vineyards  upon the southern bank of the loire  from moines to amboise the road  is truly delightful  the rich lowland scenery  by the margin of the  river  is verdant even in october  and occasionally the landscape is  diversified with the picturesque cottages of the vintagers  cut in the  rock along the road side  and overhung by the thick foliage of the  vines above them     at amboise i took a cross road  which led me to the romantic borders  of the cher and the chateau of chenonceau  this beautiful chateau  as  well as that of chambord  was built by the gay and munificent francis  the first  one is a specimen of strong and massive architecture  a  dwelling for a warrior  but the other is of a lighter and more  graceful construction  and was designed for those soft languishments  of passion with which the fascinating diane de poitiers had filled the  bosom of that voluptuous monarch     the chateau of chenonceau is built upon arches across the river cher   whose waters are made to supply the deep moat at each extremity  there  is a spacious courtyard in front  from which a drawbridge conducts to  the outer hall of the castle  there the armor of francis the first  still hangs upon the wall  his shield  and helm  and lance  as if the  chivalrous but dissolute prince had just exchanged them for the silken  robes of the drawing room     doubtless the naked walls and the vast  solitary chambers of an old and desolate chateau inspire a feeling of  greater solemnity and awe  but when the antique furniture of the olden  time remains  the faded tapestry on the walls  and the arm chair  by the fire side  the effect upon the mind is more magical and  delightful  the old inhabitants of the place  long gathered to their  fathers  tho living still in history  seem to have left their halls  for the chase or the tournament  and as the heavy door swings upon its  reluctant hinge  one almost expects to see the gallant princes and  courtly dames enter those halls again  and sweep in stately procession  along the silent corridors        a short time after candle lighting  i reached the little tavern of the  boule d or  a few leagues from tours  where i passed the night  the  following morning was lowering and sad  a veil of mist hung over  the landscape  and ever and anon a heavy shower burst from the  overburdened clouds  that were driving by before a high and piercing  wind  this unpropitious state of the weather detained me until noon   when a cabriolet for tours drove up  and taking a seat within it  i  left the hostess of the boule d or in the middle of a long story about  a rich countess  who always alighted there when she passed that way   we drove leisurely along through a beautiful country  till at length  we came to the brow of a steep hill  which commands a fine view of the  city of tours and its delightful environs  but the scene was  shrouded by the heavy drifting mist  through which i could trace but  indistinctly the graceful sweep of the loire  and the spires and roofs  of the city far below me     the city of tours and the delicious plain in which it lies have been  too often described by other travelers to render a new description   from so listless a pen as mine  either necessary or desirable  after a  sojourn of two cloudy and melancholy days  i set out on my return to  paris  by the way of vendome and chartres  i stopt a few hours at  the former place  to examine the ruins of a chateau built by jeanne  d albret  mother of henry the fourth  it stands upon the summit of a  high and precipitous hill  and almost overhangs the town beneath  the  french revolution has completed the ruin that time had already begun   and nothing now remains  but a broken and crumbling bastion  and here  and there a solitary tower dropping slowly to decay  in one of these  is the grave of jeanne d albret  a marble entablature in the wall  above contains the inscription  which is nearly effaced  tho enough  still remains to tell the curious traveler that there lies buried the  mother of the  bon henri   to this is added a prayer that the repose  of the dead may be respected     here ended my foot excursion  the object of my journey was  accomplished  and  delighted with this short ramble through the valley  of the loire  i took my seat in the diligence for paris  and on the  following day was again swallowed up in the crowds of the metropolis   like a drop in the bosom of the sea           amboise a      footnote a  from  old touraine   published by james pott   co      by theodore andrea cook      the castle of amboise stands high above the town  like another  acropolis above a smaller athens  it rises upon the only height  visible for some distance  and is in a commanding position for holding  the level fields of touraine around it  and securing the passage of  the loire between tours and chaumont  which is the next link in the  chain that ends at blois     the river at this point is divided in two by an island  as is so often  the case where the first bridge builders sought to join the wide banks  of the loire  and on this little spot between the waters clovis is  said to have met alaric before he overthrew the power of the visigoths  in aquitaine     amboise gains even more from the river than the other chateaux of  the loire  the magnificent round tower that springs from the end of  charles viii  s facade completely commands the approaches of the  bridge  and the extraordinary effect of lofty masonry  produced by  building on the summit of an elevation and carrying the stone courses  upward from the lower ground  is here seen at its best        but amboise has a history before the days of charles viii  there was  without doubt a roman camp here  but the traditions of the ubiquitous  caesar must be received with caution  the so called  greniers de  caesar   strange  unexplained constructions caverned in the soft rock   are proved to be the work of a later age by that same indefatigable  abbe chevalier to whom we have been already indebted for so much  archeological research  a possible explanation of them is contained in  an old latin history of the castle  which goes down to the death of  stephen of england  according to this  the romans had held amboise  from the days of caesar till the reign of diocletian  the baugaredi or  bagaudee then put them to flight  but let the rest of the inhabitants  remain who   being afraid to live above ground  tunnelled beneath it   and made a great colony of subterranean dwellings in the holes they  had dug out   a custom apparently common in touraine from the earliest  times  the romans at any rate left unmistakable traces of their  presence  many of their architectural remains still exist  and their  fort is spoken of by sulpicius severus  but they can have built no  bridge of alone  for in st  gregory s time there were only boats  available for crossing the river     not till the fifteenth century did the castle become royal property   when it was confiscated by charles vii  as a punishment for  treacherous dealings with the invading english very similar to  the treason discovered at chenonceaux just before  but beyond  strengthening the fortification of the place this king did little for  his new possession     in a few years the castle is overshadowed by the cruel specter of  louis xi   whose memory has already spoiled several charming views  for us  it was to amboise that the father of this unfilial prince  was carried from chinon on his way north  when wearied out by the  annoyance caused by the dauphin s plots  the castle had become a royal  residence  and soon after the whole town turns out to meet the new  king with a  morality play made by master etienne for the joyous  occasion of his arrival   for amboise was already famous for those  dramatic performances always so dear to the french  and particularly  to these citizens  in the old days at any rate  there is no trace of  such frivolities now in the sleepy little town        the two great towers of amboise with the inclined planes of brickwork   which wind upward in the midst instead of staircases  were the result  of the work which charles set on foot as a distraction of his grief   these strange ascents had been partially restored by the comte de  paris  the present owner of amboise  before his exile stopt the work  of repairing the chateau  and it is still possible to imagine the   charrettes  mullets  et litieres   of which du bellay speaks   mounting from the low ground to the chambers above  or the emperor  charles v   in later years  riding up with his royal host francis i    always fond of display  amid such a blaze of flambeaux  that a man  might see as clearly as at mid day      these great towers and the exquisite little chapel were the work of  the  excellent sculptors and artists from naples  who  as commines  tells us  were brought back with the spoils of the italian wars  for  the young king  never thought of death  but only of collecting round  him  all the beautiful things which he had seen and which had given  him pleasure  from france or italy or flanders   but death came upon  him suddenly  at the end of a garden walk  fringed with a mossy grove  of limes that rises from the river bank  is the little doorway through  which charles viii  was passing when he hit his head  never a  very strong one  against the low stone arch  and died a few hours  afterward  the castle had been fortified before his time  he left it  beautiful as well  and the traces of his work are those which are most  striking at the present day        within the shadow of the lime trees on the terraced garden of amboise  is a small bust of leonardo da vinci  for it was near here he died   his remains are laid in the beautiful chapel at the corner of  the castle court  and the romantic story of his last moments at  fontainebleau becomes the sad reality of a tombstone covering ashes  mostly unknown and certainly indistinguishable   among which  as the  epitaph painfully records   are supposed to be the remains of leonardo  da vinci   he had been brought to paris a weak old man  by francis   in pursuance of a certain fixt artistic policy  to which it may be  noticed this forgotten and uncertain grave does but little credit     to francis i   rightly or wrongly  is given the glory of having  naturalized in france the arts of italy  to him is due the  architecture built for ease and charm which turned the fortress into a  beautiful habitation  which changed chambord from a feudal stronghold  to a country seat  and which left its traces at amboise  as it did  at chaumont and at blois  he found in france the highest and most  beautiful expression of the work of  the great unnamed race of  master masons   he found the traditions of a national school of  painting  the work of fouquet and the clouets  but for these he cared  not  for him the only schools were those of rome and florence  and  tho by encouraging their imitation he weakened the vital sincerity of  french art  yet from his first exercise of royal power the consistency  always somewhat lacking in his politics was shown clearly and firmly  in his taste for art           blois a      footnote a  from  castles and chateaux of old touraine   by special  arrangement with  and by permission of  the publishers  l c  page    co  copyright            by francis miltoun      blois  among all the other cities of the loire  is the favorite with  the tourist  here one first meets a great chateau of state  and  certainly the chateau de blois lives in one s memory more than any  other chateau in france     much has been written of blois  its counts  its chateau  and its many  and famous hotels of the nobility  by writers of all opinions and  abilities  from those old chroniclers who wrote of the plots and  intrigues of other days to those critics of art and architecture who  have discovered  or think they have discovered  that da vinci designed  the famous spiral staircase     from this one may well gather that blois is the foremost chateau of  all the loire in popularity and theatrical effect  truly this is so   but it is by no manner of means the most lovable  indeed  it is the  least lovable of all that great galaxy which begins at blois and ends  at nantes  it is a show place and not much more  and partakes in  every form and feature  as one sees it to day  of the attributes of a  museum  and such it really is     all of its former gorgeousness is still there  and all the banalities  of the later period when gaston of orleans built his ugly wing  for  the  personally conducted  to marvel at  and honeymoon couples to  envy  the french are quite fond of visiting this shrine themselves   but usually it is the young people and their mammas  and detached  couples of american and english birth that one most sees strolling  about the courts and apartments where formerly lords and ladies and  cavaliers moved and plotted     the great chateau of the counts of blois is built upon an inclined  rock which rises above the roof tops of the lower town quite in  fairy book fashion  commonly referred to as the chateau de blois  it  is really composed of four separate and distinct foundations  the  original chateau of the counts  the later addition of louis xii   the  palace of francis i   and the most unsympathetically and dismally  disposed pavilion of gaston of orleans     the artistic qualities of the greater part of the distinct edifice  which go to make up the chateau as it stands to day are superb  with  the exception of that great wing of gaston s  before mentioned  which  is as cold and unfeeling as the overrated palace at versailles     the comtes de chatillon built that portion just to the right of the  present entrance  louis xii   the edifice through which one enters  the inner court and which extends far to the left  including also  the chapel immediately to the rear  while francois i   who here as  elsewhere let his unbounded italian proclivities have full sway  built  the extended wing to the left of the inner court and fronting on the  present place du chateau  formerly the place royale        as an architectural monument the chateau is a picturesque assemblage  of edifices belonging to many different epochs  and  as such  shows   as well as any other document of contemporary times  the varying  ambitions and emotions of its builders  from the rude and rough  manners of the earliest of feudal times through the highly refined  renaissance details of the imaginative brain of francois  down to the  base concoction of the elder mansart  produced at the commands of  gaston of orleans     in the earliest structure were to be seen all the attributes of a  feudal fortress  towers and walls pierced with narrow loopholes   and damp  dark dungeons hidden away in the thick walls  then came a  structure which was less of a fortress and more habitable  but still a  stronghold  tho having ample and decorative doorways and windows  with  curious sculptures and rich framings  then the pompous renaissance  with  escaliers  and  balcons a jour   balustrades crowning the walls  and elaborate cornices here  there  and everywhere  all bespeaking  the gallantry and taste of the knightly king  finally came the cold   classic features of the period of the brother of louis xiii     in plan the chateau de bois forms an irregular square situated at  the apex of a promontory high above the surface of the loire   and practically behind the town itself  the building has a most  picturesque aspect  and  to those who know  gives practically a  history of the chateau architecture of the time  abandoned  mutilated  and dishonored  from time to time  the structure gradually took on new  forms until the thick walls underlying the apartment known to day as  the salle des etats  probably the most ancient portion of all  were  overshadowed by the great richness of the fifteenth and sixteenth  centuries     from the platform one sees a magnificent panorama of the city and the  far reaching loire  which unrolls itself southward and northward for  many leagues  its banks covered by rich vineyards and crowned by thick  forests     the building of louis xii  presents its brick faced exterior in black  and red lozenge shapes  with sculptured window frames  squarely upon  the little tree bordered place of to day  which in other times formed  a part of that magnificent terrace which looked down upon the roof  of the eglise st  nicholas  and the jesuit church of the immaculate  conception  and the silvery bell of the loire itself     the murders and other acts of violence and treason which took place  here are interesting enough  but one can not but feel  when he views  the chimney piece before which the due de guise was standing when  called to his death in the royal closet  that the men of whom the  bloody tales of blois are told quite deserved their fates     one comes away with the impression of it all stamped only upon the  mind  not graven upon the heart  political intrigue to day  if quite  as vulgar  is less sordid  bigotry and ambition in those days allowed  few of the finer feelings to come to the surface  except with regard  to the luxuriance of surroundings  of this last there can be no  question  and blois is as characteristically luxurious as any of the  magnificient edifices which lodged the royalty and nobility of other  days throughout the valley of the loire     the interior court is partly surrounded by a colonnade  quite  cloister like in effect  at the right center of the francois i  wing  is that wonderful spiral staircase  concerning the invention of which  so much speculation has been launched     the apartments of catherine de medici were directly beneath the  guard room where the balafre was murdered  and that event  taking  place at the very moment when the queen mother was dying  can not be  said to have been conducive to a peaceful demise     here  on the first floor of the francois i  wing  the queen mother   held her court  as did the king his  the great gallery over looked the  town on the side of the present place du chateau  it was  and is  a  truly grand apartment  with diamond paned windows  and rich  dark wall  decorations on which catherine s device  a crowned c and her monogram  in gold  frequently appears  there was  moreover  a great oval  window  opposite which stood her altar  and a doorway led to her  writing closet  with its secret drawers and wall panels  which well  served her purpose of intrigue and deceit     a hidden stair way led to the floor above  and there was a  chambre a coucher  with a deep recess for the bed  the same to which  she called her son henri  as she lay dying  admonishing him to give  up the thought of murdering guise   what   said henri  on this  embarrassing occasion   spare guise  when he  triumphant in paris   dared lay his hand on the hilt of his sword  spare him who drove me a  fugitive from the capital  spare them who never spared me  no  mother   i will not      as the queen mother drew near her end  and was lying ill at blois   great events for france were culminating at the chateau  henry iii   had become king of france  and the balafre  supported by rome and  spain  was in open rebellion against the reigning house  and the word  had gone forth that the duc de guise must die     the states general were to be immediately assembled  and de guise   once the poetic lover of marguerite  through his emissaries canvassed  all france to ensure the triumph of the party of the church against  henri de navarre and his queen  the marguerite whom de guise once  profest to love  who soon were to come to the throne of france     the uncomfortable henri iii  had been told that he would never be king  in reality until de guise had been made away with     the final act of the drama between the rival houses of guise and  valois came when the king and his council came to blois for the  assembly  the sunny city of blois was indeed to be the scene of a  momentous affair  and a truly sumptuous setting it was  the roof tops  of its houses sloping downward gently to the loire  with its chief  accessory  the coiffed and turreted chateau itself  high above all  else     details had been arranged with infinite pains  the guard doubled  and  a company of swiss posted around the courtyard and up and down  the gorgeous staircase  every nook and corner has its history in  connection with this greatest event in the history of the chateau of  blois     as guise entered the council chamber he was told that the king would  see him in his closet  to reach which one had to pass through the  guard room below  the door was barred behind him that he might not  return  when the trusty guards of the forty fifth  under dalahaide   already hidden behind the wall tapestry  sprang upon the balafre and  forced him back upon the closed door through which he had just passed   guise fell stabbed in the breast by malines  and  lay long uncovered  until an old carpet was found in which to wrap his corpse      below  in her own apartments  lay the queen mother  dying  but  listening eagerly for the rush of footsteps overhead  hoping and  praying that henri  the hitherto effeminate henri who played with his  sword as he would with a battledore  and who painted himself like a  woman  and put rings in his ears  would not prejudice himself at this  time in the eyes of rome by slaying the leader of the church party        it was under the regime of gaston d orleans that the gardens of the  chateau de blois came to their greatest excellence and beauty  in        abel brunyer  the first physician of gaston s suite  published a  catalog of the fruit and flowers to be found here in these gardens   of which he was also director  more than five hundred varieties were  included  three quarters of which belonged to the flora of france     among the delicacies and novelties of the time to be found here was  the prunier de reine claude  from which those delicious green plums  known to all the world to day as  reine claudes  were propagated  also  another variety which came from the prunier de monsieur  somewhat  similar in taste  but of a deep purple color  the potato was tenderly  cared for and grown as a great novelty and delicacy long before its  introduction to general cultivation by parmentier  the tomato was  imported from mexico  and even tobacco was grown        in      all the symbols and emblems of royalty were removed from  the chateau and destroyed  the celebrated bust of gaston  the chief  artistic attribute of that part of the edifice built by him  was  decapitated  and the statue of louis xii  over the entrance gateway  was overturned and broken up  afterward the chateau became the  property of the  domaine  and was turned into a mere barracks  the  pavilion of queen anne became a military magazine  the tour de  l observatoire  a powder magazine  and all the indignities imaginable  were heaped upon the chateau     in      blois became the last capital of napoleon s empire  and the  chateau walls sheltered the prisoners captured by the imperial army           chambord a      footnote a  from  old touraine   published by james pott   co      by theodore andrea cook      the road that leads from blois to chambord crosses the loire by a fine  stone bridge  which the inscription sets forth to be the first public  work of louis philippe     for some distance the rails of a small tramway followed the road by  which our carriage was slowly rolling toward the level plains of the  cologne  but we gradually left such uncompromising signs of activity   and came into a flat country of endless vineyards  with here and there  a small plaster tower showing its slated roof above the low green  clusters of the vines  we passed through several villages  whose  inhabitants that day seemed to have but one care upon their minds   like the famous scilly islanders  to gain a precarious livelihood by  taking each other s washing  on every bush and briar fluttered the  household linen and the family apparel  of various textures and in  different states of despair  and with that strict observance of  utility which is the chief characteristic of the french peasant  the  inevitable blouses  of faded blue were blown into shapeless bundles  even along the railings of the churchyard tombs     at last we came to an old moss grown wall  and through a broken  gateway entered what is called the park of chambord  there is very  little of it to be seen now  the trees have been ruthlessly cut down  and mutilated  and of the wild boars  which francis i  was so fond  of hunting there is left only the ghostly quarry that thibault of  champagne chases through the air  while the sound of his ghostly  horn echoes down the autumn night as the fantom pack sweeps by to  montfrault     it is impossible for the uninstructed mind to grasp the plan or method  of this mass of architecture  yet it is unsatisfactory to give it up   with mr  henry james   as an irresponsible  insoluble labyrinth    m  viollet le duc  with a sympathetic denial of any extreme and  over technical admiration  gives just that intelligible account of the  chateau which is a compromise between the unmeaning adulation of its  contemporary critics and the ignorance of the casual traveler      chambord   says he   must be taken for what it is  for an attempt in  which the architect sought to reconcile the methods of two opposite  principles  to unite in one building the fortified castle of the  middle ages and the pleasure palace of the sixteenth century   granted  that the attempt was an absurd one  it must be remembered that the  renaissance was but just beginning in france  gothic art seemed out  of date  yet none other had established itself to take its place  in  literature  in morals  as in architecture  this particular phase in  the civilization of the time has already become evident even in the  course of these small wanderings in a single province  and if only  this transition period is realized in all its meaning  with all the   monstrous and inform  characteristics that were inevitably a part of  it  the mystery of this strange sixteenth century in france is half  explained  of this  glorious devil  large in heart and brain  that did  love beauty only  and would have it somewhere  somehow  at whatever  cost     francis i  had passed his early years at cognac  at amboise  or  romorantin  and when he first saw chambord it was only the old feudal  manor house built by the counts of blois  he transformed it  not by  the help of primaticcio  with whose name it is tempting to associate  any building of this king s  for the methods of contemporary italian  architecture were totally different  but  as mr  de la saussaye  proves  by the skill of that fertile school of art particularly of one  maitre pierre trinqueau  or le nepveu  whose name is connected with  more successful buildings at amboise and blois  the plan is that  of the true french chateau  in the center is the habitation of the  seigneur and his family  flanked by four angle towers  on three sides  is a court closed by buildings  also with towers at each angle  and  like most feudal dwellings the central donjon has one of its sides on  the exterior of the whole        it may well be imagined that chambord is the parody of the old  castles  just as the abbey of theleme parodies the abbeys of the  twelfth and thirteenth centuries  both heaped a fatal ridicule upon  the bygone age  but what rabelais could only dream francis could  realize  yet not with the unfettered perfection that was granted to  the vision of gargantua  for surely never was the spirit of the time   seized and smitten into incongruous shapes of stone at so unfortunate  a moment  just when the old renaissance was striving to take upon  itself the burden which was too heavy for the failing gothic spirit   just when success was coming  but had not yet come     it is only from within the court  where the great towers fling their  shadows over the space  where pinnacles and gables soar into the air   and strange gargoyles and projectures shoot from the darkness into  light  that it is possible to realize the admiration which chambord  roused when it was first created  brantome waxes enthusiastic over its  wonders  and describes how the king had drawn up plans  mercifully  never carried out  to divert the waters of the loire to his new  palace  not content with the slender stream of cosson  from which  the place derived its name  others compare it to a palace put of the  arabian nights raised at the prince s bidding by a genie  or like  lippomano  the venetian ambassador  to  the abode of morgana or  alcinous   but this topheavy barrack is anything rather than a  fairy  monument   it might with as much humor be called a  souvenir of first  loves   as m  de la saussaye has it  both descriptions fit chenonceaux  admirably  when used of chambord they are out of place           chenonceaux a      footnote a  from  castles and chateaux of old touraine   by special  arrangement with  and by permission of  the publishers  l c  page    co  copyright            by francis miltoun    chenonceaux is noted chiefly for its chateau  but the little village  itself is charming  the houses of the village are not very new  nor  very old  but the one long street is most attractive throughout its  length  and the whole atmosphere of the place  from september to  december  is odorous with the perfume of red and purple grapes  the  vintage is not equal to that of the bordeaux region  perhaps  nor  of chinon  nor saumur  but  vin du pays  of the cher and the loire   around tours  is not to be despised     most tourists come to chenonceaux by train from tours  others drive  over from amboise  and yet others come by bicycle or automobile  they  are not as yet so numerous as might be expected  and accordingly here   as elsewhere in touraine  every facility is given for visiting the  chateau and its park     if you do not hurry off at once to worship at the abode of the  fascinating diane  one of the brightest ornaments of the court of  francois i  and his son henri  you will enjoy your dinner at the hotel  du bon laboureur  tho most likely it will be a solitary one  and you  will be put to bed in a great chamber over looking the park  through  which peep  in the moonlight  the turrets of the chateau  and you  may hear the purling of the waters of the cher as it flows below the  walls     jean jacques rousseau  like francois i   called chenonceaux a  beautiful place  and he was right  it is all of that and more  here  one comes into direct contact with an atmosphere which  if not feudal   or even medieval  is at least that of several hundred years ago     chenonceaux is moored like a ship in the middle of the rapidly running  cher  a dozen miles or more above where that stream enters the loire   as a matter of fact  the chateau practically bridges the river  which  flows under its foundations and beneath its drawbridge on either side   besides filling the moat with water  the general effect is as if the  building were set in the midst of a stream and formed a sort of island  chateau  round about is a gentle meadow and a great park  which gives  to this turreted  architectural gem of touraine a setting equalled by  no other chateau     what the chateau was in former days we can readily imagine  for  nothing is changed as to the general disposition  boats came to the  water gate  as they still might do if such boats still existed  in  true  pictorial legendary fashion  to day the present occupant has  placed a curiosity on the ornamental waters in the shape of a gondola   it is out of keeping with the grand fabric of the chateau  and it is a  pity that it does not cast itself adrift some night  what has become  of the gondolier  who was imported to keep the craft company  nobody  seems to know  he is certainly not in evidence  or  if he is  has  transformed himself into a groom or a chauffeur     the chateau of chenonceaux is not a very ample structure  not so ample  as most photographs would make it appear  it is not tiny  but still it  has not the magnificent proportions of blois  of chambord  or even of  langeais  it was more a habitation than it was a fortress  a  country house  as indeed it virtually became when the connetable de  montmorency took possession of the structure in the name of the king   when its builder  thomas bohier  the none too astute minister of  finance in normandy  came to grief in his affairs     francis i came frequently here to hunt  and his memory is still kept  alive by the chambre francois i  francois held possession till his  death  when his son made it over to the  admired of two generations    diane de poitiers     diane s memory will never leave chenonceaux  to day it is perpetuated  in the chambre de diane de poitiers  but the portrait by leonardo da  vinci  which was supposed to best show her charms  has now disappeared  from the long gallery at the chateau  this portrait was painted at the  command of francois  before diane transferred her affections to his  son     no one knows when or how diane de poitiers first came to fascinate  francois  or how or why her power waned  at any rate at the time  francois pardoned her father  the witless comte de st  vallier  for  the treacherous part he played in the bourbon conspiracy  he really  believed her to to be the  brightest ornament of a beauty loving  court      certainly  diane was a powerful factor in the politics of her time   tho francois himself soon tired of her  undaunted by this  she  forthwith set her cap for his son henri  the duc d orleans  and won  him  too  of her beauty the present generation is able to judge for  itself by reason of the three well known and excellent portraits of  contemporary times     diane s influence over the young henri was absolute  at his death  her power was  of course  at an end and chenonceaux  and all else  possible  was taken from her by the orders of catherine  the  long suffering wife  who had been put aside for the fascinations of  the charming huntress     it must have been some satisfaction  however  to diane  to know that   in his fatal joust with montgomery  henri really broke his lance and  met his death in her honor  for the records tell that he bore her  colors on his lance  besides her initials set in gold and gems on his  shield     catherine s eagerness to drive diane from the court was so great  that  no sooner had her spouse fallen  even tho he did not actually die for  some days  than she sent word to diane  who sat weeping alone   to  quit the court instantly  to give up the crown jewels  which henri had  somewhat inconsiderately given her  and to  give up chenonceaux in  touraine   catherine s naboth s vineyard  which she had so long  admired and coveted     she had known it as a girl  when she often visited it in company with  her father in law  the appreciative but dissolute francois  and had  ever longed to possess it for her own  before even her husband  now  dead  had given it to  that old hag diane de poitiers  duchesse de  valentinois      diane paid no heed to catherine s command  she simply asked   is the  king yet dead       no  madame   said the messenger   but his wound is mortal  he can not  live the day       tell the queen  then   replied diane   that her reign is not yet  come  that i am mistress still over her and the kingdom as long as the  king breathes the breath of life      the chateau of chenonceaux  so greatly coveted by catherine when she  first came to france  and when it was in the possession of diane   still remains in all the regal splendor of its past  it lies in the  lovely valley of the cher  far from the rush and turmoil of cities and  even the continuous traffic of great thoroughfares  for it is on the  road to nowhere unless one is journeying crosscountry from the lower  to the upper loire  this very isolation resulted in its being one  of the few monuments spared from the furies of the revolution  and    half palace and half chateau   it glistens with the purity of its  former glory  as picturesque as ever  with turrets  spires  and  roof tops all mellowed with the ages in a most entrancing manner     even to day one enters the precincts of the chateau proper over a  drawbridge which spans an arm of the loire  or rather  a moat which  leads directly from the parent stream  on the opposite side are the  bridge piers supporting five arches  the work of diane when she was  the fair chatelaine of the domain  this ingenious thought proved to  be a most useful and artistic addition to the chateau  it formed a  flagged promenade  lovely in itself  and led to the southern bank of  the cher  whence one got charming vistas of the turrets and roof tops  of the chateau through the trees and the leafy avenues which converged  upon the structure     when catherine came she did not disdain to make the best use of  diane s innovation that suggested itself to her  which was simply to  build the long gallery over the arches of this lovely bridge  and so  make of it a veritable house over the water  a covering was made quite  as beautiful as the rest of the structure  and thus the bridge formed  a spacious wing of two stories  the first floor  known as the long  gallery  was intended as a banqueting hall  and possest four great  full length windows on either side looking up and down the stream   from which was seen  and is to day  an outlook as magnificently  idyllic as is possible to conceive  jean goujon had designed for the  ceiling one of those wonder works for which he was famous  but if the  complete plan was ever carried out  it has disappeared  for only a  tiny sketch of the whole scheme remains to day     catherine came in the early summer to take possession of her  long coveted domain  being a skilful horsewoman  she came on  horseback  accompanied by a little band of feminine charmers destined  to wheedle political secrets from friends and enemies alike  a real   flying squadron of the queen   as it was called by a contemporary     it was a gallant company that assembled here at this time  the young  king charles ix   the duc de guise  and the  two cardinals mounted on  mules   lorraine  a true guise  and d este  newly arrived from italy   and accompanied by the poet tasso  wearing a  gabardine and a hood  of satin   catherine showed the italian great favor  as was due a  countryman  but there was another poet among them as well  ronsard   the poet laureate of the time  the duc de guise had followed in the  wake of marguerite  unbeknown to catherine  who frowned down any  possibility of an alliance between the houses of valois and lorraine     a great fete and water masque had been arranged by catherine to take  place on the cher  with a banquet to follow in the long gallery in  honor of her arrival at chenonceaux     when twilight had fallen  torches were ignited and myriads of lights  blazed forth from the boats on the river and from the windows of the  chateau  music and song went forth into the night  and all was as gay  and lovely as a venetian night s entertainment  the hunting horns  echoed through the wooded banks  and through the arches above which  the chateau was built passed great highly colored barges  including a  fleet of gondolas

of art  and literature  this is best shown by the citing of such names as  fontenelle  montesquieu  buffon  bolingbroke  voltaire  and rousseau   all of whom were frequenters of the establishment  the

   above the swift flowing ariege in their superb setting of mountain  and forest are the towers and parapets of the old chateau  in itself  enough to make the name and fame of any city     the actual age of  the monument covers many epochs  the two square towers and the main  edifice  as seen to day  are anterior to the thirteenth century  as is  proved by the design in the seals of the comtes de foix of      and       now in the bibliotheque nationale in paris  in the fourteenth  century these towers were strengthened and enlarged with the idea of  making them more effective for defense and habitation     the escutcheons of foix  beam and comminges  to be seen in the great  central tower  indicate that it  too  goes back at least to the end  of the fourteenth century  when eleanore de

stones scattered all over france as one  of the most graceful  legend attributes it to gaston phoebus  but all  authorities do not agree as to this  the window and door openings  the  moldings  the accolade over the entrance doorway  and the machicoulis  all denote that they belong to the latter half of the fifteenth  century  these  however  may be later interpolations     originally one

unlovely thing  regardless of its  high sounding titles        it was that great hunter and warrior  gaston phoebus  who gave the  chateau de foix its greatest lustre  it was here that this most  brilliant and most celebrated of the counts passed his youth  and it  was from here that he set out on his famous expedition to aid his  brother knights of the teutonic order in prussia  at gaston s orders  the comte d armagnac was imprisoned here  to be released after the  payment of a heavy ransom  as to the motive for this particular act   authorities differ as to whether it was the fortune of war or mere  brigandage     they lived high  the nobles of the old days  and froissart recounts a  banquet at which he had assisted at foix  in the sixteenth century  as  follows      and this was what i saw in the comte de foix  the comte left his  chamber to sup at midnight  the way to the great  salle  being led by  twelve varlets  bearing twelve illumined torches  the great hall was  crowded with knights and equerries  and those who would supped  saying  nothing meanwhile  mostly game seemed to be the favorite viand  and  the legs and wings only of fowl were eaten  music and

promised rivers were before us  so was the mont  spectral no  longer  but nearing with every plunge forward of our sturdy young  percheron  locomotion through any new or untried medium is certain  to bring with the experiment a dash of elation  now  driving through  water appears to be no longer the fashion in our fastidious century   someone might get a wetting  possibly  has been the conclusion of the  prudent  and thus a very innocent and exciting bit of fun has been  gradually relegated among the lost arts of pleasure     we were taking water as we had never taken it before  and liking the  method  we were as wet as ducks  but what cared we  we were being  deluged with spray  the spume of the sea was spurting in our faces  with the force of a strong wet breeze  and still we liked it  besides   driving thus into the white foam of the waters  over the sand ridges   across the downs  into the wide plains of wet mud  this was the old  classical way of going up to the mont     surely  what had been found good enough as a pathway for kings  and  saints and pilgrims should be good enough for lovers of old time  methods  the dike yonder was built for those who believe in the devil  of haste  and for those who also serve him faithfully        with our first toss upon the downs  a world of new and fresh  experiences began  genets was quite right  the mont over yonder was  another country  even at the very beginning of the journey we learned  so much  this breeze blowing in from the sea  that had swept the  ramparts of the famous rock  was a double extract of the sea essence   it had all the salt of the sea and the aroma of firs and wild flowers   its lips had not kissed a garden in high air without the perfume  lingering  if only to betray them     even this strip of meadow marsh had a character peculiar to itself   half of it belonged to earth and half to the sea  you might have  thought it an inland pasture  with its herds of cattle  its flocks  of sheep  and its colonies of geese patrolled by ragged urchins  but  behold somewhere out yonder the pasture was lost in high sea waves   ships with bulging sails replaced the curve of the cattle s sides and  instead of bending necks of sheep  there were sea gulls swooping down  upon the foamy waves     as the incarnation of this dual life of sea and land  the rock  stands  it also is both of the sea and the land  its feet are of the  waters  rocks and stones the sea waves have used as playthings these  millions of years  but earth regains possession as the rocks pile  themselves into a mountain  even from this distance  one can see the  moving of great trees  the masses of yellow flower tips that dye the  sides of the stony hill  and the strips of green grass here and there     so much has nature done for this wonderful pyramid in the sea  then  man came and fashioned it to his liking  he piled the stones at its  base into titanic walls  he carved about its sides the rounded breasts  of bastions  he piled higher and higher up the dizzy heights a medley  of palaces  convents  abbeys  cloisters  to lay at the very top the  fitting crown of all  a jewelled norman gothic cathedral     earth and man have thrown their gauntlet down to the sea  this rock is  theirs  they cry to the waves and the might of the oceans  and the sea  laughs  as strong men laugh when boys are angry or insistent  she has  let them build and toil  and pray and fight  it is all one to her what  is done on the rock  whether men carve its stones into lace  or rot  and die in its dungeons  it is all the same to her whether each spring  the daffodils creep up within the crevices and the irises nod to them  from the gardens     it is all one to her  for twice a day she recaptures the mont  she  encircles it with the strong arm of her tides  with the might of her  waters she makes it once more a thing of the sea     the tide was rising now     the fringe of the downs had dabbled in the shoals till they became  one  we had left behind the last of the shepherd lads  come out to the  edge of the land to search for a wandering kid  we were all at once  plunging into high water  our road was sunk out of sight  we were  driving through  waves as high as our cart wheels        our cart still pitched and tossed  we were still rocked about in our  rough cradle  but the sun  now freed from the banks of clouds  was  lighting our way with a great and sudden glory  and for the rest of  our watery journey we were conscious only of that lighting  behind the  mont lay a vast sea of saffron  but it was in the sky  against it the  great rock was as black as if the night were upon it     here and there  through the curve of a flying buttress  or the  apertures of a pierced parapet  gay bits of this yellow world were  caught and framed  the sea lay beneath like a quiet carpet  and over  this carpet ships and sloops swam with easy gliding motion  with sails  and cordage dipt in gold  the smaller craft  moored close to the  shore  seemed transfigured as in a fog of gold  and nearer still were  the brown walls of the mont making a great shadow  and in the shadow  the waters were as black as the skin of an african  in the shoals  there were lovely masses of turquoise and palest green  for here and  there a cloudlet passed  to mirror its complexion in the translucent  pools        there was a rapid dashing beneath the great walls  a sudden night of  darkness as we plunged through an open archway into a narrow village  street  a confused impression of houses built into side walls  of  machicolated gateways  of rocks and roof tops tumbling about our ears   and within the street was sounding the babel of a shrieking troop of  men and women  porters  peasants  and children were clamoring about  our cartwheels like so many jackals  the bedlam did not cease as we  stopt before a brightly lit open doorway     then through the doorway there came a tall  finely featured brunette   she made her way through the yelling crowd as a duchess might cleave a  path through a rabble  she was at the side of the cart in an instant   she gave us a bow and smile that were both a welcome and an act of  appropriation  she held out a firm  soft  brown hand  when it closed  on our own  we knew it to be the grasp of a friend  and the clasp of  one who knew how to hold her world  but when she spoke the words were  all of velvet  and her voice had the cadence of a caress      i have been watching you   cheres dames   crossing the  greve   but  how wet and weary you must be  come in by the fire  it is ablaze  now  i have been feeding it for you      and once more the beautifully curved lips parted over the fine teeth   and the exceeding brightness of the dark eyes smiled and glittered in  our own  the caressing voice still led us forward  into the great gay  kitchen  the touch of skilful  discreet fingers undid wet cloaks and  wraps  the soft charm of a lovely and gracious woman made even the  penetrating warmth of the huge fire logs a secondary feature of our  welcome     to those who have never crossed a  greve   who have had no jolting in  a normandy  char a banc   who  for hours  have not known the mixed  pleasures and discomfort of being a part of sea rivers  and who have  not been met at the threshold of an inn on a rock by the smiling  welcome of

still survive at mont st  michel      altho her people were waiting below  and the dinner was on its way to  the cloth  madame poulard had plenty of time to give to the beauty  about her  how fine was the outlook from the top of the ramparts   what a fresh sensation  this of standing on a terrace in mid air and  looking down on the sea and across to the level shores  the rose  vines  we found them sweet   ah   one of the branches had fallen  she  had full time to re adjust the loosened support  and  marianne  give  these ladies their hot water  and see to their bags   even this order  was given with courtesy  it was only when the supple  agile figure had  left us to fly down the steep rock cut steps  when it shot over the  top of the gateway and slid with the grace of a lizard into the street  far below us  that we were made sensible of there having been any  special need of madame s being in haste        the mont proved by its appearance its history in adventure  it had the  grim  grave  battered look that comes only to features  whether of  rock or of more plastic human mold  that have been carved by the rough  handling of experience     it is the common habit of hills and mountains  as we all know  to turn  disdainful as they grow skyward  they only too eagerly drop  one by  one  the things by which man has marked the earth for his own  to  stand on a mountain top and to go down to your grave are alike  at  least in this  that you have left everything  except yourself  behind  you  but it is both the charm and the triumph of mont st  michael   that it carries so much of man s handiwork up into the blue fields of  the air  this achievement alone would mark it as unique among hills   it appears as if for once man and nature had agreed to work in concert  to produce a masterpiece in stone  the hill and the architectural  beauties it carries aloft  are like a taunt flung out to sea and to  the upper heights of air  for centuries they appear to have been  crying aloud   see what we can do  against your tempests and your  futile tides  when we try      rustic france along this coast still  makes pilgrimages to the shrine of the archangel st  michael  no  marriage is rightly arranged which does not include a wedding journey  across the  greve   no nuptial breakfast is aureoled with the true  halo of romance which is eaten elsewhere than on these heights in  mid air  the young come to drink deep of wonders  the old  to refresh  the depleted fountains of memory  and the tourist  behold he is a  plague of locusts let loose upon the defenseless hill     it was impossible  after sojourning a certain time upon the hill  not  to concede that there were two equally strong centers of attraction  that drew the world hitherward  one remained  indeed  gravely  suspended between the doubt and the fear  as to which of these  potential units had the greater pull  in point of actual attraction   the impartial historian  given to a just weighing of evidence  would  have been startled to find how invariably the scales tipped  how  lightly an historical mont  born of a miracle  crowned by the noblest  buildings  a pious mecca for saints and kings innumerable  shot up  like feathers in lightness when overweighted by the modern realities  of a perfectly appointed inn  the cooking and eating of an omelet of  omelets  and the all conquering charms of madame poulard     the fog of doubt thickened as  day after day  the same scenes were  enacted  when one beheld all sorts of conditions of men similarly  affected  when  again and again  the potentiality in the human magnet  was proved true  doubt turned to conviction  at the last  that the  holy shrine of st  michael had  in truth  been violated  that the mont  had been desecrated  that the latter exists now solely as a setting  for a pearl of an inn  and that within the shrine  it is madame  poulard herself who fills the niche        such a variety of brides as come up to the mont  you could have your  choice  at the midday meal  of almost any nationality  age  or color   the attempt among these bridal couples to maintain the distant air  of a finished indifference only made their secret the more open   the british phlegm  on such a journey  did not always serve as a  convenient mask  the flattering  timid glance  the ripple of tender  whispers  and the furtive touching of fingers beneath the table  made  even these english couples a part of the great human marrying family   their superiority to their fellows would return  doubtless  when the  honey had dried out of their moon     the best of our adventures into this tender country were with the  french bridal tourists  they were certain to be delightfully human  as  we had had occasion to remark before  they were off  like ourselves   on a little voyage of discovery  they had come to make acquaintance  with the being to whom they were mated for life  various degrees of  progress could be read in the air and manner of the hearty young   bourgeoises  and their paler or even ruddier partners  as they  crunched their bread or sipped their thin wine  some had only entered  as yet upon the path of inquiry  others had already passed the  mile stone of criticism  and still others had left the earth and were  floating in full azure of intoxication  of the many wedding parties  that sat down to breakfast  we soon made the commonplace discovery  that the more plebeian the company  the more certain orbed appeared to  be the promise of happiness        madame poulard s air with this  her world  was as full of tact as with  the tourists  many of the older women would give her the norman kiss   solemnly  as if the salute were a part of the ceremony attendant on  the eating of a wedding breakfast at mont st  michel  there would be  a three times  clapping of the wrinkled or the ruddy peasant cheeks  against the sides of madame poulard s daintier  more delicately  modeled face  then all would take their seats noisily at the table  it  was madame poulard who would then bring us news of the party  at the  end of a fortnight charm and i felt ourselves to be in possession of  the hidden and secret reasons for all the marrying that had been done  along the coast that year        one morning  as we looked toward pontorson  a small black cloud  appeared to be advancing across the bay  the day was windy  the sky  was crowded with huge white mountains  round  luminous clouds that  moved in stately sweeps  and the sea was the color one loves to see  in an earnest woman s eye  the dark blue sapphire that turns to  blue gray  this was a setting that made that particular cloud  making  such slow progress across from the shore  all the more conspicuous   gradually  as the black mass neared the dike  it began to break and  separate  and we saw plainly enough that the scattering particles were  human beings     it was  in point of fact  a band of pilgrims  a peasant pilgrimage was  coming up to the mont  in wagons  in market carts  in  char a bancs    in donkey carts  on the backs of monster percherons  the pilgrimage  moved in slow processional dignity across the dike  some of the  younger black gowns and blue blouses attempted to walk across over the  sands  we could see the girls sitting down on the edge of the shore   to take off their shoes and stockings and to tuck up their thick  skirts  when they finally started they were like unto so many huge  cheeses hoisted on stilts  the bare legs plunged boldly forward   keeping ahead of the slower moving peasant lads  the girls  bravery  served them till they reached the fringe of the incoming tide  not  until their knees went under water did they forego their venture  a  higher wave came in  deluging the ones farthest out  and then ensued a  scampering toward the dike and a climbing up of the stone embankment   the old route across the sands  that had been the only one known to  kings and barons  was not good enough for a modern norman peasant  the  religion of personal comfort has spread even as far as the fields     other aspects of the hill  on this day of the pilgrimage  made those  older dead and gone bands of pilgrims astonishingly real  on the tops  of bastions  in the clefts on the rocks  beneath the glorious walls  of la merveille  or perilously lodged on the crumbling cornice of a  tourelle  numerous rude altars had been hastily erected  the crude  blues and scarlets of banners were fluttering  like so many pennants   in the light breeze  beneath the improvised altar roofs  strips of gay  cloth stretched across poles stuck into the ground  were groups not  often seen in these less fervent centuries     high up  mounted on the natural pulpit  formed of a bit of rock  with  the rude altar before him with its bits of scarlet cloth covered with  cheap lace  stood or knelt the priest  against the wide blue of the  open heaven his figure took on an imposing splendor of mien and an  unmodern impressiveness of action  beneath him knelt  with bowed  heads  the groups of the peasant pilgrims  the women  with murmuring  lips and clasped hands  their strong  deeply seamed faces outlined  with the precision of a francesco painting against the gray background  of a giant mass of wall or the amazing breadth of a vast sea view   children  squat and chubby  with bulging cheeks starting from the  close fitting french  bonnet   and the peasant farmers  mostly of the  older varieties  whose stiffened or rheumatic knees and knotty hands  made their kneeling real acts of devotional zeal     there were a dozen such altars and groups scattered over the  perpendicular slant of the hill  the singing of the choir boys  rising  like skylark notes into the clear space of heaven  would be floating  from one rocky nested chapel  while below  in the one beneath which  we  for a moment  were resting  there would be the groaning murmur of  the peasant groups in prayer     three times did the vision of st  michael appear to saint aubert  in  his dream  commanding the latter to erect a church on the heights of  mont st  michel to his honor  how many a time must the modern pilgrim  traverse the stupendous mass that has grown out of that command before  he is quite certain that the splendor of mont st  michel is real  and  not part of a dream     whether one enters through the dark magnificence of the great portals  of the chatelet  whether one mounts the fortified stairway  passing  into the salle des gardes  passing onward from dungeon to fortified  bridge to gain the abbatial residence  whether one leaves the vaulted  splendor of oratories for aerial passageways  only to emerge beneath  the majestic roof of the cathedral  that marvel of the early norman   ending in the gothic choir of the fifteenth century  or  as one  penetrates into the gloom of the mighty dungeons where heroes  and  brothers of kings  and saints  and scientists have died their long  death  as one gropes through the black night of the crypt  where a  faint  mysterious glint of light falls aslant the mystical face of the  black virgin  as one climbs to the light beneath the ogive arches  of the aumonerie  through the wide lit aisles of the salle des  chevaliers  past the slender gothic columns of the refectory  up at  last to the crowning glory of all the glories of la merveille  to the  exquisitely beautiful colonnades of the open cloister  the impressions  and emotions excited by these ecclesiastical and military masterpieces  are ever the same  however many times one may pass them in review  a  charm indefinable  but replete with subtle attractions  lurks in every  one of these dungeons     the great halls have a power to make one retraverse their space i have  yet to find under other vaulted chambers  the grass that is set   like a green jewel  in the arabesques of the cloister  is a bit of  greensward the feet press with a different tread to that which skips  lightly over other strips of turf  and the world  that one looks out  upon through prison bars  that is so gloriously arched in the arm of  a flying buttress  or that lies prone at your feet from the dizzy  heights of the rock clefts  is not the world in which you  daily  do  your petty stretch of toil  in which you laugh and ache  sorrow  sigh   and go down to your grave     the secret of this deep attraction may lie in the fact of one s being  in a world that is built on a height  much  doubtless  of the charm  lies  also  in the reminders of all the human life that  since the  early dawn of history  has peopled this hill  one has the sense  of living at a tremendously high mental pressure  of impressions   emotions  sensations crowding upon the mind  of one s whole meager  outfit of memory  of poetic equipment  and of imaginative furnishing  being unequal to the demand made by even the most hurried tour of the  great buildings  or the most flitting review of the noble massing of  the clouds and the hilly seas     the very emptiness and desolation of all the buildings on the hill  help to accentuate their splendor  the stage is magnificently set   the curtain  even  is lifted  one waits for the coming on of kingly  shapes  for the pomp of trumpets  for the pattering of a mighty host   but  behold  all is still  and one sits and sees only a shadowy  company pass and repass across that glorious mise en scene     for  in a certain sense  i know no other medieval mass of buildings as  peopled as are these  the dead shapes seem to fill the vast halls  the  salle des chevaliers is crowded  daily  with a brilliant gathering of  knights  who sweep the trains of their white damask mantles  edged  with ermine  over the dulled marble of the floor  two by two they  enter the hall  the golden shells on their mantles make the eyes  blink  as the groups gather about the great chimneys  or wander  through the column broken space     behind this dazzling cortege  up the steep steps of the narrow  streets  swarm other groups  the medieval pilgrim host that rushes  into cathedral aisles  and that climbs the ramparts to watch the  stately procession as it makes its way toward the church portals     there are still other figures that fill every empty niche and deserted  watch tower  through the lancet windows of the abbatial gateways the  yeomanry of the vassal villages are peering  it is the weary time of  the hundred years  war  and all france is watching  through sentry  windows  for the approach of her dread enemy  on the shifting sands  below  as on brass  how indelibly fixt are the names of the hundred  and twenty nine knights whose courage drove  step by step  over  that treacherous surface  the english invaders back to their island  strongholds           caen a      footnote a  from  a bibliographical tour in france and germany       by thomas frognall dibdin      let us begin  therefore  with the abbey of st  stephen  for it is the  noblest and most interesting on many accounts  it is called by the  name of that saint  inasmuch as there stood formerly a chapel  on the  same site  dedicated to him  the present building was completed and  solemnly dedicated by william the conqueror  in the presence of his  wife  his two sons robert and william  his favorite  archbishop  lanfranc  john  archbishop of rouen  and thomas  archbishop of  york  toward the year       but i strongly suspect  from the present  prevailing character of the architecture  that nothing more than the  west front and the towers upon which the spires rest remain of its  ancient structure  the spires  as the abbe de la rue conjectures  and  as i should also have thought  are about two centuries later than the  towers     the outsides of the side aisles appear to be of the thirteenth  rather  than of the end of the eleventh  century  the first exterior view of  the west front  and of the towers  is extremely interesting from the  gray and clear tint  as well as excellent quality  of the stone   which  according to huet  was brought partly from vaucelle and partly  from allemagne  one of the corner abutments of one of the towers has  fallen down and a great portion of what remains seem to indicate rapid  decay  the whole stands indeed greatly in need of reparation  ducarel   if i remember rightly  has made  of this whole front  a sort of  elevation as if it were intended for a wooden model to work by  having  all the stiffness and precision of an erection of forty eight hours   standing only  the central tower is of very stunted dimensions  and  overwhelmed by a roof in the form of an extinguisher  this  in fact   was the consequence of the devastations of the calvinists  who  absolutely sapped the foundation of the tower  with the hope of  overwhelming the whole choir in ruin  but a part only of their  malignant object was accomplished  the component parts of the eastern  extremity are strangely and barbarously miscellaneous  however  no  good commanding exterior view can be obtained from the place  or  confined square  opposite the towers     but let us return to the west front  and  opening the unfastened green  baize covered door  enter softly and silently into the venerable  interior  sacred even to the feelings of englishmen  of this interior   very much is changed from its original character  the side aisles  retain their flattened arched roofs and pillars  and in the nave you  observe those rounded pilasters  or altorilievo like pillars  running  from bottom to top  which are to be seen in the abbey of jumieges  the  capitals of these long pillars are comparatively of modern date     to the left on entrance  within a side chapel  is the burial place  of matilda  the wife of the conqueror  the tombstone attesting her  interment is undoubtedly of the time  generally speaking  the interior  is cold  and dull of effect  the side chapels  of which not fewer than  sixteen encircle the choir  have the discordant accompaniments of  grecian balustrades to separate them from the choir and nave     to the right of the choir  in the sacristy  i think  is hung the huge  portrait  in oil  within a black and gilt frame  of which ducarel has  published an engraving  on the supposition of its being the portrait  of william the conqueror  but nothing can be more ridiculous than  such a conclusion  in the first place  the picture itself  which is  a palpable copy  can not be older than a century  and in the second  place  were it an original performance  it could not be older than the  time of francis i  in fact  it purports to have been executed as a  faithful copy of the figure of king william  seen by the cardinals in        who were seized with a sacred frenzy to take a peep at the body  as it might exist at that time  the costume of the oil painting is  evidently that of the period of our henry viii   and to suppose that  the body of william  even had it remained in so surprisingly perfect  a state as ducarel intimates  after an interment of upward of four  hundred years  could have presented such a costume  when  from  ducarel s own statement  another whole length representation of the  same person is totally different  and more decidedly of the character  of william s time  is really quite a reproach to any antiquary who  plumes himself upon the possession even of common sense     in the middle of the choir  and just before the high altar  the body  of the conqueror was entombed with great pomp  and a monument erected  to his memory of the most elaborate and costly description  nothing  now remains but a flat  black marble slab  with a short inscription   of quite a recent date        you must now attend me to the most interesting public building   perhaps all things considered  which is to be seen at caen  i mean  the abbey of the holy trinity  or l abbaye aux dames  this abbey was  founded by the wife of the conqueror  about the same time that william  erected that of st  stephen  ducarel s description of it  which i  have just seen in a copy of the  anglo norman antiquities   in a  bookseller s shop  is sufficiently meager  his plates are also  sufficiently miserable  but things are strangely altered since his  time  the nave of the church is occupied by a manufactory for making  cordage  or twine  and upward of a hundred lads are now busied in  their flaxen occupations  where formerly the nun knelt before the  cross  or was occupied in auricular confession     the entrance at the western extremity is entirely stopt up  but the  exterior gives manifest proof of an antiquity equal to that of the  abbey of st  stephen  the upper part of the towers are palpably of the  fifteenth or  rather  of the early part of the sixteenth century  i  had no opportunity of judging of the neat pavement of the floor of the  nave  in white and black marble  as noticed by ducarel  on account  of the occupation of this part of the building by the manufacturing  children  but i saw some very ancient tombstones  one  i think  of the  twelfth century  which had been removed from the nave or side aisles   and were placed against the sides of the north transept     the nave is entirely walled up from the transepts  but the choir is  fortunately preserved  and a more perfect and interesting specimen  of its kind  of the same antiquity  is perhaps nowhere to be seen  in normandy  all the monuments as well as the altars  described by  ducarel  are now taken away  having ascended a stone staircase  we got  into the upper part of the choir  above the first row of pillars  and  walked along the wall  this was rather adventurous  you will say  but  a more adventurous spirit of curiosity had nearly proved fatal to me   for  on quitting daylight  we pursued a winding stone staircase  in  our way to the central tower  to enjoy from hence a view of the town   i almost tremble as i relate it     there had been put up a sort of temporary wooden staircase  leading  absolutely to nothing  or  rather  to a dark void space  i happened  to be foremost in ascending  yet groping in the dark  with the guide  luckily close behind me  having reached the topmost step  i was  raising my foot to a supposed higher or succeeding step  but there was  none  a depth of eighteen feet at least was below me  the guide  caught my coat  as i was about to lose my balance  and roared out    wait  stop   the least balance or inclination  one way or the other   is sufficient  upon these critical occasions  when luckily  from his  catching my coat  and pulling me  in consequence  slightly backward   my fall and my life  were equally saved  i have reason from henceforth  to remember the abbey aux dames at caen     i gained the top of the central tower  which is not of equal altitude  with those of the western extremity  and from hence surveyed the town   as well as the drizzling rain would permit  i saw enough  however   to convince me that the site of this abbey is fine and commanding   indeed  it stands nearly upon the highest ground in the town  ducarel  had not the glorious ambition to mount to the top of the tower   nor did he even possess that most commendable of all species of  architectural curiosity  a wish to visit the crypt  thus  in either  extremity  i evinced a more laudable spirit of enterprise than did  my old fashioned predecessor  accordingly  from the summit  you must  accompany me to the lowest depth of the building  i descended by the  same somewhat intricate route  and i took especial care to avoid all   temporary wooden staircase   the crypt  beneath the choir  is perhaps  of yet greater interest and beauty than the choir itself  within an  old  very old  stone coffin  at the further circular end  are the  pulverized remains of one of the earliest abbesses  i gazed around  with mixed sensations of veneration and awe  and threw myself back  into centuries past  fancying that the shrouded figure of maltilda  herself glided by  with a look as if to approve of my antiquarian  enthusiasm     having gratified my curiosity by a careful survey of the subterranean  abode  i revisited the regions of daylight  and made toward the large  building  now a manufactory  which in ducarel s time had been a  nunnery  the revolution has swept away every human being in the  character of a nun  but the director of the manufactory showed me   with great civility  some relics of old crosses  rings  veils   lacrimatories  etc   which had been taken from the crypt i had  recently visited  these relics savored of considerable antiquity  tom  hearne would have set about proving that they must have belonged to  matilda herself  but i will have neither the presumption nor the merit  of attempting this proof  they seemed  indeed  to have undergone half  a dozen decompositions  upon the whole  if our antiquarian society   after having exhausted the cathedrals of their own country  should  ever think of perpetuating the principal ecclesiastical edifices of  normandy  by means of the art of engraving  let them begin their  labors

holt    co  copyright            by hippolyte adolphe taine      the river is so fine that  before going to bayonne  i have come down  as far as royan  ships heavy with white sails ascend slowly on both  sides of the boat  at each gust of wind they incline like idle birds   lifting their long wings and showing their black bellies  they run  slantwise  then come back  one would say that they felt the better for  being in this great fresh water harbor  they loiter in it and enjoy  its peace after leaving the wrath and inclemency of the ocean     the banks  fringed with pale verdure  glide right and left  far  away to the verge of heaven  the river is broad like a sea  at this  distance you might think you had seen two hedges  the trees dimly lift  their delicate shapes in a robe of bluish gauze  here and there great  pines raise their umbrellas on the vapory horizon  where all is  confused and vanishing  there is an inexpressible sweetness in these  first hues of the timid day  softened still by the fog which exhales  from the deep river     as for the river itself  its waters stretch out joyous and splendid   the rising sun pours upon its breast a long streamlet of gold  the  breeze covers it with scales  its eddies stretch themselves  and  tremble like an awaking serpent  and  when the billow heaves them  you  seem to see the striped flanks  the tawny cuirass of a leviathan     indeed  at such moments it seems that the water must live and feel  it  has a strange look  when it comes  transparent and somber  to stretch  itself upon a beach of pebbles  it turns about them as if uneasy and  irritated  it beats them with its wavelets  it covers them  then  retires  then comes back again with a sort of languid writhing and  mysterious lovingness  its snaky eddies  its little crests suddenly  beaten down or broken  its wave  sloping  shining  then all at once  blackened  resembles the flashes of passion in an impatient mother   who hovers incessantly and anxiously about her children  and covers  them  not knowing what she wants and what fears     presently a cloud has covered the heavens  and the wind has risen   in a moment the river has assumed the aspect of a crafty and savage  animal  it hollowed itself  and showed its livid belly  it came  against the keel with convulsive starts  hugged it  and dashed against  it  as if to try its force  as far as one could see  its waves lifted  themselves and crowded together  like the muscles upon a chest  over  the flank of the waves passed flashes with sinister smiles  the mast  groaned  and the trees bent shivering  like a nerveless crowd before  the wrath of a fearful beast  then all was hushed  the sun had burst  forth  the waves were smoothed  you now see only a laughing expanse   spun out over this polished back a thousand greenish tresses sported  wantonly  the light rested on it  like a diaphanous mantle  it  followed the supple movements and the twisting of those liquid arms   it folded around them  behind them  its radiant  azure robe  it took  their caprices and their mobile colors  the river meanwhile  slumbrous  in its great  peaceful bed  was stretched out at the feet of the  hills  which looked down upon it  like it immovable and eternal     the boat is made fast to a boom  under a pile of white houses  it  is royan  here already are the sea and the dunes  the right of the  village is buried under a mass of sand  there are crumbling hills   little dreary valleys  where you are lost as if in the desert  no  sound  no movement  no life  scanty  leafless vegetation dots moving  soil  and its filaments fall like sickly hairs  small shells  white  and empty  cling to these in chaplets  and  wherever the foot is set   they crack with a sound like a cricket s chirp  this place is the  ossuary of some wretched maritime tribe     one tree alone can live here  the pine  a wild creature  inhabitant of  the forests and sterile coasts  there is a whole colony of them here   they crowd together fraternally  and cover the sand with their brown  lamels  the monotonous breeze which sifts through them forever awakes  their murmur  thus they chant in a plaintive fashion  but with a far  softer and more harmonious voice than the other trees  this voice  resembles the grating of the cicadas when in august they sing with all  their heart among the stalks of the ripened wheat     at the left of the village  a footpath winds to the summit of a wasted  bank  among billows of standing grasses  the river is so broad that  the other shore is not distinguishable  the sea  its neighbor  imparts  its influence  its long undulations come one after another against the  coast  and pour their little cascades of foam upon the sand  then the  water retires  running down the slope until it meets a new wave coming  up which covers it  these billows are never wearied  and their come  and go remind one of the regular breathing of a slumbering child  for  night has fallen  the tints of purple grow brown and fade away  the  river goes to rest in the soft  vague shadow  scarcely  at long  intervals  a remnant glimpse is reflected from a slanting wave   obscurity drowns everything in its vapory dust  the drowsy eye vainly  searches in this mist some visible point  and distinguishes at last   like a dim star  the lighthouse of cordouan     the next evening a fresh sea breeze has brought us to bordeaux   the enormous city heaps its monumental houses along the river like  bastions  the red sky is embattled by their coping  they on one hand   the bridge on the other  protect  with a double line  the port where  the vessels are crowded together like a flock of gulls  those graceful  hulls  those tapering masts  those sails swollen or floating  weave  the labyrinth of their movements and forms upon the magnificent purple  of the sunset  the sun sinks into the river  the black rigging  the  round hulls  stand out against its conflagration  and look like jewels  of jet set in gold     around bordeaux are smiling hills  varied horizons  fresh valleys   a river people by incessant navigation  a succession of cities and  villages harmoniously planted upon the declivities or in the plains   everywhere the richest verdure  the luxury of nature and civilization   the earth and man vying with each other to enrich and

well     pine woods pass to the right and to the left  silent and wan  each  tree bears on its side the scar of wounds where the woodmen have set  flowing the resinous blood which chokes it  the

bathed in light  stretches  away as far as the eye can reach  their green fans expand beneath the  sun which colors  but does not cause them to fade  upon the horizon a  few scattered trees lift their slender columns  you see now and then  the silhouette of a herdsman on his stilts  inert and standing like a  sick heron  wild horses are grazing half hid in the herbage  as the  train passes  they abruptly lift their great startled eyes and stand  motionless  uneasy at the noise that has troubled their solitude     man does not fare well here  he dies or degenerates  but it is the  country of animals  and especially of plants  they abound in this  desert  free  certain of living  our pretty  cut up valleys are but  poor things alongside of these immense spaces  leagues upon leagues  of marshy or dry vegetation  a level country  where nature  elsewhere  troubled and tortured by men  still vegetates  as in primeval days   with a calm equal to its grandeur  the sun needs these savannas in  order properly to spread out its light  from the rising exhalation   you feel that the whole plain is fermenting under its force  and the  eyes  filled by the limitless horizon  divine the secret

thomas gray      we took the longest road  which lies through savoy  on purpose to see  a famous monastery  called the grande chartreuse  and had no reason to  think our time lost  after having traveled seven days very slow  for  we did not change horses  it being impossible for a chaise to go fast  in these roads   we arrived at a little village  among the mountains  of savoy  called echelles  from thence we proceeded on horses  who are  used to the way  to the mountain of the chartreuse     it is six miles to the top  the road runs winding up it  commonly not  six feet broad  on one hand is the rock  with woods of pine trees  hanging overhead  on the other  a monstrous precipice  almost  perpendicular  at the bottom of which rolls a torrent that  sometimes  tumbling among the fragments of stone that have fallen from on high   and sometimes precipitating itself down vast descents with a noise  like thunder  which is made still greater by the echo from the  mountains on each side  concurs to form one of the most solemn  the  most romantic  and the most astonishing scenes i ever beheld     add to this the strange views made by the crags and cliffs on the  other hand  the cascades that in many places throw themselves from the  very summit down into the vale  and the river below  and many other  particulars impossible to describe  you will conclude we had no  occasion to repent our plans  this place st  bruno chose to retire  to  and upon its very top founded the aforesaid convent  which is the  superior of the whole order  when we came there  the two fathers  who  are commissioned to entertain strangers  for the rest must neither  speak one to another nor to any one else  received us very kindly  and  set before us a repast of dried fish  eggs  butter  and fruits  all  excellent in their kind  and extremely neat  they prest us to spend  the night there  and to stay some days with them  but this we could  not do  so they led us about their house  which is  you must think   like a little city  for there are     fathers  besides     servants   that make their clothes  grind their corn  press their wine  and do  everything among themselves     the whole is quite orderly and simple  nothing of finery  but the  wonderful decency  and the strange situation  more than supply the  place of it  in the evening we descended by the same way  passing  through many clouds that were then forming themselves on the  mountain s side           carcassonne a      footnote a  from  a little tour in france   by special arrangement  with  and by permission of  the publishers  houghton  mifflin co   copyright            by henry james      when i say the town  i mean the towns  there being two at carcassonne   perfectly distinct  and each with excellent claims to the title  they  have settled the matter between them  however  and the elder  the  shrine of pilgrimage  to which the other is but a stepping stone  or  even  as i may say  a humble doormat  takes the name of the cite     you see nothing of the cite from the station  it is masked by the  agglomeration of the  ville basse   which is relatively  but only  relatively  new  a wonderful avenue of acacias leads to it from  the station  leads past it  rather  and conducts you to a little  high backed bridge over the aude  beyond which  detached and erect  a  distinct medieval silhouette  the cite presents itself  like a rival  shop  on the invidious side of a street  it has  no connection  with  the establishment across the way  altho the two places are united   if old carcassonne may be said to be united to anything  by a vague  little rustic faubourg  perched on its solid pedestal  the perfect  detachment of the cite is what first strikes you     to take leave  without delay  of the  ville basse   i may say that  the splendid acacias i have mentioned flung a summerish dusk over  the place  in which a few scattered remains of stout walls and big  bastions looked venerable and picturesque  a little boulevard winds  around the town  planted with trees and garnished with more benches  than i ever saw provided by a soft hearted municipality  this  precinct had a warm  lazy  dusty  southern look  as if the people sat  out of doors a great deal  and wandered about in the stillness of  summer nights  the figure of the elder town  at these hours  must be  ghostly enough on its neighboring hill     even by day it has the air of a vignette of gustave dore  a couplet  of victor hugo  it is almost too perfect  as if it were an enormous  model  placed on a big green table at a museum  a steep  paved way   grass grown like all roads where vehicles never pass  stretches up  to it in the sun  it has a double enceinte  complete outer walls and  complete inner  these  elaborately fortified  are the more curious    and this congregation of ramparts  towers  bastions  battlements   barbicans  is as fantastic and romantic as you please  the approach i  mention here leads to the gate that looks toward toulouse  the porte  de l aude  there is a second  on the other side  called  i believe   porte narbonnaise  a magnificent gate  flanked with towers thick and  tall  defended by elaborate outworks  and these two apertures alone  admit you to the place  putting aside a small sally port  protected by  a great bastion  on the quarter that looks toward the pyrenees        i should lose no time in saying that restoration is the great mark of  the cite  m  viollet le duc has worked his will upon it  put it into  perfect order  revived the fortifications in every detail  i do not  pretend to judge the performance  carried out on a scale and in  a spirit which really impose themselves on the imagination  few  architects have had such a chance  and m  viollet le duc must have  been the envy of the whole restoring fraternity  the image of a more  crumbling carcassonne rises in the mind  and there is no doubt that  forty years ago the place was more affecting  on the other hand  as we  see it to day  it is a wonderful evocation  and if there is a great  deal of new in the old  there is plenty of old in the new  the  repaired crenellations  the inserted patches  of the walls of the  outer circle sufficiently express this commixture     carcassonne dates from the roman occupation of gaul  the place  commanded one of the great roads into spain  and in the fourth century  romans and franks ousted each other from such a point of vantage  in  the year      theodoric  king of the visigoths  superseded both these  parties  and it is during his occupation that the inner enceinte  was raised upon the ruins of the roman fortifications  most of  the visigoth towers that are still erect are seated upon roman  substructions which appear to have been formed hastily  probably  at the moment of the frankish invasion  the authors of these solid  defenses  tho occasionally disturbed  held carcassonne and the  neighboring country  in which they had established their kingdom of  septimania  till the year      when they were expelled by the moors  of spain  who ushered in an unillumined period of four centuries  of  which no traces remain     these facts i derived from a source no more recondite than a  pamphlet by m  viollet le duc  a very luminous description of the  fortifications  which you may buy from the accomplished custodian  the  writer makes a jump to the year       when carcassonne  then forming  part of the realm of the viscounts of beziers and infected by the  albigensian heresy  was besieged  in the name of the pope  by the  terrible simon de montfort and his army of crusaders  simon was  accustomed to success  and the town succumbed in the course of a  fortnight  thirty one years later  having passed into the hands of  the king of france  it was again besieged by the young raymond de  trincavel  the last of the viscounts of beziers  and of this siege m   viollet le duc gives a long and minute account  which the visitor who  has a head for such things may follow  with the brochure in hand  on  the fortifications themselves     the young raymond de trineavel  baffled and repulsed  retired at the  end of twenty four days  saint louis and philip the bold  in the  thirteenth century  multiplied the defenses of carcassonne  which was  one of the bulwarks of their kingdom on the spanish quarter  and from  this time forth  being regarded as impregnable  the place had nothing  to fear  it was not even attacked  and when  in       edward the black  prince marched into it  the inhabitants had opened the gates to the  conqueror before whom all languedoc was prostrate  i am not one of  those who  as i said just now  have a head for such things  and having  extracted these few facts had made all the use of m  viollet le duc s  pamphlet of which i was capable        my obliging friend the  mad lover   of la cite  handed me over to the  doorkeeper of the citadel  i should add that i was at first committed  to the wife of this functionary  a stout peasant woman  who conducted  me to a postern door and ushered me into the presence of her husband     this brilliant  this suggestive warden of carcassonne marched us about  for an hour  haranguing  explaining  illustrating  as he went  it was  a complete little lecture  such as might have been delivered at the  lowell institute  on the manner in which a first rate  place forte   used to be attacked and defended  our peregrinations made it very  clear that carcassonne was impregnable  it is impossible to imagine   without having seen them  such refinements of immurement  such  ingenuities of resistance  we passed along the battlements and   chemins de ronde   ascended and descended towers  crawled under  arches  peered out of loopholes  lowered ourselves into dungeons   halted in all sorts of tight places  while the purpose of something or  other was described to us     it was very curious  very interesting  above all  it was very  pictorial  and involved perpetual peeps into the little crooked   crumbling  sunny  grassy  empty cite  in places  as you stand upon  it  the great towered and embattled enceinte produces an illusion  it  looks as if it were still equipped and defended  one vivid challenge   at any rate  it flings down before you  it calls upon you to make  up your mind on the matter of restoration  for myself  i have no  hesitation  i prefer in every case the ruined  however ruined  to the  reconstructed  however splendid  what is left is more precious than  what is added  the one is history  the other is fiction  and i like  the former the better of the two  it is so much more romantic  one is  positive  so far as it goes  the other fills up the void with things  more dead than the void itself  inasmuch as they have never had life   after that i am free to say that the restoration of carcassonne is a  splendid achievement  the little custodian dismissed us at last   after having  as usual  inducted us into the inevitable repository of  photographs     after leaving it and passing out of the two circles of walls  i  treated myself  in the most infatuated manner  to another walk round  the cite  it is certainly this general impression that is most  striking  the impression from outside  where the whole place detaches  itself at once from the landscape  in the warm southern dusk it looked  more than ever like a city in a fairy tale  to make the thing perfect   a white young moon  in its first quarter  came out and hung just over  the dark silhouette  it was hard to come away  to incommode one s self  for anything so vulgar as a railway train  i would gladly have spent  the evening in revolving round the walls of carcassonne           biarritz a      footnote a  from  castles and chateaux of old navarre   by special  arrangement with  and by permission of  the publishers  l c  page    co  copyright            by francis miltoun      if bayonne is the center of commercial affairs for the basque country   its citizens must  at any rate  go to biarritz if they want to live   the elegant and worldly life   the prosperity and luxury of biarritz  are very recent  it goes back only to the second empire  when it was  but a village of a thousand souls or less  mostly fishermen and women     the railway and the automobile omnibus make communication with bayonne  to day easy  but formerly folk came and went on a donkey side saddled  for two  arranged back to back  like the seats of an irish  jaunting car  if the weight were unequal  a balance was struck by  adding cobblestones on one side or the other  the patient donkey not  minding in the least     this astonishing mode of conveyance was known as a  cacolet   and  replaced the  voitures  and  fiacres  of other resorts  an occasional  example may still be seen  but the  jolies basquaises  who conducted  them have given way to sturdy  barelegged basque boys  as picturesque   perhaps  but not so entrancing to the view  to voyage  en cacolet  was  the necessity of our grandfathers  for us it is an amusement only     napoleon iii   or rather eugenie  his spouse  was the faithful  godfather of biarritz as a resort  the villa eugenie is no more  it  was first transformed into a hotel and later destroyed by fire  but it  was the first of a great battery of villas and hotels which has made  biarritz so great that the popularity of monte carlo is steadily  waning  biarritz threatens to become even more popular  some sixteen  thousand visitors came to biarritz in       but there were thirty odd  thousand in       while the permanent population has risen from        in the days of the second empire to        in       the tiny railway  from bayonne to biarritz transported half a million travelers twenty  years ago  and a million and a half  or nearly that number  in        the rest  being millionaires  or gypsies  came in automobiles or  caravans  these figures tell eloquently of the prosperity of this   villegiature imperiale      the great beauty of biarritz is its setting  at monte carlo  the setting is also beautiful  ravishingly beautiful  but the  architecture  the terrace  monaco s rock  and all the rest combine  to make the pleasing  ensemble   at biarritz the architecture of its  casino and the great hotels is not of an epoch making beauty  neither  are they so delightfully placed  it is the surrounding stage setting  that is so lovely  here the jagged shore line  the blue waves  the  ample horizon seaward  are what make it all so charming     biarritz as a watering place has an all the year round clientele  in  summer the spanish and the french  succeeded in winter by americans   germans  and english  with a sprinkling of russians at all times   biarritz  like pau  aside from being a really delightful winter  resort  where one may escape the rigors of murky november to march in  london  is becoming afflicted with a bad case of  sport fever   there  are all kinds of sports  some of them reputable enough in their place   but the comic opera fox hunting which takes place at pau and biarritz  is not one of them        the picturesque  plage des basques  lies to the south of the town   bordered with high cliffs  which in turn are surmounted with terraces  of villas  the charm of it all is incomparable  to the northwest  stretches the limpid horizon of the bay of biscay  and to the  south the snowy summits of the pyrenees  and the adorable bays of  saint jean de luz and fontarabie  while behind  and to the eastward   lies the quaint country of the basques  and the mountain trails into  spain in all their savage hardiness     the off shore translucent waters of the gulf of gascony were the   sinus aquitanicus  of the ancients  a colossal rampart of rocks and  sand dunes stretches all the way from the gironde to the  bidassoa  without a harbor worthy of the name save at bayonne and  saint jean de luz  here the atlantic waves pound  in time of storm   with all the fury with which they break upon the rocky coasts of  brittany further north  perhaps this would not be so  but for the fact  that the iberian coast to the southward runs almost at right angles  with that of gascony  as it is  while the climate is mild  biarritz  and the other cities on the coasts of the gulf of gascony have a fair  proportion of what sailors  the world over  call  rough weather      the waters of the gascon gulf are not always angry  most frequently  they are calm and blue  vivid with a translucence worthy of those of  capri  and it is this that makes the beach at biarritz one of the most  popular sea bathing resorts in france to day  it is a fashionable  watering place  but it is also  perhaps  the most beautifully disposed  city to be found in all the round of the european coast line  its  slightly curving slope dominated by a background terrace   decorative in itself  but delightfully set off with its fringe of  dwelling houses  hotels  and casinos  ostend is superbly laid out   but it is dreary  monte carlo is beautiful  but it is ultra  while  trouville is constrained and affected  biarritz has the best features  of all these     saint jean de luz had a population of ten thousand  two centuries ago  to day it has three thousand  and most of these  take in boarders  or in one way or another cater to the hordes of  visitors who have made it  or would  if they could have supprest its  quiet basque charm of coloring and character  a little brighton     not all is lost  but four hundred houses were razed in the  mid eighteenth century by a tempest  and the stable population began  to creep away  only with recent years an influx of strangers has  arrived for a week s or a month s stay to take their places  if idling  butterflies of fashion or imaginary invalids can really take the place  of a hardworking  industrious colony of fishermen  who thought no more  of sailing away to the south antarctic or the banks of newfoundland in  an eighty ton whaler than they did of seining sardines from a shallop  in the gulf of gascony at their doors           down the saone to lyons a      footnote a  from  pencillings by the way   published by charles  scribner            by nathaniel parker willis      the saone is about the size of the mohawk  but not half so beautiful   at least for the greater part of its course  indeed  you can hardly  compare american with european rivers  for the charm is of another  description  quite  with us it is nature only  here it is almost  all art  our rivers are lovely  because the outline of the shore is  graceful  and particularly because the vegetation is luxuriant  the  hills are green  the foliage deep and lavish  the rocks grown over  with vines or moss  the mountains in the distance covered with pines  and other forest trees  everything is wild  and nothing looks bare or  sterile  the rivers of france are crowned on every height with ruins   and in the bosom of every valley lies a cluster of picturesque stone  cottages  but the fields are naked  and there are no trees  the  mountains are barren and brown  and everything looks as if the  dwellings had been deserted by the people  and nature had at the same  time gone to decay     i can conceive nothing more melancholy than the views upon the saone   seen  as i saw them  tho vegetation is out everywhere  and the banks  should be beautiful if ever  as we approached lyons the river narrowed  and grew bolder  and the last ten miles were enchanting  naturally the  shores at this part of the saone are exceedingly like the highlands of  the hudson above west point  abrupt hills rise from the river s edge   and the windings are sharp and constant  but imagine the highlands of  the hudson crowned with antique chateaux  and covered to the very top  with terraces and summer houses and hanging gardens  gravel walks and  beds of flowers  instead of wild pines and precipices  and you may get  a very correct idea of the saone above lyons     you emerge from one of the dark passes of the river by a sudden turn   and there before you lies this large city  built on both banks  at  the foot and on the sides of mountains  the bridges are fine  and  the broad  crowded quays  all along the edges of the river  have a  beautiful effect  there is a great deal of magnificence at lyons  in  the way of quays  promenades  and buildings     i was glad to escape  from the lower streets  and climb up the long staircases to the  observatory that overhangs the town  from the base of this elevation  the descent of the river is almost a precipice  the houses hang on the  side of the steep hill  and their doors enter from the long alleys of  stone staircases by which you ascend        it was holy week  and the church of notre dame de fourvieres  which  stands on the summit of the hill  was crowded with people  we went  in for a moment  and sat down on a bench to rest  my companion was a  swiss captain of artillery  who was a passenger in the boat  a very  splendid fellow  with a mustache that he might have tied behind his  ears  he had addrest me at the hotel  and proposed that we should  visit the curiosities of the town together  he was a model of a manly  figure  athletic  and soldier like  and standing near him was to get  the focus of all the dark eyes in the congregation     the new square tower stands at the side of the church  and rises to  the height of perhaps sixty feet  the view from it is said to be one  of the finest in the world  i have seen more extensive ones  but never  one that comprehended more beauty and interest  lyons lies at the  foot  with the saone winding through its bosom in abrupt curves  the  rhone comes down from the north on the other side of the range of  mountains  and meeting the saone in a broad stream below the town   they stretch off to the south  through a diversified landscape  the  alps rise from the east like the edges of a thunder cloud  and the  mountains of savoy fill up the interval to the rhone     all about the foot of the monument lie gardens  of exquisite  cultivation  and above and below the city the villas of the rich   giving you altogether as delicious a nucleus for a broad circle of  scenery as art and nature could create  and one sufficiently in  contrast with the barrenness of the rocky circumference to enhance the  charm  and content you with your position  half way down the hill lies  an old monastery  with a lovely garden walled in from the world     the river was covered with boats  the bells were ringing to church   the glorious old cathedral  so famous for its splendor  stood piled  up  with its arches and gray towers  in the square below  the day was  soft  sunny  and warm  and existence was a blessing  i leaned over the  balustrade  i know not how long  looking down upon the scene about me   and i shall ever remember it as one of those few unalloyed moments   when the press of care was taken off my mind  and the chain of  circumstances was strong enough to set aside both the past and the  future  and leave me to the quiet enjoyment of the present  i have  found such hours  few and far between            lyons a      footnote a  from a letter to his friend west      by thomas gray      i take this opportunity to tell you that we are at the ancient and  celebrated lugdunum  a city situated upon the confluence of the  rhone and saone  arar  i should say  two people  who tho of tempers  extremely unlike  think fit to join hands here  and make a little  party to travel to the mediterranean in company  the lady comes  gliding along through the fruitful plains of burgundy     the  gentleman runs all rough and roaring down from the mountains of  switzerland to meet her  and with all her soft airs she likes him  never the worse  she goes through the middle of the city in state  and  he passes incog  without the walls  but waits for her a little below     the houses here are so high  and the streets so narrow  as would be  sufficient to render lyons the dismalest place in the world  but the  number of people  and the face of commerce diffused about it  are   at least  as sufficient to make it the liveliest  between these two  sufficiencies  you will be in doubt what to think of it  so we shall  leave the city  and proceed to its environs  which are beautiful  beyond expression  it is surrounded with mountains  and those  mountains all bedropped and bespeckled with houses  gardens  and  plantations of the rich bourgeois  who have from thence a prospect of  the city in the vale below on one hand  on the other the rich plains  of the lyonnois  with the rivers winding among them  and the alps   with the mountains of dauphine  to bound the view     all yesterday morning we were busied in climbing up mount fourviere   where the ancient city stood perched at such a height  that nothing  but the hopes of gain could certainly ever persuade their neighbors to  pay them a visit  here are the ruins of the emperors  palaces  that  resided here  that is to say  augustus and severus  they consist in  nothing but great masses of old wall  that have only their quality  to make them respected  in a vineyard of the minims are remains of a  theater  the fathers  whom they belong to  hold them in no esteem at  all  and would have showed us their sacristy and chapel instead of  them  the ursuline nuns have in their garden some roman baths  but we  having the misfortune to be men  they did not think proper to admit  us     hard by are eight arches of a most magnificent aqueduct  said to be  erected by antony  when his legions were quartered here  there are  many other parts of it dispersed up and down the country  for it  brought the water from a river many leagues off in la forez  here are  remains too of agrippa s seven great roads which met at lyons  in some  places they lie twelve feet deep in the ground           marseilles a      footnote a  from  pictures from italy   written in          by charles dickens      so we went on  until eleven at night  when we halted at the town of  aix  within two stages of marseilles  to sleep  the hotel  with all  the blinds and shutters closed to keep the light and heat out  was  comfortable and airy next morning  and the town was very clean  but  so hot  and so intensely light  that when i walked out at noon it was  like coming suddenly from the darkened room into crisp blue fire  the  air was so very clear  that distant hills and rocky points appeared  within an hour s walk  while the town immediately at hand  with a kind  of blue wind between me and it  seemed to be white hot  and to be  throwing off a fiery air from its surface     we left this town toward evening  and took the road to marseilles  a  dusty road it was  the houses shut up close  and the vines powdered  white  at nearly all the cottage doors  women were peeling and slicing  onions into earthen bowls for supper  so they had been doing last  night all the way from avignon  we passed one or two shady dark  chateaux  surrounded by trees  and embellished with cool basins of  water  which were the more refreshing to behold  from the great  scarcity of such residences on the road we had traveled     as we approached marseilles  the road began to be covered with holiday  people  outside the public houses were parties smoking  drinking   playing draughts and cards  and  once  dancing  but dust  dust  dust   everywhere  we went on  through a long  straggling  dirty suburb   thronged with people  having on our left a dreary slope of land  on  which the country houses of the marseilles merchants  always staring  white  are jumbled and heaped without the slightest order  backs   fronts  sides  and gables toward all points of the compass  until  at  last  we entered the town     i was there  twice  or thrice afterward  in fair weather and foul   and i am afraid there is no doubt that it is a dirty and disagreeable  place  but the prospect  from the fortified heights  of the beautiful  mediterranean  with  its lovely rocks and islands  is most delightful   these heights are a desirable retreat  for less picturesque  reasons  as an escape from a compound of vile smells perpetually  arising from a great harbor full of stagnant water  and befouled by  the refuse of innumerable ships with all sorts of cargoes  which  in  hot weather  is dreadful in the last degree     there were foreign sailors  of all nations  in the streets  with red  shirts  blue shirts  buff shirts  tawny shirts  and shirts of orange  color  with red caps  blue caps  green caps  great beards  and no  beards  in turkish turbans  glazed english hats  and neapolitan  headdresses  there were the townspeople sitting in clusters on the  pavement  or airing themselves on the tops of their houses  or walking  up and down the closest and least airy of boulevards  and there were  crowds of fierce looking people of the lower sort  blocking up the  way  constantly     in the very heart of all this stir and uproar  was the common  madhouse  a low  contracted  miserable building  looking straight upon  the street  without the smallest screen or courtyard  where chattering  madmen and mad women were peeping out  through rusty bars  at the  staring faces below  while the sun  darting fiercely aslant into their  little cells  seemed to dry up their brains  and worry them  as if  they were baited by a pack of dogs     we were pretty well accommodated at the hotel du paradis  situated  in a narrow street of very high houses  with a hairdresser s shop  opposite  exhibiting in one of its windows two full length waxen  ladies  twirling around and around  which so enchanted the hairdresser  himself  that he and his family sat in armchairs  and in cool  undresses  on the pavement outside  enjoying the gratification of the  passers by  with lazy dignity  the family had retired to rest when we  went to bed  at midnight  but the hairdresser  a corpulent man  in  drab slippers  was still sitting there  with his legs stretched out  before him  and evidently couldn t bear to have the shutters put up     next day we went down to the harbor  where the sailors of all nations  were discharging and taking in cargoes of all kinds  fruits  wines   oils  silks  stuffs  velvets  and every manner of merchandise  taking  one of a great number of lively little boats with gay striped awnings   we rowed away  under the sterns of great ships  under tow ropes and  cables  against and among other boats  and very much too near  the sides of vessels that were faint with oranges  to the  marie  antoinette   a handsome steamer bound for genoa  lying near the mouth  of the harbor     by and by  the carriage  that unwieldy  trifle from the pantechnicon    on a flat barge  bumping against everything  and giving occasion for  a prodigious quantity of oaths and grimaces  came stupidly alongside   and by five o clock we were steaming out in the open sea  the vessel  was beautifully clean  the meals were served under an awning on deck   the night was calm and clear  the quiet beauty of the sea and sky  unspeakable           the little republic of andorra a      footnote a  from  castles and chateaux of old navarre   by special  arrangement with  and by permission of  the publishers  l c  page    co  copyright            by francis miltoun      the little republic of andorra  hidden away in the fastnesses of the  pyrenees between france and spain  its allegiance divided between the  bishop of urgel in spain and the french government  is a relic of  medievalism which will probably never fall before the swift advance of  twentieth century ideas of progress  at least it will never be overrun  by automobiles     from french or spanish territory this little unknown land is to be  reached by what is called a  wagon way   but the road is so bad that  the sure footed little donkeys of the pyrenees are by far the best  means of locomotion  unless one would go up on foot  a matter of  twenty kilometers or more from hospitalet in spanish or porte in  french territory     the political status of andorra is most peculiar  but since it has  endured without interruption  and this in spite of wars and rumors of  wars   for six centuries  it seems to be all that is necessary     a relic of the middle ages  andorra viella  the city  and its six  thousand inhabitants live in their lonesome retirement much as they  did in feudal times  except for the fact that an occasional newspaper  smuggled in from france or spain gives a new topic of conversation     this paternal governmental arrangement which cares for the welfare of  the people of andorra  the city and the province  is the outcome of a  treaty signed by pierre d urg and roger bernhard  the third comte  de foix  giving each other reciprocal rights  there s nothing very  strange about this  it was common custom in the middle ages for lay  and ecclesiastical seigneurs to make such compacts  but the marvel is  that it has endured so well with governments rising and falling  all about  and grafters and pretenders and dictators ruling every  bailiwick in which they can get a foot hold  feudal government  may have had some bad features  but certainly the republics and  democracies of to day  to say nothing of absolute monarchies  have  some  too     the ways of access between france and andorra are numerous enough   but of the eight only two  and those not all the way  are really  practicable for wheeled traffic  the others are mere trails  or  mule paths     the people of andorra  as might be inferred  are all ardent catholics   and for a tiny country like this to have a religious seminary  as that  at urgel  is remarkable of itself     public instruction is of late making headway  but half a century ago  the shepherd and laboring population  perhaps nine tenths of the  whole  had little learning or indeed need for it  their manners and  customs are simple and severe and little has changed in modern life  from that of their great great great grandfathers  each family has a  sort of a chief or official head  and the eldest son always looks for  a wife among the families of his own class  seldom  if ever  does the  married son quit the paternal roof  so large households are the rule   in a family where there are only girls  the eldest is the heir  and  she may only marry with a cadet of another family by his joining his  name with hers  perhaps it is this that originally set the fashion for  hyphenated names     the andorrans are generally robust and well built  the maladies of  more populous regions are practically unknown among them  this speaks  much for the simple life  costumes and dress are rough and simple and  of heavy woolens  clipt from the sheep and woven on the spot  public  officers  the few representatives of officialdom who exist  alone  make any pretense at following the fashions  the women occupy a very  subordinate position in public affairs  they may not be present at  receptions and functions and not even at mass when it is said by the  bishop  crime is infrequent  and simple  light punishments alone are  inflicted  things are not so uncivilized in andorra as one might  think     in need all men may be called upon to serve as soldiers  and each head  of a family must have a rifle and ball at hand at all times  in other  words  he must be able to protect himself against marauders  this does  away with the necessity of a large standing police force     commerce and industry are free of all taxation in andorra  and customs  dues apply on but few articles  for this reason there is not a very  heavy tax on a people who are mostly cultivators and graziers  there  is little manufacturing industry  as might be supposed  and what is  made  save by hand and in single examples  is of the most simple  character   made in germany  or  tabrique en belgique  are the marks  one sees on most of the common manufactured articles     the andorrans are a simple  proud  gullible people  who live to day in  the past  of the past and for the past   les vallees et souverainetes  de l andorre  are to them to day just what they always were  a little  world of their own           gavarnie a

there are but two resources  to learn a description by heart  or to  make the journey  i have made the journey  and am going to give the  description     we leave at six o clock in the morning  by the road to scia  in the  fog  without seeing at first anything beyond confused forms of trees  and rocks  at the end of a quarter of an hour  we hear along the  pathway a noise of sharp cries drawing near  it was a funeral  procession coming from scia  two men bore a small coffin under a white  shroud  behind came four herdsmen in long cloaks and brown capuchons   silent  with bent heads  four women followed in black mantles  it was  they who uttered those monotonous and piercing lamentations  one knew  not if they were wailing or praying  they walked with long steps  through the cold mist  without stopping or looking at any one  and  were going to bury the poor body in the cemetery at luz     at scia the road passes over a small bridge very high up  which  commands another bridge  gray and abandoned  the double tier of arches  bends gracefully over the blue torrent  meanwhile a pale light already  floats in the diaphanous mist  a golden gauze undulates above the  gave  the aerial veil grows thin and will soon vanish     nothing can convey the idea of this light  so youthful  timid  and  smiling  which glitters like the bluish wings of a dragon fly that is  pursued and is taken captive in a net of fog     beneath  the boiling water is engulfed in a narrow conduit and leaps  like a mill race  the column of foam  thirty feet high  falls with  a furious din  and its glaucous waves  heaped together in the deep  ravine  dash against each other and are broken upon a line of fallen  rocks  other enormous rocks  debris of the same mountain  hang above  the road  their squared heads crowned with brambles for hair  ranged  in impregnable line  they seem to watch the torments of the gave   which their brothers hold beneath themselves crusht and subdued     we turn a second bridge and enter the plain of gedres  verdant and  cultivated  where the hay is in cocks  they are harvesting  our horses  walk between two hedges of hazel  we go along by orchards  but the  mountain is ever near  the guide shows us a rock three times the  height of a man  which  two years ago  rolled down and demolished a  house     we encounter several singular caravans  a band of young priests in  black hats  black gloves  black cassocks tucked up  black stockings   very apparent  novices in horsemanship who bound at every step  like  the gave  a big  jolly  round man  in a sedan chair  his hands crossed  over his belly  who looks on us with a paternal air  and reads his  newspaper  three ladies of sufficiently ripe age  very slender  very  lean  very stiff  who  for dignity s sake  set their beasts on a trot  as we draw near them  the cicisbeo is a bony cartilaginous gentleman   fixt perpendicularly on his saddle like a telegraph pole  we hear  a harsh clucking  as of a choked hen  and we recognize the english  tongue     beyond gedres is a wild valley called chaos  which is well named   after a quarter of an hour s journey there  the trees disappear  then  the juniper and the box  and finally the moss  the gave is no longer  seen  all noises are hushed  it is a dead solitude peopled with  wrecks  the avalanches of rocks and crusht flint have come down from  the summit to the very bottom  the horrid tide  high and a quarter  of a league in length  spreads out like waves its myriads of sterile  stones  and the inclined sheet seems still to glide toward inundating  the gorge  these stones are shattered and pulverized  their living  fractures and thin  harsh points wound the eye  they are still  bruising and crushing each other  not a bush  not a spear of grass   the arid grayish train burns beneath a sun of brass  its debris are  scorched to a dull hue  as in a furnace     a hundred paces further on  the aspect of the valley becomes  formidable  troops of mammoths and mastadons in stone lie crouching  over the eastern declivity  one above another  and heaped up over the  whole slope  these colossal ridges shine with a tawny hue like iron  rust  the most enormous of them drink the water of the river at their  base  they look as if warming their bronzed skin in the sun  and  sleep  turned over  stretched out on their side  resting in all  attitudes  and always gigantic and frightful  their deformed paws are  curled up  their bodies half buried in the earth  their monstrous  backs rest one upon another  when you enter into the midst of the  prodigious band  the horizon disappears  the blocks rise fifty feet  into the air  the road winds painfully among the overhanging masses   men and horses seem but dwarfs  these rusted edges mount in stages to  the very summit  and the dark hanging army seems ready to fall on the  human insects which come to trouble its sleep     once upon a time  the mountain  in a paroxysm of fever  shook its  summits like a cathedral that is falling in  a few points resisted   and their embattled turrets are drawn out in line on the crest  but  their layers are dislocated  their sides creviced  their points  jagged  the whole shattered ridge totters  beneath them the rock fails  suddenly in a living and still bleeding wound  the splinters are lower  down  strewn over the declivity  the tumbled rocks are sustained one  upon another  and man to day passes in safety amidst the disaster     but what a day was that of the ruin  it is not very ancient  perhaps  of the sixth century  and the year of the terrible earthquake told of  by gregory of tours  if a man could without perishing have seen the  summits split  totter and fall  the two seas of rock come bounding  into the gorge  meet one another and grind each other amidst a shower  of sparks  he would have looked upon the grandest spectacle ever seen  by human eyes     on the west  a perpendicular mole  crannied like an old ruin  lifts  itself straight up toward the sky  a leprosy of yellowish moss has  incrusted its pores  and has clothed it all over with a sinister  livery  this livid robe upon this parched stone has a splendid effect   nothing is uglier than the chalky flints that are drawn from the  quarry  just dug up  they seem cold and damp in their whitish shroud   they are not used to the sun  they make a contrast with the rest  but  the rock that has lived in the air for ten thousand years  where the  light has every day laid on and melted its metallic tints  is the  friend of the sun  and carries its mantle upon its shoulders  it  has no need of a garment of verdure  if it suffers from parasitic  vegetations  it sticks them to its sides and imprints them with its  colors  the threatening tones with which it clothes itself suits the  free sky  the naked landscape  the powerful heat that environs it  it  is alive like a plant  only it is of another age  one more severe and  stronger than that in which we vegetate     gavarnie is a very ordinary village  commanding a view of the  amphitheater we are come to see  after you have left it  it is still  necessary to go three miles through a melancholy plain  half buried in  sand by the winter inundations  the waters of the gave are muddy and  dull  a cold wind whistles from the amphitheater  the glaciers  strewn  with mud and stones  are stuck to the declivity like patches of dirty  plaster  the mountains are bald and ravined by cascades  black cones  of scattered firs climb them like routed soldiers  a meager and wan  turf wretchedly clothes their mutilated heads  the horses ford the  gave stumblingly  chilled by the water coming from the snows  in this  wasted solitude you meet  all of a sudden  the most smiling parterre   a throng of the lovely iris crowds itself into the bed of a dried  torrent  the sun stripes with rays of gold their velvety petals of  tender blue  and the eye follows over the whole plain the folds of the  rivulet of flowers     we climb a last eminence  sown with iris and with stones  there is a  hut where you breakfast and leave the horses  you arm yourself with a  stout stick  and descend upon the glaciers of the amphitheater     these glaciers are very ugly  very dirty  very uneven  very slippery   at every step you run the risk of falling  and if you fall  it is on  sharp stones or into deep holes  they look very much like heaps of old  plaster work  and those who have admired them must have a stock of  admiration for sale  the water has pierced them so that you walk  upon bridges of snow  these bridges have the appearance of kitchen  air holes  the water is swallowed up in a very low archway  and  when  you look closely  you get a distinct sight of a black hole     after the glaciers we find a sloping esplanade  we climb for ten  minutes bruising our feet upon fragments of sharp rock  since leaving  the hut we have not lifted our eyes  in order to restore for ourselves  an unbroken sensation  here at last we look     a wall of granite crowned with snow hollows itself before us in a  gigantic amphitheater  this amphitheater is twelve hundred feet high   nearly three miles in circumference  three tiers of perpendicular  walls  and in each tier thousands of steps  the valley ends there  the  wall is a single block and impregnable  the other summits might fall   but its massive layers would not be moved  the mind is overwhelmed  by the idea of a stability that can not be shaken and an assured  eternity  there is the boundary of two countries and two races  this  it is that roland wanted to break  when with a sword stroke he opened  a breach in the summit  but the immense wound disappeared in the  immensity of the unconquered wall  three sheets of snow are spread out  over the three tiers of layers     the sun falls with all its force upon this virginal robe without being  able to make it shine  it preserves its dead whiteness  all this  grandeur is austere  the air is chilled beneath the noonday rays   great  damp shadows creep along the foot of the walls  it is the  everlasting winter and the nakedness of the desert  the sole  inhabitants are the cascades assembled to form the gave  the  streamlets of water come by thousands from the highest layer  leap  from step to step  cross their stripes of foam  unite and fall by a  dozen brooks that slide from the last layer in flaky streaks to lose  themselves in the glaciers of the bottom     the thirteenth cascade on the left is twelve hundred and sixty six  feet high  it falls slowly  like a dropping cloud  or the unfolding of  a muslin veil  the air softens its fall  the eye follows complacently  the graceful undulation of the beautiful airy veil  it glides the  length of the rock  and seems to float rather than to fall  the sun  shines  through its plume  with the softest and loveliest splendor   it reaches the bottom like a bouquet of slender waving feathers  and  springs backward in a silver dust  the fresh and transparent mist  swings about the rock it bathes  and its rebounding train mounts  lightly along the courses  no stir in the air  no noise  no living  creature in the solitude  you hear only the monotonous murmur of the  cascades  resembling the rustle of the leaves that the wind stirs in  the forest     on our return  we seated ourselves at the door of the hut  it is a  poor  squat little house  heavily supported upon thick walls  the  knotty joists of the ceiling retain their bark  it is indeed necessary  that it should be able to stand out alone against the snows of winter   you find everywhere the imprint of the terrible months it has gone  through  two dead fir trees stand erect at the door  the garden  three  feet square  is defended by enormous walls of piled up slates  the low  and black stable leaves neither foot hold nor entry for the winds  a  lean colt was seeking a little grass among the stones  a small bull   with surly air  looked at us out of the sides of his eyes  the  animals  the trees and the site  wore a threatening or melancholy  aspect  but in the clefts of a rock were growing some admirable  buttercups  lustrous and splendid  which looked as if painted by a ray  of sunshine     at the village we met our companions of the journey who had sat down  there  the good tourists get fatigued  stop ordinarily at the inn   take a substantial dinner  have a chair brought to the door  and  digest while looking at the amphitheater  which from there appears  about as high as a house  after this they return  praising the sublime  sight  and very glad that they have come to the pyrenees           vi    belgium          bruges a      footnote a  from  cities of belgium       by grant allen      the rhine constituted the great central waterway of medieval europe   the flemish towns were its ports and its manufacturing centers  they  filled in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries much the same place  that liverpool  glasgow  manchester  and birmingham fill in the  nineteenth  many causes contributed to this result     flanders  half independent under its own counts  occupied a middle  position  geographically and politically  between france and the  empire  it was comparatively free from the disastrous wars which  desolated both these countries  and in particular it largely escaped  the long smouldering quarrel between french and english  which so long  retarded the development of the former  its commercial towns  again   were not exposed on the open sea to the attacks of pirates or hostile  fleets  but were safely ensconced in inland flats  reached by rivers  or canals  almost inaccessible to maritime enemies  similar conditions  elsewhere early ensured peace and prosperity for venice     the canal system of holland and belgium began to be developed as early  as the twelfth century  at first for drainage   and was one leading  cause of the commercial importance of the flemish cities in the  fourteenth  in so flat a country  locks are all but unnecessary  the  two towns which earliest rose to greatness in the belgian area were  thus bruges and ghent  they possest in the highest degree the combined  advantages of easy access to the sea and comparative inland security     bruges  in particular  was one of the chief stations of the hanseatic  league  which formed an essentially commercial alliance for the mutual  protection of the northern trading centers  by the fourteenth century  bruges had thus become in the north what venice was in the south   the capital of commerce  trading companies from all the surrounding  countries had their  factories  in the town  and every european king  or prince of importance kept a resident minister accredited to the  merchant republic     some comprehension of the mercantile condition of europe in general  during the middle ages is necessary in order to understand the early  importance and wealth of the flemish cities  southern europe  and in  particular italy  was then still the seat of all higher civilization   more especially of the trade in manufactured articles and objects of  luxury  florence  venice and genoa ranked as the polished and learned  cities of the world  further east  again  constantinople still  remained in the hands of the greek emperors  or  during the crusades   of their latin rivals  a brisk trade existed via the mediterranean  between europe and india or the nearer east  this double stream of  traffic ran along two main routes  one  by the rhine  from lombardy  and rome  the other  by sea  from venice  genoa  florence   constantinople  the levant  and india     on the other hand  france was still but a half civilized country   with few manufactures and little external trade  while england was an  exporter of raw produce  chiefly wool  like australia in our own time   the hanseatic merchants of cologne held the trade of london  those of  wisby and luebeck governed that of the baltic  bruges  as head of the  hansea  was in close connection with all of these  as well as with  hull  york  novgorod  and bergen     the position of the flemish towns in the fourteenth century was thus  not wholly unlike that of new york  philadelphia  and boston at the  present day  they stood as intermediaries between the older civilized  countries  like italy or the greek empire  and the newer producers of  raw material  like england  north germany  and the baltic towns     in a lost corner of the great lowland flat of flanders  defended from  the sea by an artificial dike  and at the point of intersection of an  intricate network of canals and waterways  there arose in the early  middle ages a trading town  known in flemish as brugge  in french as  bruges  that is to say  the bridge   from a primitive structure that  here crossed the river  a number of bridges now span the sluggish  streams  all of them open in the middle to admit the passage of  shipping     bruges stood originally on a little river  reye  once navigable  now  swallowed by canals  and the reye flowed into the zwin  long silted  up  but then the safest harbor in the low countries  at first the  capital of a petty count  this land locked internal harbor grew in  time to be the venice of the north  and to gather round its quays or  at its haven of damme  the ships and merchandise of all neighboring  peoples  already in      it ranked as the central mart of the  hanseatic league     it was the port of entry for english wool and russian furs  the port  of departure for flemish broadcloths  laces  tapestries  and linens   canals soon connected it with ghent  dunkirk  sluys  furnes and ypres   its nucleus lay in a little knot of buildings about the grand place  and the hotel de ville  stretching out to the cathedral and the dyver   thence it spread on all sides till  in       it filled the whole space  within the existing ramparts  now largely abandoned or given over to  fields and gardens  it was the wealthiest town of europe  outside  italy     the decline of the town was due partly to the break up of the  hanseatic system  partly to the rise of english ports and  manufacturing towns  but still more  and especially as compared with  our flemish cities  to the silting of the zwin  and the want of  adaption in its waterways to the needs of great ships and modern  navigation  the old sea entrance to bruges was through the zwin  by  way of sluys and kadzand  up that channel came the venetian merchant  fleet and the flemish galleys  to the port of damme  by       it  ceased to be navigable for large vessels     the later canal is still open  but as it passes through what is now  dutch territory  it is little used  nor is it adapted to any save  ships of comparatively small burden  another canal  suitable for  craft of     tons  leads through belgian territory to ostend  but few  vessels now navigate it  and those for the most part only for local  trade  the town has shrunk to half its former size  and has only a  quarter of its medieval population     the commercial decay of bruges  however  has preserved its charm for  the artist  the archeologist  and the tourist  its sleepy streets and  unfrequented quays are among the most picturesque sights of bustling  and industrial modern belgium  the great private palaces  indeed   are almost all destroyed  but many public buildings remain  and the  domestic architecture is quaint and pretty     bruges was the mother of arts in flanders  jan van eyck lived here  from      to       memling  probably from      till       caxton  the  first english printer  lived as a merchant at bruges  in the domus  anglorum or english factory  from      to       and probably put in  the press here the earliest english book printed  tho strong grounds  have been adduced in favor of cologne  colard mansion  the great  printer of bruges at that date  was one of the leaders in the art of  typography        the very tall square tower which faces you as you enter the grand  place is the belfry  the center and visible embodiment of the town of  bruges  the grand place itself was the forum and meeting place of the  soldier citizens  who were called to arms by the chimes in the belfry   the center of the place is therefore appropriately occupied by a  colossal statue group  modern  of pieter de coninck and jan breidel   the leaders of the citizens of bruges at the battle of the spurs  before the walls of courtrai in       a conflict which secured the  freedom of flanders from the interference of the kings of france  the  group is by devigne  the reliefs on the pedestal represent scenes from  the battle and its antecedents     the majestic belfry itself represents the first beginnings of freedom  in bruges  leave to erect such a bell tower  both as a mark of  independence and to summon the citizens to arms  was one of the first  privileges which every teutonic trading town desired to wring from its  feudal lord  this brick tower  the pledge of municipal rights  was  begun in       to replace an earlier one of wood  and finished about a  hundred years later  the octagon  in stone at the summit  which holds  the bell  having been erected in             it consists of three stories  the two lower of which are square and  flanked by balconies with turrets  the windows below are of the simple  early gothic style  but show a later type of architecture in the  octagon  the niche in the center contains the virgin and child  a  group restored after being destroyed by the french revolutionists   below it on either side are smaller figures holding escutcheons  from  the balcony between these last  the laws and the rescripts of the  counts were read aloud to the people assembled in the square     the belfry can be ascended by steps  owing to the force of the wind   it leans slightly to the southeast  the view from the top is very  extensive and striking  it embraces the greater part of the plain of  flanders  with its towns and villages  the country  tho quite flat   looks beautiful when thus seen  in early times  however  the look out  from the summit was of practical use for purposes of observation   military or maritime  it commanded the river  the zwin  and the sea  approach by sluys and damme  the course of the various canals  and the  roads to ghent  antwerp  tournai  and courtrai  the belfry contains a  famous set of chimes  the mechanism of which may be inspected by the  visitor  he will have frequent opportunities of hearing the beautiful  and mellow carillon  perhaps to excess  the existing bells date only  from       the mechanism from                a pen picture of bruges a      footnote a  from  the paris sketch book       by william makepeace thackeray      it is the quaintest and prettiest of all the quaint and pretty towns i  have seen  a painter might spend months here  and wander from church  to church  and admire old towers and pinnacles  tall gables  bright  canals  and pretty little patches of green garden and moss grown wall   that reflect in the clear quiet water  before the inn window is a  garden  from which in the early morning issues a most wonderful odor  of stocks and wallflowers  next comes a road with trees of admirable  green  numbers of little children are playing in this road  the place  is so clean that they may roll on it all day without soiling  their pinafores   and on the other side of the trees are little  old fashioned  dumpy  whitewashed  red tiled houses     a poorer landscape to draw never was known  nor a pleasanter to  see  the children especially  who are inordinately fat and rosy  let  it be remembered  too  that here we are out of the country of ugly  women  the expression of the face is almost uniformly gentle and  pleasing  and the figures of the women  wrapt in long black monk like  cloaks and hoods  very picturesque  no wonder there are so many  children  the  guide book   omniscient mr  murray   says there are  fifteen thousand paupers in the town  and we know how such multiply     how the deuce do their children look so fat and rosy  by eating  dirt pies  i suppose  i saw a couple making a very nice savory one   and another employed in gravely sticking strips of stick betwixt the  pebbles at the house door  and so making for herself a stately garden   the men and women don t seem to have much more to do  there are a  couple of tall chimneys at either suburb of the town  where no doubt  manufactories are at work  but within the walls everybody seems  decently idle     we have been  of course  abroad to visit the lions  the tower in the  grand place is very fine  and the bricks of which it is built do not  yield a whit in color to the best stone  the great building round this  tower is very like the pictures of the ducal palace at venice  and  there is a long market area  with columns down the middle  from which  hung shreds of rather lean looking meat  that would do wonders under  the hands of cattermole or haghe     in the tower there is a chime of bells that keep ringing perpetually   they not only play tunes of themselves  and every quarter of an hour   but an individual performs selections from popular operas on them at  certain periods of the morning  afternoon  and evening  i have heard  to day  suoni la tromba    son vergin vezzosa   from the  puritani    and other airs  and very badly they were played too  for such a great  monster as a tower bell can not be expected to imitate madame grisi or  even signor lablache  other churches indulge in the same amusement  so  that one may come here and live in melody all day or night  like the  young woman in moore s  lalla rookh      in the matter of art  the chief attractions of bruges are the pictures  of memling  that are to be seen in the churches  the hospital  and the  picture gallery of the place  there are no more pictures of rubens to  be seen  and  indeed  in the course of a fortnight  one has had quite  enough of the great man and his magnificent  swaggering canvases   what a difference is here with simple memling and the extraordinary  creations of his pencil  the hospital is particularly rich in them   and the legend there is that the painter  who had served charles the  bold in his war against the swiss  and his last battle and defeat   wandered back wounded and penniless to bruges  and here found cure and  shelter     this hospital is a noble and curious sight  the great hall is almost  as it was in the twelfth century  it is spanned by saxon arches  and  lighted by a multiplicity of gothic windows of all sizes  it is very  lofty  clean  and perfectly well ventilated  a screen runs across the  middle of the room  to divide the male from the female patients  and  we were taken to examine each ward  where the poor people seemed  happier than possibly they would have been in health and starvation  without it     great yellow blankets were on the iron beds  the linen was  scrupulously clean  glittering pewter jugs and goblets stood by the  side of each patient  and they were provided with godly books  to  judge from the building   in which several were reading at leisure   honest old comfortable nuns  in queer dresses of blue  black  white   and flannel  were bustling through the room  attending to the wants  of the sick  i saw about a dozen of these kind women s faces  one was  young   all were healthy and cheerful  one came with bare blue arms  and a great pile of linen from an out house  such a grange as cedric  the saxon might have given to a guest for the night  a couple were in  a laboratory  a tall  bright  clean room      years old at least      we saw you were not very religious   said one of the old ladies  with  a red  wrinkled  good humored face   by your behavior yesterday in  chapel      and yet we did not laugh and talk as we used at college  but were  profoundly affected by the scene that we saw there  it was a fete day   a work of mozart was sung in the evening  not well sung  and yet so  exquisitely tender and melodious  that it brought tears into our eyes   there were not above twenty people in the church  all  save three or  four  were women in long black cloaks  i took them for nuns at first   they were  however  the common people of the town  very poor indeed   doubtless  for the priest s box that was brought round was not  added to by most of them  and their contributions were but two cent  pieces  five of these go to a penny  but we know the value of such   and can tell the exact worth of a poor woman s mite     the box bearer did not seem at first willing to accept our  donation  we were strangers and heretics  however  i held out my hand   and he came perforce as it were  indeed it had only a franc in it  but   que voulez vous   i had been drinking a bottle of rhine wine that  day  and how was i to afford more  the rhine wine is dear in this  country  and costs four francs a bottle     well  the service proceeded  twenty poor women  two englishmen  four  ragged beggars  cowering on the steps  and there was the priest at the  altar  in a great robe of gold and damask  two little boys in white  surplices serving him  holding his robe as he rose and bowed  and the  money gatherer swinging his censer  and filling the little chapel with  smoke     the music pealed with wonderful sweetness  you could see the prim  white heads of the nuns in their gallery  the evening light streamed  down upon old statues of saints and carved brown stalls  and lighted  up the head of the golden haired magdalen in a picture of the  entombment of christ  over the gallery  and  as it were  a kind  protectress to the poor below  stood the statue of the virgin           ghent a      footnote a  from  cities of belgium       by grant allen      flanders owes everything to its water communications  at the junction  of the schelde with the lys and lei  there grew up in the very early  middle ages a trading town  named gent in flemish  and gand in french   but commonly anglicized as ghent  it lay on a close network of rivers  and canals  formed partly by these two main streams  and partly by the  minor channels of the lieve and the moere  which together intersect it  into several islands     such a tangle of inland waterways  giving access to the sea and to  bruges  courtrai  and tournai  as well as less directly to antwerp  and brussels  ensured the rising town in early times considerable  importance  it formed the center of a radiating commerce  westward   its main relations were with london and english wool ports  eastward  with cologne  maastricht  the rhine towns  and italy     ghent was always the capital of east flanders  as bruges or ypres were  of the western province  and after the counts lost possession of  arras and artois  it became in the thirteenth century their principal  residence and the metropolis of the country        early in the fourteenth century  the burghers of ghent  under their  democratic chief  jacob or jacques van artevelde  attained practical  independence  till       the counts and people of flanders had been  united in their resistance to the claims of france  but with the  accession of count louis of nevers  the aspect of affairs changed   louis was french by education  sympathies  and interests  and  artistocratic by nature  he sought to curtail the liberties of the  flemish towns  and to make himself despotic  the wealthy and populous  burgher republics resisted and in      van artevelde was appointed  captain of ghent  louis fled to france and asked the aid of philip of  valois     thereupon  van artevelde made himself the ally of edward iii  of  england  then beginning his war with france  but as the flemings did  not like entirely to cast off their allegiance  a thing repugnant to  medieval sentiment  van artevelde persuaded edward to put forward his  trumped up claim to the crown of france  and thus induced the towns  to transfer their fealty from philip to his english rival  it was  therefore in his character as king of france that edward came to  flanders  the alliance thus formed between the great producer of raw  wool  england  and the great manufacturer of woolen goods  ghent   proved of immense importance to both parties     but as count louis sided with philip of valois  the breach between the  democracy of ghent and its nominal soverign now became impassable  van  artevelde held supreme power in ghent and flanders for nine years  the  golden age of flemish commerce  and was treated on equal terms by  edward  who stopt at ghent as his guest for considerable periods  but  he was opposed by a portion of the citizens  and his suggestion that  the black prince  son of edward iii   should be elected count  of flanders  proved so unpopular with his enemies that he was  assassinated by one of them  gerald denys  the town and states  immediately repudiated the murder  and the alliance which van  artevelde had brought about still continued  it had far reaching  results  the woolen industry was introduced by edward into the eastern  counties of england  and ghent had risen meanwhile to be the chief  manufacturing city of europe     the quarrel between the democratic weavers and their exiled counts  was still carried on by philip van artevelde  the son of jacques  and  godson of queen philippa of england  herself a hainaulter  under his  rule  the town continued to increase in wealth and population  but  the general tendency of later medieval europe toward centralized  despotisms as against urban republics was too strong in the end for  free ghent  in       philip was appointed dictator by the democratic  party  in the war against the count  son of his father s opponent   whom he repelled with great slaughter in a battle near bruges     he then made himself regent of flanders  but count louis obtained  the aid of charles vi  of france  and defeated and killed philip van  artevelde at the disastrous battle of roosebeke in       that was  practically the end of local freedom in flanders  tho the cities  continued to revolt against their sovereigns from time to time  they  were obliged to submit for the most part to their count and to the  burgundian princes who inherited from him by marriage     the subsequent history of ghent is that of the capital of the  burgundian dukes  and of the house of austria  here the german king   maximilian  afterward emperor  married mary of burgundy  the heiress  of the netherlands  and here charles v  was born in the palace of  the counts  it was his principal residence  and he was essentially a  fleming        the real interest of the cathedral centers  not in st  bavon  nor in  his picture by rubens  but in the great polyptych of the adoration  of the lamb  the masterpiece of jan van eyck and his brother hubert   which forms in a certain sense the point of departure for the native  art of the netherlands        stand before the west front at a little distance  to examine the  simple but massive architecture of the tower and facade  the great  portal has been robbed of the statues which once adorned its niches   three have been  restored   they represent  center  the savior  at the  left  the patron  st  bavon  recognizable by his falcon  his sword as  duke  and his book as monk  he wears armor  with a ducal robe and cap  above it  at the right  st  john the baptist  the earlier patron     then  walk to the right  round the south side  to observe the external  architecture of the nave  aisles and choir  the latter has the  characteristic rounded or apsidal termination of continental gothic   whereas english gothic usually has a square end  enter by the south  portal     the interior  with single aisles and short transepts  early gothic   is striking for its simple dignity  its massive pillars  and its high  arches  tho the undeniably noble effect of the whole is somewhat  marred to english eyes by the unusual appearance of the unadorned  brick walls and vaulting  the pulpit  by delvaux         partly in  oak  partly in marble  represents truth revealing the christian faith  to astonished paganism  figured as an old and outworn man  it is a  model of all that should be avoided in plastic or religious art   the screen which separates the choir from the transepts is equally  unfortunate  the apsidal end of the choir  however  with its fine  modern stained glass  forms a very pleasing feature in the general  coup d oeil        the sixth chapel  of the vydts family  contains the famous altar piece  of the adoration of the lamb  by hubert and jan van eyck  to study  which is the chief object of a visit to ghent  see it more than once   and examine it carefully  ask the sacristan to let you sit before it  for some time in quiet or he will hurry you on  you must observe it in  close detail  taking it in its entirety  then  the altar piece  when  opened  is a great mystical poem of the eucharist and the sacrifice of  the lamb  with the christian folk  both church and world  adoring  the  composition contains over     figures  many of them  which i have  not here identified  can be detected by a closer inspection  which   however  i will leave to the reader     now  ask the sacristan to shut the wings  they are painted on the  outer side  all a copy  mainly in grisaille  or in very low tones  of color  as is usual in such cases  so as to allow the jewel like  brilliancy of the internal picture to burst upon the observer the  moment the altar piece is opened     old ghent occupied for the most part the island which extends from the  palais de justice on one side to the botanical gardens on the other   this island  bounded by the lys  the schelde  and an ancient canal   includes almost all the principal buildings of the town  such as the  cathedral  st  nicholas  the hotel de ville  the belfry  and st   jacques  as well as the chief places  such as the marche aux grains   the marche aux herbes  and the marche du vendredi  it also extends  beyond the lys to the little island on which is situated the church of  st  michael  and again to the islet formed between the lieve and the  lys  which contains the chateau of the counts and the palace ste   pharailde     in the later middle ages  however  the town had spread to nearly its  existing extreme dimensions  and was probably more populous than at  the present moment  but its ancient fortifications have been destroyed  and their place has been taken by boulevards and canals  the line  may still be traced on the map  or walked round through a series of  shipping suburbs  but it is uninteresting to follow  a great part of  its course lying through the more squalid portions of the town   the only remaining gate is that known as the rabot         a very  interesting and picturesque object situated in a particularly slummy  quarter     bruges is full of memories of the burgundian princes  at ghent it is  the personality of charles v   the great emperor who cumulated in his  own person the sovereignties of germany  the low countries  spain and  burgundy  that meets us afresh at every turn  he was born here in       and baptized in a font  otherwise uninteresting  which still stands in  the north transept of the cathedral  ghent was really  for the greater  part of his life  his practical capital  and he never ceased to be at  heart a ghenter     that did not prevent the citizens from unjustly rebelling against him  in       after the suppression of which revolt charles is said to have  ascended the cathedral tower  while the executioner was putting to  death the ringleaders in the rebellion  in order to choose with his  brother ferdinand the site for the citadel he intended to erect  to  overawe the freedom loving city  he chose the monastery of st  bavon  as its site  and  as we have seen  built there his colossal fortress   now wholly demolished  the palace in which he was born and which he  inhabited frequently during life  was known as the cour du prince  it  stood near the ancient grand beguinage  but only its name now survives  in that of a street           brussels a      footnote a  from  the belgians at home   published by little  brown    co      by clive holland      the great commercial and material prosperity of the place dates from  the commencement of the rule of the house of burgundy  it was then   in the fifteenth century  that the most beautiful of its many fine  buildings were erected  the church of st  michael and st  gudule has  its great nave and towers dating from this period  the hotel de ville   notre dame du sablon  the nassau palace  the palace of the dukes of  brabant  and many other buildings were commenced then  manufactures  and commerce commenced to flourish  while the liberties of the  municipality were extended considerably     it was undoubtedly under the rule of charles v  that brussels reached  its zenith of ancient prosperity  then  with the era of philip ii  of  spain  came a long period of bloodshed  persecution  and misery  the  religious disputes and troubles afflicting the netherlands had their  effect upon the life  prosperity  and happiness of the bruxellois  the  whole country was running with blood  and ruin stalked through the  land  but during this tragic period of netherlands  history brussels  saw several glorious events  and did as a city more than one noble  deed  it was in brussels that the compromise of the nobles took place   after which those who were rebelling against the cruelties of the  inquisition were given the name of  gueux   which had been bestowed  upon them contemptuously by the comte de barlaimont     it was  brussels which led the revolt against the most bloodthirsty of the  rulers sent to the netherlands by spain  the duke of alva  and  successfully resisted the imposition of the notorious  twentieth  denier  tax which it was sought to impose upon it  a tax which led  ultimately to the revolt of the whole of the belgian provinces     certainly this ancient capital of the province of brabant  containing  nowadays with its suburbs a population of upward of          which has  quadrupled in sixty years  has come to take its place among the most  beautiful and charming capital cities of europe  it is undoubtedly  healthy  and there is an engaging air about brussels which soon  impresses itself upon the foreign visitor  added to all its many  attractions of interesting museums  the homes of wonderful and in  some cases unrivaled collections of works of art  and of historical  associations with the past  it possesses the charm of being modern in  the best sense and of being a place where one may find much that is  finest in art and music  as a home of fashion it bids fair some day  to rival paris herself  and the shops of the montagne de la cour   boulevard anspach  and contiguous streets are scarcely less luxurious  or exclusive than those of the rue de la paix or boulevard des  italiens in the french capital  brussels is a city of shady  boulevards  open spaces  and pleasant parks as is paris  and the  beautiful bois de la cambre on its outskirts compares very favorably  with the world renowned bois de boulogne as regards rural charm and  picturesqueness     one impression that brussels is almost certain to make upon the  visitor is its compactness  its population  including the outskirts   is nowadays rather over          but it is almost impossible to  realize that nearly one eleventh of the whole population of belgium  is concentrated in this one city  or  as might be said  in greater  brussels  perhaps the real reason of this apparent lack of size  is because there are in reality two cities  brussels interior and  brussels exterior  the one with a population of about          the  latter with one of about          it is with the former  of course   that the tourist and casual visitor are chiefly concerned     the outlying suburbs are  however  connected with the city proper by a  splendid system of steam  electric  and other trams  in fact  it may  be said that brussels is in a sense surrounded by a group of small  towns  which tho forming part of the great city are yet independent   and are governed very much like the various boroughs which make up  greater london  curhegem  st  gilles  ixelles  st  josse  ten noodle   molenbeek  st  jean  and schaerbeek  still further out  are all in a  sense separate towns  seldom visited by  and indeed almost unknown to  the tourist     the most fashionable quarters for residences of the wealthy classes  are the broad and beautiful avenue louise and the streets and avenues  of the quartier leopold  they in a sense correspond to the avenue du  bois de boulogne  avenue des champs elysees  and boulevard st  germain  of paris  there is another feature  too  that modern brussels has in  common with paris of the immediate past and of to day  it is being   haussmannized   and the older and more quaint and interesting  portions of the city  as has been and is the case in paris  are  gradually but surely disappearing to make way for the onward march of  progress and expansion  almost on every hand  and especially in the  porte de namur quarter  old buildings are constantly falling victims  to the house wrecker  and new  in the shape of handsome mansions and  lofty blocks of flats  are arising from their ashes     the last thirty  even twenty  years have seen many changes  during  that period the sluggish little river senne  which once meandered  through the city  and upon whose banks stood many fine and picturesque  old houses and buildings of past ages  has been arched over  and the  fine boulevard of the same name  and those of hainaut and anspach   have been built above its imprisoned waters  the higher portions of  the city are undeniably healthy  and the climate of brussels is less  subject to extreme changes than that of paris  it is not unbearably  cold in winter  and tho hot in summer  is not so  we think  airless  as either paris or london  a fact accounted for by reason of its many  open spaces  its height above sea level  and comparative nearness to  the north sea     of its fine buildings  none excels the hotel de ville  which is  certainly one of the most interesting and beautiful buildings of its  kind in belgium  it is well placed on one of the finest medieval  squares in europe  and is surrounded by quaint and historic houses  on  this grande place many tragedies have from time to time been enacted   and some of the most ferocious acts of the inhuman alva performed   in the spring of the terrible year        no less than twenty five  flemish nobles were executed here  and in the june of the same year  the patriots lamoral  count egmont  philip de montmorency  and count  hoorn were put to death  this atrocious deed is commemorated by a  fountain with statues of the heroes  placed in front of the maison  du roi  from a window of which the duke of alva watched his orders  carried out     this most beautiful hotel de ville  with its late gothic facade  approaching the renaissance period  nearly     feet in length  was  commenced  according to a well known authority  either in      or        the eastern wing  or left hand portion as one faces it across  the place  having been the first part to be commenced  the western  half of the facade not having been begun until       the later  additions formed the quadrangle     the cathedral at brussels is dedicated jointly to ste  gudule and st   michael  the former is one of the luckiest saints in that respect  as  probably but for this dedication  she would have remained among the  many rather obscure saints of the early periods of christianity     it is to this church that most visitors to brussels first wend their  way after visiting the grande place and its delightful flower market   which is gay with blossoms on most days of the week all the year  round  the natural situation of the church is a fine one  which was  made the most of by its architects and builders of long ago  standing   as it does  on the side of a hill reached from the grande place by the  fine rue de la montagne and short  steep rue ste  gudule  it overlooks  the city with its two fine twin western towers dominating the  neighboring streets  these towers have appeared to us when viewed up  the rue ste  gudule and other streets leading up from the lower town  to the church  generally to be veiled by a mystic gray or ambient  haze  and to gain much in impressiveness and grandeur from the coup  d oeil one obtains of them framed  as it were  in the end of the  rising street           waterloo a      footnote a  from  les miserables   translated by lascelles wraxall      by victor hugo      the battle of waterloo is an enigma as obscure for those who gained  it as for him who lost it  to napoleon it is a panic  bluecher sees  nothing in it but fire  wellington does not understand it at all   look at the reports  the bulletins are confused  the commentaries are  entangled  the latter stammer  the former stutter     jomini divides the battle of waterloo into four moments  muffing cuts  it into three acts  charras  altho we do not entirely agree with him  in all his appreciations  has alone caught with his haughty eye  the characteristic lineaments of this catastrophe of human genius  contending with divine chance  all the other historians suffer from a  certain bedazzlement in which they grope about  it was a flashing day   in truth the overthrow of the military monarchy which  to the great  stupor of the kings  has dragged down all kingdoms  the downfall of  strength and the rout of war        in this event  which bears the stamp of superhuman necessity  men play  but a small part  but if we take waterloo from wellington and bluecher   does that deprive england and germany of anything  no  neither  illustrious england nor august germany is in question in the problem  of waterloo  for  thank heaven  nations are great without the mournful  achievements of the sword  neither germany  nor england  nor france  is held in a scabbard  at this day when waterloo is only a clash of  sabers  germany has goethe above bluecher  and england has byron above  wellington  a mighty dawn of ideas is peculiar to our age  and in this  dawn england and germany have their own magnificent flash  they are  majestic because they think  the high level they bring to civilization  is intrinsic to them  it comes from themselves  and not from an  accident  any aggrandizement the nineteenth century may have can not  boast of waterloo as its fountainhead  for only barbarous nations  grow suddenly after a victory  it is the transient vanity of torrents  swollen by a storm  civilized nations  especially at the present day   are not elevated or debased by the good or evil fortune of a captain   and their specific weight in the human family results from something  more than a battle  their honor  dignity  enlightenment  and genius  are not numbers which those gamblers  heroes and conquerors  can  stake in the lottery of battles  very often a battle lost is progress  gained  and less of glory  more of liberty  the drummer is silent and  reason speaks  it is the game of who loses wins  let us  then  speak  of waterloo coldly from both sides  and render to chance the things  that belong to chance  and to god what is god s  what is waterloo  a  victory  no  a prize in the lottery  won by europe  and paid by  france  it was hardly worth while erecting a lion for it     waterloo is the strangest encounter recorded in history  napoleon  and wellington are not enemies  but contraries  never did god  who  delights in antitheses  produce a more striking contrast  or a more  extraordinary confrontation  on one side precision  foresight   geometry  prudence  a retreat assured  reserves prepared  an obstinate  coolness  an imperturbable method  strategy profiting by the ground   tactics balancing battalions  carnage measured by a plumb line  war  regulated watch in hand  nothing left voluntarily to accident  old  classic courage and absolute correctness     on the other side we have intuition  divination  military strangeness   superhuman instinct  a flashing glance  something that gazes like the  eagle and strikes like lightning  all the mysteries of a profound  mind  associated with destiny  the river  the plain  the forest  and  the hill summoned  and  to some extent  compelled to obey  the despot  going so far as even to tyrannize over the battlefield  faith in a  star  blended with a strategic science  heightening  but troubling it     wellington was the bareme of war  napoleon was its michelangelo  and  this true genius was conquered by calculation  on both sides somebody  was expected  and it was the exact calculator who succeeded  napoleon  waited for grouchy  who did not come  wellington waited for bluecher   and he came     wellington is the classical war taking its revenge  bonaparte  in his  dawn  had met it in italy  and superbly defeated it  the old owl  fled before the young vulture  the old tactics had been not only  overthrown  but scandalized  who was this corsican of six and twenty  years of age  what meant this splendid ignoramus  who  having  everything against him  nothing for him  without provisions   ammunition  guns  shoes  almost without an army  with a handful of  men against masses  dashed at allied europe  and absurdly gained  impossible victories  who was this new comet of war who possest the  effrontery of a planet     the academic military school excommunicated him  while bolting  and  hence arose an implacable rancor of the old caesarism against the new   of the old saber against the flashing sword  and of the chessboard  against genius  on june           this rancor got the best  and  beneath lodi  montebello  montenotte  mantua  marengo  and arcola  it  wrote  waterloo  it was a triumph of mediocrity  sweet to majorities   and destiny consented to this irony  in his decline  napoleon found  a young suvarov before him  in fact  it is only necessary to blanch  wellington s hair in order to have a suvarov  waterloo is a battle of  the first class  gained by a captain of the second     what must be admired in the battle of waterloo is england  the english  firmness  the english resolution  the english blood  and what england  had really superb in it  is  without offense  herself  it is not her  captain  but her army  wellington  strangely ungrateful  declares in  his dispatch to lord bathurst that his army  the one which fought on  june           was a  detestable army      what does the gloomy pile of bones buried in the trenches of waterloo  think of this  england has been too modest to herself in her treatment  of wellington  for making him so great is making herself small   wellington is merely a hero  like any other man  the scots grays  the  life guards  maitland s and mitchell s regiments  pack s and kempt s  infantry  ponsonby s and somerset s cavalry  the highlanders playing  the bagpipes under the shower of canister  ryland s battalions  the  fresh recruits who could hardly manage a musket  and yet held their  ground against the old bands of essling and rivoli  all this is grand     wellington was tenacious  that was his merit  and we do not deny it  to him  but the lowest of his privates and his troopers was quite as  solid as he  and the iron soldier is as good as the iron duke  for our  part  all our glorification is offered to the english soldier  the  english army  the english nation  and if there must be a trophy  it  is to england that this trophy is owing  the waterloo column would be  more just  if  instead of the figure of a man  it raised to the clouds  the statue of a people        but this great england will be irritated by what we are writing here   for she still has feudal illusions  after her      and the french        this people believes in inheritance and hierarchy  and while no  other excels it in power and glory  it esteems itself as a nation and  not as a people  as a people  it readily subordinates itself  and  takes a lord as its head  the workman lets himself be despised  the  soldier puts up with flogging  it will be remembered that  at the  battle of inkerman  a sergeant who  as it appears  saved the british  army  could not be mentioned by lord raglan  because the military  hierarchy does not allow any hero below the rank of officer to be  mentioned in dispatches  what we admire before all  in an encounter  like waterloo  is the prodigious skill of chance  the night raid   the wall of hougoumont  the hollow way of ohain  grouchy deaf to the  cannon  napoleon s guide deceiving him  bulow s guide enlightening  him  all this cataclysm is marvelously managed     there is more of a massacre than of a battle in waterloo  waterloo  of  all pitched battles  is the one which had the smallest front for  such a number of combatants  napoleon s three quarters of a league   wellington s half a league  and seventy two thousand combatants  on either side  from this density came the carnage  the following  calculation has been made and proportion established  loss of men  at  austerlitz  french  fourteen per cent   russian  thirty per cent    austrian  forty four per cent   at wagram  french  thirteen per cent    austrian  fourteen per cent   at moscow  french  thirty seven per  cent   russian  forty four per cent   at bautzen  french  thirteen  cent   russian and prussian  fourteen per cent   at waterloo  french   fifty six per cent   allies  thirty one per cent   total for waterloo   forty one per cent   or out of one hundred and forty four thousand  fighting men  sixty thousand killed     the field of waterloo has at the present day that calmness which  belongs to the earth  and resembles all plains  but at night  a sort  of a visionary mist rises from it  and if any traveler walk about it   and listen and dream  like virgil on the mournful plain of philippi   the hallucination of the catastrophe seizes upon him  the frightful  june   th lives again  the false monumental hill is leveled  the  wondrous lion is dissipated  the battlefield resumes its reality   lines of infantry undulate on the plain  furious galloping crosses the  horizon  the startled dreamer sees the flash of sabers  the sparkle  of bayonets  the red lights of shells  the monstrous collision of  thunderbolts  he hears like a death groan from the tomb  the vague  clamor of the fantom battle     these shadows are grenadiers  these flashes are cuirassiers  this  skeleton is napoleon  this skeleton is wellington  all this is  non existent  and yet still combats  and the ravines are stained  purple  and the trees rustle  and there is fury even in the clouds  and in the darkness  while all the stern heights  mont st  jean   hougoumont  frischemont  papelotte  and plancenoit  seem confusedly  crowned by hosts of specters exterminating one another           waterloo  a visit to the field a      footnote a  from  two months abroad   privately printed            by the editor      the french wished to call it the battle of mont st  jean  but  wellington said  the battle of waterloo   the victor s wish prevailed   i know not why  except because he was the victor  the scene of the  battle is four miles from the village of waterloo and  besides mont  st  jean  several villages from any one of which it might well have  been named  are included in the field  before the battle  however  the  village of waterloo had been the headquarters of the duke and there he  rested for two days after the battle was won     i am now on this memorable spot as the solitary guest of a small hotel  at the base of the lion s mound  after having made a night of it in  crossing from aix la chapelle to brussels and thence  through a storm  of mist and rain to the little station of braine l alleud  which is a  good mile from the battlefield  the train reached braine l alleud long  before daybreak  when the morn had really dawned  i left the  little waiting room  a solitary loiterer  and set out to find the  battleground  from the platform of the station the eye surveyed a  wide  thickly populated but rural plain  and in one direction afar  off  clearly set against the dark rain dripping sky  rose in solemn  majesty a mound of earth  bearing on its lofty summit an indistinct  figure of a lion     a small rustic gate from the station led in the direction of the  mound  from necessity  i began a tramp through the rain alone  no  conveyance being obtainable  the soil of belgium here being alluvial   a little rain soon makes a great deal of mud and little rains at this  season  january  are frequent  along a small unpaved mud deep road   having meanwhile been joined by a peasant with a two wheeled cart  drawn by a single mule  i was soon hastening onward toward the mound  which was growing more and more visible on the horizon  the road soon  turned away  however  but a path led toward the mound  the peasant  took the road and i the path  which led into a little clump of houses   where were boys about their morning duties  and dogs that barked  vigorously until one of the boys to whom i had spoken silenced them     passing onward through streets not more than six feet wide  along  neatly trimmed hedges and past small cottage doorways  i soon entered  an open plain  but in a crippled state with heavy mud covered shoes   mud fairly obliterated all trace of leather  with this burden  and wet  to the skin with rain  there rose far ahead of me that historic mound   and at last i stood at its base alone  there in the midst of one of  the greatest battlefields history records  soon to forget in the  momentary joys of a beefsteak breakfast that man had ever done  anything in this world except eat and drink     i must borrow an illustration  victor hugo s letter a  the apex is  mount st  jean  the right hand base la belle alliance  the left hand  base hougoumont  the cross bar that sunken road which perhaps changed  the future of europe  the two sides broad belgian roads  paved with  square stones and bordered with graceful and lofty poplar trees  their  proud heads waving in every breeze that drifts across this undulating  plain  the lion s mound is just below the middle of this cross bar   mont st  jean  la belle alliance and hougoumont  at the three angles  of the triangle  are small villages  scarcely more than hamlets  all  were important points in the fortunes of that memorable   th of june         hougoumont  with its chateau and wall  in some sense was like a  fortress     go with me if you will in imagination to the summit of the lion s  mound  a flight of     stone steps will take us there  a toilsome  ascent in this chilling air and this persistent rain  toward mont  st  jean  the surface of the ground is rolling  the waves of it high  enough to conceal standing men from view  except the lofty poplars at  the road sides  there are no trees  an admirable place for an army on  the defensive  you will at once say  since reserves can be concealed  behind the convolutions of the rolling plain  these convolutions may  also serve in the fight as natural fortifications     here at mont st  jean  wellington pitched his tent  hougoumont lay far  off in front of his center  and had that morning a small garrison   napoleon  with his army  was a mile away  his line extending to the  right and left beyond la belle alliance  we must turn squarely around  as we stand alongside the lion if we are to see in the distance the  ground he occupied  our place is nearly in the center of the field   hougoumont we realize to have been worthy of the prodigious struggle  the french made to capture it  half a fortress then  it provided  an admirable stand for artillery  a few men might hold it against  superior numbers     at waterloo the duke had about        men  some accounts say          but many  perhaps         fled in desertion at an early hour  of the day  with these figures correct  the fighting forces of the  allies later in the day  would remain little more than        men  the  emperor s army has usually been placed at         his soldiers were  probably better trained than the duke s and combined with long service  an abundance of enthusiasm for their old general  now restored to his  imperial throne and confident of victory     the night before the battle had been wet and stormy  but the morning  gave some promise of clearing  the sky  however  remained overcast and  some rain continued to fall  the french were weary after a long march   and the artillery moved with difficulty across this wet and muddy  plain  altogether they were in poor condition for a battle  in which  all their fortunes were at stake  it was just such a morning as ours   except that it was then june and is now january  if the battle began  at   o clock  as one account reads  we are here on the lion s mound at  that same hour  even if this be january  daisies are in blossom at our  feet     jerome bonaparte  leading the attack  moves on hougoumont  where the  allies  who have come down from mont st  jean  repulse him  he renews  the attack  with redoubled fury   and a gallant resistance is made   but he forces a way into the outer enclosure of the chateau that  crowns the hill  british howitzers are at once discharged upon the  french and compel them to retreat  new assaults are then made   overwhelming numbers seem to bear down upon the allies  the stronghold  is more than once nearly lost  but it is defended with  prodigies of  valor  and firmly held to the last  had hougoumont been taken  the  result of the battle  would probably have been very different      meanwhile  the emperor has ordered a second attack elsewhere  this  time against the left wing of wellington  marshal ney sends forward  six divisions  who encounter the netherlandish troops and easily  scatter them  two brigades of british numbering       men then prepare  to check the advancing french  a struggle  brief but fierce  ensues   in which the french are repulsed  they rally again  however  and  scotch highlanders  their bagpipes sounding the cry  advance against  them  along with an english brigade  these make an impetuous assault   while cavalry charge napoleon s infantry  and force a part of them  back on la belle alliance  but here the pursuing british meet with a  check in a scene of wild carnage that sweeps over the field     we may look down upon the scene of that frightful struggle  it lies  just below us  grass is growing there luxuriantly now  a north wind  sweeps over the plain  a mournful requiem seems to whistle through the  poplar trees     if we look toward hougoumont  french gunners are seen to have been  slain  many cannon are silent  with the chateau in flames  confusion  reigns  napoleon  ordering a new cavalry attack  directs jerome to  advance with his infantry  immediately the allies discharge grape  and canister on the advancing host  but no frenchman wavers  on the  contrary  the french cavalry capture wellington s outward battalion  and press onward toward his hollow squares of infantry  all efforts to  break these squares end in failure  for a time the french abandon the  attack  but only to renew it and then follows a remarkable scene  the  french charge with unprecedented fury  and the squares are partially  broken  while friends and enemies  wounded or killed  are mingled in  inextricable confusion     some of the belgian troops take flight and in mad terror run back to  brussels  causing great consternation there by reporting a defeat for  wellington  the squares maintain their ground to the end admirably   and with severe losses the french retire  hougoumont near by  all this  time was not silent  the attack being continued  the commander is  killed and at last its heights are gained  from elsewhere in the  field  wellington learns of his loss  places himself at the head of a  brigade  and commands it to charge  amid the utmost enthusiasm of the  allies the french are driven back from hougoumont     napoleon now turns his efforts against la haye sainte  a small height  forward from mont st  jean  occupied by the enemy s left wing  ney   in a furious cannonade  begins the attack  in which the allies are  overwhelmed and their ammunition is exhausted  masters of this point   the french again move on hougoumont  it is seven o clock in the  evening  with napoleon in fair way to succeed  but his men are already  exhausted and their losses are heavy  some of them plunge into that  famous sunken road  unheeded of him and them  and still so great a  mystery to historians  it was a charging cavalry column that plunged  in  unknowingly  rider and horse together  in indescribable confusion  and dismay  we may see that road to day  for we have walked in a part  of it when coming across the plain from the station  a narrow road cut  many feet deep  its bed paved with little stones  hugo s words on that  frightful scene are these      there was the ravine  unlooked for  yawning at the very feet of the  horses  two fathoms deep between its double slope  the second rank  pushed in the first  the third pushed in the second  the horses  reared  threw themselves over  fell upon their backs  and struggled  with their feet in the air  piling up and overturning their riders  no  power to retreat  the whole column was nothing but a projectile  the  force acquired to crush the english crusht the french  the inexorable  ravine could not yield until it was filled  riders and horses rolled  in together pell mell  grinding each other  making common flesh in  this dreadful gulf  and when this grave was full of living men  the  rest marched over them and passed on  almost a third of the dubois   brigade sank into this abyss      two hours before this  bluecher  with his prussians  had  appeared  bluecher who was to turn the tide of battle  he had promised  wellington to be there  his soldiers had complained bitterly on the  long march over muddy ground  but he told them his word as a soldier  must be kept  from far beyond la belle alliance had bluecher come  a  cow boy showing him the way  a boy who  if he had not known the way   or had lied  might have saved napoleon from st  helena  the ground  where bluecher entered the field is just visible to us from the mound  as with strained eyes  we peer through the morning mist  during ney s  attack  bluecher opens fire on la haye sainte  by six o clock he has  forty eight guns in action and some of the guns send shot as far as la  belle alliance  as the conflict deepens  napoleon s fortunes are seen  to be obviously in grave  if not critical  danger  but he strengthens  his right wing and again hazards hougoumont  eight battalions are  sent forward  an outlying stronghold is captured  but more prussians  advance and threaten to regain the point     at seven o clock while ney is renewing the attack on hougoumont other  prussians appear  the real crisis being at hand  napoleon resolves  on a final  concentrated movement against the enemy s center  his  soldiers being worn out and discouraged  he gives out a false report  that reinforcements are at last coming  that grouchy has not failed  him  a furious cannonade opens this new attack  causing  frightful  havoc  among the allies  the prince of orange holds back the french  on the very ground where the lion is now elevated  but falls wounded   napoleon  in an address to the imperial guard  rouses them to great  enthusiasm  for a half hour longer the french bear down on the enemy   but british gunners make gaps in their ranks  with his horse shot from  under him  ney goes forward on foot     the duke now takes personal command  he sends a shower of grape and  cannister against a column of french veterans  but they never waver   reserves  suddenly called for  pour a fierce charge against the  advancing french  rending them asunder  the attack is closely followed  up and the french are driven down the hill  elsewhere in the field the  battle still rages  bluecher continues his attack on napoleon s right  and forces it back  reduced to despair  napoleon now gives his final  and famous order   tout est perdu  sauve qui peut   but the young  guard resists bluecher  wellington  descending from his height  follows  the retreating enemy as far as la belle alliance  at eight o clock   after a most sanguinary struggle  the young guard yields  the success  of bluecher elsewhere completes the victory of the allies     one man will never surrender  cambronne  who was cambronne  no one  can tell you more than this  he was the man at waterloo who would not  surrender   the old guard dies  but never surrenders    among those  giants then   says hugo   there was one titan  cambronne  the man  who won the battle of waterloo was not napoleon  put to rout  not  wellington  giving way at four o clock  desperate at five  not  bluecher  who did not fight  the man who won the battle of waterloo  was cambronne  to fulminate at the thunderbolt which kills you  is  victory      as we look over this field from our height and try to realize what  mighty fortunes were here at stake  we note that the mementoes of  that day are few  a corinthian column and an obelisk are seen at the  roadside as memorials of the bravery of two officers  this lion s  mound  two hundred feet high and made from earth piled up by cart  loads  commemorates the place where a prince was wounded  colossal in  size  the lion was cast from french cannon captured in the fight  on  this broad plain upward of        men  who had mothers  sisters   and wives at home  gave up their lives  poplar trees sigh forth  perpetually their funeral dirge  grass grows where their blood was  poured out  modern europe can show few scenes of more sublime tragedy   our visiting day  with its chilling air and penetrating rain  has  been a fit day for seeing waterloo  the old woman who served me with  breakfast spoke english easily  it was well  doubly well  no other  language than english should be spoken on the field of waterloo  i  passed a few french words with the boy who called off the dogs  but  was afterward sorry for having done so           antwerp a      footnote a  from  the cathedrals and churches of belgium   published  by james pott   co      by t  francis bumpus      byzantium  venice  antwerp  these are the centers around which the  modern world has revolved  for we must include its commercial with its  social progress  and with those interests which develop with society   indeed  the development of the arts has always run concurrently with  commerce  one could wish to add that the converse were equally true     antwerp  the city on the wharf  became famous at the beginning of  the sixteenth century under the reign of the enterprising charles v    antwerp was then truly a leading city in almost all things  but  in commerce it headed all the cities of the world   says an old  chronicler  bruges  the great banking center yielded her position   and the hanseatic merchants removed to the banks of the scheldt   i  was astonished  and wondered much when i beheld antwerp   wrote an  envoy of the italian republic   for i saw venice outdone      in what direction venice was outdone is not recorded  not in her  architecture  at least  scarcely in her painting  we can not concede  a tintoretto for a rubens  yet  as antwerp was the home of matsys   of rubens  van dyck  and the teniers  the home also of christopher  plantin  the great printer  her glory is not to be sought in trade  alone  she is still remembered as a mother of art and letters  while  her mercantile preeminence belongs to a buried past     it must  however  be confest that the fortunes of antwerp as a city   prospering in its connection with the hanseatic league  were anything  but advantageous to the student of architectural history  alterations  and buildings were the order of the day  and so lavish were the means  devoted to the work that scarcely a vestige of architecture in the  remains is of earlier date than the fourteenth century     the grandly dimensioned churches raised in every parish afford ample  evidence of the zeal and skill with which the work of reconstruction  was prosecuted  and as specimens of the style of their day can not  fail to elicit our admiration by the nobility of their proportions  so  that in the monuments the wealthy burghers of antwerp have left us we  have perhaps no reason to regret their zeal  at the same time  one  is tempted to wish that they had spared the works of earlier date by  raising their new ones on fresh ground  instead of such wholesale  demolition of the labors of preceding generations     notre dame at antwerp  the most spacious church in the netherlands   originated in a chapel built for a miraculous image of the blessed  virgin  this chapel was reconstructed in       when the canons of st   michel  having ceded their church to the praemonstratensians  removed  hither  two centuries later  the canons of st  michel  animated by the  prevailing spirit  determined on rebuilding their church on a more  magnificent scale  and they commenced the work in      by laying the  foundations for a new choir  but slow progress was made with this  great undertaking  more than two centuries and a half elapsing before  the church assumed that form with which we are familiar to day  in        the chapter  dissatisfied with its choir  started upon the  erection of a new one  the first stone of which was laid in the  following year by the emperor charles v   accompanied by king  christian ii  of denmark and a numerous retinue     the new plan included a crypt  partly above ground  probably like that  we see in st  paul s in the same town  and the work was progressing  when  in       a disastrous fire did such damage to the western parts  of the church that the project of enlargement was suspended  and  the funds destined for its employment were applied to restoring the  damaged portions  had the design been realized  the eastern limb of  the church would have been doubled in size     as regards its dimensions  notre dame at antwerp is one of the most  remarkable churches in europe  being nearly     feet long by     feet  in width across the nave  which  inclusive of that covered by the  western towers  has seven bays  and three aisles on either side  this  multiplication of aisles gives a vast intricacy and picturesqueness to  the cross views of the interior  but there is a poverty of detail  and  a want of harmony among the parts and of subordination and  proportion  sadly destructive of true architectural effect  so that   notwithstanding its size  it looks much smaller internally than many  of the french cathedrals of far less dimensions  if there had been ten  bays in the nave instead of only seven  and the central division had  been at least ten feet wider  which could easily have been spared from  the outermost aisles  the apparent size of the church would have been  much greater  the outermost south aisle is wider than the nave  and  equal in breadth to the two inner aisles  the northernmost aisle is  not quite so broad     the transepts have no aisles  but they are continued beyond the line  of the nave aisles  so that they are more than usually elongated  the  two inner aisles of the nave open into the transepts  but the outer  ones  which  it should be remarked  are continuous  and not divided  into a series of chapels  are walled up at their eastern extremities     the choir consists of three bays  but has only one aisle on either  side  this is continued round the apse  and five pentagonal chapels  radiate from it  three chapels flank the north aisle of the choir  the  first two opening  as does the north transept  into one large chapel  of the same breadth as the southernmost aisle of the nave     the  facade is flanked by towers equal in width to the two inner aisles of  the nave  the northern one has alone been completed  and altho it may  seem to a severe judgment to possess some of the defects of the  late flemish style  it is rivaled for beauty of outline only by the  flamboyant steeples of chartres and vienna  as might be expected from  its late age  it was not finished until       this northwestern spire  of notre dame at antwerp exhibits some extravagances in design and  detail  but the mode in which the octagonal lantern of openwork  bisects the faces of the solid square portion with its alternate  angles  thus breaking the outline without any harsh or disagreeable  transition  is very masterly  while the bold pinnacles  with their  flying buttresses  which group around it  produce a most pleasing  variety  the whole serving to indicate the appearance the steeple of  malines would have presented had it been completed according to the  original design     if size were any real test of beauty  the interior or notre dame at  antwerp ought to be one of the finest in belgium  unfortunately  altho  it was begun at a time when the pointed style had reached the full  maturity of perfection  a colder and more unimpressive design than is  here carried out it would be difficult to find  still  notwithstanding  the long period that elapsed between its commencement and completion   there is a congruity about the whole building which is eminently  pleasing  and to some extent redeems the defects in its details and  proportions  while the views afforded in various directions by the  triple aisles on either side of the nave are undeniably picturesque     the high altarpiece  placed on the chord of the apse  is a noble and  sumptuous example of early renaissance taste and workmanship  but like  the stallwork  its dimensions are such as to diminish the scale of the  choir  the five arches opening to the procession path being completely  obscured by it  of the numerous creations of rubens  pencil none  perhaps more thoroughly declares to us his comprehension of religious  decorative art than the  assumption  which fills the arched  compartment in the lower portion of this altarpiece  it was finished  in       and  of twenty repetitions of the subject  is the only  example still preserved at the place it was intended by the painter  to occupy  in spirit we are reminded of titian s  assumption  in the  cathedral at verona  but rubens  proves perhaps a higher conception  of the subject  the work is seen a considerable way off  and every  outline is bathed in light  so that the virgin is elevated to dazzling  glory with a power of accession scarcely  if ever  attained by any  master     in the celebrated  descent from the cross   which hangs in the  south transept  the boldness of the composition  the energy in the  characters  the striking attitudes and grouping  the glowing  vigorous  coloring  are astonishing proofs of rubens  power  the circumstances  which gave rise to this wondrous effort of art are interesting  it is  said that rubens  in laying the foundations of his villa near antwerp   had unwittingly infringed on some ground belonging to the company  of gunsmiths  arquebusiers   a law suit was threatened  and rubens  prepared to defend it  but  being assured by one of the greatest  lawyers of the city that the right lay with his opponents  he  immediately drew back  and offered to paint a picture by way of  recompense  the offer was accepted  and the company required a  representation of its patron saint  st  christopher  to be placed in  its chapel in the cathedral  which at that time notre dame was     rubens  with his usual liberality and magnificence  presented to his  adversaries  not merely a single representation of the saint  but  an elaborate illustration of his name  the christ bearer  the  arquebusiers were at first disappointed not to have their saint  represented in the usual manner  and rubens was obliged to enter  into an explanation of his work  thus  without knowing it  they had  received in exchange for a few feet of land a treasure which neither  money nor lands can now purchase  the painting was executed by  rubens soon after his seven years  residence in italy  and while the  impression made by the work of titian and paul veronese were yet fresh  in his mind  the great master appeared in the fulness of his glory in  this work  it is one of the few which exhibits in combination all  that nature had given him of warmth and imagination  with all that he  acquired of knowledge  judgment and method  and in which he may be  considered fully to have overcome the difficulties of a subject which  becomes painful  and almost repulsive  when it ceases to be sublime           vii    holland          how the dutch obtained their land a      footnote a  from  holland and its people   translated by caroline  tilton  by special arrangement with  and by permission of  the  publishers  g p  putnam s sons  copyright            by edmondo de amicis      the first time that i crossed the old rhine  i had stopt on the  bridge  asking myself whether that small and humble stream of water  was really the same river that i had seen rushing in thunder over the  rocks at schaffhausen  spreading majestically before mayence  passing  in triumph under the fortress of ehrenbreitstein  beating in sonorous  cadence at the foot of the seven mountains  reflecting in its course  gothic cathedrals  princely castles  fertile hills  steep rocks   famous ruins  cities  groves  and gardens  everywhere covered with  vessels of all sorts  and saluted with music and song  and thinking of  these things  with my gaze fixt upon the little stream shut in between  two flat and desert shores  i had repeated   is this that rhine      the vicissitudes which accompany the agony and death of this great  river in holland  are such as really to excite a sense of pity  such  as is felt for the misfortunes and inglorious end of a people once  powerful and happy  from the neighborhood of emmerich  before reaching  the dutch frontier  it has lost all the beauty of its banks  and flows  in great curves through vast and ugly flats  which seem to mark the  approach to old age  at millingen it runs entirely in the territory of  holland  a little farther on it divides  the main branch shamefully  loses its name  and goes to throw itself into the meuse  the other  branch  insulted by the title of the dannerden canal  flows nearly to  the city of arnehm  when it once more divides into two branches  one  empties into the gulf of zuyder zee  the other still called  out of  compassion  the lower rhine  goes as far as the village of durstede   where it divides for the third time  a humiliation now of old date     one of these branches  changing its name like a coward  throws itself  into the meuse near rotterdam  the other still called the rhine   but with the ridiculous surname of  curved   reaches utrecht with  difficulty  where for the fourth time it again divides  capricious as  an old man in his dotage  one part  denying its old name  drags itself  as far as muiden  where it falls into the zuyder zee  the other  with  the name of old rhine  or simply the old  flows slowly to the city  of leyden  whose streets it crosses almost without giving a sign of  movement  and is finally gathered into one canal by which it goes to  its miserable death in the north sea     but it is not many years since this pitiful end was denied it  from  the year      in which a furious tempest had accumulated mountains of  sand at its mouth  until the beginning of the present century  the old  rhine lost itself in the sand before reaching the sea  and covered a  vast tract of country with pools and marshes  under the reign of louis  bonaparte the waters were collected into a large canal protected  by three enormous sluicegates  and from that time the rhine flows  directly to the sea  these sluices are the greatest monument in  holland and  perhaps  the most admirable hydraulic work in europe     the dikes which protect the mouth of the canal  the walls  pillars   and gates  present altogether the aspect of a cyclopian fortress   against which it seems that not only that sea  but the united forces  of all seas  must break as against a granite mountain  when the tide  rises the gates are closed to prevent the waters from invading the  land  when the tide recedes they are opened to give passage to the  waters of the rhine which have accumulated behind them  and then a  mass of three thousand cubic feet of water passes through them in one  minute  on days when storms prevail  a concession is made to the sea   and the most advanced of the sluicegates is left open  and then the  furious billows rush into the canal  like an enemy entering by a  breach  but they break upon the formidable barrier of the second gate   behind which holland stands and cries   thus far shalt thou go  and  no farther   that enormous fortification which  on a desert shore   defends a dying river and a fallen city from the ocean  has something  of solemnity which commands respect and admiration        napoleon said that it  holland  was an alluvion of trench rivers  the  rhine  the scheldt  and the meuse  and with this pretext he added  it to the empire  one writer has defined it as a sort of transition  between land and sea  another  as an immense crust of earth floating  on water  others  an annex of the old continent  the china of europe   the end of the earth  and the beginning of the ocean  a measureless  raft of mud and sand  and philip ii  called it the country nearest to  hell     but they all agreed upon one point  and all exprest it in the same  words   holland is a conquest made by man over the sea  it is an  artificial country  the hollanders made it  it exists because the  hollanders preserve it  it will vanish whenever the hollanders shall  abandon it     to comprehend this truth  we must imagine holland as it was when first  inhabited by the first german tribes that wandered away in search of  a country  it was almost uninhabitable  there were vast tempestuous  lakes  like seas  touching one another  morass beside morass  one  tract covered with brushwood after another  immense forests of pines   oaks  and alders  traversed by herds of wild horses  and so thick were  these forests that tradition says one could travel leagues passing  from tree to tree without ever putting foot to the ground  the deep  bays and gulfs carried into the heart of the country the fury of the  northern tempests  some provinces disappeared once every year under  the waters of the sea  and were nothing but muddy tracts  neither land  nor water  where it was impossible either to walk or to sail  the  large rivers  without sufficient inclination to descend to the sea   wandered here and there uncertain of their day  and slept in monstrous  pools and ponds among the sands of the coasts  it was a sinister  place  swept by furious winds  beaten by obstinate rains  veiled in a  perpetual fog  where nothing was heard but the roar of the sea  and  the voice of wild beasts and birds of the ocean     now  if we remember that such a region has become one of the most  fertile  wealthiest and best regulated of the countries of the world   we shall understand the justice of the saying that holland is a  conquest made by man  but  it must be added  the conquest goes on  forever     to drain the lakes of the country the hollanders prest the air into  their service  the lakes  the marshes  were surrounded by dikes   the dikes by canals  and an army of windmills  putting in motion  force pumps  turned the water into the canals  which carried it off  to the rivers and the sea  thus vast tracts of land buried under the  water  saw the sun  and were transformed  as if by magic  into fertile  fields  covered with villages  and intersected by canals and roads  in  the seventeenth century  in less than forty years  twenty six lakes  were drained  at the beginning of the present century  in north  holland alone  more than six thousand hectares  or fifteen thousand  acres  were thus redeemed from the waters  in south holland  before        twenty nine thousand hectares  in the whole of holland  from       to       three hundred and fifty five thousand hectares   substituting steam mills for windmills  in thirty nine months was  completed the great undertaking of the draining of the lake of  haarlem  which measured forty four kilometers in circumference   and for ever threatened with its tempests the cities of haarlem   amsterdam  and leyden  and they are now meditating the prodigious work  of drying up the zuyder zee  which embraces an area of more than seven  hundred square kilometers     but the most tremendous struggle was the battle with the ocean   holland is in great part lower than the level of the sea   consequently  everywhere that the coast is not defended by sand banks   it has to be protected by dikes  if these interminable bulkwarks of  earth  granite  and wood were not there to attest the indomitable  courage and perseverance of the hollanders  it would not be believed  that the hand of man could  even in many centuries have accomplished  such a work  in zealand alone the dikes extend to a distance of more  than four hundred kilometers  the western coast of the island of  walcheren is defended by a dike  in which it is computed that the  expense of construction added to that of preservation  if it were put  out at interest  would amount to a sum equal in value to that which  the dike itself would be worth were it made of massive copper     around the city of helder  at the northern extremity of north holland   extends a dike ten kilometers long  constructed of masses of norwegian  granite  which descends more than sixty meters into the sea  the whole  province of friesland  for the length of eighty eight kilometers  is  defended by three rows of piles sustained by masses of norwegian and  german granite  amsterdam  all the cities of the zuyder zee  and all  the islands  fragments of vanished lands  which are strung like beads  between friesland and north holland  are protected by dikes  from the  mouths of the ems to those of the scheldt holland is an impenetrable  fortress  of whose immense bastions the mills are the towers  the  cataracts are the gates  the islands the advanced forts  and like a  true fortress  it shows to its enemy  the sea  only the tops of  its bell towers and the roofs of its houses  as if in defiance and  derision     holland is a fortress  and her people live as in a fortress on a  war footing with the sea  an army of engineers  directed by the  minister of the interior  spread over the country  and ordered like  an army  continually spy the enemy  watch over the internal waters   foresee the bursting of the dikes  order and direct the defensive  works  the expenses of the war are divided  one part to the state   one part to the provinces  every proprietor pays  besides the general  imposts  a special impost for the dikes  in proportion to the extent  of his lands and their proximity to the water  an accidental rupture   an inadvertence  may cause a flood  the peril is unceasing  the  sentinels are at their posts upon the bulwarks at the first assault of  the sea  they shout the war cry  and holland sends men  material  and  money  and even when there is not a great battle  a quiet  silent  struggle is for ever going on     the innumerable mills  even in the drained districts  continue to work  unresting  to absorb and turn into the canals the water that falls in  rain and that which filters in from the sea     but holland has done more than defend herself against the waters   she has made herself mistress of them  and has used them for her own  defense  should a foreign army invade her territory  she has but to  open her dikes and unchain the sea and the rivers  as she did against  the romans  against the spaniards  against the army of louis xiv   and  defend the land cities with her fleet  water was the source of her  poverty  she has made it the source of wealth  over the whole country  extends an immense net work of canals which serve both for the  irrigation of the land and as a means of communication  the cities   by means of canals  communicate with the sea  canals run from town to  town  and from them to villages  which are themselves bound together  by these watery ways  and are connected even to the houses scattered  over the country  smaller canals surround the fields and orchards   pastures and kitchen gardens  serving at once as boundary wall  hedge   and roadway  every house is a little port  ships  boats  rafts move  about in all directions  as in other places carts and carriages  the  canals are the arteries of holland  and the water her life blood     but even setting aside the canals  the draining of the lakes  and  the defensive works  on every side are seen the traces of marvelous  undertakings  the soil  which in other countries is a gift of nature   is in holland a work of men s hands  holland draws the greater part of  her wealth from commerce  but before commerce comes the cultivation  of the soil  and the soil had to be created  there were sand banks   interspersed with layers of peat  broad downs swept by the winds   great tracts of barren land apparently condemned to an external  sterility  the first elements of manufacture  iron and coal  were  wanting  there was no wood  because the forests had already been  destroyed by tempests when agriculture began  there was no stone   there were no metals     nature  says a dutch poet  had refused all her gifts to holland  the  hollanders had to do everything in spite of nature  they began by  fertilizing the sand  in some places they formed a productive soil  with earth brought from a distance  as a garden is made  they spread  the siliceous dust of the downs over the too watery meadows  they  mixed with the sandy earth the remains of peat taken from the bottoms   they extracted clay to lend fertility to the surface of their lands   they labored to break up the downs with the plow  and thus in a  thousand ways  and continually fighting off the menacing waters  they  succeeded in bringing holland to a state of cultivation not inferior  to that of more favored regions  that holland  the sandy  marshy  country that the ancients considered all but uninhabitable  now sends  out yearly from her confines agricultural products to the value of a  hundred millions of francs  possesses about one million three hundred  thousand head of cattle  and  in proportion to the extent of her  territory  may be accounted one of the most populous of european  states     but however wonderful may be the physical history of holland  her  political history is still more so  this small territory invaded from  the beginning by different tribes of the germanic races  subjugated by  the romans and the franks  devastated by the normans and by the danes   desolated by centuries of civil war with all its horrors  this small  people of fisherman and traders  saves its civil liberty and its  freedom of conscience by a war of eighty years against the formidable  monarchy of philip ii   and founds a republic which becomes the ark of  salvation to the liberties of all the world  the adopted country of  science  the exchange of europe  the station for the commerce of the  world  a republic which extends its domination to java  sumatra

rotterdam an equilateral triangle  the base of the triangle is an  immense dike  which defends the city from the meuse  and is called  the boompjes  signifying  in dutch  small trees  from a row of little  elms  now very tall  that were planted when it was first constructed     the whole city of rotterdam presents the appearance of a town that  has been shaken smartly by an earthquake  and is on the point of  the falling ruin  all the houses  in any street one may count the  exceptions on their fingers  lean more or less  but the greater part  of them so much that at the roof they lean forward at least a foot  beyond their neighbors  which may be straight  or not so visibly  inclined  one leans forward as if it would fall into the street   another backward  another to the left  another to the right  at some  points six or seven contiguous houses all lean forward together  those  in the middle most  those at the ends lass  looking like a paling  with a crowd pressing against it  at another point  two houses lean  together as if supporting one another  in certain streets the  houses for a long distance lean all one way  like trees beaten by a  prevailing wind  and then another long row will lean in the opposite  direction  as if the wind had changed     sometimes there is a certain regularity of inclination that is  scarcely noticeable  and again  at crossings and in the smaller  streets  there is an indescribable confusion of lines  a real  architectural frolic  a dance of houses  a disorder that seems  animated  there are houses that nod forward as if asleep  others that  start backward as if frightened  some bending toward each other  their  roofs almost touching  as if in secret conference  some falling upon  one another as if they were drunk  some leaning backward between  others that lean forward  like malefactors dragged onward by their  guards  rows of houses that curtsey to a steeple  groups of small  houses all inclined toward one in the middle  like conspirators in  conclave     broad and long canals divide the city into so many islands  united by  drawbridges  turning bridges  and bridges of stone  on either side of  every canal extends a street  flanked by trees on one side and houses  on the other  all these canals are deep enough to float large vessels   and all are full of them from one end to the other  except a space in  the middle left for passage in and out  an immense fleet imprisoned in  a city     when i arrived it was the busiest hour  so i planted myself upon the  highest bridge over the principal crossing  from thence were visible  four canals  four forests of ships  bordered by eight files of trees   the streets were crammed with people and merchandise  droves of cattle  were crossing the bridges  bridges were rising in the air  or opening  in the middle  to allow vessels to pass through  and were scarcely  replaced or closed before they were inundated by a throng of people   carts  and carriages  ships came and went in the canals  shining like  models in a museum  and with the wives and children of the sailors on  the decks  boats darted from vessel to vessel  the shops drove a busy  trade  servant women washed the walls and windows  and all this moving  life was rendered more gay and cheerful by the reflections in the  water  the green of the trees  the red of the houses  the tall  windmills  showing their dark tops and white sails against the azure  of the sky  and still more by an air of quiet simplicity not seen in  any other northern city     from canal to canal  and from bridge to bridge  i finally reached the  dike of the boompjes upon the meuse  where boils and bubbles all the  life of the great commercial city  on the left extends a long row of  small many colored steamboats  which start every hour in the day for  dordrecht  arnhem  gonda  schiedam  brilla  zealand  and continually  send forth clouds of white smoke and the sound of their cheerful  bells

labor on the  earth below     rotterdam  it must be said here  is  in commercial importance  the  first city in holland after amsterdam  it was already a flourishing  town in the thirteenth century  ludovico guicciardini  in his work on  the low countries  adduces a proof of the wealth of the city in the  sixteenth century  saying that in one year nine hundred houses that  had been destroyed by fire were rebuilt  bentivoglio  in his history  of the war in flanders  calls it  the largest and most mercantile of  the lands of holland   but its greatest prosperity did not begin until        or after the separation of holland and belgium  when rotterdam  seemed to draw to herself everything that was lost by her rival   antwerp     her situation is extremely advantageous  she communicates with the sea  by the meuse  which brings to her ports in a few hours the largest  merchantmen  and by the same river she communicates with the rhine   which brings to her from the swiss mountains and bavaria immense  quantities of timber  entire forests that come to holland to be  transformed into ships  dikes  and villages  more than eighty splendid  vessels come and go  in the space of nine months  between rotterdam  and india  merchandise flows in from all sides in such great abundance  that a large part of it has to be distributed through the neighboring  towns        rotterdam  in short  has a future more splendid than that of  amsterdam  and has long been regarded as a rival by her elder  sister  she does not possess the wealth of the capital  but is more  industrious in increasing what she has  she dares  risks  undertakes  like a young and adventurous city  amsterdam  like a merchant grown  cautious after having made his fortune by hazardous undertakings   begins to

custom of writers  in his day  that gerrit gerritz belonged  by his education  his style   and his ideas  to the family of the humanists and erudite of italy   a fine writer  profound and indefatigable in letters and science  he  filled all europe with his name between the fifteenth and sixteenth  centuries  he was loaded with favors by the popes  and sought after  and entertained by princes  and his  praise of folly   written in  latin like the rest of his innumerable works  and dedicated to sir  thomas more  is still read  the bronze statue  erected in        represents erasmus drest in a furred gown  with a cap of the same  a  little bent forward as if walking  and in the act of reading a large  book  held open in the hand  the pedestal bears a double inscription   in dutch and latin  calling him   the foremost man of his century    and  the most excellent of all citizens   in spite of this pompous  eulogium  however  poor erasmus  planted there like a municipal guard  in the market place  makes but a pitiful figure  i do not believe that  there is in the world another statue of a man of letters that is   like this  neglected by the passer by  despised by those about it   commiserated by those who look at it  but who knows whether erasmus   acute philosopher as he was  and must be still  be not contented with  his corner  the more that it is not far from his own house  if the  tradition is correct  in a small street near the market place  in the  wall of a little house now occupied as a tavern  there is a niche with  a bronze statuette representing the great writer  and under it the  inscription   this is the little house in which the great erasmus was  born          rotterdam in the evening presents an unusual aspect to the stranger s  eye  while in other northern cities at a certain hour of the night all  the life is concentered in the houses  at rotterdam at that hour it  expands into the streets  the hoog straat is filled until far into the  night with a dense throng  the shops are open  because the servants  make their purchases in the evening  and the cafes crowded  dutch  cafes are peculiar  in general there is one long room  divided in the  middle by a green curtain  which is drawn down at evening and conceals  the back part  which is the only part lighted  the front part  closed  from the street by large glass doors  is in darkness  so that from  without only dark shadowy forms can be seen  and the burning points  of cigars  like so many fireflies  among these dark forms the vague  profile of a woman who prefers darkness to light may be detected here  and there        walking through rotterdam in the evening  it is evident that the city  is teeming with life and in process of expansion  a youthful city   still growing  and feeling herself every year more and more prest  for room in her streets and houses  in a not far distant future  her  hundred and fourteen thousand inhabitants will have increased to two  hundred thousand  a  the smaller streets swarm with children  there is  an overflow of life and movement that cheers the eye and heart  a kind  of holiday air  the white and rosy faces of the servant maids  whose  white caps gleam on every side  the serene visages of shopkeepers  slowly imbibing great glassfuls of beer  the peasants with their  monstrous ear rings  the cleanliness  the flowers in the windows  the  tranquil and laborious throng  all give to rotterdam an aspect of  healthful and peaceful content  which brings to the lips the chant  of  te beata   not with the cry of

myself such a very poor devil as in those streets  they are wide and  straight  flanked by palaces of elegant form and delicate color  with  large shutterless windows  through which can be seen the rich carpets  and sumptuous furniture of the first floors  every door is closed  and  there is not a shop  nor a placard  nor a stain  nor a straw to be  seen if you were to look for it with a hundred eyes  the silence  was profound when i passed by  only now and then i encountered some  aristocratic equipage rolling almost noiselessly over the brick  pavement  or the stiffest of lackeys stood before a door  or the  blonde head of a lady was visible behind a curtain  passing close  to the windows and beholding my shabby traveling dress ruthlessly  reflected in the plate glass i experienced a certain humiliation at  not having been born at least a cavaliere  and imagined i heard low  voices whispering disdainfully   who is that low person      of the older portion of the city  the most

building  the interior  however   is as bare and hideous as all other dutch churches  it contains a  monument to the architect conrad  designer of the famous locks of  katwijk   the defender of holland against the fury of the sea and  the power of tempests   behind the choir is the tomb of the poet  bilderijk  who only died in       and near this the grave of laurenz  janzoom  the coster or sacristan  who is asserted in his native town   but never believed outside it  to have been the real inventor of  printing  as he is said to have cut out letters in wood  and taken  impressions from them in ink  as early as       his partizans also  maintain that while he was attending a midnight mass  praying  for patience to endure the ill treatment of his enemies  all his  implements were stolen  and that when he found this out on his return  he died of grief     it is further declared that the robber was faust of mayence  the  partner of gutenburg  and that it was thus that the honor of the  invention passed from holland to germany where gutenberg produced his  invention of movable type twelve years later  there is a statue of the  coster in front of the church  and  on its north side  his house is  preserved and adorned with his bust     among a crowd of natives with their hats on  talking in church as in  the market place  we waited to hear the famous organ of christian  muller            and grievously were we disappointed with its  discordant noises  all the men smoked in church  and this we saw  repeatedly  but it would be difficult to say where we ever saw  a dutchman with a pipe out of his mouth  every man seemed to be  systematically smoking away the few wits he possest     opposite the groote kerk is the stadhuis  an old palace of the counts  of holland remodeled  it contains a delightful little gallery of the  works of franz hals  which at once transports the spectator into the  holland of two hundred years ago  such is the marvelous variety of  life and vigor imprest into its endless figures of stalwart officers  and handsome young archers pledging each other at banquet tables and  seeming to welcome the visitor with jovial smiles as he enters the  chamber  or of serene old ladies   regents  of hospitals  seated at  their council boards  the immense power of the artist is shown  in nothing so much as in the hands  often gloved  dashed in with  instantaneous power  yet always having the effect of the most  consummate finish at a distance  behind one of the pictures is the  entrance to the famous  secret room of haarlem   seldom seen  but  containing an inestimable collection of historic relics of the time of  the famous siege of leyden     april and may are the best months for visiting haarlem  which is the  bulb

footnote a  from  holland of to day   by special arrangement with   and by permission of  the author and of the publishers  moffat  yard    co  copyright            by george wharton edwards      let us go down to the north sea and see how the dutch people enjoy  themselves in the summer  of course the largest of the watering places  in the netherlands is scheveningen  and it has a splendid bathing  beach which makes it an attractive resort for fashionable germans and  hollanders  and for summer travelers from all over the world  at the  top of the long dyke is a row of hotels and restaurants  and when  one reaches this point after passing through the lovely old wood of  stately trees one is ushered into the twentieth century  for here all  is fashion and gay life  yet with a character all its own     along the edge of the beach are the bathing machines in scores  and  behind them are long lines of covered wicker chairs of peculiar form   each with its foot stool  where one may sit  shaded  from the sun and  sheltered from the wind  and read  chat or doze by the hour  bath  women are seen quaintly clad with their baskets of bathing dresses and  labeled with the signs bearing their names  such as trintje or netje   everywhere there are sightseers  pedlers calling their wares  children  digging in the sand  strolling players performing and the sound of  bands of music in the distance  so there is no lack of amusement here  during the season     the spacious kurhaus with its verandas and kursaal  which is large  enough to accommodate       people  is in the center of the dike   there are concerts every evening  and altho the town is filled with  hotels  during the months of june  july  august  and september they  are quite monopolized by the hollanders and the prices are very high     the magnificent pier is     yards long  the charges for bathing are  very moderate  varying from twenty cents for a small bathing box to  fifty cents for a large one  including the towels  bathing costumes  range from five to twenty five cents  the tickets are numbered  and as  soon as a machine is vacant a number is called by the  bath man  and  the holder of the corresponding number claims the machine  the basket  chairs cost for the whole day twenty cents  dutch money  one may  obtain a subscription to the  kurhaus  at a surprisingly reasonable  rate for the day  week or season  there is a daily orchestra  ballet  and operatic concerts once a week  dramatic performances and frequent  hops throughout the season     there is a local saying that when good dutchmen die they go to  scheveningen  and this is certainly their heaven  to stand on the pier  on a fine day during the season looking down on these long lines of  wicker chairs  turned seaward  is an astonishing sight  they are  shaped somewhat like huge snail shells  and around these the children  delight to dig in the sand  throwing up miniature dunes around  one  perhaps no seashore in the world has been painted so much as  scheveningen  mesdag  maris  alfred stevens  to name only a few of the  artists  have found here themes for many paintings  and the scene is  a wonderful one when the homing fleet of  boms   as the fishing boats  are called  appears in the offing to be welcomed by the fisherwomen   there are other smaller watering places on the coast  but scheveningen  is unique     in the little fishing town itself  the scene on the return of the men  is very interesting  women and children are busily hurrying about from  house to house  and everywhere in the little streets are strange signs  chalked up on the shutters  such as  water en vuur te koop   that is  water and fire for sale  and here are neatly painted buckets of iron   each having a kettle of boiling water over it and a lump of burning  turf at the bottom  fish is being cleaned and the gin shops are well  patronized  for it seems a common habit in this moist northern climate  frequently to take  een sneeuw balletje  of gin and sugar  which does  not taste at all badly  be it said  all sorts of strange looking  people are met in the little narrow street  and all doing  strange looking things  but with the air of its being in no wise  unusual with them  all in all  scheveningen is an entertaining spot in  which to linger           delft a      footnote a  from  sketches in holland and scandinavia       by augustus j c  hare      an excursion must be made to delft  only twenty minutes distant from  the hague by rail  pepys calls it  a most sweet town  with bridges  and a river in every street   and that is a tolerably accurate  description  it seems thinly inhabited  and the dutch themselves  look upon it as a place where one will die of ennui  it has scarcely  changed with two hundred years  the view of delft by van der meer in  the museum at the hague might have been painted yesterday  all the  trees are dipt  for in artificial holland every work of nature is  artificialized  at certain seasons  numbers of storks may be seen  upon the chimney tops  for delft is supposed to be the stork town par  excellence  near the shady canal oude delft is a low building  once  the convent of st  agata  with an ornamental door surmounted by a  relief  leading into a courtyard  it is a common barrack now  for  holland  which has no local histories  has no regard whatever for its  historic associations or monuments  yet this is the greatest shrine of  dutch history  for it is here that william the silent died     philip ii  had promised        crowns of gold to any one who would  murder the prince of orange  an attempt had already been made  but had  failed  and william refused to take any measures for self protection   saying   it is useless  my years are in the hands of god  if there is  a wretch who has no fear of death  my life is in his hand  however i  may guard it      at length  a young man of seven and twenty appeared at delft  who  gave himself out to be one guyon  a protestant  son of pierre guyon   executed at besancon for having embraced calvinism  and declared that  he was exiled for his religion  really he was balthazar gerard  a  bigoted catholic  but his conduct in holland soon procured him the  reputation of an evangelical saint     the prince took him into his service and sent him to accompany a  mission from the states of holland to the court of france  whence  he returned to bring the news of the death of the duke of anjou to  william  at that time the prince was living with his court in the  convent of st  agata  where he received balthazar alone in his  chamber  the moment was opportune  but the would be assassin had no  arms ready  william gave him a small sum of money and bade him hold  himself in readiness to be sent back to france     with the money balthazar bought two pistols from a soldier  who  afterward killed himself when he heard the use which was made of the  purchase   on the next day  june           balthazar returned to the  convent as william was descending the staircase to dinner  with his  fourth wife  louise de coligny  daughter of the admiral who fell  in the massacre of st  bartholomew   on his arm  he presented his  passport and begged the prince to sign it  but was told to return  later  at dinner the princess asked william who was the young man who  had spoken to him  for his expression was the most terrible she had  ever seen     the prince laughed  said it was guyon  and was as gay as usual  dinner  being over  the family party were about to remount the staircase  the  assassin was waiting in a dark corner at the foot of the stairs  and  as william passed he discharged a pistol with three balls and fled   the prince staggered  saying   i am wounded  god have mercy upon me  and my poor people   his sister catherine van schwartz bourg asked    do you trust in jesus christ   he said   yes   with a feeble voice   sat down upon the stairs  and died     balthazar reached the rampart of the town in safety  hoping to swim  to the other side of the moat  where a horse awaited him  but he had  dropt his hat and his second pistol in his flight  and so he was  traced and seized before he could leap from the wall     amid horrible tortures  he not only confest  but continued to triumph  in his crime  his judges believed him to be possest of the devil  the  next day he was executed  his right hand was burned off in a tube of  red hot iron  the flesh of his arms and legs was torn off with red hot  pincers  but he never made a cry  it was not till his breast was cut  open  and his heart torn out and flung in his face  that he expired   his head was then fixt on a pike  and his body  cut into four  quarters  exposed on the four gates of the town     close to the prinsenhof is the oude kerk with a leaning tower  it is  arranged like a very ugly theater inside  but contains  with  other tombs of celebrities  the monument of admiral van tromp          martinus harberti trompius   whose effigy lies upon his back   with swollen feet  it was this van tromp who defeated the english  fleet under blake  and perished  as represented on the monument  in an  engagement off scheveningen  it was he who  after his victory over the  english  caused a broom to be hoisted at his mast head to typify that  he had swept the channel clear of his enemies

by edmondo de amicis      leyden  the antique athens of the north  the saragossa of the low  countries  the oldest and most illustrious of the daughters of  holland  is one of those cities which make you thoughtful upon first  entering them  and are remembered for a long time afterward with a  certain impression of sadness     i had hardly arrived when the chill of a dead city seemed to fall upon  me  the old rhine  which crosses leyden  dividing it into many islets  joined together by one hundred and fifty stone bridges  forms wide  canals and basins which contain no ship or boat  and the city seems  rather invaded by the waters than merely crossed by them  the  principal streets are very broad and flanked by rows of old  blockhouses with the usual pointed gables  and the few people seen in  the streets and squares are like the survivors of a city depopulated  by the plague     in the smaller streets you walk upon long tracts of grass  between  houses with closed doors and windows  in a silence as profound as  that of those fabled cities where all the inhabitants are sunk in a  supernatural sleep  you pass over bridges overgrown with weeds  and  long canals covered with a green carpet  through small squares that  seem like convent courtyards  and then  suddenly  you reach a broad  thoroughfare  like the streets of paris  from which you again  penetrate into a labyrinth of narrow alleys  from bridge to bridge   from canal to canal  from island to island  you wander for hours  seeking for the life and movement of the ancient leyden  and finding  only solitude  silence  and the waters which reflect the melancholy  majesty of the fallen city     in      the spaniards  led by valdez  laid siege to leyden  in the  city there were only some volunteer soldiers  the military command was  given to van der voes  a valiant man  and a latin poet of some  renown  van der werf was burgomaster  in brief time the besiegers  had constructed more than sixty forts in all the places where it was  possible to penetrate into the city by sea or land  and leyden was  completely isolated  but the people of leyden did not lose heart   william of orange had sent them word to hold out for three months   within which time he would succor them  for on the fate of leyden  depended that of holland  and the men of leyden had promised to resist  to the last extremity        the prince of orange received the news of the safety of the city at  delft  in church  where he was present at divine service  he sent the  message at once to the preacher  and the latter announced it to the  congregation  who received it with shouts of joy  altho only just  recovered from his illness  and the epidemic still raging at leyden   william would see at once his dear and valorous city  he went there   his entry was a triumph  his majestic and serene aspect put new heart  into the people  his words made them forget all they had suffered  to  reward leyden for her heroic defense  he left her her choice between  exemption from certain imposts or the foundation of a university   leyden chose the university     how this university answered to the hopes of leyden  it is superfluous  to say  everybody knows how the states of holland with their liberal  offers drew learned men from every country  how philosophy  driven  out of france  took refuge there  how leyden was for a long time the  securest citadel for all men who were struggling for the triumph  of human reason  how it became at length the most famous school in  europe  the actual university is in an ancient convent  one can not  enter without a sentiment of profound respect the great hall of the  academic senate  where are seen the portraits of all the professors  who have succeeded each other from the foundation of the university up  to the present day           dortrecht a      footnote a  from  sketches in holland and scandinavia       by augustus j c  hare      our morning at dortrecht was very delightful  and it is a thoroughly  charming place  passing under a dark archway in a picturesque building  of charles v   opposite the hotel  we found ourselves at once on  the edge of an immense expanse of shimmering river  with long  rich  meadows beyond  between which the wide flood breaks into three  different branches  red and white sails flit down them  here and there  rises a line of pollard willows or clipt elms  and now and then a  church spire  on the nearest shore an ancient windmill  colored  in delicate tints of gray and yellow  surmounts a group of white  buildings     on the left is a broad esplanade of brick  lined with ancient houses   and a canal with a bridge  the long arms of which are ready to open at  a touch and give a passage to the great yellow masted barges  which  are already half intercepting the bright red house fronts ornamented  with stone  which belong to some public buildings facing the end of  the canal  with what a confusion of merchandise are the boats laden   and how gay is the coloring  between the old weedy posts to which they  are moored     it was from hence that isabella of france  with sir john de hainault  and many other faithful knights set on their expedition against edward  ii  and the government of the spencers     from the busy port  where nevertheless they are dredging  we cross  another bridge and find ourselves in a quietude like that of a  cathedral close in england  on one side is a wide pool half covered  with floating timber  and  in the other half  reflecting like a mirror  the houses on the opposite shore  with their bright gardens of lilies  and hollyhocks  and trees of mountain ash  which bend their masses of  scarlet berries to the still water  between the houses are glints of  blue river and of inevitable windmills on the opposite shore  and all  this we observe standing in the shadow of a huge church  the groote  kerk  with a nave of the fourteenth century  and a choir of the  fifteenth and a gigantic trick tower  in which three long gothic  arches  between octagonal tourelles  enclose several tiers of windows   at the top is a great clock  and below the church a grove of elms   through which fitful sunlight falls on the grass and the dead red of  the brick pavement  so grateful to feet sore with the sharp stones of  other dutch cities   where groups of fishermen are collecting in their  blue shirts and white trousers     there is little to see inside this or any other church in holland   travelers will rather seek for the memorials at the kloveniers doelen   of the famous synod of dort  which was held          in the hope of  effecting a compromise between the gomarists  or disciples of calvin   and the arminians who followed zwingli  and who had recently obtained  the name of remonstrants from the  remonstrance  which they had  addrest eight years before in defense of their doctrines  the  calvinists held that the greater part of mankind was excluded from  grace  which the arminians denied  but at the synod of dort the  calvinists proclaimed themselves as infallible as the pope  and their  resolutions became the law of the dutch reformed church  the arminians  were forthwith outlawed  a hundred ministers who refused to subscribe  to the dictates of the synod were banished  hugo grotius and rombout  hoogerbeets were imprisoned for life at loevestein  the body of the  secretary ledenberg  was hung  and van olden barneveldt  the friend of  william the silent  was beheaded in his seventy second year        through the street of wine  wijnstraat  built over stonehouses used  for the staple  we went to the museum to see the pictures  there were  two schools of dortrecht  jacob geritee cuyp         albert cuyp          ferdinand bol         nicolas maas

grayness and sobriety of the  second  but there are few good pictures at dort now  and some of the  best works of cuyp are to be found in our national gallery   london   executed at his native place and portraying the great brick tower of  the church in the golden haze of evening  seen across rich pastures   where the cows are lying deep in the meadow grass  the works of ary  scheffer are now the most interesting pictures in the dortrecht  gallery  of the subject   christus consolator   there are two  representations  in the more striking of these the pale christ is  seated among the sick  sorrowful  blind  maimed  and enslaved  who  are all stretching their hands to him  beneath is the tomb which the  artist executed for his mother  cornelia scheffer  whose touching  figure is represented lying with outstretched hands  in the utmost  abandonment of repose           the zuyder zee a      footnote a  from  holland and its people   translated by caroline  tilton  by special

extent of more than seven hundred square kilometers  six hundred  years ago was not in existence  north holland touched friesland  and  where the gulf now extends there was a vast region sprinkled with  fresh water lakes  the largest of which  the flevo  mentioned by  tacitus  was separated from the sea by a fertile and populous isthmus   whether the sea by its own force broke through the natural dikes  of the region  or whether the sinking of the land left it free to  invasion  is not certainly known  the great transformation was  completed during the course of the thirteenth century     about the formation of this gulf there has collected a varied and  confused history of cities destroyed and people drowned  to which has  been added in later times another history  of new cities rising on new  shores  becoming powerful and famous  and being in their turn reduced  to poor and mean villages  with streets overgrown with grass  and  sand choked ports  records of great calamities  wonderful traditions   fantastic horrors  strange usages and customs  are found upon the  waters and about the shores of this peculiar sea  born but yesterday   and already encircled with ruins and condemned to disappear  and a  month s voyage would not suffice to gather up the chief of them  but  the thought alone of beholding from a distance those decrepit  cities  those mysterious islands  those fatal sand banks  excited my  imagination        marken is as famous among the islands of the zuyder zee as broek  is among the villages of holland  but with all its fame  and altho  distant but one hour by boat from the coast  few are the strangers   and still fewer the natives who visit it  so said the captain as he  pointed out the lighthouse of the little island  and added that in his  opinion the reason was  that when a stranger arrived at marken  even  if he were a dutchman  he was followed by a crowd of boys  watched   and commented upon as if he were a man fallen from the moon  this  unusual curiosity is explained by a description of the island  it is a  bit of land about three thousand meters in length and one thousand  in width  which was detached from the continent in the thirteenth  century  and remains to this day  in the manners  and customs of its  inhabitants  exactly as it was six centuries ago     the surface of the island is but little higher than the sea  and it is  surrounded by a small dike which does not suffice to protect it  from inundation  the houses are built upon eight small artificial  elevations  and form as many boroughs  one of which  the one which has  the church  is the capital  and another the cemetery  when the sea  rises above the dike  the spaces between the little hills are changed  into canals  and the inhabitants go about in boats  the houses are  built of wood  some painted  some only pitched  one only is of stone   that of the pastor  who also has a small garden shaded by four large  trees  the only ones on the island  next to this house are the church   the school  and the municipal offices  the population is about one  thousand in number  and lives by fishing  with the exceptions of the  doctor  the pastor  and the school master  all are native to the  island  no islander marries on the continent  no one from the mainland  comes to live on the island     they all profess the reformed religion  and all know how to read and  write  in the schools more than two hundred boys and girls are taught  history  geography  and arithmetic  the fashion of dress  which has  not been changed for centuries  is the same for all  and extremely  curious  the men look like soldiers  they wear a dark gray cloth  jacket ornamented with two rows of buttons which are in general  medals  or ancient coins  handed down from father to son  this jacket  is tucked into the waistband of a pair of breeches of the same color   very wide about the hips and tight around the leg  fastening below the  knee  a felt hat or a fur cap  according to the season  a red cravat   black stockings  white wooden shoes  or a sort of slipper  complete  the costume     that of the women is still more peculiar  they wear on their heads an  enormous white cap in the form of a miter  all ornamented with lace  and needlework  and tied under the chin like a helmet  from under the  cap  which completely covers the ears  fall two long braided tresses   which hang over the bosom  and a sort of visor of hair comes down  upon the forehead  cut square just above the eyebrows  the dress is  composed of a waist without sleeves  and a petticoat of two colors   the waist is deep red  embroidered in colors and costing years of  labor to make  for which reason it descends from mother to daughter   from generation to generation  the upper part of the petticoat is gray  or blue striped with black  and the lower part dark brown  the arms  are covered almost to the elbow with sleeves of a white chemise   striped with red  the children are drest in almost the same way   tho there is some slight difference between girls and women  and on  holidays the costume is more richly ornamented           the art of holland a      footnote a  from  holland and its people   translated by caroline  tilton  by special arrangement with  and by permission of  the  publishers  g p  putnam s sons  copyright            by edmondo de amicis    the dutch school of painting has one quality which renders it  particularly attractive to us italians  it is of all others the most  different from our own  the very antithesis  or the opposite pole of  art  the dutch and italian schools are the two most original  or  as  has been said  the only two to which the title rigorously belongs   the others being only daughters  or younger sisters  more or less  resembling them  thus  even in painting holland offers that which is  most sought after in travel and in books of travel  the new     dutch painting was born with the liberty and independence of holland   as long as the northern and southern provinces of the low countries  remained under the spanish rule and in the catholic faith  dutch  painters painted like belgian painters  they studied in belgium   germany  and italy  heemskerk imitated michael angelo  bloemart  followed correggio  and  il moro  copied titian  not to indicate  others  and they were one and all pedantic imitators  who added to the  exaggerations of the italian style a certain german coarseness  the  result of which was a bastard style of painting  still inferior to  the first  childish  stiff in design  crude in color  and completely  wanting in chiaroscuro  but not  at least  a servile imitation  and  becoming  as it were  a faint prelude to the true dutch art that was  to be        after depicting the house  they turned their attention to the country   the stern climate allowed but a brief time for the admiration of  nature  but for this very reason dutch artists admired her all the  more  they saluted the spring with a livelier joy  and permitted that  fugitive smile of heaven to stamp itself more deeply on their fancy   the country was not beautiful  but it was twice dear because it had  been torn from the sea and from the foreign oppressor  the dutch  artist painted it lovingly  he represented it simply  ingenuously   with a sense of intimacy which at that time was not to be found in  italian or belgian landscape     the flat  monotonous country had  to the dutch painter s eyes  a  marvelous variety  he caught all the mutations of the sky  and knew  the value of the water  with its reflections  its grace and freshness   and its power of illuminating everything  having no mountains  he took  the dikes for background  and with no forests  he imparted to a simple  group of trees all the mystery of a forest  and he animated the whole  with beautiful animals and white sails     the subjects of their pictures are poor enough  a windmill  a canal   a gray sky   but how they make one think  a few dutch painters  not  content with nature in their own country  came to italy in search of  hills  luminous skies  and famous ruins  and another band of select  artists is the result  both  swanevelt  pynaeker  breenberg  van laer   asselyn  but the palm remains with the landscapists of holland  with  wynants the painter of morning  with van der neer the painter of  night  with rusydael the painter of melancholy  with hobbema the  illustrator of windmills  cabins  and kitchen gardens  and with others  who have restricted themselves to the expression of the enchantment of  nature as she is in holland     simultaneously with landscape art was born another kind of painting   especially peculiar to holland  animal painting  animals are the  wealth of the country  and that magnificent race of cattle which has  no rival in europe for fecundity and beauty  the hollanders  who owe  so much to them  treat them  one may say  as part of the population   they wash them  comb them  dress them  and love them dearly  they are  to be seen everywhere  they are reflected in all the canals  and dot  with points of black and white the immense fields that stretch on  every side  giving an air of peace and comfort to every place  and  exciting in the spectator s heart a sentiment of patriarchal serenity     the dutch artists studied these animals in all their varieties  in  all their habits  and divined  as one may say  their inner life and  sentiments  animating the tranquil beauty of the landscape with their  forms  rubens  luyders  paul de vos  and other belgian painters  had  drawn animals with admirable mastery  but all these are surpassed by  the dutch artists  van der velde  berghum  karel der jardin  and by  the prince of animal painters  paul potter  whose famous  bull   in  the gallery of the hague  deserves to be placed in the vatican beside  the  transfiguration  by rafael     in yet another field are the dutch painters great  the sea  the sea   their enemy  their power  and their glory  forever threatening their  country  and entering in a hundred ways into their lives and fortunes   that turbulent north sea  full of sinister colors  with a light of  infinite melancholy beating forever upon a desolate coast  must  subjugate the imagination of the artist  he  indeed  passes long hours  on the shore  contemplating its tremendous beauty  ventures upon its  waves to study the effects of tempests  buys a vessel and sails with  his wife and family  observing and making notes  follows the fleet  into battle  and takes part in the fight  and in this way are made  marine painters like william van der velde the elder  and william the  younger  like backhuysen  dubbels  and stork     another kind of painting was to arise in holland  as the expression of  the character of the people and of republican manners  a people that  without greatness had done so many great things  as michelet says   must have its heroic painters  if we call them so  destined to  illustrate men and events  but this school of painting  precisely  because the people were without greatness  or  to express it better   without form of greatness  modest  inclined to consider all equal  before the country  because all had done their duty  abhorring  adulation  and the glorification in one only of the virtues and the  triumph of many  this school has to illustrate not a few men who  have excelled  and a few extraordinary facts  but all classes of  citizenship gathered among the most ordinary and pacific of burgher  life     from this come the great pictures which represent five  ten  thirty  persons together  arquebusiers  mayors  officers  professors   magistrates  administrators  seated or standing around a table   feasting and conversing  of life size  most faithful likenesses   grave  open faces  expressing that secure serenity of conscience  by which may be divined rather than seen the nobleness of a life  consecrated to one s country  the character of that strong  laborious  epoch  the masculine virtues of that excellent generation  all this  set off by the fine costume of the time  so admirably combining grace  and dignity  those gorgets  those doublets  those black mantles  those  silken scarves and ribbons  those arms and banners  in this field  stand preeminent van der heist  hals  covaert  flink  and bol        finally  there are still two important excellences to be recorded  of this school of painting  its variety  and its importance as the  expression  the mirror  so to speak  of the country  if we except  rembrandt with his group of followers and imitators  almost all the  other artists differ very much from one another  no other school  presents so great a number of original masters  the realism of the  dutch painters is born of their common love of nature  but each one  has shown in his work a kind of love peculiarly his own  each one has  rendered a different impression which he has received from nature and  all  starting from the same point  which was the worship of material  truth  have arrived at separate and distinct goals           the tulips of holland a      footnote a  from  holland and its people   translated by caroline  tilton  by special arrangement with  and by permission of  the  publishers  g p  putnam s sons  copyright            by edmondo de amicis    the word  tulip  recalls one of the strangest popular follies that has  ever been seen in the world  which showed itself in holland toward  the middle of the seventeenth century  the country at that time had  reached the height of prosperity  antique parsimony had given place to  luxury  the houses of the wealthy  very modest at the beginning of  the century  were transformed into little palaces  velvet  silk  and  pearls replaced the patriarchal simplicity of the ancient costume   holland had become vain  ambitious  and prodigal     after having filled their houses with pictures  hangings  porcelain   and precious objects from all the countries of europe and asia  the  rich merchants of the large dutch cities began to spend considerable  sums in ornamenting their gardens with tulips  the flower which  answers best to that innate avidity for vivid colors which the dutch  people manifest in so many ways  this taste for tulips promoted their  rapid cultivation  everywhere gardens were laid out  studies promoted   new varieties of the favorite flower sought for  in a short time the  fever became general  on every side there swarmed unknown tulips  of  strange forms  and wonderful shades or combinations of colors  full of  contrasts  caprices  and surprises  prices rose in a marvelous way   a new variegation  a new form  obtained in those blest leaves was an  event  a fortune  thousands of persons gave themselves up to the study  with the fury of insanity  all over the country nothing was talked of  but petals  bulbs  colors  vases  seeds     the mania grew to such a pass that all europe was laughing at it   bulbs of the favorite tulips of the rarer varieties rose to fabulous  prices  some constituted a fortune  like a house  an orchard  or a  mill  one bulb was equivalent to a dowry for the daughter of a rich  family  for one bulb were given  in i know not what city  two carts  of grain  four carts of barley  four oxen  twelve sheep  two casks  of wine  four casks of beer  a thousand pounds of cheese  a complete  dress  and silver goblet  another bulb of a tulip named  semper  augustus  was bought at the price of thirteen thousand florins  a bulb  of the  admiral enkhuysen  tulip cost two thousand dollars  one day  there were only two bulbs of the  semper augustus  left in holland   one at amsterdam and the other at haarlem  and for one of them there  were offered  and refused  four thousand six hundred florins  a  splendid coach  and a pair of gray horses with beautiful harness   another offered twelve acres of land  and he also was refused  on the  registers of alkmaar it is recorded that in      there were sold in  that city  at public auction  one hundred and twenty tulips for the  benefit of the orphanage  and that the sale produced one hundred and  eighty thousand francs     then they began to traffic in tulips  as in state bonds and shares   they sold for enormous sums bulbs which they did not possess  engaging  to provide them for a certain day  and in this way a traffic was  carried on for a much larger number of tulips than the whole of  holland could furnish  it is related that one dutch town sold twenty  millions of francs  worth of tulips  and that an amsterdam merchant  gained in this trade more than sixty eight thousand florins in the  space of four months  these sold that which they had not  and those  that which they never could have  the market passed from hand to hand   the differences were paid  and the flowers for and by which so many  people were ruined or enriched  flourished only in the imagination of  the traffickers  finally matters arrived at such a pass that  many  buyers having refused to pay the sums agreed upon  and contests and  disorders following  the government decreed that these debts should be  considered as ordinary obligations  and that payment should be exacted  in the usual legal manner  then prices fell suddenly  as low as fifty  florins for the  semper augustus   and the scandalous traffic ceased     now the culture of flowers is no longer a mania  but is carried on for  love of them  and haarlem is the principal temple  she still provides  a great part of europe and south america with flowers  the city is  encircled by gardens  which  toward the end of april and the beginning  of may  are covered with myriads of tulips  hyacinths  carnations   auriculas  anemones  ranunculuses  camelias  primroses  and other  flowers  forming an immense wreath about haarlem  from which travelers  from all parts of the world gather a bouquet in passing  of late years  the hyacinth has risen into great honor  but the tulip is still king  of the gardens  and holland s supreme affection     i should have to change my pen for the brush of van der huysem or  menedoz  if i were to attempt to describe the pomp of their gorgeous   luxuriant  dazzling colors  which  if the sensation given to the eye  may be likened to that of the ear  might be said to resemble a shout  of joyous laughter or a cry of love in the green silence of the  garden  affecting one like the loud music of a festival  there are  to be seen the  duke of toll  tulip  the tulips called  simple  precocious  in more than six hundred varieties  the  double  precocious   the late tulips  divided into unicolored  fine   superfine  and rectified  the fine  subdivided into violet  rose   and striped  then the monsters or parrots  the hybrids  the thieves   classified into a thousand orders of nobility and elegance  tinted  with all the shades of color conceivable to the human mind  spotted   speckled  striped  edged  variegated  with leaves fringed  waved   festooned  decorated with gold and silver medals  distinguished by  names of generals  painters  birds  rivers  poets  cities  queens   and a thousand loving and bold adjectives  which recall their  metamorphoses  their adventures  and their triumphs  and leave in the  mind a sweet confusion of beautiful images and pleasant thoughts               ii  brown s caller  one of many         iii  brown s borrowed baby          iv  brown s sister sue           v  brown s unborrowed baby          vi  brown s persistent

brown himself      brown was so tall and thin  and his study was so low and square  that the  one in the other seemed a misfit     there was not much in the study  a few shelves of books  not all learned  books by any means  three chairs  one of them a rocker cushioned in a  cheerful red  a battered old desk  a broad and rather comfortable looking  couch  this was nearly all the study s furniture  there was a fireplace  with a crumbling old hearth stone  and usually a roaring fire within  and  a chimney piece above  where stood a few photographs and some odd looking  articles of apparently small value  on the walls were two small  portraits  of an elderly man and woman     this was absolutely all there was in the room worth mentioning  except  when brown was in it  then  of course  there was brown  this is not a  truism  it is a large  significant fact  when you had once seen brown in  his study you knew that the room would be empty when he was out of it  no  matter who remained  not that brown was such a big  broad shouldered   dominating figure of a man  he was so tall and thin of figure that he  looked almost gaunt  and so spare and dark of face that he appeared  almost austere  yet when you observed him closely he did not seem really  austere  for out of his eyes  of a clear  deep gray  looked not only  power but sympathy  and not only patience but humour  his mouth was  clean cut and strong  and it could smile in a rather wonderful way  as to  the years he had spent  they might have been thirty  or forty  or twenty   according to the hour in which one met him  as a matter of fact he was   at the beginning of this history  not very far along in the thirties   though when that rather wonderful smile of his was not in evidence one  might have taken him for somewhat older     i had forgotten  besides brown when he was in the study there was  usually  also  bim  also long and lean  also brown  with a rough  shaggy  coat and the suggestion of collie blood about him  though he was plainly  a mixture of several breeds  bim belonged to brown  and to brown s  immediate environment  whenever bim himself was able to accomplish it   when he was not able he was accustomed to wait patiently outside the door  of brown s small bachelor abode  this door opened directly from the  street into the brown study     the really curious thing about the study was that nobody in that quarter  of the big city knew it was a study  they called the place simply    brown s    who brown himself was they did not know  either  he had  come to live in the little old house about a year ago  he was dressed so  plainly  and everything about him  including his manner  was of such an  unobtrusive simplicity  that he attracted little attention  at first   soon his immediate neighbours were on terms of interested  acquaintanceship with him  though how they got there they could not  themselves have told  it had never occurred to them to wonder  the thing  had come about naturally  somehow  presently others besides his immediate  neighbours knew brown  had become friends of brown  they never wondered  how it had happened     the brown study had many callers  it was by now thoroughly used to them   for it had all sorts  every day of the month  at any hour of the day  at  almost any hour of the night           ii    brown s caller  one of many      a caller had just come stumbling in out of the november murk  half blind  with weariness and unhappiness and general discouragement  brown had  welcomed him heartily      it s nothing in particular   growled the other man  presently   and it s  everything  i m down and out       lost your job       no  but i m going to lose it       how do you know       every thing points that way       what  for instance       oh  i can t tell you  so you d understand       am i so thick headed   brown asked the question seriously  his eyes   keen  yet full of sympathetic interest  rested inquiringly upon his  caller s face      it s in the air  that s all i can say  i wouldn t be surprised to be  fired any minute  after eight years  service  and  it s got on my nerves  so i can t do decent work  even to keep up my own self respect till i do  go  and what i m to do afterward       brown was silent  looking into the fire  his caller shifted in his chair   he had shifted already a dozen times since he sat down  his nervous hands  gripped the worn arms of the rocker restlessly  unclosing only to take  fresh hold  until the knuckles shone white      there s the wife   said brown presently     the caller groaned aloud in his unhappiness      and the kiddies       god  yes       i meant to mention him   said brown  in a quietly matter of fact way    i m glad you thought of him  he s in this situation  too      the caller s brow grew black   that s one thing i came to say to you  i m  through with all that  no use to give me any of it  i don t believe in  it  that s all      brown considered him  apparently not in the least shocked  the caller s  clothes were very nearly shabby  certainly ill kept  his shoes had not  been blackened that day  he needed a hair cut  his sensitive  thin face  was sallow  and there were dark circles under his moody eyes     brown got up and went out by a door which opened beside the  chimney piece into the room behind  which was his kitchen  he stirred  about there for some time  then he invited jennings out  there were  crisply fried bacon and eggs  and toast and steaming coffee ready for  the two men  brown s cookery     they sat down  and brown bowed his head     his companion did not bow his but he dropped his eyes  letting his glance  rest upon the bacon       lord   said brown simply    we ask thy blessing on this food  give us  food for our souls  as well  we need it  amen       then he looked up at the caller   pitch in  jennings   said he  and set  the example     for a man who professed to have had his supper jennings did pretty well     when the meal was over brown sent jennings back to the fireside while he  himself washed the dishes  when he rejoined his visitor jennings looked  up with a sombre face      life s just what that card a fellow tacked up in the office one day says  it is     one damned thing after another     he asserted grimly   there s  no use trying to see any good in it all      brown looked up quickly  into his eyes leaped a sudden look of  understanding  and of more than understanding  anger with something  or  some one  but his voice was quiet      so somebody s put that card up in your office  too  i wonder how many of  them there are tacked up in offices all over the country       a good many  i guess       i suppose every time you look up at it  it convinces you all over  again   remarked brown  he picked up the poker  and leaning forward began  to stir the fire      i don t need convincing  i know it  i ve experienced it  god   i ve had  reason to       if you don t believe in him   brown was poking vigorously now   why  bring him into the conversation      jennings laughed  a short  ugly laugh   that sounds like you  always  putting a fellow in a corner  i use the word  i suppose  to        to give force to what you say  it does it  in a way  but it s not the  way you use it when you address him  is it       i don t address him   jennings s tone was defiant     brown continued lightly to poke the fire   about that card   said he    i ve often wondered just how many poor chaps it s been responsible for  putting down and out      jennings stared   oh  it s just a joke  i laughed the first time  i saw it       and the second time       i don t remember  the fellows were all laughing over it when it first  came out       it  was  a clever thing  a tremendously clever thing  for a man to think  of saying  there s so much humour in it  to a man who happened to be  already feeling that way  one can see just how it would cheer him up   give him courage  brace him to take a fresh hold      jennings grunted   oh  well  if you re going to take every joke with such  deadly seriousness        you took it lightly  did you  it s seemed like a real joke to you  it s  grown funnier and funnier every day  each time it caught your eye      but now jennings groaned   no  it hasn t  but that s because it s too  true to keep on seeming funny      brown suddenly brought his fist down on the arm of jennings s rocker  with a thump which made his nerve strung visitor jump in his chair   it   isn t  true  it s not the saying of a brave man  it s the whine of a  coward  brave men don t say that sort of thing  the sort of thing they do  say  sometimes to other men  oftener to themselves alone  is what a  famous englishman said    if you do fight  fight it out  and don t give  in while you can stand and see    how s that for a motto  if that had  been tacked on the wall in your office all this while  would it have made  you feel like giving up  every time you looked at it      brown s eyes were glowing  jennings had slumped down in his chair  his  head on his hand  his face partly hidden from his host  there was silence  in the room     brown kept jennings overnight  making a bed for him on his couch  where  he could see the fire  as jennings sat on the couch  ready to turn in   brown came out from his bedroom  a long figure in his bathrobe and  slippers  and knelt down before the old rocking chair  jennings  in his  surprise  sat perfectly still  looking at him  he could see brown s lean   strong face in profile  the fine head  it was a very fine head  though  perhaps jennings did not appreciate that  a little lifted  the eyes  closed  brown prayed in a conversational tone  as if the one he addressed  were in the room above  with an opening between     then he rose  a little tender smile on his face  said   good night   old man   and went away into the inner room  the door of which he did  not close     what did he leave behind him  what was in the air  was this a common  room  a homely room  lighted only by a smoldering fire  what was it which  suddenly and unaccountably gripped george jennings s heart  so that a sob  rose in his throat  what made him want to cry  like a schoolboy  with his  head on his arms  with all his long misery  tears had never once come to  his relief  his heart had been hard and his eyes dry  now  somehow  he  felt something give way                                                 jennings slept all night  and came out to breakfast with a queer   shamefaced aspect  yet with considerably less heaviness of foot than he  had shown the night before  he ate heartily  as well he might  for the  food was extremely appetizing  when he got up to go he stood still by his  chair  seeming to be trying to say something  seeing this  brown came  over to him and put his hand on his shoulder      yes  lad   said he interrogatively  he was smiling and the smile  transformed his face  as always      i  feel better  this morning   stammered jennings   i  want to thank  you  i m ashamed of the way i talked last night  it was as you said  i  knew better  but i couldn t seem to  to       brown nodded   of course you knew better   he said heartily   we all  know better  every man prays  at some time or other  it s when we stop  praying that things get dark  begin again  and something happens  it   always  happens  and sometimes the thing that happens is that we get a  good sleep and are able to see things differently in the morning   good bye  and come back to night       shall i   jennings asked eagerly      surely  we ll have oysters to night  roasted on the half shell over the  coals in the fireplace  like  em       i never ate any that way   admitted jennings   it sounds good   and he  smiled broadly  a real smile at last      wait till you try them   promised brown           iii    brown s borrowed baby      on the following saturday  at five in the afternoon  the previous hours  having been filled with a long list of errands of all sorts  yet all  having to do with people  and the people s affairs  seldom his own  brown  turned his steps home ward  the steps lagged a little  for he was tired     at the house next his own  a shabby little house  yet with rows of  blooming scarlet geraniums in tin cans on its two lower window sills  and  clean  if patched  muslin curtains behind the plants  brown turned in  once more  standing in the kitchen doorway he put a question      mrs  kelcey  may i borrow norah for an hour      the person addressed looked up from her work  grinned a broad irish  grin  pushed back a lock of bothersome hair with a soapy hand  and  answered heartily      to be shure ye may  misther brown  i says to mesilf an hour ago  i says    happen he ll come for nory to night  it bein  saturday night  an  him  bein  apt to come of a saturday night   so i give her her bath early  to  get her out o  the way before the bhoys come home  so it s clane she is   if she ain t got into no mischief the half hour      she dashed into the next room and returned triumphant  her youngest  daughter on her arm  five minutes later brown bore little norah kelcey  into his bachelor domain  wrapped in her mother s old plaid shawl  her  blue eyes looking expectantly from its folds  it was not the first time  she had paid a visit to the place  she remembered what there was in store  for her there  she was just two years old  was norah  a mere slip of an  irish baby  with a tangled mop of dark curls above eyes of deep blue set  in bewildering lashes  and with a mouth like a freshly budded rose     brown withdrew the shawl and knelt on the floor before her  bim  who had  welcomed the two with eagerness  sat down beside them      you see  bim   explained his master   i had to have something human to  love for an hour or two  you re pretty nearly human  i know  but not  quite  norah is human  she s flesh and blood  a fellow gets starved for  the touch of flesh and blood sometimes  bim      he bent over the child  then he lifted her again and bore her into his  bedroom  clean and wholesome she was without question  but he disliked  the faint odour of laundry soap which hung about her  smiling at her   playing with her  making a game of it  he gently bathed the little face  and neck  the plump arms and hands  using a clear toilet soap with a most  delicate suggestion of fragrance  when he brought her back to his  fireside she was a small honey pot for sweetness and daintiness  and fit  for the caresses she was sure to get     brown sat down with her upon his knee  he had given her a tiny doll to  snuggle in her arms  and she was quiet as a kitten      norah   said he  speaking softly   you are adorable  your eyes are the  colour of deep sea water and they make havoc with my heart  that heart   by the way  is soft as melting snow to night  norah  it s longing for all  the old things  longing so hard it aches like a bruise  it s done its  best to be stoical about this exile  but there are times when stoicism is  a failure  this is one of those times  norah baby  would you mind very  much if i kiss the back of your little neck      norah did not mind in the least      all right  little human creature   said brown  placing her upon the  hearth rug to play with bim s silky brown ears   you ve given me as much  comfort as one of us is likely to give another  in a world where  everybody starves for something he can t have  and only god knows what  the fight for self denial costs  shall we have supper now  norah and bim   milk for norah  bones for bim  meat for donald brown  and a prayer for  pluck and patience for us all            iv    brown s sister sue      it was a rainy  windy  november night  brown and bim were alone  together  temporarily  suddenly  above the howling of the wind sounded  sharply the clap of the old knocker on the door  brown laid down his  book  reluctantly  for he was human  a woman s figure  clad from head to  foot in furs  sprang from the car at the curb  ran across the sidewalk   and in at the open door      go back to the hotel and come for me at twelve  simpson   she said to  her chauffeur as she passed him  and the next moment she was inside the  house and had flung the door heavily shut behind her      o don   she cried  and assailed the tall figure before her with a furry  embrace  which was returned with a right good will      well  well  sue girl  have you driven seventy miles to see me    was brown s response  bim  circling madly around the pair  barked  his emotion      is this    began brown s visitor  glancing rapidly about her as she  released herself   is this    she began again  and stopped helplessly   then   o don   she said once more  and again   o don    and laughed      yes  i know   said brown  smiling   here  let me take off your furs   it s pretty warm here  i imagine  bim and i are apt to keep a lot of wood  on the fire       bim       at your feet  and your service      the lady looked at the dog  who stood watching her      your only companion  don   she asked      my best chum  he s so nearly human he understands at this moment that  you don t think him handsome  never mind  we re used to it  aren t we   bim  come over and take this chair  sue  are you cold  would you like  something hot  tea  or coffee      she sat in the chair he drew to the fire for her  as he looked at his  sister s charming  youthful face  and saw her sitting there in her  handsome street dress with its various little indications of wealth and  fashion  the gold meshed purse on its slender chain  the rare jewel in  the brooch at the throat  the flashing rings on the white hands  he drew  in his breath in an incredulous little whistle      is it really you  sis   he said   you look pretty good to me  do you  know  sitting there in my old chair      she glanced at the arm of the old rocker  worn smooth by the rubbing of  many hands      why do you have such a chair   she answered impatiently  or so it  sounded   why in the world  if you must live in a hovel like this  don t  you make yourself comfortable  send home for some easy chairs  and rugs  and pictures   her eye wandered about the room   and a decent  desk  and  and  a well bred dog      he laughed   a better bred dog  in one sense  than bim you couldn t  find  his manners are finer than those of most men  and as for this being  a hovel  you do it injustice  it was built at the beginning of the last  century by a titled englishman  who used it for an office on his estate   look at the big oak beams  look at the floor  the doors  the fireplace   it s a distinguished little old house  sue  admit it      she shook her head   i ll admit nothing  except that you are the most  eccentric fellow who ever lived  to come off here and stay all by  yourself  when you ve been the idol of a congregation like st   timothy s  and might still be their idol  if you would take just a little  more assistance and not kill yourself with work  i ve no patience with  you  don      he did not reply to this  instead  he asked again gently   shall it be  tea or coffee  sue   he stood in the doorway which led to the kitchen and  added  as she hesitated  that he could give her an excellent brand of  either   coffee  then   she chose  and sat staring into the fire until  her brother returned with his earthenware pot and the other essentials  for the brewing of coffee  all set forth on a small tray  when   presently  he offered her a fragrant cup  she drank it eagerly      that  is  good   she declared   i didn t know you could cook  when did  you learn       on my vacations in the woods  the guides taught me  lafitte was a  wonderful cook  with certain limitations  i ve picked up a few other  tricks as well  would you like something to eat       no  thank you      she had studied him with attention as he knelt before the fire   noting every detail of his appearance  she now put a question which  she had reserved      just how well are you now      he looked up   don t i look well enough to satisfy you       i can t tell  you are frightfully thin        i never was anything else       do you think this sort of thing is doing as much to make you well as  doctor brainard s prescription of a voyage and stay in the south seas       much more       you must be dreadfully lonely      he was sitting  turk fashion  on the hearth rug before her  his long  legs crossed beneath him  his hands clasping his knees  with the  firelight playing over his face and touching the thrown back chestnut  locks of his heavy hair with high lights here and there  he looked  decidedly boyish  at her suggestion of his probable loneliness he smiled  and glanced at bim      bim   said he  addressing a curled up mass of rough brown hair from  which looked out two watchful brown eyes  and which responded instantly  to the name by resolving itself into an approaching dog   are we ever  lonely  rarely  sue  as a matter of fact  we have a good many callers   first and last       what sort of callers       neighbours  and friends       you are in a horribly poor locality  i noticed as i came through  do you  mean that you encourage these people to come to see you       we use all the drawing powers we have  bim and i       do you mean to say   said she  bending forward   that you are conducting  a  mission   here  in this place  when you ought to be just trying to get  well  oh  what would doctor brainard say   her tone was full of  consternation     brown threw back his head and laughed  a big  hearty laugh which did not  sound at all like that of an invalid      brainard seems to be your special anxiety   he said   send him down to  see me  i ll make him some flapjacks  if there s any one who appreciates  good cookery it s brainard       don   said his sister slowly  studying the face before her   what are  you trying to do       accomplish a little something while i m marking time       you ought to be resting       i am  this is child s play  compared with the parish of st  timothy s   and it s lots more fun       you re an ascetic       never  no crusts and water for me  coffee and flapjacks every time      once more she bent toward him   you are an ascetic  to live in this  place  and wear  what are you wearing  old clothes and a  what on earth  is that scarf pin  a ten cent piece      he put up his hand   benson  the little old watchmaker on the corner   gave me that  no  it s not a dime  it pleases him immensely to see me  wear it  it s not bad  sue  nonsense       it s not good  cheap      he sat smiling up at her  while she regarded him in silence for a minute   then she broke out again      why   why  do you do it  haven t you worked hard enough in your great  parish  without allowing yourself to spoil this rest you so much need       sue   said her brother   the best cure for certain kinds of overwork is  merely more work  only of a different sort  i can t be idle and  contented  can you       idle  i should like to be idle  i m rushed to death  all the time  it s  killing me       dressmakers and hairdressers  and dinners and bridge and the whole  routine of your set   said he   it is indeed a hard life  i wonder you  stand it       don t be ironic       i m not ironic  i realized  long ago  that it s the hardest life in the  world  and pays the least      she flushed   i have my charities   she reminded him   i m not utterly  useless  and my clubs  belonging to them is a duty i owe other women  i  try to fulfill it       but you re not happy       happy  i ve forgotten the meaning of the word  to tell the honest  truth  don  i ve been feeling for a long while that i didn t care  how  soon it ended       poor little sister      a crashing blow upon the door startled mrs  breckenridge so that she  cried out under her breath  brown went to the door  a furious gust of  wind hurled it wide open beneath his hand  but there was no one upon the  doorstep  no one  at his feet lay a bundle  from which sounded a wailing  cry  he picked it up  looked up and down a vacant street  closed the  door  and came back to sue breckenridge by the fire      i wonder if they chose the bachelor s doorstep by chance or by  intention   he said           v    brown s unborrowed baby       don  don t take it in  they ll come back for it if you don t  they re  watching somewhere  put it back on the doorstone  don t look at it       why  sue   he answered  and for an instant his eyes flashed reproof into  hers   on such a night       but what can you do with it       make it comfortable  first      he was unwrapping the bundle  the child was swathed none too heavily in  clean cotton comforters  it was crying frantically  and its hands  as  brown s encountered them in the unwinding  were cold and blue  there  emerged from the wrappings an infant of possibly six weeks  existence in  a world which had used it ill      will you take him while i get some milk   asked brown  as naturally as  if handing crying babies over to his sister were an everyday affair with  them both     she shook her head  backing away   oh  mercy  no  i shouldn t know what  to do with it       sue   her brother s tone was suddenly stern   don t be that sort of  woman  don t let me think it of you      he continued to hold out the small wailing bundle  she bit her lip   reluctantly extended unaccustomed arms  and received the foundling  into them      sit down close by the fire  my dear  and get those frozen little hands  warm  a bit of mothering won t hurt either of you   and brown strode away  into the kitchen with a frown between his brows  he was soon back with a  small cupful of warm milk and water  a teaspoon  and a towel      do you expect to feed a tiny baby with a teaspoon   sue asked  with scorn      you don t know much about babies  do you  sue  well  i may have some  trouble  but it s too late to get any other equipment from my neighbours   and i ll try my luck   she watched with amazement the proceedings which  followed  brown sat down with the baby cradled on his left arm  tucked  the half unfolded towel beneath its chin  and with the cup conveniently  at hand upon the table began to convey the milk  drop by drop  to the  little mouth      i don t see how you dare do it  you might choke the child to death       not a bit  he ll swallow a lot of atmosphere and it may give him a pain   but that s better than starving  isn t it  baby       you act as if you had half a dozen of your own  what in the world do you  know about babies       enough to puff me up with pride  mrs  murdison  my right hand neighbour   is the mother of five  mrs  kelcey  on my left  has six  and two of them  are twins  one twin was desperately ill a while ago  i became well  acquainted with it  and with the other five       don   again his sister gazed at him as if she found him past  comprehension   you   you   what would your friends  our friends  say  if  they knew      putting down the teaspoon and withdrawing the towel  brown snuggled the  baby in his left arm  warmth and food had begun their work in soothing  the little creature  and it was quiet  its eyelids drooping heavily     he got up  carried the baby to the couch  with one hand arranged a  steamer rug lying there so that it made a warm nest  and laid the small  bundle in it     then he returned to his chair by the fire  he lifted his eyes for a long   keen look into his sister s face  until she stirred restlessly under the  inspection      well  what do you see   she asked      i see   said brown slowly   a woman who is trying to live without  remembering her immortality      she shivered suddenly  there before the blazing fire   i m not sure that  i believe in it   she said fiercely   now i ve shocked you  don  but i  can t help it  i m not sure of anything  these days  that s why        why you want to forget  but you can t forget  and the reason why you  can t forget is because you do believe in it  every day people are trying  to forget one of the greatest facts in the universe  they may deny it  with their lips  but with their hearts they know it is true      she did not answer  her brother drew his chair closer  leaned forward   and took one of the jewelled hands in his  he spoke very gently  and in  his voice was a certain quality of persuasion which belongs not to all  voices which would persuade      sue  make room in your life for a little child  you need him      her glance evaded his  flashed past his to the small  still bundle on the  couch  then  suddenly  into her unhappy eyes leaped a suspicion  she  straightened in her chair      you don t mean  you re not suggesting       he smiled  comprehending   no  no  nothing like that  your heart isn t  big enough for that  yet  it s the mothers of children who make room for  the waifs  or those who have long been mothers in heart and have been  denied  you don t belong to either of those classes  do you      she drew a stifled breath   you don t know what you are talking about   don  how could you  a bachelor like you       couldn t i  well  sue  if fathers may be divided into the same two  classes  i might be found in one of them      she stared at him   you  oh  i can t believe it  you could have  married long ago  if you had wanted to  you could have married  anybody  simply anybody       you do me too much honour  or discredit  i m not just sure which       but it s true  with your position  and your money  rich and brilliant  clergymen aren t so common  donald brown  and your personality  your  magnetism  men care for you  women have always hung on your words      he made a gesture of distaste  got up      sterility of soul is a worse thing than sterility of body   said he    but sometimes  god cures the one when he cures the other       but you never prescribed this strange thing before      he smiled   i ve been learning some things out here  sue  that i never  learned before  one of them is how near god is to a little child       you ve learned that  of your neighbours   her accent was indescribable      of my neighbours  and friends      it was time for her to go  he helped her into her great fur coat and  himself fastened it in place  when she was ready she turned from the  window from which she had tried in vain to see her surroundings  and  threw at her brother a question which seemed to take him unawares      don  do you know anything about helena these days      though his face did not change  something about him suggested the mental  bracing of himself for a shock  he shook his head      she s dropped everything she used to care for  nobody knows why  her  mother s in despair about her  you know what a society leader mrs   forrest has always been  she can t understand helena  nor can anybody       she s not ill       apparently not  she s as wonderful to look at as ever  when one meets  her  which one seldom does  the girls say she walks miles every day   so she must be well in body  though even that doesn t assure mrs   forrest  i thought  possibly  you might know  you and helena used to  be such friends       we are still  i hope      his sister s eyes were not easily to be deceived  and they were positive  they saw pain in the eyes which met her own      don   she said softly   may i ask you one question       please don t       when you were a little boy  and you got hurt in any way  you used to run  away and hide  are you  hiding now      his eyes grew dark with sudden anger  but he replied with self control      you will have to think what you like about that  sue  if that is the way  the thing looks to you  so be it      the sound of the returning car made mrs  breckenridge speak hurriedly      i didn t mean to be unkind  don boy  nobody knows better than i that you  are no coward  only  only  you know an ascetic denies himself things that  he needn t  and  you  are  an ascetic       can i never convince you of your mistake about that   he answered  and  now his lips smiled again  a little stiffly     she embraced him once more  stopped to say beseechingly   you won t keep  that baby here  will you  don   and  receiving his assurance that he  would consult with his neighbours in the morning as to the welfare of the  foundling  took her departure     left alone brown went back into the quiet room  the baby was stirring  among its wrappings  bim  who had roused himself to see the visitor off   came and poked his nose into the bundle      we never know what s coming  bim  do we   asked brown of his  companion   sometimes it s what we want  and sometimes not  but  if we  are to teach others we must be taught ourselves  bim  and that s what s  happening now            vi    brown s persistent memory       i wonder   he said to himself an hour later   if it s any use to go to  bed at all   he was walking the floor with the baby in his arms  bim   puzzled and anxious  walked by his side  looking up at the small bundle  with a glance which seemed to say   what in the world are we going to  do with it      whether the feeding from the teaspoon had disagreed with its digestion  could not be discovered  but clearly the baby was unhappy  it was quiet  when walked with but upon being put down immediately set up such an  outcry that the bachelor  unaccustomed  could not listen to it with  stoicism  therefore  when he had endured the sound as long as he could   he had taken the little visitor up and was now walking with it  himself  in bathgown and slippers      it may be a pin  bim   said he suddenly     he sat down before the fire  laid the baby upon its face on his knees  and began cautiously to investigate  he loosened the tiny garments one  by one  until he had reached the little body and could assure himself  that no sharp point was responsible for the baby s discomfort  he  gently rubbed the small back  wondering  as he did so  at the  insignificant area his hand nearly covered  under this treatment the  wailing gradually quieted      bim   said he resignedly   we shall have to sit up with him  for a  while  at least      bim walked over to the window      no   said his master   we can t disturb our neighbours at this time of  night  we must see it through  if we can manage to read  it will make the  time go faster      he reached for a book  opened it at a mark  and began to read  his hand   meanwhile  steadily maintaining the soothing motion up and down the  baby s back  but his thoughts were not upon the page  instead  they took  hold upon one phrase his sister had used  one phrase  which had brought  up to him a certain face as vividly as the sudden presentation of a  portrait might have done       she s as wonderful to look at as ever       was she  well  she had been wonderful to look at  there could be no  question of that  he had looked at her  and looked  and looked again   until his eyes had blurred with the dazzle of the vision  and having  looked  there could be no possible forgetting  no merciful blotting out  of the recollection of that face  he had tried to forget it  to forget  the whole absorbing personality  had tried with all his strength  but the  thing could not be done  it seemed to him sometimes that the very effort  to efface that image only cut its outlines deeper into his memory     the baby began to cry afresh  with sudden  sharp insistence  brown took  it up and strode the floor with it again      poor little chap   he murmured   you can t have what you want  and  i can t have what i want  but it doesn t do a bit of good to cry  about it  eh      the knocker sounded  bim growled      at this hour   thought brown  with a glance at his watch lying on the  table  it was nearly two in the morning     holding the baby in the crook of his arm he crossed the floor and opened  the door gingerly  sheltering the baby behind it      is it the toothache  misther brown   inquired an eagerly pitiful voice    or warse      mrs  kelcey came in  her shawl covering her unbound hair  his next door  neighbour and little norah s mother  her face was full of astonishment at  sight of brown in his bathgown and the baby in his arms      i m mighty glad to see you   brown assured her   i don t know what to do  with him  poor little fellow  i think it must be a pain       the saints and ahl   said mrs  kelcey  she took the baby from him with  wonted  motherly arms   the teeny thing   she exclaimed   where        left on my doorstep       an  ye thried to get through the night with him  why didn t ye bring him  to me at wanst       it was late  your lights were out  how did you know i was up       yer lights wasn t out  i was up with me man  pat s a sore fut  an  i was  bathin  it to quiet him  i seen yer lights  ye sit up till ahl hours  i  know  but i cud see the shadow movin  up and down  i says to pat   he s  the toothache  maybe  and me with plinty of rimidies nixt door       she turned her attention to the tiny creature in her lap  she  inquired into the case closely  and learned how the child had been  fed with a teaspoon      to think of a single man so handy   she exclaimed admiringly   but maybe  he shwallied a bit too much air with the feedin        he swallowed all the air there was at hand   admitted brown   and  precious little milk  but he seemed hungry  and i thought he was too  little to go all night without being fed       right ye were  an   tis feedin  he nades agin  only not with a shpoon   i ll take him home an  fix up a bit of a bottle for him  the poor thing   an  i ll take him at wanst  an  let ye get to bed  where ye belong  by  the looks of ye       you re an angel  mrs  kelcey  i hate to let you take him  with all you  have on your hands        shure   tis the hands that s full that can always hold a bit more  an  a  single man can t be bothered with cast off childher  no matter how big  his heart is  as we well know      and mrs  kelcey departed  with the baby under her shawl and a motherly  look for the man who opened the door for her and stood smiling at her in  the lamplight as she went away     but when he had thrown himself  at last  on his bed  wearily longing for  rest  he found he had still to wrestle a while with the persistent image  of the face which was  wonderful to look at   before kindly slumber  would efface it with the gray mists of oblivion           vii    brown s financial resources       there  tom  how s that  does it droop as much as the one on the  other side      tom kelcey  aged fourteen  squinted critically at the long festoon of  ground pine between the centre of the chimney breast and the angle of the  dingy old oak beamed ceiling      drop her a couple of inches  misther brown   he suggested   no  not so  much  there  that s the shtuff  now you ve got her  foine and dandy      brown stepped down from the chair on which he had been standing  and  stood off with tom to view the effect      yes  that s exactly right   said he   thanks to your good eye  the room  looks pretty well  eh  quite like having a dinner party       it s ilegant  misther brown  that s what it is   said a voice in the  doorway behind them   tom bhoy  be afther takin  the chair back to the  kitchen for him      mrs  kelcey  mother of tom  and next door neighbour to brown  advanced  into the room  she was laden with a big basket  which brown  perceiving   immediately took from her      set it down careful  man   said she   the crust on thim pies is that  delicate it won t bear joltin   i had the saints  own luck with  em this  toime  praise be       that s great   said brown   but i haven t worried about that  you never  have anything else  i m sure      mrs  kelcey shook her head in delighted protest      the table is jist the handsomest i iver laid eyes on   she asserted   modestly changing the subject      it is pretty nice  isn t it   agreed brown warmly  surveying the table  with mixed emotions  when he stopped to think of what mrs  hugh  breckenridge would say at sight of that table  set for the thanksgiving  dinner her brother  donald brown  was giving that afternoon  he  experienced a peculiar sensation in the region of his throat  he was  possessed of a vivid sense of humour which at times embarrassed him  sorely  if it had not been that his bigness of heart kept his love of  fun in order he would have had great difficulty  now and then  in  comporting himself with necessary gravity     mrs  kelcey herself had arranged that table  spending almost the entire  preceding day in dashing about the neighbourhood  borrowing from brown s  neighbours the requisite articles  brown s own stock of blue and white  ware proving entirely inadequate  besides being in mrs  kelcey s eyes by  no means fine enough for the occasion  she had unhesitatingly  requisitioned every piece of china she could lay hands on in the  neighbourhood  she had had no difficulty whatever in borrowing more than  enough  for every woman in the block who knew brown was eager to lend her  best  the result was such an array of brilliantly flowered plates and  cups and dishes of every style and shape  that one s gaze  once riveted  thereon  could with difficulty be removed     when brown had first conceived this festival it had been with the idea  of sending to the nearest city for a full equipment  if an inexpensive  one  of all the china and glass  linen and silver necessary for the  serving of the meal  but upon thinking it over it occurred to him that  such an outlay would not only arouse his new friends  suspicion of his  financial resources  it would deprive them of one of the chief joys in  such a neighbourhood as this in which he was abiding  that of the  personal sharing in the details of the dinner s preparation and the proud  lending of their best in friendly rivalry     therefore the table  as it now stood before him in all but complete  readiness for the feast  bore such witness to the warmth of esteem in  which the neighbourhood held him  not to mention its resourcefulness in  fitting together adjuncts not originally intended for partnership  as  must have touched the heart of a dinner giver less comprehending than  donald brown  late of st  timothy s great and prosperous parish     to begin with  the table itself had been set up in its place in the front  room by tim lukens the carpenter  who when he was sober was one of the  cleverest of artisans  starting with two pairs of sawhorses and  continuing with smooth pine boards  he had constructed a table of goodly  proportions and of a solidity calculated to withstand successfully the  demand likely to be made upon it  over this table top mrs  kelcey had  laid  without thought  it must be admitted  of any intermediary padding  such as certain mistaken hostesses consider essential  three freshly and  painstakingly laundered tablecloths  her own  mrs  murdison s  and mrs   lukens s best  cunningly united by stitches hardly discoverable except by  a too searching eye     the foundations thus laid  the setting of the table had been a delightful  task for mrs  kelcey  assisted as she was by mrs  murdison  who  frequently differed from her in points of arrangement but who yielded  most of them upon hearing  as she frequently did  mrs  kelcey s verbal  badge of office   misther brown put me in charge  missus murdison  he  says to me  he says   missus kelcey  do jist as ye think best    together  the two had achieved a triumph  and the table now stood forth glowingly  ready for its sixteen guests  from the splendid bunch of scarlet  geraniums in an immense pink and blue bowl with an indian s head on one  side  to the sixteen chairs  no two exactly alike  which had been  obtained from half as many houses     as for the dinner itself  there was no patchwork about that  brown  himself had supplied the essentials  trusting that the most of his guests  could have no notion whatever of the excessively high cost of turkeys  that season  or of the price of the especial quality of butter and eggs  which he handed over to mrs  kelcey to be used in the preparation of the  dishes which he and she had decided upon  that lady  however  had had  some compunctions as she saw the unstinted array of materials an  astonished grocer s boy had delivered upon her kitchen table two days  before the dinner  and had expressed herself to mrs  murdison as  concerned lest mr  brown had spent more than he could well afford       tis the big hearrt of him that leads his judgment asthray   she said   exulting none the less  as she spoke  over the prospect of handling all  those rich materials and for once having the chance to display her  skilled cookery   i said as much as i dared  lest i hurrt his pride   but   tis but wanct a year  missus kelcey   says he  an  i said no more      the thrifty scotswoman shook her head   the mon kens nae mair aboot the  cost o  things than a cheild   said she   but  twould be  as ye say  a  peety to mak  him feel we dinna appreciate his thocht o  us      so they had done their best for him  and the result was a wonderful  thing  to his supplies they had surreptitiously added small delicacies of  their own  mrs  kelcey contributed a dish of fat pickles  luscious to the  eye and cooling to the palate  mrs  murdison brought a jar of marmalade  of her own making  a rare delicacy  though the oranges were purchased of  an italian vender who had sold out an over ripe stock at a pittance  mrs   lukens supplied a plate of fat doughnuts  and mrs  burke sent over a big  platter of molasses candy  thus the people of the neighbourhood had come  to feel the affair one to which not only had they been bidden  but in  which they were all in a way entertainers     the boys of the district  also  had their share in the fun  though not  invited to the dinner proper  they had been given a hint that if they  dropped in that evening after their fathers and mothers had departed  there might be something left  and what boys would not rather  drop in   after that fashion  by the back door  than go decorously in at the front  one  so they had been eager to furnish decorations for the party   according to brown s suggestion  by going in a body to the woods three  miles away and bringing back a lavish supply of ground pine  they had  spent two happy evenings helping brown make this material into ropes   while he told them stories  and there was not a boy of them all who would  not cheerfully have lent his shoulders to the support of the dinner table  throughout the coming meal  if it had suddenly been reported that tim  lukens s sawhorses were untrustworthy      now  misther brown  i ll be goin  home to see to the twins and get me  man to dhress himsilf  an  thin i ll be back  have no fear  av rythin s  doin  foine  an  the turrkey s an ilegant brown jist beginnin  to show   if i m not back in tin minutes ye moight baste him wanct  but have no  other care       i ll be delighted to baste him  thank you   brown responded   and i  have no cares at all  with you in charge  i only hope you won t be too  tired to enjoy the dinner  you ve been busy every minute since dawn       shure   tis the labour of love makes the worrk aisy   she responded  and  then  attacked by a sudden and most unusual wave of shyness  disappeared  out of the door     brown  standing with his back to the fire  smiled to himself  well he  knew that since the suffering three year old twin son of the kelceys had  spent the night in his pitiful arms and in the morning taken a turn for  the better  the entire kelcey family would have made martyrs of  themselves for his sake  it was quite true that that sort of thing  as  his sister  mrs  breckenridge  had intimated  was not precisely in  accordance with the prescription of dr  bruce brainard  distinguished  specialist  but if that night had been his last  donald brown could not  have spent it in a way more calculated to give him pleasure as he closed  his eyes  surely  since life was still his  the love of the kelceys was  not to be despised     as he dressed for the dinner brown considered his attire carefully  he  could not venture to wear anything calculated to outshine the apparel  of his guests  and yet to don the elbow worn  shiny backed blue serge of  his everyday apparel seemed not to do them quite honour enough  he had  not many clothes with him  but he had brought one suit of rough homespun   smart indeed from the viewpoint of the expensive tailor who had made it   but deceivingly unconventional to the eye of the uninitiated  this he put  on  taking particular pains to select a very plain cravat  and to fasten  in it with care the scarf pin bestowed upon him by old benson  the little  watchmaker on the corner below  through the buttonhole in the lapel of  his coat he drew a spicy smelling sprig of ground pine  chanting  whimsically as he did so a couplet from ben jonson      still to be neat  still to be drest   as you were going to a feast            viii    brown s bidden guests      and now  promptly on the stroke of two  the dinner guests arrived  not a  man or woman of them later than five minutes after  even mrs  kelcey   though she had rushed into the kitchen two minutes earlier by the back  door  now entered formally with patrick  her husband  by the front  and  only the high flush on her cheek and the sparkle in her blue black eye  told of a sense of her responsibilities     the company had put on its best for the occasion  there could be no  possible question of that  from the pink geranium in mrs  kelcey s  hair just behind her ear  to the high polish of her husband s boots   the kelceys were brave and fine  mrs  murdison  though soberly gowned  in slate coloured worsted  wore a white muslin kerchief which gave her  the air of a plump and comfortable mother superior  mr  murdison  the  only gentleman present who possessed a  suit of blacks   as he himself  was accustomed to call it  came in looking like the scottish preacher  whose grandson he was  and lent much dignity to the occasion merely by  his presence     there was a predominance of exquisitely ironed white  shirtwaists  among  the costumes of the women  but as these were helped out by much elaborate  and dressy neckwear of lace and ribbon the general effect was  unquestionably festive  the men were variously attired as to clothing   but every collar was immaculate  most of them had a dazzlingly brilliant  finish  and the neckties worn were so varied as to give the eye relief  from possible monotony     in spite of brown s genial greetings to his guests  he had a special  welcoming word for every one  just at first there was a bit of stiffness   the men showed the customary tendency to support one another through the  social ordeal by standing in a solid group in a corner of the room  hands  behind their backs and an air of great gravity upon their faces  while  they spoke  if at all  in low and solemn tones  the women  on the other  hand  as ever  did their best to show themselves entirely at ease by  addressing  one after another  remarks to their host calculated to  prevent his having any doubt as to the sort of weather now prevailing  outside or likely to prevail during the days to come     brown  having anticipated this period of gloom before the feast should  actually begin  had arranged with mrs  kelcey that as soon as the last  guest had arrived the company should sit down at the table  mrs  kelcey   true to her word  gave him the nod without the delay of more than a  minute or two  and promptly the company seated itself  brown  drawing  back her chair for mrs  murdison  who as his most impressive guest he had  placed upon his right  noticed  without seeming to notice  that the  little watchmaker did the same for his wife  and with an effect of habit   speaking of wives  the company being left to seat themselves according to  their own notion  brown having considered the question of dinner cards  and discarded it   every man sat down beside his own wife  in some  instances being surreptitiously jerked into position by a careful  conjugal hand     brown  looking about his table with a smile  bent his head  every eye  fell and every ear listened to the words which followed    our father   we are here in company with thee and in warm friendliness with one  another  we are thankful on this day that we are busy men and women  able  to do our work and to be useful in thy world  teach us to find in life  the joy of living it to please thee  amen       it was mrs  kelcey who broke the hush which followed  by starting from  her place to run out into the kitchen and bring on the dinner  from this  moment the peculiar fitness of donald brown for the duties of host showed  itself  that his dinner should be stiff and solemn was not in his  intention  if the informality of his own conduct could prevent it  he  therefore jumped up from his own place to follow mrs  kelcey to the  kitchen and bring in the great platter for her  bearing the turkey in a  garland of celery leaves  a miracle of luscious looking brownness     he had considered the feasibility of serving at least one preliminary  course  not so much because it seemed to him impossible to plunge at  once into the heartiness of fowl and stuffing as because he wanted to  prolong the hour of dining for his guests  but mrs  kelcey had promptly  vetoed this notion      man  dear   she had said earnestly   an  why would ye be shpoiling the  appetoites of yer company with soup  tis soup they know only too  well  but the turrkey   tis manny a long year since mrs  murdison and  andy have tasted the loike of it  an  the same with the ithers  if   twas chickun  i ll warrant now  we re all glad to make a bit of  chickun go furrther with other things  but a grreat turrkey like this  wan  give it to thim sthrait  misther brown  an  that s my advoice  ye  can take it or lave it      brown had accepted this wise counsel  of course  and now saw the full  wisdom of it as he beheld the looks of veiled but hungry  one might  almost have said starving  anticipation which fell upon the big turkey as  it was borne to its place at the end of the table   i don t know how an  old bachelor is going to make out to carve before such a company   brown  said gaily  brandishing his carving knife   this was a bit of  play making  for he was a famous carver  having been something of an  epicure in days but one year past  and accustomed to demand and receive  careful service in his bachelor establishment    i wonder if i can manage  it  mr  benson   he addressed the old watchmaker   what do you say to  taking my place and helping me out  i d hate to ruin the bird       i say i ll not do it  mr  brown   responded old benson   watch making is  my business  and it s watch i ll make now of your carving      this brave attempt at a witticism brought a fine response  brown s hearty  laugh leading off  and now the ice began to be broken into smaller and  smaller bits  brown s gay spirits  his mirth provoking observations as he  carved the tender fowl  the way in which he appreciated the efforts of  his guests to do their part  led them all to forget themselves in greater  or less degree  when it came to the actual attacking of the piled up  plates before them  it is true that there ensued considerable significant  silence  but it was the silence of approval and enjoyment  not that of  failure to be entertained     if it occurred to brown to wish himself at some more exalted  festival making with more congenial associates on this thanksgiving day   no one would have dreamed it  to all appearances he was with his best  friends  and if he did not partake of the toothsome meal before him with  such avidity as they  it would have needed a more discerning person to  have recognized it than any one who sat at his board  at his boards  it  might be put  remembering tim lukens s achievement with the sawhorses     tim  himself  was present  sober and subdued but happy  how it came about  that he had not drunk a drop for several weeks  none but brown and mrs   lukens could have told  tim s glance was often upon brown s face  the  look in his eyes  now and then  reminded brown of that in the eyes of his  dog bim when he had earned his master s approval  shy but adoring     in spite of all there was to eat in that mighty first course of turkey  and stuffing and mashed white potatoes and sirup browned sweet potatoes   and every possible accompaniment of gravy and vegetable and relish  not  to mention such coffee as none of them had ever drunk  it all disappeared  with astonishing rapidity down the throats of the guests  how  indeed   can one mince and play with his food when he and his wife have not in  their lives tasted so many good things all at once  and when both have  been prepared for the feast by many weeks and months  and years  of  living upon boiled potatoes with a bit of salt pork  or even upon bread  and molasses  when times were hard  brown s neighbours were not of the  very poorest  by any means  but all were thriftily accustomed to  self denial  and there is no flavour to any dainty like that of having  seldom tasted but of having longed for it all one s life     when the second course had come and gone  it was composed entirely of  pies  but of such pies   brown surprised mrs  kelcey by going to a  cupboard and bringing out a final treat unsuspected by her  a great  basket of fruit  oranges and bananas and grapes  flanked by a big bowl of  nuts cunningly set with clusters of raisins  made them all exclaim   happily  they had reached the exclaiming stage  no longer afraid of their  host or of one another      it s reckless with his money he is  patsy   whispered mrs  kelcey to  her husband   it ll take a power of it to pay for all o  thim  an   fruit so dear       whist  he knows what he s about   returned patrick kelcey  uninclined to  remonstrate with any man for giving him that unaccustomed and delightful  feeling that his vest buttons must be surreptitiously unloosed or he  would burst them off  he helped himself lavishly as he spoke     by and by  when all had regretfully declined so much as another  raisin   now we must have some music   cried brown   tim  did you bring  your fiddle      tim lukens nodded  carpentry was tim s vocation  but fiddling was his  avocation and dear delight  he was presently fiddling away  while the  company sat about  completely relaxed in spirit  and mrs  kelcey and mrs   murdison hustled the table clear of dishes  refusing sternly brown s  eager offer to help them  and now came the best time of all  tim played  all the old tunes  and when he struck into  kate kearney  the company was  electrified to hear a rich and vibrant voice take up the words of the  song and sing them through to the end     sitting carelessly on his pine bottomed chair  it was one from the  kelcey house  one hand in his pocket  his heavy hair tossed back and his  lips smiling  brown s splendid tones rang through the room and held his  listeners enthralled  never had they heard singing like that  they could  have no possible notion of the quality of the voice to which they  listened  but they enjoyed its music so thoroughly that the moment the  song was ended they were eager for another  so he sang them another and  still another  while the warm blood rolled in under his dark skin   enriching his thin cheek till it looked no longer thin  he was giving  himself up to the task of pleasing his friends  with thorough enjoyment  of his own  after  kate kearney  he sang  annie laurie   making andy  murdison s warm scottish heart under his stiff scottish manner beat  throbbingly in sympathy  so the hours passed  it never occurring to the  company to go home as long as it was having the time of its life  until  the sudden discovery of a row of boys  faces peering eagerly in from the  darkness of the late afternoon reminded mrs  kelcey that she had a  family at home      the saints be prraised   tis afther darrk   said she  rising  precipitately   and the bhoys promised the lavin s of the table      they all followed her  suddenly grown shy again as they murmured their  thanks  their host s cheery parting words eased them over this ordeal   however  and each one left with the comfortable feeling that he had said  the right thing     two minutes later the house was again invaded  this time by those who  felt entirely at home there  with a whoop of joy the boys of the  neighbourhood took possession  and as they did so a curious thing  happened  donald brown himself became a boy among them     but this was not the only curious thing which happened     the sixteen guests at the dinner  in spite of the generous supplies  had  not left many  lavin s   the great turkey had little remaining now upon  his bones and nothing at all inside of him  the potatoes and vegetables  had been entirely consumed  of the pies there remained a solitary wedge   but brown  smiling broadly  attended to these difficulties  he had the  air of a commissary who knew of unlimited supplies      tom   he commanded   pick three boys and go down cellar with them  and  into the little storeroom at the right      tom  grinning  made a lightning like selection of assistants  and dove  down the steep and narrow stairway from the kitchen      burke and jimpsey  explore the cupboard opening from my bedroom  and  bring out whatever you find there that looks good to eat      before the words were out of his mouth burke and jimpsey had disappeared      tub and jiggers  look under my bed  and haul out a long box you ll  find there      the two fell over each other to do his bidding  in less time than it  takes to tell it  the emissaries were returning with their spoils  a  whole cooked turkey  only slightly inferior in size to the original one   appeared to the accompaniment of howls of joy  it was cold  to be sure   but what boy would mind that  and to the critical palate is not cold  turkey even more delicious than hot  there were piles and piles of  sandwiches with the most delectable filling  there were pies and more  pies  and there were fruit and cake and candy  brown had not feared lest  these later guests suspect him of too long a purse  he had ordered  without stint  and his orders had been filled by a distant firm of  caterers and sent by express     now there were girls in the neighbourhood as well as boys  by a  mysterious invitation they had been summoned to the home of one of their  number  a small cripple  and were there at the very moment rejoicing in  all manner of festivities  nobody knew how it had happened  nor where the  good things came from  except the little girl who was their hostess  and  wild horses could not have dragged the wonderful secret from her  brown  himself  making merry with his boys  remembered the girls with a  comfortable feeling at his heart that for once  at least  a goodly number  of people  young and old  were happier than they had ever been before in  their lives on thanksgiving day     as for his own immediate entertaining the revel now began  no lesser word  describes it  if  before the departure of his dinner guests  brown had  experienced a slight feeling of fatigue  it disappeared with the pleasure  of seeing his present company disport themselves  they were not in the  least afraid of him  how should they be  when he had spent months in the  winning of their confidence and affection by every clever wile known to  the genuine boy lover  that they respected him was plainly shown by the  fact that  ill trained at home as most of them had been  with him they  never overstepped certain bounds  at the lifting of a finger he could  command their attention  though the moment before their boisterousness  had known no limits     if the earlier guests had been surprisingly rapid in their consumption of  the dinner  these later ones were startlingly so  like grain before a  flock of hungry birds  like ice beneath a bonfire  the viands  lavishly  provided though they had been  melted away in almost the twinkling of an  eye  and it was precisely as the last enormous mouthful of cherry pie  vanished down jiggers quigg s happy throat that the unexpected happened           ix    brown s unbidden guests      the front door  opening directly into the living room  with its long  table  and its flashing fire lighting the eager faces round it  nobody  had thought of or bothered to make any other light in that room  was  flung open by a fur gloved hand  and a large figure appeared in the  doorway  a ruddy face looked in upon the scene  this face possessed a  pair of keen gray eyes  a distinguished nose  and a determined mouth  beneath a close trimmed moustache with flecks of gray in it     brown sprang up   doctor brainard   he cried joyfully  and came forward  with outstretched hand     the unexpected guest advanced  behind him appeared others  to the dazed  and gazing boys these people might have come from greenland  so enveloped  were they in defences against the cold  motor coats of rich fur  furry  hats and caps  floating silken veils  muffs  rugs  wherever they came  from they could not have minded coming  sharp as was the november air  outside  as the boys  who had been hanging about the house since the  first approach of twilight  well knew     dr  bruce brainard was followed by two men and three women  in the  flickering firelight brown was obliged to come close to each  as in  smiling silence they approached him  before he could make sure whom the  furs and scarfs enshrouded   sue   he exclaimed  discovering his  sister   and hugh breckenridge  this is great  brother in law  mrs   brainard  can it be mrs  brainard  how kind of you  you must have known  how i ve been wanting to see you  webb atchison  is that you  looming  behind there  how are you  old fellow  but  this lady in the veil       he bent closer as he took the gloved hand outstretched  but all he could  make out in the traitorous light was a pair of dark eyes  and lips that  must be laughing behind the heavy silken veil      do i know her   he asked  looking round upon the others  who were  watching him      you have met her   hugh breckenridge assured him      several times   added webb atchison      but not of late   said brown   or else i        once to have seen her   declared doctor brainard   means never to  forget       you put me in a hard place   brown objected  trying in vain to  distinguish outlines through the veil   she isn t going to lift it   must i guess       of course you must guess  don   cried his sister      how can he   laughed breckenridge   he knows so many fair beings of  about that height  and furs and veils are disguising things  without  them  of course  though she wore a mask  he would have no difficulty       will you speak one word   asked brown of the unknown     she shook her head      then  forgive me  but i m puzzled   said he  laying light but determined  hold upon the veil   i can t imagine at all who  would honour me       he gently lifted the veil  the others saw his expression change as the  drawn folds revealed a face whose dark eyed beauty was vividly enhanced  by the fire glow upon cheeks which the november frost had stung into a  wonder colour  there was a general laugh of appreciation      never would have thought it  eh   chuckled webb atchison  a fine and  prosperous figure of a bachelor past his first youth but not yet arrived  at middle age  and with the look of one who does what he pleases with  other people   well  it wasn t her plan  i assure you  she was  horror stricken when she learned where we were bound       donald brown in his bachelor apartment in the worthington was one  person  this queer fellow living in a roadside cabin is quite  another   suggested dr  bruce brainard quizzically   still  i ll  warrant miss forrest will confess to a bit of curiosity  when she  found she was in for it       were you curious   asked donald brown  he was still looking steadily  down into the lifted face of the person before him  into his own face  had come a look as of one who has been taken unawares at a vulnerable  point  but who has instantly rallied his forces to stand out the attack      they were all curious   answered miss forrest  and the sound of her  voice was different from that of the other voices  if  as doctor brainard  had jestingly but truthfully said  one who had seen her would not forget  her  a similar statement might with equal truth be made of the hearing of  her voice  the one word brown had asked from her lips could certainly  have revealed her to him  and would have done so while he had a memory      to see if we know how to keep thanksgiving here   brown inquired of the  group  though his eyes came back again to helena forrest s face      to see if you had anything to be thankful for   cried sue breckenridge    well  don  now that we are here  are you going to invite us to stay   or  is your present company       brown wheeled and went over to the boys  who were staring  open eyed and  motionless      you ll help me out  fellows  won t you   he said in a low tone  and they  felt him still one of them  for the tone was the old one of comradeship    you see  i have nowhere to ask my guests to sit down  if each of you  will take what you can at a time  and carry everything out into the  kitchen  and then take out the table  i ll be much obliged  you are  coming again soon  you know  but for to night  you see  i must call it  off  tom  you ll see to taking off the tablecloth  will you  fold it up  any sort of way  but don t let the crumbs get out  all right      there was a tumultuous pushing back of chairs  in short order it was  all accomplished  the guests stood at one side  looking at the boys as  curiously as the boys had looked at them  while the dishes disappeared  as fast as many hands could carry them  the big bowl of geraniums was  removed by brown himself  who set it carefully upon his reading table  at the side of the room  and the tablecloth was painstakingly  manipulated by tom kelcey so that hardly a crumb fell upon the floor   there was one crash of crockery in the kitchen  followed by a smothered  howl from the boy who in his agitation had done the deed  but this was  the only accident     brown turned again to his guests      now   said he   will you make yourselves at home  it s a cold night  out  let s have off the furs and sit by the fire  mrs  brainard  allow  me to help you out of that coat  this is the happiest sort of a  surprise for me            x    brown s answers to questions      donald brown stood at the end of his hearth  his elbow resting on the  chimney piece  his eyes  narrowed a little between the lashes  intently  regarding these latest guests of his  he was in the shadow  they were in  the strong light of the fire  a great lump of cannel coal  recently laid  upon the red hot embers and half burned logs of the afternoon fire  had  just broken apart with a great hissing and crackling of the pitchy  richness of its inner formation  and the resultant glow of rosy light  which enveloped the figures before the hearth  against the duller  background of the room  otherwise unillumined  made them stand out like  figures in a cleverly lighted tableau     they were much more interesting to brown  however  than anything he had  ever seen in the set and artificial radiance of the calcium light  he  knew well every face there  and yet  after his year s exile and in  contrast to the faces at which he had been lately looking  they formed a  more engrossing study than any he had known for many months     in the centre of the circle  in brown s old red cushioned rocker and most  comfortable chair  sat mrs  brainard  the exquisitely sophisticated wife  of the distinguished specialist close by  her graceful head  with its  slight and becoming touches of gray at the temples  rested like a fine  cameo against the warm hue of the cushion  her brilliant eyes reflected  the dancing firelight  her shapely hands  jewelled like mrs   breckenridge s  but after an even more rare and perfectly chosen fashion   lay in her silken lap  as his glance fell upon these hands some whimsical  thought brought to brown s mind mrs  kelcey s red  work roughened ones   he wondered if by any chance the two hands would ever meet  and whether  mrs  brainard s would shrink from the contact  or meet it as that of a  sister   under the skin      near her his sister sue s dainty elegance of person showed like a flower  against the big figure of doctor brainard  who sat at her elbow  brainard  himself  with his splendid head and erect carriage  was always an  imposing personage  he had never seemed more so than now  with the face  of patrick kelcey  andrew murdison  and james benson  the little  watchmaker  in the background of brown s mind with which to contrast it   beyond mrs  brainard lounged hugh breckenridge  as nearly as one could be  said to lounge  in a plain  cane seated chair without arms     at one side of the group was webb atchison  the rich bachelor of the  party where all were possessed of wealth in plenty  next atchison sat  miss helena forrest  the one member of the company who had not known  where she was going until well upon her way there  upon her the glance of  the man standing by the chimney piece fell least often  yet there was no  person present of whom he was so unremittingly conscious  it may be said  that from the moment that he had lifted her veil in his puzzled search  for her identity  he had been conscious of little else     there was not a single movement of miss forrest s hands  and she had  certain little delightful  highly characteristic ways of helping out her  speech with slight yet significant motions  but had its place in brown s  memory  she was not a frequent talker  she did not speak one word to sue  breckenridge s fifty  but when she did speak  in her voice of slow music   people listened  and yet one never thought of her  brown remembered  as a  silent person  the effect of her presence in any circle was that of a  personality of the active  not the passive  sort  the eyes of one  speaking must  involuntarily  be drawn to her because she was listening   if i may coin a phrase  vividly  as for her looks  she possessed that  indescribable charm which is not wholly a matter of beautiful features   but lies rather in such details as the lift of the eyebrow  the curve of  the lip  the droop of the hair upon the brow  she was dressed much more  simply than either of the older women present  yet with the simplicity   it must be admitted  of the artist  she seemed somehow to make their  goodly showing fade before her own  as a crimson flower draws from the  colour of one of delicate blue     well  take them separately or as a group  they were an absorbing study to  the man who had seen so little of their kind for so long past  yet knew  that kind by the wontedness of his lifetime  he seemed to himself somehow  to be viewing them all  for the first time  from a vantage point he had  never before occupied  every word they said in their pleasantly  modulated  well bred voices  with the familiar accent of the educated  environment from which they came  and from which he came  it was his  accent  too  but somehow it sounded a bit foreign to him tonight  struck  upon his ear with a new meaning  each gesture they made  personal and  familiar to him as they were  struck brown now with its special  individuality      it s not fair  don   said sue breckenridge suddenly   for you to stand  over there in the shadow and watch us  without our being able to see your  face at all       you don t realize   declared brown  in answer to this assertion and the  general assenting  laugh which followed it  backed by atchison s   hear   hear    that the group you all make in the light of my fire is a picture  far ahead of anything in atchison s collection  i should be an  unappreciative host indeed if i didn t make the most of it       what an artful speech   laughed mrs  brainard  lifting fine eyes in an  attempt to make out the shadowy face above her   it s well calculated to  distract our attention from the fact that you are not changing your  position by so much as the moving of an arm  we came to see you  man  not  to show ourselves to you       we came to cheer his loneliness   put in hugh breckenridge with a  peculiar  cynical sounding little laugh for which he was famous   and  we find him up to his neck in boys  jove  how do you stand their  dirty hands  don  that s what would get me  no matter how good my  intentions were       those hands were every pair scrubbed to a finish  to day  in honour of  thanksgiving  do you think we have no manners here   retorted brown      that wasn t the dinner party you wrote me of when you refused to come  to mine  was it  don   questioned his sister      no  this was an after dinner party  partaking of the  lavin s    brown  explained   the real one was over an hour before       do tell us about it  did you enjoy it  won t you describe your guests    mrs  brainard spoke eagerly      with pleasure  the kelceys are my next door neighbours on the left  mrs   kelcey is pure gold  in the rough  her husband is not quite her equal   but he knows it and strives to be worthy of her  the murdisons  on the  other side  are  scotch granite  splendid building material  old mr   benson  the watchmaker  is  well  he s full jewelled  the others i  perhaps can t characterize quite so easily  but among them i find several  uncut gems of the semi precious varieties  of course there s considerable  commonplace material  if you can ever call the stuff of which human  beings are made commonplace  which i doubt  there s more or less copper  and brass  with a good bit of clay  as there is in all of us  and a deal  of a more spiritual element which can t be measured or described  but  which makes them all worth knowing      he had spoken in a thoughtful tone  as if he took mrs  brainard s  question seriously and meant to answer it in the same way  a moment s  silence followed  then doctor brainard said slowly      i suppose you don t find those priceless elements among the people of  your abandoned parish  down there we re all copper and clay  eh       if you had been clay i might have done more with you   was the  quick retort      and you can do things with these people  can you  dig out the rough  gold  polish the uncut diamonds  build temples of the granite  and  perhaps mold even the clay into works of art      the answer to the ironic question was grave enough  and it came with a  quietness which spoke more eloquently than fervid tones would have done  of the feeling behind it      no  doctor  i can t hope to do those things  i m not wise enough  but  the things these people are going to do to me  if i ll let them  are  worth coming for       they ve done some of them already   murmured mrs  brainard  but nobody  heard her except sue breckenridge  who cried out      and you re not a bit homesick  don  while you re living like this       if you people won t come up here very often and make me remember what  being with you is like  i shall get on pretty well   said brown s voice  from the shadow      then we ll come as often as we can   cried sue triumphantly      no  you won t  not if you want to help me  my reputation as an indigent  bachelor out of a job won t stand many onslaughts of company dressed as  you are  if you want to come to see me you must come disguised  i m  afraid i m under suspicion already       explain to them that we re the clay  they the uncut diamonds  that will  let you out   advised doctor brainard grimly      ah  but you don t look the part   said brown  laughing   you look like  what you are  a big jewel of a fellow  as my friend mrs  kelcey would  say  to tell the truth  you all seem like jewels to me to night  and such  polished ones you dazzle my eyes  hugh  i d forgotten what a well cut  coat looked like  i remember now       you seem pretty well dressed yourself   remarked atchison  peering up  into the shadow   according to mrs  breckenridge  you go about dressed in  monk s cloth  and a shabby variety at that  this doesn t look like it       he was wearing a dreadful  old shiny serge suit when i saw him a  fortnight ago   said sue   and such a scarf pin  don  are you wearing  that same scarf pin to night  do show it to them       does choosing to live by himself make a man a fair target for all the  quips and arrows of his friends   brown queried  at the same time  withdrawing obediently the little silver pin from his cravat and giving  it into atchison s outstretched hand   be just to that pin  webb  it was  given me by a special friend of mine       how will you exchange   atchison inquired gravely  touching his own  neckwear as he examined the pin  a rare and costly example of the  jeweller s art reposed there  as might have been expected      i ll not exchange  thank you       neither will i   declared atchison  leaning back with a laugh and  passing the pin on down the line     hugh breckenridge gave the obviously cheap and commonplace little article  one careless glance  and handed it to miss forrest  she examined it  soberly  as if seeking to find its peculiar value in its owner s eyes   then she looked at brown      this has a story  i am sure  or you wouldn t care so much for it   she  said   are we worthy to hear it  mr  brown      his eyes met hers  though as he stood she could barely make out  that fact      i should like you to hear it       come out of the darkness  don  please   begged his sister again     the others echoed the wish  and brown  yielding against his  will  somehow he had never wanted more to remain in the shadow  took a  chair at one end of the hearth  where he was in full view of them all    it was given me   said brown  speaking in a tone which instantly  arrested even hugh breckenridge s careless attention  though why it did  so he could not have said   by a man whose son was wearing it when he  stood on a plank between two windows  ten stories up in the air  and  passed fifteen girls over it to safety  then  the plank burned through  at one end  he had known it would      there fell a hush upon the little group  mrs  brainard put out her hand  and touched brown s shoulder caressingly      no wonder you wouldn t exchange it  don   she said  very gently      was the father at your dinner  don   doctor brainard asked  after a  minute      yes  doctor       so you wore it to please him   commented sue      he wore it   said helena forrest   as a man might wear the  victoria cross       ah  but i didn t earn it   denied brown  without looking up      i m not so sure of that   mrs  brainard declared   you must have  done something to make the father feel you worthy to wear a thing he  valued so much       he fancied   said brown   he and the mother  that there was a slight  resemblance between my looks and those of the son  and they have a finer  memorial of him than anything he wore  they have one end of the burned  plank  the father has cut the date on it  with his son s name  and it  hangs over the chimney piece       what a tragic thing   cried sue  shuddering   i don t see how they can  keep it  do tell us something else  don  doesn t anything amusing ever  happen here  oh  what became of the baby      brown rose suddenly to his feet   i m forgetting my hospitality   said  he   i m going to make you all some coffee  the baby  sue  is at mrs   kelcey s  next door  having only six of her own  she could easily make  room for the seventh       tell us about the baby   demanded webb atchison   has don gone into the  nursery business  with all the rest      sue began to tell the story  describing the night on which she made her  first visit to her brother  brown disappeared into the kitchen and soon  returned  bringing with him  as was his entertaining custom  the  materials for brewing his coffee upon the hob      you remember   he said  as he came   the way this room was cleared for  your reception       by an avalanche of boys  who swept everything  hurly burly  into outer  darkness   supplied breckenridge      you can guess  perhaps  what the kitchen must be looking like   can t you       indescribable   murmured sue   you re not going to invite us to put it  in order for you  are you  don   and wash all those dreadful  gaudy  plates and cups       just take a look out there  will you      sue shook her head  but mrs  brainard went to the door  followed by  atchison and miss forrest  they looked out upon a low ceiled   lamp lighted room  in absolute order  in which was not a trace of the  late festival making except the piles of clean dishes upon the table   under which lay bim  nose on paws  alert eyes on the strangers      magic   queried mrs  brainard   surely those noisy boys couldn t  accomplish such a miracle       never  though i suspect they were put to work by a good general  for the  borrowed chairs are gone and so are several other bulky articles  there s  no difficulty in guessing who did the deed   said brown  busy with his  coffee making     he served his guests presently with a beverage which made atchison  exclaim   the old chap certainly knows how to make the best stuff i ever  drank  when i tasted this brew first i invited myself to come out and  stay a week with him  but he wouldn t have me       you re too polished an article for his hand  he wants his work stuff  raw   doctor brainard said again  evidently this point rankled  brown  looked up      i ll challenge you to stay and have it out with me  doctor   said he      thank you  i came for no other purpose   retorted the doctor coolly    these people brought me up to have a look at you  and i m not going back  till morning       that s great   brown s face showed his pleasure           xi    brown s present world      when miss forrest returned from her survey of the kitchen she had come  straight to the corner of the hearth where brown stood  and had taken  the chair beside the one he had lately occupied  he was therefore beside  her when he sat down to drink his coffee with his guests  at a moment  when webb atchison and sue breckenridge were engaged in a bit of  controversy over the relative merits of varying methods of coffee  making  helena forrest turned to brown  who had been looking into the  fire without speaking      i hope you don t really mind our coming up here to night   she said      mind it  if i did  i couldn t blame you  for you came against your  will   he answered  and his eyes were no longer upon the fire      without my consent  but not  perhaps  against my will      he regarded her intently  she met his look without turning aside      you felt a curiosity to see the hermit in his cell   was his explanation  of the matter     she nodded   of course  who wouldn t  after such reports as mrs   breckenridge brought back       and now that you have seen him  you are consumed with pity       no  if i am consumed with anything it is with envy      his low laugh spoke his disbelief  she read it in the sound and in the  way his gaze left her face and went back to the fire      you don t think i mean that   said she      hardly       why not       it is  inconceivable       why      her face  turned toward him  invited him to look at it again  but he did  not  just then      because you are  helena forrest   he answered      and what is she  please  in your opinion       an inhabitant of another world than that i live in       a world of which you have an even poorer opinion than you used to have  when you lived in it yourself      he smiled   anyhow  i am no longer in it  nor ever shall go back      a startled look passed over her face   you don t mean that you intend to  stay here  forever       not quite that  but i mean to do this sort of work  rather than the sort  i began with  to do it i must live much as i am living now  where ever  that may be  now  what about the envy of me you profess      he turned  still smiling  at the little sound he caught from her  half closed lips      are you happy in such a decision   she murmured      do i look like an unhappy man      she shook her head   that s what i have been noticing about you ever  since i came  you did look unhappy when you went away  now  you don t   and it is the look on your face which gives me the sense of envy      brown gave one quick glance at the rest of the party   do you mean to  say   he questioned  very low   that you are not happy       does that seem so strange       it might very naturally seem so  to one who knows what you have to make  you the happiest of the happy       you yourself didn t find happiness among similar surroundings   she  said  looking at him intently      similar   the thought seemed to amuse him      well  weren t they similar  at any rate we were in the same world  and  you say now we are not       we are so far apart   said he evenly   that we can only signal to each  other  and even then  neither is familiar with the other s code       oh   she exclaimed  and a strange expression showed in her eyes   what a  hard  hard thing for you to say  it doesn t sound like you       hard   he questioned  with a contraction of the brows   it is  substantially what you yourself once said  if it was true then  it must  be true now      moved by some impulse the two looked at each other searchingly   donald brown s face grave but tense  helena forrest s full of a proud  pain  clearly they were not understanding each other s code now  so  much was evident     at this instant  without warning  the outer door flew open  mrs  kelcey   her round red face disordered  her breath coming short  stood upon the  threshold and spoke pantingly  without regard to the company assembled      mr  brown  sor  the baby s dyin  the sthranger child  it was took all of  a suddint  would ye moind comin  to say a bit of a prayer over him   father mccarty s away  or i wouldn t ask it      she was gone with the words  with the first sentence brown had sprung to  his feet  as mary kelcey vanished he turned to doctor brainard      come  doctor   he said  with a beckoning hand   while i say the bit of a  prayer you try what you can do to keep the baby here      the eminent physician rose rather slowly to his feet   it s probably no  use   he demurred   the woman knows       the lord knows  too   declared brown  with a propelling hand on his  friend s arm   knows that you re here to give the child a chance   come  hurry      the two went out  doctor brainard would have stayed for his hat and  overcoat  but brown would brook no delay     left behind  the party by the fire looked at one another with faces  sobered  hugh breckenridge consulted his watch      it s time we were off   he declared   the doctor s going to stay anyway   and it s no use waiting for don to come back       that s right   agreed webb atchison   i came up here once before   about six months ago  and i saw then enough of the way things went here  to know that he lives at the beck and call of every man  woman  and  child in this district  and they call him  too  he d just finished  sobering up a drunkard that night  or scant attention i d have had   well  i ll walk down to the hotel and send back rogers and the car  be  ready in ten minutes      they said they would be ready  but in brown s little bedroom  donning  furry wraps  helena forrest spoke in sue breckenridge s ear      i can t bear to go till we know how it comes out      sue stared at her   you don t mean to say you care  why  it s just a  forlorn little foundling  better dead than alive  i saw it when i was  here two weeks ago  it has nothing to live for  dear  don t think of  it again       but he cared  your brother cared   said helena forrest      oh  don cares about everything  i never saw such a soft heart  of course  i think it s lovely of him  though i don t understand how he can be so  absorbed in such a class of people      miss forrest went to the one window of the room  she lifted the plain  shade which covered it and looked out into the night     ten yards away she saw a brightly lighted  uncurtained window  beyond  which were figures  plainly discernible  the figures were moving  one  bringing a pail  another stooping  the scene was not one of still waiting  but of tense action  she caught a glimpse of doctor brainard s tall form  bending above something at one side  then she saw brown himself cross the  room in haste     mrs  brainard and sue went back to the outer room to stand before the  fire with the purpose of accumulating all the bodily heat possible before  the long  cold drive  miss forrest  unheeding them  remained by the  window in the unlighted bedroom  minutes passed  hugh breckenridge had  fallen to examining the larger room s eighteenth century features  he was  something of a connoisseur in antiques     helena  turning from the window for a moment  scanned the shadowy room in  which she stood  it was very scantily furnished with the bare essentials   upon the plain chest of drawers which held brown s bachelor belongings  stood a few simply framed photographs  an old set of hanging bookshelves  was crammed full of books  with more overflowing upon the floor     suddenly  as she stood there  an outer door banged  swift footsteps  crossed the floor  helena turned to see donald brown himself rushing into  the room  he ran to the chest of drawers  pulled one open  searched a  minute  withdrew something  and was hurrying out of the room again  when  he caught sight of the figure at the window  involuntarily he halted for  an instant      can you save it   helena cried  under her breath      i don t know  brainard s got his coat off  pray for us  will you      he was gone again     beside the narrow bed on which he lay every night  there dropped upon  its knees a figure in sumptuous furs  a face such as men vow themselves  ready to die for was pressed into the hard little pillow  helena forrest  breathed a prayer of beseeching for a life she had never seen  and when  she had done lifted eyes wet with tears     as hugh breckenridge  protesting at the lateness of the hour  marshalled  his friends into the great car at the door  doctor brainard came out of  mrs  kelcey s house and ran across to the curb      don wants me to tell you that the baby s pulled through  it s gone off  to sleep with his finger in its fist  and he won t leave it  he says   good night  to you       was it the prayer or the potion that saved it  doctor   questioned  breckenridge in his caustic tone      i don t know   said the doctor  and there was something new and gentle  in his voice   it was very nearly beyond potions  i m inclined to think  it was the prayer   an hour afterward  doctor brainard  sitting  wide awake and thoughtful before brown s fire  was aware of the quiet  entrance of the younger man  he looked up  and a radiant smile met him      still doing well  i see  don      brown nodded  he sank down into the chair opposite the doctor and ran his  hand through his hair  in spite of the brightness of his face the gesture  betrayed weariness     doctor brainard got up  he went over to the corner where his overcoat  hung upon a peg in the wall  and took from a pocket a small instrument  composed mostly of tubes  he inserted certain earpieces in his ears and  returned to the fire      sit up and let me get at you   he commanded     brown glanced round  saw the doctor s grotesque appearance with the  stethoscope in position  and shook his head   that s not fair  i was  up rather early  and it s been a fairly full day  and night  take me in  the morning       i ll take you right now  when you re tired enough to show up whatever s  there  coat off  please      he made his examination painstakingly  omitting no detail of his inquiry  into the state of both heart and lungs      what would you say if i told you you were in a bad way   he asked     brown smiled   i shouldn t believe you  i know you too well  you can t  disguise the fact that you find nothing new  and the old things improved   i know i m stronger than i was a year ago  why shouldn t i be  with  nothing to do but take care of myself      the doctor whistled   how do you make that out  that  nothing to do        with the demands of a great parish off my shoulders the little i do  here is child s play       after i left you with the baby   said the doctor   mrs  kelcey followed  me into the other room and told me a few things  in your old parish you  had your sleep o  nights  in your new one i should say you spend the  sleeping hours in activity       in my old parish   said brown  studying the fire with an odd twist at  the corners of his lips   i lay awake nights worrying over my  problems  here  i m asleep the minute my head touches the pillow   isn t that a gain       too weary to do anything else  i suppose  well  i shall have to admit  that you are improved  surprisingly so  you are practically well  but  what i can t understand is how a man of your calibre  your tastes  your  fineness of make up  can stand consorting with these people  be honest   now  after such a visit as you ve had to night with the old friends   don t you feel a bit like giving in and coming back to us      brown lifted his head   doctor   said he  slowly  and with a peculiar  emphasis which made his friend study his face closely   if the devil  wanted to put temptation in my way  just as i have decided on my future  course  he did it by sending you and the others down here to night  if i  could have jumped into that car with the rest of you  and by that one act  put myself back in the old place  i would have done it  but for one  thing  and that s the sure knowledge that soft living makes me soft  i  love the good things of this life so that they unfit me for real service   do you know what was the matter with my heart when i came away  i do  it  was high living  it was sitting with my legs under the mahogany of my  millionaire parishioners  tables  driving in their limousines  drinking  afternoon tea with their wives  letting them send me to europe whenever i  looked a bit pale  soft  i was a down pillow  a lump of putty  i  who was  supposed to be a fighter for the lord       nonsense  man   cried the doctor  now thoroughly aroused   you were the  hardest worker in the city  your organizations  your charities        my organizations  my charities   the words came in a tone of contempt    they were all in fine working order when i came to them  they continued  to work  with no help from me  they are working quite as well now in my  absence as they did in my presence  st  timothy s is a great  strong  society of the rich  and the man they engage to preach to them on sundays  has mighty little to do that any figurehead couldn t do as well  down  here  well  there is something to do which won t get done unless i do it   and if this neighbourhood  or any other similar one  needs me  there s no  question that still more do i need the neighbourhood       in other words   said the doctor   mrs  kelcey can do more for you than  bruce brainard      the look which met his frown was comprehending   doctor   said brown    every man knows his own weakness  i like the society of bruce brainard  so well that when i m in it i can forget all the pain and sorrow in the  world  when i m with mrs  kelcey i have to remember the hurt  and the  grind  and the hardness of life  and it s good for me  it helps me  as  st  paul said  to   keep under my body and bring it into subjection         that s monkish doctrine       no  it s st  paul s  i tell you  remember the rest of it     lest that  by any means  when i have preached to others  i myself should be a  castaway         you  a castaway   the doctor laughed     brown nodded  rising   you can see a long way into a man s body  doctor   but not so far into his soul  there s been a pretty rotten place in  mine     come  shall we go to bed  it s almost two      the doctor assented  and brown went into his bedroom to make it ready for  his guest  closing the drawers he had opened in such haste two hours  before  his eye was caught by something unfamiliar  against one of the  framed photographs which stood upon the top of the chest leaned a new  picture  unframed  by the light of the small lamp he had brought into the  room he examined it  as the face before him was presented to his gaze he  stopped breathing for the space of several thudding heartbeats     out of the veiling brown mists of the picture looked a pair of eyes at  which one glance had long been of more moment to him than the chance to  look long and steadily into other eyes  the exquisite lines of a face  which  having seen  men did not forget  were there before him  in his  possession  it was the face of the woman  young and rich with beauty and  with worldly wealth  who had  three years before  refused to marry  donald brown      how did this come here  did sue leave it  or did  you    he questioned  the photograph in his mind  staring at it with eager eyes   wasn t it  enough for you to come here to night  to make me realize how far apart we  are  you like to play with men s hearts  so they say  don t you think  it s a bit cruel to play with mine  now      but he looked and looked at the enchanting face  and even as he looked  doctor brainard called out from the other room      by the way  don  i suppose you ve noticed that atchison seems to be  getting on with his suit  everybody thinks it s either an engagement or  likely to be one soon  pretty fine match  eh      it was a full minute before the answer came  when it did it sounded a  little as if the speaker had his head in the clothespress which opened  from the small bedroom  albeit the tone was gay enough      webb s one of the best men i know  he deserves to win whatever he wants   do you like a hard pillow or a soft  doctor            xii    brown s old world      on a certain morning in february  mrs  hugh breckenridge alighted in  haste from her limousine in front of a stately apartment house in the  best quarter of a great city  she hurried through the entrance hall to  the lift and was taken up with smooth speed to the seventh story  in a  minute more she was eagerly pressing the button at the door of a familiar  suite of rooms into which she had not had occasion to enter for more than  a year  for the very good reason that they had been closed and unoccupied  in the absence of their tenant     the returned tenant himself opened the door to her  a tall figure looming  in the dusk of an unlighted corridor  a tall figure infinitely dear to  sue breckenridge      o don   cried the visitor in an accusing tone   how could you come back  without letting us know       i ve been back only an hour   explained donald brown  submitting to and  warmly returning his sister s embrace   how in the world did you hear of  it so soon  did brainard       she nodded   mrs  brainard called me up at once  of course  she knew you  couldn t be serious in trying to keep people from knowing you were here   least of all your sister       i was intending to come to you before luncheon  i only meant to surprise  you  as for the rest  i should be glad if they needn t know  at least  until i m ready to leave       to leave  don  you re not going to persist in going back  it can t be  true  you won t give up this apartment  tell me you won t      his sister s tone was anguished  before he answered brown led her into  the library of the suite  the room in which he had been occupied when her  ring came  and put her into a big arm chair  taking from her her wrap and  furs  then he sat down upon the edge of a massive mahogany writing table  near by  crossing his long legs and folding his arms  while she mutely  waited for him to speak      sue   he said  and his face had in it a sort of reflection of the pain  in hers   you may be sure i haven t come to this decision without a deal  of thought  but i ve made it  and i m going to stick to it because i  believe it s the thing for me to do  i assure you that since i came into  these rooms they have been beseeching me  as loudly as inanimate things  can not to desert them  i m going to find it the hardest task of my life  to take leave of them       don t take leave of them  lock them up for another year  if you must  persist in your experiment  but don t   don t  burn your bridges behind  you  oh  how can you think of leaving your splendid church and going off  to consign yourself to oblivion  living with poor people the rest of  your days  you   you   don   i can t believe it of you      his face  in his effort at repression  grew stern  his folded arms became  tense in the muscles      don t make it harder for me than it is  i can t discuss it with you   because though i argued till i was dumb i could never make you see what i  see  accept my decision  sue dear  and don t try my soul by pleading with  me     i have a lot to do  i should like your help  see here  would you  care to have any of my things  look about you  this is rather a good rug  under your feet  will you have it  and any others you fancy      she looked down at the heavy eastern rug  exquisite in its softness and  richness of colouring     it was one of which  knowing its value  she had long envied her  brother the possession  she put up her hand and brushed away the mist  from her eyes      aren t you going to take  any  comfortable things with you  are you  going to go on living on pine chairs and rag carpets  you  who were  brought up on rugs like this      he nodded   for the most part  i ve been wondering if i might indulge  myself in one big easy chair  just for old times  but i m afraid it  won t do       oh  mercy  don  why  not        how should i explain its presence  opposite my red cushioned rocker   give it a good look  sue  that chair  and tell me honestly if i can  afford to introduce such an incongruous note into my plain bachelor house  up there      she surveyed the chair in question  a luxurious and costly type standing  for the last word in masculine comfort and taste  it was one which had  been given to brown by webb atchison  and had long been a favourite      oh  i don t know   she said hopelessly  shaking her head   i can t  decide for any monk what he shall take into his cell      brown flushed  a peculiar dull red creeping up under his dark skin  he  smothered the retort on his lips  however  and when he did speak it was  with entire control  though there was  nevertheless  an uncompromising  quality in his inflection which for the moment silenced his sister as if  he had laid his hand upon her mouth      understand me  once for all  sue  if you can  i am going into no  monastery  to such a man as i naturally am  i am going out of what has  been a sheltered life into one in the open  you think of me as retiring  from the world  instead of that  i am just getting into the fight  and to  fight well  i must go stripped      she shook her head again and walked over to the window  struggling with  very real emotion  at once he was beside her  and his arm was about her  shoulders  he spoke very gently now      don t take it so hard  dear girl  i m not going to be so far away that i  can never come back  you will see me from time to time  i couldn t get on  without my one sister  with father and mother gone  and the brothers at  the other side of the world  come  cheer up  and help me decide what  disposal to make of my stuff  will you take the most of it      she turned about  presently  dried her eyes determinedly  and surveyed  the room  it was a beautiful room  the sombre hues of its book lined  walls relieved by the rich and mellow tones of its rugs and draperies   the distinguished furnishings of the writing table  and the subdued gleam  of a wonderful reading lamp of wrought copper which had been given to  brown by sue herself      if you will let me   she said   i ll give up one room to your things and  put all these into it  aren t you even going to take your books       i must  a couple of hundred  at least  i can t give up such old friends  as these       a couple of hundred  out of a couple of thousand       there are five thousand in this room   said brown cheerfully   but two  hundred will give me a very good selection of favourites  and i can  change them from time to time  i have sixty or seventy already with  me     hello  who can that be  has brainard been giving me away right  and left      he answered the ring  and admitted webb atchison  rosy of cheek and  rather lordly of appearance  as always  the bachelor came in   frowning even as he smiled  and bringing to donald brown a vivid  suggestion of old days      caught   he cried  shaking hands   thought you could sneak in and out  of town like a thief in the night  did you  it can t be done  old man      he was in a hurry and could stay but ten minutes  five of those he  devoted to telling brown what he thought of the news he had heard  by  which he understood that st  timothy s was to lose permanently the man  whom it had expected soon to have back  brown listened with head a little  down bent  arms folded again  lips set in lines of determination  he had  been fully prepared for the onslaughts of his friends  but that fact  hardly seemed to make it easier to meet them  when atchison had delivered  himself uninterrupted  brown lifted his head with a smile      through  webb   he asked      no  i m not through  by a long shot  but it s all i have time for now   for i came on a different matter  since i heard you were here i ve been  telephoning around  and i ve got together a little dinner party for  to night that you won t evade if you have a particle of real affection  for me  i m not going to be cheated out of it  it ll be a hastily  arranged affair  but there may be something decent to eat and drink   brainard tells me you re not going to linger in town an hour after your  business is done  so i thought best to lose no time  you ll come  of  course  the way you re looking just now i don t know but you re equal to  refusing me even such a small favour as this one      brown crossed the room  to lay his hands on atchison s shoulders  his  eyes were dark with suppressed feeling      my dear old friend   said he affectionately   i wish you wouldn t take  the thing this way  i m not dealing blows at those i love  if i m dealing  them at anybody it s at myself  i can t possibly tell you what it means  to me  this crisis  i can only ask you not to think hardly of me  as for  the dinner  if it will please you to have me agree to it i will  only  i  should a little rather have you stand me up against a wall and take a  shot at me       for a deserter      atchison spoke out of his grief and anger  not from belief in the motive  he imputed  when he saw donald brown turn white and clench the hands he  dropped from his friend s shoulders  atchison realized what he had done   he winced under the sting of the quick and imperious command which  answered him      take that back  webb       i do  and apologize   said the other man instantly  and tears smarted  under his eyelids   you know i didn t mean it  don  but  hang it  all   i m bitterly disappointed and i can t help showing it       disappointed in me  or in my act   brown was still stern      in your act  of course  i m bound to acknowledge that it must take a  brave man to cut cables the way you re doing  a mighty brave man       i don t care about being considered brave  but i won t be called  a coward       i thought   said atchison  trying to smile   there was something in your  bible about turning the other cheek       there is   said brown steadily   and i do it when i come to your dinner   but between now and then i ll knock you down if you insult the course  i ve laid out for myself      the two men gazed at each other  the one the thorough man of the world  with every sign of its prospering touch upon him  the other looking  somehow more like a lean and hardened young soldier of the army than a  student of theology  both pairs of eyes softened  but it was atchison s  which gave way first      confound you  don  it s because of that splendidly human streak in you  that we love you here  you ve always seemed to have enough personal  acquaintance with the devil and his works to make you understand the rest  of us  and refrain from being too hard on us      at which sue breckenridge  who had been listening with tense strung  nerves to the interview taking place in her presence  laughed  with an  hysterical little sob shaking her  both men looked at her      poor sue   said brown   she doesn t like to have you quarrel with me   yet it s all she can do to keep from quarrelling with me herself  between  you  if you don t undermine my purpose  it will be only because i ve been  preparing my defenses for a good while and have strong patrols out at the  weak points       i give you fair warning  i ll undermine it yet if i can   and atchison  gripped brown s hand with fervor before he went away  charging sue  breckenridge with the responsibility of bringing her brother to the  dinner to be given that evening      now  what   said brown  turning to his writing table when atchison had  gone  and absently picking up a bronze paper weight which lay  there   put it into his head to fire a dinner at me the moment he knew i  was here       we all have a suspicion   said sue  watching him as she spoke   that he  and helena are ready to announce their engagement  it may have popped  into his head that with you here it was just the time to do it  of  course   she went on hurriedly  in answer to something she thought she  saw leap into her brother s face   we don t absolutely know that they re  engaged  he s been devoted for a good while  and since he s never been  much that sort with women it looks as if it meant something       it looks it on his part   said brown  opening a drawer in the table and  appearing to search therein   does it look it on hers       not markedly so  but helena s getting on  she must be twenty six or  seven  and she always seems happy with him  of course that s no evidence   for she has such a charmingly clever way with men you never can tell when  she s bored  and certainly they can t  it s just that it seems such a  splendidly fitting match we re confident there s ground for our  expectations       i see  altogether  that dinner promises well for sensations  of one sort  or another  meanwhile  shall we pitch into business      together they went through brown s apartment  which was a large one  and  comprised everything which he had once considered necessary to the  comfort of a bachelor establishment  as he looked over that portion of  the place pertaining to the cooking and serving of food he smiled rather  grimly at the contrast it inevitably brought to his mind  standing before  the well filled shelves in the butler s pantry he eyed a certain  cherished set of svres china  thinking of the cheap blue and white ware  which now filled all his needs  and recalling with a sense of amusement  the days  not so long past  when he would have considered himself ill  served had his breakfast appeared in such dishes      it s all in the way you look at it  sue   he exclaimed  opening the  doors of leaded glass and taking down a particularly choice example of  the ceramic art in the shape of a large satsuma plate   look at that   now  why should a chop taste any better off that plate than off the one i  ate from this morning at daybreak  it tastes no better  i vow it doesn t  taste as good  i ve a keener appetite now than last year  when sing lee   my chinese cook  was cudgelling his asiatic brains to tempt me       that s not the way i look at it   sue answered mournfully   to me it  makes all the difference in the world how food is served  not to mention  how it is cooked  do you ever have anything but bacon and eggs at that  dreadful place of yours       bless your heart  yes  i don t deny myself good food  child  get that  out of your mind  why  just night before last jennings and i had an  oyster roast  on the half shell  over the coals in my fireplace  my word   but they were good  if webb can give us anything better than that  to night he ll surprise me       who is jennings  a laundryman or a policeman       neither  jennings is a clerk in the office of a great wholesale hardware  house  he was down on his luck  a while back  but he s pulled out of his  trouble  when his wife s called out of town  as she often is by the old  people back home  he keeps me company  he s particularly fond of roasted  oysters  is jennings  since a certain night when i introduced them to his  unaccustomed palate  it s great fun to see him devour them      sue shook her head again  she could seem to do little else these days   being in a perpetual state of wonder and regret over that which she could  not understand  quite as her brother had said  he sent her away an hour  before luncheon time  telling her that he would follow when he had  attended to certain matters in which she could not help  having put her  into her car  he waved a cheery hand at her as she drove away  and  returned to his apartment  he lingered a little at the lift to ask after  the welfare of the young man who operated it  whom he had known in past  days  but presently he was in his library again with the door locked  behind him  and here for a brief space business was suspended     before the big leather chair he fell upon his knees  burying his head  in his arms       oh  good father     said brown  just above his breath    only thou  canst help me through this thing  it s even harder than i thought it  would be  i want the old life  i want the old love  my heart is weak  within me at the thought of giving them up     i know the temptation  comes not from without but from within  it s my own weak self that is my  enemy  not the lure of the life i m giving up     give me  strength  fighting strength     help me   not to give in while i can  stand and see        presently he rose to his feet  he was pale  but in his face showed the  renewed strength of purpose he had asked for  he set about the task of  packing the few things he meant to take with him  working with a certain  unhurried efficiency which accomplished no small amount in that hour  before luncheon  then he descended to find his sister s car waiting for  him  and was whirled away           xiii    brown s trial by flood      at nine o clock that night  feeling a little as if he were in some sort  of familiar dream  brown  wearing evening dress for the first time in  more than a year  sat looking about him  he was at mrs  brainard s right  hand  in the post of the guest of honour  for mrs  brainard was playing  hostess for her bachelor friend  webb atchison  in the apartment of the  princely up town hotel which was his more or less permanent home     about the great round table were gathered a goodly company  the company  of brown s old friends among the rich and eminent of the city  not only  men of great wealth  but men distinguished in their professions  noted  for their achievements  and honoured for their public services  were  among those hurriedly asked to do this man honour  they had all been  more or less constant members of his congregation during the years when  he was making a name as the most forceful and fearless young preacher who  ever ventured to tell the people of aristocratic st  timothy s what he  thought of them     and they were gathered to night to tell him what they thought of him   they were sparing no pains to do so  more than once  while he parried  their attacks upon his resolution to leave them permanently  parried them  with a smiling face  with a resolute quiet voice  with the quickness of  return thrust for which he was famous in debate  he was inwardly sending  up one oft repeated  pregnant petition    lord  help me through this  for  thy sake       they were not men alone who combined against him with every pressure of  argument  there were women present who used upon him every art of  persuasion  not that of speech alone  but that subtler witchery of look  and smile with which such women well know how to make their soft blows  tell more surely than harder ones from other hands  among these  all of  whom were women of charm and distinction after one fashion or another   was one who alone  though she seemed to be making no direct attack  was  waging the heaviest war of all against donald brown s determination     atchison  in arranging the places of his guests  had put helena forrest  at brown s right  at the sacrifice of his own pleasure  for by this  concession she was farthest from himself  whether or not he understood  how peculiarly deadly was the weapon he thus used against his friend  he  knew that helena was capable of exerting a powerful influence upon any  man  how should he himself not know it  who was at her feet  he had no  compunction in bringing that influence to bear upon brown at this moment   when the actual word of withdrawal had not yet been spoken     yet as from time to time atchison looked toward these two of his guests  he wondered if helena were doing all she could in the cause in which he  had enlisted her  she was saying little to brown  he could see that  and  brown was saying even less to her  each seemed more occupied with the  neighbour upon the farther side than with the other  just what this meant  atchison could not be sure     the dinner  an affair of surprising magnificence considering the brief  hours of its preparation  drew at length to its close  it seemed to brown  that he had been sitting at that table  in the midst of the old  environment in which he had once been carelessly happy and assured  for  hours upon end  before the signal came at last for the departure of the  women  and even then he knew that after they had gone the worst was  probably to come  it came  left alone with him  the men of the party  redoubled their attacks  with every argument  renewed and recast  they  assaulted him  he withstood them  refusing at the last to argue  merely  lifting his head with a characteristic gesture of determination  smiling  wearily  and saying with unshaken purpose   it s no use  gentlemen  i ve  made up my mind  i m sorry you think i m wrong  but i can t help that   since i believe i m right      they could not credit their own failure  these men of power  so  accustomed to having things go their way that they were unable to  understand even the possibility of being defeated  and they were being  defeated by a man whom they had never admired more  and they had made  him  as sue breckenridge had said  the idol of the great church  than now  when he refused them  but they  quite naturally  did not show him that   they showed him disappointment  chagrin  cynicism  disbelief in his  judgment  everything that could make his heart beat hard and painfully  with the weight of their displeasure     suddenly he rose to his feet  a hush fell  for they thought he was going  to speak to them  he was silent for a minute  looking down at these old  friends who were so fond of him  then he opened his mouth  but not to  speak  to sing     it was a powerful asset of donald brown s  and it had never been more  powerful than now  this voice which had been given him of heaven  they  had often heard him before but now  under these strange circumstances   they listened with fresh amazement to the beauty of his tones  every word  fell clean cut upon their ears  every note was rich with feeling  as  brown in this strange fashion made his plea  took his stand with george  matheson s deathless words of passionate loyalty      make me a captive  lord     and then i shall be free   force me to render up my sword     and i shall conqueror be   i sink in life s alarms    when by myself i stand   imprison me within thy arms     and strong shall be my hand      when they looked up  these men  they saw that the women of the party had  come back to the doors  drawn by an irresistible force     in a strange silence  broken only by low spoken words  the whole company  returned to the living rooms of the apartment  here brown himself broke  the spell he had laid upon them     speaking in the ringing voice they knew of old  and with a gesture of  both arms outflung as if he threw himself upon their friendship  he  cried blithely      ah  give me a good time now  dear people  let me play i m yours and you  are mine again  just for to night      that settled it  webb atchison brought his hand down upon his victim s  shoulder with a resounding friendly blow  calling      he s right  we ve given him a bad two hours of it  let s make it up to  him  and let him have the right sort of send off  since he will go  he  will  there s no possible question of that  so let s part friends       i don t know   said brown  smiling in the midst of the faces which now  gave him back his smile   but that if you are kind to me you ll test my  endurance still more heavily  but  we ll risk it      the scene now became a gay one  gay  at least  upon the surface  brown  was his old self again  the one they had known  and he was the centre of  the good fellowship which now reigned  so  for a time  then came the  supreme test of his life  as unexpectedly as such tests come  when a man  thinks he has won through to the thin edge of the struggle           xiv    brown s trial by fire      he had gone alone into a den of atchison s  where was kept a medley of  books and pipes and weapons  a bachelor collection of trophies of all  sorts  he was in search of a certain loving cup which had been mentioned  and asked for  and atchison himself had for the moment left the apartment  to see an insistent caller below  the den was at some distance from the  place where the company was assembled  and brown could hear their voices  only in the remote distance as he searched  suddenly a light sound as  of the movement of silken draperies fell upon his ear  and at the same  instant a low voice spoke  he swung about  to see a figure before him at  sight of which  alone as he had been with it for months  he felt his  unsubdued heart leap in his breast  by her face he knew she had followed  him for a purpose  he let her speak      donald brown   she said  and she spoke fast and breathlessly  as if she  feared  as he did  instant interruption and this were her only  chance   what you have said to night makes me forget everything but what  i want you to know      quite evidently her heart was beating synchronously with his  for he  could see how it shook her  he stared at her  at the lovely line and  colour of cheek and chin  at the wonderful shadowed eyes  at the soft  darkness of her heavy hair  she was wearing misty white to night  with  one great red rose upon her breast  she was such a sight as might well  blind a man  even if he were not already blind with love of her  the  fragrance of the rose was in his nostrils  it assailed his senses as if  it were a part of her  its fragrance hers  but he did not speak      you asked me something once   she went on  with an evident effort    would you mind telling me if  if       but he would not help her  he could not believe he understood what she  meant to say      you make it very hard for me   she murmured   yet i believe i understand  why  if this thing is ever said at all  i must be the one to say it  do  you  donald  do you  still  care        o god    he cried in his heart    o god  couldn t you have spared  me this       but aloud  after an instant  he said  a little thickly   i think you know  without asking  i shall never stop caring      she lifted her eyes   then    and she waited     he must speak  she had done her part  his head swam with the sudden  astounding revelation that she was his for the taking  if  ah  but the   if   he knew too well what that must mean      are you tempting me  too   he asked  with sudden fierceness   do you  mean  like all the rest  i may have you if  i give up my purpose and  stay here      mutely her eyes searched his  dumb with the agony of it his searched hers  in return  he turned away      don   her voice was all low music  the words vibrated appealingly  she  had seen what it meant to him  she put out one hand as if to touch  him  and drew it back   listen to me  please  i know  i know  what a  wonderful sacrifice you are making  i admire and honour you for it  i do   but  think once more  this great parish  surely there is work for you  here  wonderful work  won t you do it   with me       he looked at her with sudden decision on his course      you left that photograph   he spoke huskily     she nodded      you left it there  in my poor house  i ve cherished it there  it hasn t  suffered  you wouldn t suffer  will you live  and work  with  me   there        oh   she drew back   how can you  do you realize what you ask       i don t ask it expecting to receive it  i know it s impossible  from  your viewpoint  but  it s  all i have to ask       he broke off  fighting savagely with the desire to seize her in his arms  that was all but overmastering him     she moved away a step in her turn  standing  with down bent head  the  partial line of her profile  the curve of her neck and beautiful  shoulder  presenting an even greater appeal to the devouring flame of his  longing than her eyes had done  it seemed to him that he would give the  heart out of his body even to press his lips upon that fair flesh just  below the low drooping masses of her hair  flesh exquisite as a child s  in contrast with the dark locks above it  all the long months of his  exile pressed upon him with mighty force to urge him to assuage his  loneliness with this divine balm     suddenly she spoke  just above a whisper   i wonder   she said   if any  woman ever humiliated herself  like this  to be so refused      he answered that with swift  eager words   it is the most womanly  the  most wonderful thing  any woman could do for a man  i shall never forget  it  or cease to honour you for it  i love you   love you   for it  ten  thousand times more than i loved you before  if that can be  i  must  say  it  i must put it into words that you and i can both remember  or i think  my heart will burst  but  helena  i have vowed this vow to my god  i have  put my hand to this plow  i can t turn back  not even for you  no man   having done that    and looking back  is fit for the kingdom of god    he  isn t fit for the kingdoms of earth  either  he isn t fit for  hell      very slowly she moved away from him  her head still drooping  at the  door she did not pause and look back  actress like  to try him with one  more look  she went like a wounded thing  and at the sight  the wild  impulse to rush after her and cry to her that nothing in the wide  universe mattered  so that she should lift that head and lay it on his  breast  gripped him and wrung him  till drops of moisture started out  upon his forehead  and he turned sick  then she was out of sight  and he  stood grasping the back of a chair  fighting for control  this was a  dinner party  a dinner party  kind god in heaven  and he and she must go  back to those other people and smile and talk  must somehow cover it all  up  how was it conceivably to be done     she could do it  perhaps  after all  it could not be the soul stirring  thing to her that it was to him  she loved him enough to be his  wife  under the old conditions  she did not love him enough to go with  him as his wife into the new conditions  then she could not be suffering  as he was suffering  wounded pride  she was feeling that  no doubt of  it  wounded pride is not a pleasant thing to feel  she loved him  somewhat  loved him enough to take the initiative in this scene to night   but real love  she could not know what that was  or she would follow him  to the ends of the earth  it was the woman s part to follow  not the  man s  hers to give up her preference for his duty  since she could not  do this  she did not really love him  this was the bitterest drop in the  whole bitter cup     footsteps came rapidly along the corridor  webb atchison appeared in the  doorway  at the first sound of his return brown had wheeled and was found  standing before a cabinet  in which behind glass doors was kept a choice  collection of curios from all parts of the world  he was trying to summon  words to explain that he was looking for a certain loving cup   a  loving cup   when one had just been presented  full to overflowing  to  his thirsty lips  and he had refused to drink     but atchison was full of his message      don  i ve done my best to put the fellow off  but he will see you  hang  it   to night of all nights  i don t know why that following of yours  should pursue you to this place  i suspect it will be considerable of a  jolt to that chap to see you in an expanse of white shirt front  but it  seems somebody has been taken worse since you left  and insists on seeing  you  why in thunder did you leave an address for them to find you at      by the time atchison had delivered himself of all this brown had hold of  himself  could turn and speak naturally  the news had been like a dash of  cold water in the face of a fainting man      who is worse  mr  benson       think that was the name  an old man  the messenger s waiting  though i  told him you certainly couldn t go back to night       i certainly shall go back to night  where is he      expostulating uselessly  atchison led the way  brown found andrew  murdison standing with a look of dogged determination on his face  which  changed to one of relief when he saw brown  old benson  the watchmaker   who had been convalescing from illness when brown came away  had suffered  a relapse and had probably but few hours to live     with a brief leave taking  in the course of which brown held for an  instant the hand of helena forrest and found it cold as ice in his grasp   he went away  as the train bore him swiftly back to the place he had left  so recently  certain words came to him and stayed by him  fitting  themselves curiously to the rhythmic roar of the train       god is faithful  who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye  are able  but will with the temptation also make a way to escape  that ye  may be able to bear it       and the car wheels  as they turned  seemed to be saying  mile after mile     a way to escape  a way to escape  a way to escape             xv    brown s brown study      standing in his kitchen doorway  brown looked out into his back yard     it was  in one way  an unusual back yard for that quarter of the city   and in that one way it differed from the back yards of his neighbours   while theirs were bounded on all sides by high and ugly board fences   his was encompassed by a stone wall standing even higher  and enclosing  the small area of possibly forty feet by thirty in a privacy quite  unknown elsewhere in the district  this stone wall had been laid by the  englishman who had built the house  his idea of having things to himself  being the product of his early life in a country where not only is every  man s house his castle  but the surrounding ground thereof  as well  his  domain  from which he would keep out every curious eye     it was an evening in mid april  brown had opened the big oak door to let  the late western light of the spring day flood his kitchen  while he  washed and put away the dishes lately used for his supper  and for that  of a forlorn and ill used specimen of tramp humanity who had arrived as  he was sitting down     he was presently to address a gathering of factory girls in a near by  schoolhouse  and he was trying  as he stood in the door  with the soft  spring air touching gratefully his face  to gather his thoughts  together for the coming talk  but he was weary with a long day s  labours  and somehow his eyes could summon no vision of the faces he  was to see  instead       there ought to be a garden back here   he said to himself   if i m to  stay here for the coming year  as it looks as if i must  i should  cultivate this little patch and make it smile a bit  as it is  it s doing  no good to anybody  not even bim  he s pretty careless about his bones  out here  and leaves them around instead of burying  em decently  i must  teach him better  this would be a good place to bring the children into   if it had some flowers in it      the notion cheered him a little  as the thought of flowers in the spring  has a way of doing  he made a rough plan of the garden  in his mind   laying out beds of sturdy bloom  training vines to cover the bleak  expanse of stone  even planting a small tree or two of rapid growth  for  the benefit of whomever should follow him as a tenant of the old house   presently he closed the door with some sense of refreshment  mental and  physical  and forced his thoughts into the channel it was now imperative  they should occupy     he took his way to the meeting in the schoolhouse  however  with a step  less rapid than was usually his  it might have been the enervating  influence of the mild spring air  it might have been the pressure of  certain recollections which he had not yet succeeded  in the two months  which had passed since the farewell dinner at webb atchison s  in so  putting aside that they should not often depress and at times even  dominate his spirit  though he had left the old life completely behind  him  and had settled into the new with all the conviction and purpose he  could summon  he was subject  especially when physically weary  as  to night  to a heaviness of heart which would not be mastered      but i must   i must   stiffen my back   he said sternly to himself  as  he neared the dingy schoolhouse toward which  from all directions  he  could see his audience making its way  it was not the first time he had  addressed these girls and women  in so informal and unostentatious a  manner that no one of his hearers had so much as suspected his  profession  but had taken him for one of their own class   he s got a way  with him   they put it   that makes you feel like you could listen to him  all night   the sight of them now provided the stimulus he needed  and as  he smiled and nodded at two or three whom he had personally met he felt  the old interest in his task coming to his aid     and in a brief space he was standing before them telling them the things  he had come to tell  it was not his message he had lacked  that had been  made ready long before the hour  it was only the peculiar power and  magnetism of speech and manner which had been the treasure of st   timothy s  that he had felt himself unable to summon as he came to this  humble audience  but now  as almost always  he was able to use every art  at his command to capture their attention  to hold it  to carry it from  point to point  and finally to drive his message home with appealing  force  and this message was  as always  the simple message of belief in  the things which make for righteousness     not all his auditors could arrive on time  they were obliged to come when  they could  brown s talks had to be subject to constant though  painstakingly muffled interruptions  as one after another stole into the  room  his attraction for his hearers  however  once he was fairly  launched  was so great that there were few wandering eyes or minds   therefore  to night  when he had been speaking for a quarter of an hour   the quiet entrance of two figures which found places near the door at the  back of the room disturbed nobody  and caused only a few heads to turn in  their direction     those who did note the arrivals saw that they were strangers to the  assembly  they saw something else  also  though they could not have told  what it was  the two women  one young  one of middle age  were plainly  dressed in cheap suits of dark serge  such as many of the working women  were wearing  their hats were of the simplest and most inexpensive  design  though lacking any of the commonplace finery to be seen  everywhere throughout the room  but there was about the pair an  undeniable since unconcealable air of difference  of refinement if it  were only in the manner in which they slipped into their seats and fixed  their eyes upon the speaker  with no glances to right or left  the eyes  which noted them noted also that both were possessed of faces such as  need no accessories of environment to make them hold the gaze of all  about them      settlement folks   guessed one girl to another  with a slight curl  of the lip       sh h     who cares what they are when  he s  talkin    gave back the  other  and settled again to listening     brown had seen the newcomers  but they were far back in the room  which  was by no means brilliantly lighted  and beneath the shadows of their  hats there was for him no hint of acquaintance  he therefore proceeded   untrammelled by a knowledge which would surely have been his undoing had  he possessed it at that stage of the evening  he went on interesting   touching  appealing to his listeners  waging war upon their hearts with  all the skill known to the valiant  forceful speaker  yet such was his  apparent simplicity of method that he seemed to all but two of those who  heard him to be merely talking with them about the things which  concerned them     his was not the ordinary effort of the amateur social worker  such though  he felt himself to be  he had not a word to say to his hearers about   conditions   he gave them no impression of having studied them and their  environment till he knew more about it all than they did  or thought he  did  he brought to them only what they felt  consciously or  unconsciously  to be an intimate understanding of the human heart   whether it were found beating under the coarse garments of the factory  hand or the silken ones of the  swells up town   gently but searchingly  he showed them their own hearts  showed them the ugly things  the strange  things  the wonderful things  of their own hearts  and then  when he had  those hearts beating heavily and painfully before him  applied the  healing balm of his message  hard eyes grew soft  weary faces  brightened  despairing mouths set with new resolve  and when the hour  ended there seemed a clearer atmosphere  a different spirit  in the  crowded room  than that which earlier had pervaded it      say  ain t he what i told you   one girl  passing near the two strangers  as the company dispersed  inquired of another   don t it seem like he  knows what you don t know yourself about how you re feelin        you can t be so down in the mouth when you re listenin  to him   was  another comment which reached ears strained to attention   you feel like  there was some good livin   after all  did liz come  d ye know  she needs  somethin  to make her buck up  if she d jest hear him       brown remained in the room till almost the last were gone  the two  strangers waited at the door  their backs turned to the room  as if in  conference  several women stayed to speak with the man who had talked to  them  and the waiting ones could hear his low tones  the same friendly   comprehending  interested tones to which st  timothy s had grown so  happily accustomed  at length the last lingerer passed the two by the  door  and brown  approaching  spoke to them      did you want to see me  is there anything i can do   he began  and the  two strangers turned     his astonished gaze fell first upon mrs  brainard  her fine and glowing  eyes fixed upon him with both mirth and tenderness in their look  she had  been deeply touched by the sights and sounds of the hour just passed  yet  the surprise she had in store for her friend  donald brown  was moving  her also  and her smile at him from under the plain little hat she wore  was a brilliant one  but he stared at her for a full ten seconds before  he could believe the testimony of his eyes  was this  could this possibly  be  the lady of the distinguished dress and bearing  who stood before him  in her cheap suit of serge  with a little gray cotton glove upon the hand  she held out to him     he seized the hand and wrung it  as if the very contact was much to him   his face broke into a smile of joy as he said fervently   i don t know  how this happens  but it s enough for me that it does       i m not the only one present  don   said the lady  laughing  and turned  to her companion     if he had given the second figure a thought as he recognized his old  friend  it was to suppose her some working girl who had conducted the  stranger to the place  but now he looked  and saw helena forrest       you    he breathed  and stood transfixed     miss forrest had always been  though never conspicuously dressed  such a  figure of quiet elegance that one who knew her could almost recognize her  with her face quite out of sight  now  without a single accessory of the  sort which stands for high bred fashion  her beauty flashed at brown like  that of one bright star in a sky of midnight gloom  she was not smiling   she was looking straight at him with her wonderful eyes  and in them was  a strange and bewildering appeal     for a moment he could not speak  he  who had been so eloquent within her  hearing for the hour past  he looked at her  and looked again at mrs   brainard  and back at helena again  and then he stammered   i  can t  quite  believe it is you  either of you   and laughed at his own  confusion  his face flushing darkly under the skin  clear to the roots of  the heavy locks on his forehead      but you see it is   said helena s low voice   we are confident of that  ourselves  for the journey has seemed a long one  under two smothering  veils  and we hadn t the easiest time finding you      brown recovered himself   you didn t motor over this time  then       the last time we were here   mrs  brainard reminded him   you told us  quite frankly that you didn t care to have your friends arrive in  limousines  or in velvet and sables  so  we have left both behind       i see you have  it was wonderfully kind of you  though the disguise is  by no means a perfect one  i wonder if you can possibly think  either of  you  that you looked like the rest of my audience       did you know us when we came in   questioned mrs  brainard  with a merry  glance   i think you did not  mr  donald brown       how long have you been here       we must have come in near the beginning of your talk  you didn t even  see us then  did you       i saw two figures which looked strange to me  but  the lights        oh  yes   agreed the lady  gayly   the lights were poor  and you saw  two working women who were merely strangers to you  so you didn t  look again       i m glad i didn t recognize you       why  we rather hoped you would  didn t we  dear      she looked at her companion  who nodded  smiling      we both hoped and feared  i think   helena said      i couldn t have gone stumbling on   brown explained   i should have had  to dismiss the meeting  telling them i had a rush of blood to the  head  or to the heart      at this moment he was helped out by the abrupt opening of the door  beside him  a grimy faced janitor looked in  wearing an expression of  surly dissatisfaction  when he saw brown the expression softened  slightly  as if he knew a friend when he beheld him  but he did not  withdraw  brown rallied his absorbed faculties to appreciate what late  hours meant to that busy janitor      just leaving  mr  simpson   he said cheerfully  and led his visitors out  into the school s anteroom      are you at a hotel   he asked  with eagerness  of mrs  brainard   how  can i  where can i        we ran away   explained that lady promptly   not a soul knows where we  are  we did not register at a hotel  for this is a secret expedition  we  take the eleven fifteen train back  meanwhile  don  am i not an  acceptable chaperon  and won t my presence make it entirely proper for us  to break a bit of bread with you in your bachelor home  we had only  afternoon tea before we left  we are very hungry  or i am       oh  if you will only do that   he said with an inflection of great  pleasure   i shall be so tremendously honoured i shall hardly know how to  express it  i hope i have something for you fit to eat  if i haven t        bacon and eggs   said mrs  brainard  with twinkling eyes   are what your  sister sue insists you live on  never in my life did i have such a  longing for bacon and eggs       then you shall have them  or an omelet garnished with bacon  and the  corner grocery has some lettuce and radishes  i believe i can even  achieve a salad      brown led the way through the ill lighted streets  not talking as he  might have done in another quarter of the city  but hurrying them past  places he could not bear to have them see  and making one detour to avoid  taking them through the poorest part of the neighbourhood  it was by no  means a dangerous neighbourhood  but somehow he felt with these two rare  women on his hands  as if he must guard them even from the ordinary  sights to be had in the districts of the working class  and as he walked  by their side it came upon him  as it had never done with such force  before  that he could never seriously ask any woman from his own world to  come and face such a life as the one he had chosen for the active years  of his own     yet  he had also a curious feeling that he must not let that thought  spoil for him the wonder of this visit  the hour was his  let him make  the most of it  he had not so many happy hours that he could afford to  lose one because it could be only one  he would not lose it           xvi    brown s new world      so the house was reached  it was a dark and stern looking little abode  at this hour  with its windows unlighted  though usually the cheeriest on  the square  brown threw open the door and bim sprang to meet him  turning  aside  however  at sight of the strangers  only a few embers glowed on  the hearth  and the room was in darkness     brown closed the door behind them all   stand still  please   he said    while i light up      he threw some kindlings from a basket upon the fire  and they leaped into  flame before he could light the lamp on his table  the room became a  pleasant place at once  as any room must in fire  and lamp light  so that  it contain such few essentials of living as did brown s  the  red cushioned chair by the hearth  the books and magazines upon the  table  the two fine portraits on the wall      now  please make yourselves comfortable   brown urged  indicating the  austere little bedroom his friends remembered   and if you ll do that  i ll go at the joyous task of getting you some supper       you must let us help you   mrs  brainard offered      never  what could you do  either of you  in a bachelor s kitchen       but we want to see the bachelor at work there       your presence might upset me   he called back  laughing  as he  hurried away     two minutes later  after an inspection of his larder  he was rushing up  the street to the corner grocery  having escaped by way of the back  door  if any of his friends of this quarter had happened to meet him  under one of the scanty street lamps  they might have noted that the  dark face  in these days usually so sober  to night was alight with  eagerness  donald brown s eyes were glowing  there was a touch of clear   excited colour on his cheek  his lips were all but smiling as he strode  along  one hand was already in his pocket  feeling critically of the  probable contents of the purse he longed to empty  to make a little  feast for his so welcome guests     arrived at jim burke s small store  the customer scanned the place  anxiously  and it seemed to him that its supplies had never been so  meagre  he succeeded in buying his lettuce  however  and a bottle of  salad oil  and  remembering a can of asparagus tips on his own shelves   congratulated himself upon the attainment of his salad  some eggs which  the grocer swore were above reproach  and some small bakery cakes   completed the possibilities of the place for quick consumption  brown ran  back to the house again  his arms full of parcels  his mind struggling  with the incredible fact that under his roof was housed  if only for an  hour or two  the one being whom he would give all but his soul to keep     entering his kitchen by its outer door he stopped short upon the  threshold  a figure in a white blouse  blue serge skirt  and little  white  beruffled apron  was arranging his table  the table had been  drawn into the middle of the room  his simple supplies of linen and  silver had been discovered  and the preparations were nearly complete   in the middle of the table in a glass bowl was a huge bunch of violets   come from he could not have guessed where  even if he had given any  thought to the attempt     but he gave no thought to anything but the figure before him  if helena  forrest  in the silks and laces of her usual evening attire  had been  always one of extraordinary charm  in her present dress and setting she  was infinitely more enchanting to the man who stood regarding her with  his heart leaping into his throat  the whole picture she presented was  one of such engaging domesticity that no bachelor who had suffered the  loneliness this one had known so many months could fail to appreciate  it   he dropped his parcels and came forward  mrs  brainard was not  in the room  and the door was closed between the kitchen and the  living room  by accident  or intention  the pulses in his temples were  suddenly beating hard     helena did not turn  she stood by the table  trifling with some little  detail of spoon or napkin  and her down bent profile was presented to  brown s gaze  as he stared at it a sudden vivid wave of colour swept over  her cheek  such an evidence of inner feeling as he had seldom observed in  her before  who usually had herself so well in hand     he came close and stood looking down at that rich hued cheek  the soft  waves of her dusky hair drooping toward it      what does this mean   he said  unsteadily and very low   this can t be  just to make me go mad with longing  for that s what i shall do if i  look long at you like this  here in my home   you  looking as if  as  if  you belonged here      he saw her hand tremble as it touched the violets in the bowl  arranging  them  it was a very beautiful hand  as he well knew  and he saw with  fresh wonder that there were no rings upon it  where rare and costly ones  were wont to be     there was silence for an instant before her reply  then she turned and  looked up  full into his face      may i belong here   she said  very gently      do you want to       yes       you are willing to leave it all  for me       yes       ought i to let you   his questions had been rapid  breathless  his  eyes were searching hers deeply  he was very near  but he had not put out  a hand to touch her  yet no woman  seeing him as he stood there  could  feel herself the one who wooed  even though she led him on     she looked away for an instant  while her lips broke into a little  smile of wonder at his control of himself  no need to tell her how she  drew him  she knew it with every fibre of her  then she let him have  her eyes again      do you think you can help letting me   she said  and lifted her face  with that adorable  irresistible movement which tells its own story of  its own desire      no   his voice shook   thank god  i don t have to try any longer      it was no passive creature he took then into his eager arms  it was one  who raised her own with the rush of self abandonment which made his joy  complete  long as he had loved her he had not dreamed of her as ever  giving herself to any lover so splendidly  if he had dreamed  he realized  with a strange feeling at the heart  he could never have withstood        it was to be hoped that mrs  brainard  in the other room  had found a  book upon the table which interested her or  hungry for food as she had  professed herself to be  she must inevitably have found the time pass  slowly before she was summoned to her promised supper     out in the old  dark  oak walled kitchen  brown was still putting  questions  he had placed his lady in a chair  and he sat on a little  old fashioned  cricket  before her  one that he had found in the house  when he came and had carefully preserved for its oddity  it brought him  just where he could look up into her eyes  one of her hands was in both  his  he lifted it now and then to his lips as he talked  the packages of  eggs and lettuce and bakery cakes stood untouched and forgotten on the  table  if helena remembered to be hungry  it was not worth the spoiling  of this hour to demand to be fed      can i possibly make you comfortable here   was one of his questions      don t you think i look as if i might help you make us both  comfortable   was her answer     brown looked at the plain little white blouse  at the simple blue serge  skirt  then on down to the foot which showed below the hem of the skirt      is this the sort of shoe that working women wear   he inquired  skeptically     helena laughed   neither mrs  brainard nor i could bring ourselves to  that   she owned   and since you and i are only to play at being poor        we can afford to keep you in fine shoe feather  yes  i think we can  but  you are going to miss a world of things you are used to  my queen  and  not only a world of things  the world itself       i know  but  i tried living in my world without you  and i failed      he made an inarticulate exclamation  expressive of great joy  and  followed it with the age old demand   tell me when you became willing to  come to mine       the night you were in town       what  not at atchison s dinner       yes  i would have come with you then  i would have come with you from  the singing of that song       but you  you let me think you wanted me to come back       i am only human  i wanted you to come back  but  i wanted you to refuse  to come  if you hadn t refused        yes        you wouldn t have towered as high for me as you do now  i might have  loved you  but  perhaps  i shouldn t have  adored you      the last words came in a whisper  and again the wonderful colour poured  itself over her face  brown  at the sight  bent his head upon her hand   and she put her other hand upon his heavy hair and gently caressed it   when he lifted his head his eyes were wet      oh  but i don t deserve that   he murmured brokenly  and put up his arms  and drew her down to him  soon he spoke with solemnity      darling  you are not making this great sacrifice wholly for me   you love  the one i try to serve  you will be glad to serve him   too  with me       yes  donald  but i love him  i think  through you  i hope to reach your  heights some day  but you will have to lead me there      they remembered mrs  brainard at last  and they remembered that helena   also  had had nothing at all to eat since the hour for afternoon tea   brown flung open the door into his living room  his face aglow  and stood  laughing at the sight of mrs  brainard s posture in his red  rocking chair  as if exhausted by the tortures of fatigue and starvation  she lay back in an attitude of utter abandonment to her fate  and only  the gleam of her eyes and the smile on her lips belied the dejection of  her pose   it s a shame   he cried  coming to her side   or would be  if  you hadn t aided and abetted it all       are you happy  donald dear   asked the lady  sitting up and reaching up  both hands to him   ah  yes  i only need to look at you       so happy i don t know what i m doing  you kind  wise friend       wise  i wonder if i am  what will they all say to me  i wonder  when  they know the part i ve played  never mind  is helena happy  too  i hope  so  for the poor girl has been through the depths  bless her       come and see   and with his arm about her  donald led her out into  the kitchen     helena came forward   dearest lady  will you stay and have supper with  us   said she with quite the air of the proud young housewife  and brown  laughed in his delight      had i better stay   inquired mrs  brainard  laughing with the man at her  side  while both regarded the figure before them with eyes which missed  no note in the appeal of her presence in that place      oh  yes  indeed  we ve plenty and to spare  donald paid a visit to the  corner grocery not long ago  and we ve new laid eggs  and radishes and  all  do stay       i think i will   and mrs  brainard took the radiant face between her  soft  white  ringless hands and kissed it as a mother might     in no time at all the hour had come for the visitors to go to their  train  in spite of their protests brown would have a cab come for them   though it took him some minutes to get one in a quarter of the city where  such luxury was rare      time enough for self denial   said he as he took his place facing them    let me play i m a man of affluence again  just for to night       i m afraid  don  you ll always be tempted to call cabs for your wife    mrs  brainard said  and suppressed a bit of a sigh  for  after all  she  knew what the future must cost them both  and she herself would miss them  sadly from her world     but it was helena who silenced her   when he walks  i ll walk   said she    haven t i been in training for a year  even though i didn t know why i  was training       i think we ve both been in training for the year   said brown    even though we didn t know  god knew  and when he trains  then the  end is sure      when he had put them in their car  and had taken leave of them with a  look which he found it hard to tear away  plain and unpretentious  travellers though they were that night  he went striding back through  the april midnight to the little old house the englishman had built  so long ago     as he let himself in  bim came tearing to meet him  the firelight was  still bright upon the hearth  and brown sat down before it  leaning  forward to look into the glowing coals with eyes which saw there splendid  things  the dog came close and laid his head on brown s knee and received  the absent minded but friendly caress he longed for  also  with the need  for speech  bim s master told him something of what he was thinking      the look of her  bim  boy  in those simple clothes  why  she was never  half so beautiful in the most costly things she ever wore  and she s  mine  mine  she s coming here  next month  bim  to be my wife  can you  believe it  i can t  not more than half  and yet  when i  remember  remember       and it seemed hard to me  bim  all this year  my life here  i thought i  was an exile  i  with this coming to me   o god  but you are good to  me  good   how i will work  how we will work   we        he got up  presently  and as he stood on the hearth rug  about to leave  it for his bed  a whimsical  wonderful thought struck him      i ll never have to borrow little norah kelcey any more  for the want of  something to get my arms about  instead  some day  perhaps   o god  but  you are good                                                        the time of his life       dot  do you remember kirke waldron      dorothy broughton  daintily manipulating her breakfast grapefruit  her  shapely young arm showing interesting curves through the muslin and lace  of her morning gown  made by her own clever fingers  looked up at her  brother julius  he was keeping her company at her late and solitary  breakfast  sitting casually on the arm of his brother in law s empty  chair  his long legs crossed  his arms folded upon his chest  his bright  eyes surveyed his sister as he spoke  from the crown of her carefully  ordered hair to the tips of her white shoes  he could see them from his  position at one side  and he observed that they were as white and as  fresh as her gown  that was one of the things julius heartily approved of  in his pretty sister  her fastidiousness in such matters  he was  fastidious himself to a degree  nothing more correct in its way than his  own morning attire could have been imagined      waldron   dorothy repeated   that tall  solemn boy who used to stumble  over himself on his way to the blackboard       and then had the rest of the class looking like a set of dough heads  while he covered the blackboard with neat little figures that always  came out right  a perfect shark at  math   yes  he s the one  five  classes ahead of us then  fifteen now  we aren t in it  any of us  with  kirkie waldron these days       i ve never heard nor thought of him since then   averred his sister   do  you mean he s made something of himself  i should never have thought it       no  you d never have thought it  because he stumbled over his own feet  when he was a kid  well  let me tell you it s the only thing he s ever  stumbled over  he s just been taken into the office of haynes and  ardmore  consulting mining engineers  and everybody says that ll mean a  partnership some day  and that brings me to my point  he hasn t taken a  day s vacation for two years  day after to morrow he sails for south  america to stay six months  looking after the development of a new mine  down there in colombia  he can take to morrow for a holiday  and i ve  asked him out  with bud s permission  and i want you to help me give him  the time of his life       me   dorothy opened her brown eyes   oh  but i can t give you to morrow   the bridal party s going on an all day motor trip      julius ran his hand through the crisp  half curly locks of his black  hair   cut it out  you don t need to be on every last one of their  junketings  get  em to let you off for to morrow       i can t possibly  i m to be maid of honour  you know  irene would never  forgive me  nor  some of the others      julius frowned   see here  you re not letting ridge jordan get any  headway with you  are you  if you are you d certainly better make him  take a day off while you see what a real man is like  after you ve had a  good look at kirke waldron you ll be ready to let tom wendell and ridge  jordan and the rest of those bridal party men go to thunder  i don t  suppose waldron was ever an usher or best man at a wedding in his life   but i tell you he ll make every one of those little society men look like  copper cents  just the same      dorothy rose from her chair  her brown eyes surveyed her brother from  between heavy chestnut lashes  and just now they were very haughty eyes   her curving  crimson lips were scornful   i find it difficult to  believe   she observed   that a boy whom i particularly detested  one of  the most awkward  solemn faced  uninteresting boys i ever saw in my life   can have blossomed into such a wonder  as for ridgeway jordan  i like him  very much  he may be a society man  which is no crime  i believe  but he  is also making quite as good  in his way  as your friend  mr  waldron   and i certainly am not going to throw over an engagement as binding as  this one to give anybody  the time of his life       she walked out of the room  cancelling the effect of her haughtiness by  turning to throw back a smile at her brother  as ravishing a smile as if  he were no brother at all     her sister  mrs  jack elliot  entering in time to glance curiously  from dorothy s smile to julius s scowl  inquired of julius what might  be the matter     he shook his head   i don t like the symptoms  she takes it more and more  seriously when i hit ridge jordan in any way  i like ridge myself  but i  wouldn t see dot marry him for a good deal       i don t believe there is the least danger   his elder sister replied   she looked a mere girl herself  she was immolating herself just now  as  was everybody else in the suburban town  on the altar of the  clifford jordan bridal party  that the dinners and dances  drives and  luncheons might proceed without hindrance many family schedules were  being upset  mrs  jack s one anxiety at present was to have her charming  sister s bloom remain unworn by fatigue  thus far dorothy was holding  out better than any of the other bridesmaids   her colour was just as  good as ever  wasn t it   mrs  jack murmured absently  preparing to  remove dorothy s fruit plate   i don t believe she ate a thing but  fruit   she murmured      best thing she could do  after the stuff she undoubtedly got away with  at midnight her only salvation s a light breakfast  as to her colour  i  enriched it   he explained grimly   by mentioning my feeling about ridge   if i thought  after all the attentions that girl has had  that she d take  ridge jordan  with all his money  dot s no girl to care such a lot about  money  it s this crazy bridal party business that s upset her  i ll go  you  the thing s contagious  lord harry  i don t know that i could look  long at irene and harold myself without getting a touch of it       a touch  you and sally   mrs  jack smiled      oh  well  that s different   her brother thrust his hands into his  pockets and walked over to the window   entirely different  sally and i  were intended for each other from the beginning  everybody knows that   but now  what in thunder am i going to do with waldron  tell me that   i ve got him to come down here expressly to meet dot  of course i didn t  tell him so  he s not that sort  and now she s off for all to morrow with  that confounded bridal party       can t he come some other time       i should say not  certainly not for months  he s off to south america  for a long stay  has this one day to himself  you see it wasn t till i  met him yesterday that i realized what the fellow had become  and then it  came over me all at once what it might mean to have him meet dot just  now  i m no matchmaker        i should say that is just what you are       no  but   there is a tide   you know  and dot certainly has me worried  to death over ridge jordan       but  julius   mrs  jack s voice took on a tinge of anxiety   we ve  always thought well of ridge  i don t just see        i know you don t  he s not the man for dot  i want a real man for her   i ve got him  wait till you see kirke       you seem to think it s very simple        by george  i think it is  i know how he felt about her when she was a  youngster  adored the ground she walked on  she never looked at him  i  tell you she ll look at him now  he s worth looking at       if he s so fine looking he may be engaged to some other girl       he s not  i made sure of that   declared julius  audacity gleaming in  his eyes as usual   besides  i tell you  he s not that sort  he s no  matinee idol for looks  maybe you wouldn t even call him good looking   i do  he s got the goods in his face  handsome or not  i tell you he s  a real man  dot hasn t seen one yet  i ll make her see kirke  somehow   you wait      he marched away  head up  eyes thoughtful  lips pursed in a whistle     next morning  when three luxurious motor cars stopped at mrs  jack s  door  julius was lounging on the porch  it was his senior vacation  he  could be forgiven for lounging  in his flannels  hands in pockets  he  strolled down the steps with his sister to see her off  though ridgeway  jordan was escorting her devotedly  he surveyed her  as he followed her   with brotherly pride      that sister of mine has all the rest of them beaten at the  quarter mile   was his inward reflection   not much money to do it on   but she certainly knows how to get herself up to look as if she d just  walked out of a tailor s box and a milliner s bandbox  made that stunner  of a hat herself  i ll wager  fresh as a peach  her face  too  the others  look a bit jaded      along with these inner comments he was keeping up a running fire of  talk with two of the bridesmaids  whom he knew well  his bright black  eyes  however  noted that dorothy s place in the first car was next  that of ridgeway jordan  and that the face of that young man was  soberer than usual      bad sign   he reflected as he turned away  after a hot and heavy  exchange of banter with certain of the men as the car prepared to start    when a chap begins to look solemn  sitting beside a girl you know he s  in love with  you can be sure he has it on his mind to have it out with  her before the day is over  if i could have just got kirke to her  yesterday  ridge may do it any time now  i can see it in his eye  and she  may take him  i don t know what s got into dot  a month ago she d have  laughed at the idea of marrying him  but now i can t be sure of her   it s this idiotic bridal hysteria that s got her in its grip  by george   she  shan t  take him      an hour later  in his brother in law s trap  julius drove to the station  to meet his guest  kirke waldron  descending from the train  found his  old schoolmate  younger than himself  but well remembered as the imp of  the high school  waiting for him on the station platform      mighty glad to be sure of you   julius declared  shaking hands   until i  actually caught sight of you i was still expecting a wire saying you  couldn t afford even the one day       the coast is clear   waldron answered  returning the grip with equal  vigor   i closed every account at midnight and have my one day as  free as air       the question is   julius lost no time in beginning  as the two walked  along the trim  flower bordered suburban platform toward the waiting  trap   what sort of a day do you want  outdoors  of course  no question  of that in hot weather  but  with people or away from them  i can take  you to my sister s for luncheon  to tell the truth  she s counting on  that  but afterward i have a little plan to carry you up into the  mountains to a place i know for an all afternoon tramp and a dinner at  the best little inn in the country  back in the late evening  a dash down  to our river and a swim by moonlight  how does that programme suit you       it s great   agreed kirke waldron decidedly   nothing could suit me  better  vacation  to me  means outdoors always  and it s a long time  since i ve done any tramping in the home state       i knew you weren t one of the hammock and novel vacation sort   julius  said as he put his new old friend into the trap   i m not myself   though   he confessed with honesty   i have been known to sit with my  heels in the air for a longer consecutive period than you ve ever done if  all your sittings were lumped together       what do you know as to where i ve kept my heels       on the ground  planting one before the other without rest  day in and  day out  ever since i first knew you  that s why you re where you are   it doesn t take a soothsayer to tell that      waldron laughed   you re a flatterer   he said     julius shook his head   not a bit of it  it s written all over you  if i  got caught in the middle of an earthquake anywhere  and the ground  stopped shaking and i looked around me to find out what to do next  and  my eye fell on you out of hundreds bunched around me  i should  simply  follow you out of the mess       that s a great tribute   waldron admitted   from a fellow whom i used to  know as the cleverest at getting himself out of scrapes of all the boys  who were resourceful in getting into them       having exchanged large sized bouquets   julius observed with sudden  gravity   we will now drive home  do you know i m mighty sorry my sister  dorothy isn t there  you remember her  do you   or maybe you don t  she  was just a  kid  with a couple of long tails of hair down her back  my  second sister  barbara  we call her  bud   was in your class  i believe   she remembers you all right  says she was tremendously impressed by the  way you slew the fractions on the blackboard  bud married jack elliot  as  i told you yesterday  and a great old boy he is  too  for a  brother in law      discoursing of his family  with occasional mention of his sister dorothy   julius took his friend to the elliot home  mrs  jack  fresh and charming   made them welcome  jack himself  by some happy chance  had been able to  come out for luncheon  and the three men found each other thoroughly  congenial     after luncheon julius contrived a chance to exchange a brief colloquy  with mrs  jack on the subject of the guest      what do you think of him  bud  pretty fine sort to have developed from  the grub who did the stunts with fractions  with his freckled face  turning lobster colour because you girls were looking at him       i can t believe he s the same   mrs  jack whispered  looking through the  open window at the figure on the porch outside  its side turned toward  her   i haven t seen a man in a long time with so much character in his  face  he s not exactly handsome  but  yes  i certainly do like his face  very much  i wish  i really wish dot were here       oh  no  not at all   julius objected   dot s satisfied with ridge  jordan  or thinks she is  so are you       i have always liked ridge   mrs  jack insisted   but  well  mr  waldron  is quite another type       yes  quite another   julius murmured  and returned to the porch     before the two took the train for the mountains julius managed to let  waldron see a photograph of dorothy  as a matter of fact  photographs of  dorothy were all about the house  but in julius s own room hung one which  the brother considered the gem of them all  it showed one of those  straight out of the picture faces which are sometimes so attractive  the  eyebrows level above the wonderful eyes  the lips serious and sweet  the  head well poised upon the lovely neck  the whole aspect one of youth  unconscious of its charm  yet feeling a subtle power of its own     waldron  his attention called to the photograph  surveyed it with a quiet  comment   i should have known she would look like this when she grew  up   and turned away without undue lingering  yet julius was satisfied  that waldron would know the face again when he saw it  as it was intended  that he should     it was a journey of an hour and a half by rail up into the mountain  resort where  by certain artfully veiled investigations  julius had  ascertained that the bridal party would stop for dinner  scheming  joyously  he led his companion from the train at a station several miles  from saxifrage inn  alighting at a mere flag station in the midst of a  semi wilderness  the promised tramp began without the knowledge of the  guest as to where it was to end or hint as to what might be found there     coats over their arms  the two young men swung away upon the trail  a  wide  much used trail  which could be followed without difficulty  the  warm summer air was fragrant with the scent of balsam  pine  and fern   pine needles carpeted the path  faint forest sounds came to their  ears  the call of a loon from a distant lake  the whirr of a partridge   the chatter of a squirrel  the splash of falling water  waldron took off  his straw hat and tucked it under his arm  baring his forehead to the  spice laden breeze that now and then filtered through the forest   stirring languid leaves to motion      ah  but i d like to be just setting out on a fortnight of this   he  breathed   dressed for the part  a pack on my back  or a canoe  when i  was a boy i used to go on long canoeing trips  following our river to its  mouth  i don t like the tropics as well as i do the temperate zones       if you weren t such a tremendous grind you would do it now   julius  offered   a fellow needs a vacation  now and then  if he s to keep  in shape      waldron glanced at him  smiling   so he does  but somehow i ve managed to  keep in shape  i inherit from my father a fairly tough constitution  and  also the love of work  the seeing my job through to the finish without  loss of time  i suspect that s what keeps me going      they fell into talk about waldron s work     in answer to julius s questions waldron told him a good deal about the  work itself  little  as julius afterward realized  of his own part in it   the miles fell away beneath their steadily marching feet  and in due  season  by julius s management  they emerged from the trail at a certain  rocky bluff overlooking the distant country  upon which was perched the  small but county famous inn where they were to have dinner     a string of automobiles stood along the driveway  and among them julius  readily recognized the three with which he was familiar as those which  had been conveying the clifford jordan bridal party to and from its  places of entertainment for the last fortnight  no sign of the party  itself was to be seen upon the side piazzas which encompassed the inn   but this was easily understood  from some distance away the sounds  proceeding from a shrubbery screened point upon the bluff before the  inn betrayed the presence of a company of revellers  this was as it  should be  even julius broughton s audacity was not to be carried to  the point of forcing himself and his friend  uninvited  upon a set of  young people already carefully selected and for the time being rigidly  separated from the rest of mankind by metaphorical white ribbons  stretched to insure privacy     julius left waldron upon the porch and went into the inn to ascertain  if  might be  from the management where the bridal party would be dining   learning  as he had expected  that a private apartment was devoted to  their use  he went to the public dining room and selected a table  being  early he was able to secure one in an alcove  looking out through an open  window upon the path along which the bridal party  returning from the  bluff  would be sure to approach  to this he presently led waldron and  seated him so that he faced the path outside  the vista of distant  countryside beyond  the young people of the clifford jordan party were to  dine at eight  and it lacked only a few minutes of this hour when they  appeared down the path     julius had just given his order and leaned comfortably back in his chair  when he caught sight of them   by george   he ejaculated   well  well  so   this  is where they ve come  been mighty mysterious about where they  meant to spend the day  but we ve caught  em  started in the opposite  direction this morning  too  just for a blind  you see there are a lot of  practical jokers among clifford s friends  and their attentions haven t  been confined to the hour of the wedding itself  i say  recognize the  girl in the lead with the bride s brother  that light haired fellow      drawing back so that he was concealed by the curtains of the window  waldron looked out at the approaching bevy of young people  up the path  they came  talking  laughing  shifting like a pattern in a kaleidoscope   gay  handsome  sophisticated  modishly dressed  unconventionally  mannered  yet showing  most of them  the traces of that youthful ennui so  often betrayed in these modern days by those who of all the world should  feel it least     julius s brotherly eye rested upon his sister  as it had done that  morning  with cool satisfaction  some of the girls looked in disarray   hair tumbled  frocks rumpled  faces burned  dorothy s simple white serge  suit was unmussed  her hair was trim under her plain white hat with its  black velvet band  her colour was even  her dark eyes clear  although  ridgeway jordan was bestowing upon her the most devoted attentions  his  eyes constantly seeking  but seldom finding  hers  she was showing no  consciousness of it beyond the little  curving  half smile with which she  was answering him  in a word  her brother felt  dot was sweet  strong  and sweet and unspoiled  fascinating  too  being a woman and not without  guile  didn t she know  of course she did  that it was just that  noncommittal attitude of hers  amused and pleased and interested  but  unimpressed by their regard  that drew the men like a magnet     behind dorothy and young jordan one of the bridesmaids  an  extraordinarily pretty girl  was laughing hysterically  clutching at her  attendant s sleeve and then pushing him away  he was laughing with  her  and at her  and his eyes  all the time  were following dorothy  broughton  it seemed to julius  as the party came on  that most of the  girls were behaving foolishly  and quite all the men  perhaps it was  because they had all seen so much of each other during these days and  nights of merry making that they had reached the borders of a dangerous  familiarity  a little tired of one another most of them had become  it  was more than probable  against this background dorothy showed easily  the most distinction of them all  she looked in her simple attire   contrasted with the elaborate costumes of the other bridesmaids  like a  young princess reigning over a too frivolous suite     kirke waldron looked  unperceived  out of his window  and julius  turning  his eyes from the picture before him  observed his friend  waldron s face  was not what might be called an expressive one  it was the face of a man  who had learned not to show what he might be feeling  there was no mask  there  only cool and balanced control  coupled with the keenest  observation  but julius imagined that waldron s close set lips relaxed a  little as he stared at dorothy     the party came on into the inn  the sound of their voices and laughter  died away  some young people at a table near  who also had been  looking out of a window  made various comments to which julius listened  with interest      swell looking lot  wonder who they are       must be the bridal party they have here to night  dining privately       awfully pretty girls   was one young woman s opinion   better looking  than the men  why are the men in bridal parties never as good looking as  you expect       bridegroom doesn t want himself cut out  he has no advantage of a veil  and train  he has to stand out in his raw black and white and compete  with the other men on his own merits       i wonder if that was the bride  that prettiest girl in front       don t know  probably  if she is  the chap s lucky who gets her      julius felt a desire to get up and explain that his sister was nobody s  bride  and wasn t going to be anybody s until the right man came along   instead he sat still and stared at his plate  as he had watched his  sister coming toward him  with ridgeway jordan beside her looking into  her face with that look of eager hopefulness  he had experienced a  powerful longing to go out and lead ridge away to some secluded spot and  explain to him that he wasn t good enough  it wasn t as if there were  anything against young jordan  there was certainly nothing specific   julius found himself wishing there were     upon the bluff in the cool darkness the two young men spent the following  hour  enjoying to the full the refreshing  woods laden breath of the  night air  their pipes sending up clouds of fragrant smoke and keeping  them free from the onslaughts of the insects which otherwise at that  hour would have been very annoying  from time to time julius lighted  matches and consulted the unrelenting face of his watch  they did not  talk much  it was a time for silence and the comradeship of silence     the station at which the tram would stop was not a dozen rods from the  hotel  until the last minute  therefore  they could linger  but at half  after nine julius sprang up      let s go back to the hotel and wait on the porch   he proposed     the two paced back to the porch  which hummed with talk  the whole small  company of the inn s few permanent guests was gathered there  obviously  to see the bridal party when it should appear and take to its motors   there was not much to amuse hotel guests up here in the mountains  they  could not afford to miss so interesting a departure     from not far in the distance suddenly a whistle pierced the night air    i say  that s too bad   cried julius low to his friend   i hoped they d  come out before you had to go and you could meet dot  just our luck       we d better be off   said waldron  and he led the way  it was a flag  station  as he had learned  and he could not afford to lose the train  it  would be after midnight before he could get back to the city as it was   and he was to leave the city at nine in the morning for his long absence     someone was waving a lantern as they approached the station  the forest  hid the track in both directions  but the roar of the nearing train could  now be plainly heard     walking fast  a trifle in advance  waldron suddenly turned and spoke over  his shoulder   i suppose my ears deceive me  but that certainly sounds as  if it were coming from the wrong direction       your ears do deceive you  of course   julius responded   all sounds  are queer in the night  still  by george  it certainly does seem to  come from       the train  puffing and panting from its pull up the grade  now showed its  headlight through the trees  there was no question about it  it was  coming from the wrong direction  and therefore  unquestionably  was going  in the wrong direction      must be two trains pass here   cried julius  and he ran ahead to the  hotel hand who was still waving his lantern  although the train was  slowing to a standstill   there s another train to night   he questioned      no  sir  this one s all the  is to night      julius turned and looked at his friend   well  i certainly have got you  into a nice scrape   he said solemnly      it looks like it   waldron answered shortly   the thing is now  how to  get out of it  we must hire something and drive back  or to a station  somewhere      they debated the question  they hurried back to the office and  interviewed the management  which shook its head dubiously  the little  mountain resort was far from stations where trains could be had for the  city fifty miles away  the inn had no conveyance to offer except one work  team of horses and a wagon  guests invariably coming by train or motor   there were three automobiles out on the driveway  but they belonged to  the bridal party  there had been other automobiles  but they had all left  soon after dinner  their passengers having come for the dinner only  and  proceeding on their way in time to make some other stopping place by  bedtime  there seemed to be no way to get waldron back except to ask a  favour of ridgeway jordan     kirke waldron knit his brows when julius made this suggestion as a last  resort   i certainly hate to ask such a favour in the circumstances   he  said   but it s a case of  must   i wouldn t miss that ship to morrow  morning for any sum you could name  i can t miss it       i ll call ridge out   said julius promptly   or  well  good luck  here  he comes      wheeling  he advanced to meet a slim young man who was hurrying down the  wide staircase to the lobby  jordan s first glance was one of  astonishment  his second of suspicion  the reputation of julius broughton  for mischief  particularly at times like these  was one not to be lightly  overlooked  but julius s air of earnestness was disarming      no joking  ridge   he said   mr  waldron and i wandered over here on a  long tramp  dot wouldn t tell me where you people were going  we meant to  take the train at nine forty five  but  well  you know timetables  it  turned out to be an up train instead of a down train  it was all my  fault  it wouldn t matter  but mr  waldron will miss a more than  important engagement with a ship sailing for south america if he doesn t  get back to catch the eleven fifty to town  you see there isn t a  conveyance here       but of course there was no need to explain further  jordan was a  gentleman  and even if he had doubted julius there was no doubting the  expression in the eyes of the man to whom julius now presented him  young  jordan knew a man of serious affairs when he saw one  unquestionably he  saw one now  he promptly offered seats in one of the cars     waldron expressed his regret that they should be obliged to force  themselves upon a private party  and jordan assured him that it would be  a pleasure to serve them  although he said it with one more appraising  glance at julius  he added that he would take them in his own car  that  being the only one which had two seats to spare  as julius had noted this  fact in the morning he was not surprised  only grateful that he had not  had to scheme for this distribution of the company     jordan went to the desk and gave an order  then returned to his  party upstairs     julius and waldron retired to the porch     presently the party came trooping out  arrayed for the trip  dorothy in  an enveloping white coat  her hat replaced by a particularly effective  little rose coloured bonnet of her own clever manufacture  found herself  confronted upon the lantern lighted porch  as she was about to step into  the car  by her brother with a strange man at his elbow     she looked straight up at him  as julius presented him  he looked  straight down at her  and for an appreciable period of time the two pairs  of eyes continued to dwell upon each other  until this extraordinarily  thorough mutual survey was over neither said a word  the rest of the  party  diverting themselves with the usual laughter and badinage  some  of it of a recognizably sleepy character  took their places  and only  those nearest noted the addition to the list of passengers  the other man  and girl of jordan s car were an engaged pair  absorbed in each other  an  astute reason for his selection of them to accompany himself and dorothy     the rear seat of the great car easily held four people  ashworth and miss  vincent occupied two of the places  during the day jordan and dorothy had  held the other two  ashworth had already handed in miss vincent  the two  chaperons of the party young jordan had throughout the day thoughtfully  bestowed in the other cars      put my friend beside sis  will you  ridge   suggested julius in his  host s ear   they used to be old schoolmates and haven t met for years   he s off to morrow for a long stay  it s their only chance to talk over  old times      jordon nodded  there was nothing else to do  he could joyfully have  taken his friend julius by the scruff of his neck and hurled him out into  the night  if by some miracle he could suddenly have become that young  man s superior in strength  but social training prevailed over natural  brute instinct  and it was with entire politeness that he made this  arrangement of his guests     he then put julius into the seat beside the chauffeur  and himself took  one of the extra folding seats  swinging it about to half face those upon  the rear seat  in this manner he was nearly as close to miss dorothy  broughton as he would have been beside her  nearly  but not quite  to his  notion there was all the difference in the world     kirke waldron  understanding intuitively the position as come between in  which he had been placed in ridgeway jordan s big automobile by julius s  misreading of the railway timetable  and  as far as that part of the  situation was concerned  wishing himself a hundred miles away  was also  keenly alive to that which the gods  and julius  had given him by seating  him beside dorothy  as the car hummed down the long trail from the inn he  played his part with all the discretion of which he was capable  and he  had learned many things since the days when he had fallen over his own  awkward feet on the way to the blackboard  he talked a little with  dorothy  not too much  he talked considerably more with ridgeway  jordan  but not more than was necessary  the greater part of the time he  was silent with the rest  as was most fitting of all in the summer  moonlight and the balmy night air     dorothy  sitting beside him  reminded julius  as from time to time he  glanced contentedly back at her from  his place beside the chauffeur  of  a particularly demure kitten in the presence of two well bred but  definitely intentioned hunting dogs  she was very quiet  and only now and  then he caught a word or two from her or the low sound of her attractive  contralto laugh     just once  as the car whirled through a brightly lighted square in a  small village where a country festival of some sort was in progress  he  saw her take advantage of a moment when everybody s attention was caught  by the scene  and look suddenly and absorbedly at kirke waldron s face in  profile  but when ridge jordan whirled about upon his folding seat  to  call her attention to the antics of a clown in the square  she was ready  for him with a smile and a gay word of assent  julius laughed to himself   there was no question that kirke s face  even in profile  was one to make  ridge s look insignificant  as for the man himself      the car  rushing on through the summer night  its powerful searchlights  sending ahead a long  clear lane of safety where the road was straight   but making the dark walls on either side resolve into black pockets of  mystery where the curves came  approached one of those long  winding  descents  followed by a second abrupt turn and a corresponding ascent   which are  or should be  the terror of motorists  all good drivers  at  such places  hurling themselves through the darkness  sound warning  signals  lest other cars  less cautious  be rushing toward them without  sound of their coming     jordan s chauffeur  sending his car on down the winding hill with hardly  appreciable loss of speed  took this precaution  and the mellow but  challenging notes of his horn were winding a long warning when the thing  happened which was to happen  no accident  but the horror of one which  comes so close that it all but seizes its victims  and leaves them weak  and shuddering with what might have been     another car dashed around the lower turn  apparently not hearing the  warning  or determined to ignore it  that no momentum with which to climb  the steep grade coming should be lost  there was an instant in which the  two drivers glimpsed each other out of the gloom of the unlighted curve   then quick action upon the part of both  lightning like swerves to avoid  the danger  two great cars rocking each on the brink of disaster  then  righting themselves and running on into safety  no pausing to let any  look back and ponder upon the closeness of the escape     it was all over so quickly that it was like the swift passage of a  hideous thought  but there had been time for every soul in the car to  look death in the face  and in that moment of peril there had been  individual action  instantaneous  the action which is instinctive and  born of character     julius himself had sat absolutely still beside the chauffeur  his muscles  tensely bracing themselves for whatever might come  ashworth had caught  miss vincent  rigid with fear  into his arms  waldron  throwing up the  arm next to dorothy to grasp her with it  felt her hand leap toward him   and with his free hand seized it in his own     staring straight ahead then they saw a strange thing  yet not so strange  when one remembers human nature  ridgeway jordan had leaped to his feet  and thrown one leg over the side of the car ready to jump  when  before  he could complete the movement  the car righted itself and he sank back  into his seat      holy smoke   julius murmured under his breath  and glanced at the  chauffeur     that nearly imperturbable youth grunted in return  his hands were steady  upon the wheel  but he laughed a little shakily     then julius gazed back into the depths of the car  he could not see much   for the trees at this point were heavily overshadowing the road  but he  made out that ridge jordan was sitting stiffly in his seat  with  strange  to observe   his head turned toward the front of the car  behind him the  other figures were still and silent  julius guessed that nobody felt like  speaking  he did not feel like it himself  it had been a little too near  a thing to discuss at first hand     dorothy  her heart beating in a queer  throat choking way  became  conscious that her hand was held close and warm in another hand  an arm  that had been about her  whose clasp she had not consciously felt but  now remembered  had been withdrawn at the moment that the danger had  passed  but evidently  for the car had now gone a quarter of a mile  beyond the crucial point and was running smoothly along a wider and less  dangerous highway  her hand had been imprisoned in this strange grasp  for some time     she made a gentle but decided effort to withdraw it  an effort which  secured its release at once but brought a low question in her ear      are you all right       i  think so   she murmured in reply     it was not only the shock of the just avoided danger which held her in  its grip  but the other and even more startling revelations which had  come with it  her head was whirling  her pulses were thrilling with the  conflict of new and strange impressions  since three minutes ago a new  heaven and an old earth had suddenly shown themselves     the low voice pressed the question   not faint  nor frightened      she looked up at him then for an instant  although she could barely see  the outlines of his face   not with you here   she answered breathlessly   with the impulse toward absolute honesty with which such an experience  sometimes shakes the spirit out of its conventionalities     he was like a statue beside her for the space of six of her heartbeats   then his hand again found hers  pressed it in both of his  and let it  go  and his quiet speech  the note deeper than before  came once more  in her ear      i shall never forget that      they went on in silence     after a time ridge jordan turned about and made a carefully worded  inquiry into the comfort of his guests  which they answered with as  careful assurances that they were entirely comfortable and confident     ridge s voice was not quite natural  a biting shame was harassing him   whose only alleviation was the possibility that nobody  or at least  dorothy  had noticed in the excitement of the part that he had played   he was saying to himself  wretchedly  that he had not known it of  himself  that he could not have believed it of himself  how could he  have done it  have had the impulse  even  to leap to safety and leave  her behind  had she seen  had she seen  yet when  after a time  she  leaned forward and spoke to him of her own accord  her voice was so  kind  rang with such a golden note  that he felt with sudden relief  that she could not have seen     he turned about and began to talk again  growing more and more secure in  his belief that at the supreme moment of danger nobody had thought of  anybody but himself or herself  and by the time the car drew into the  home town jordan was serene again     under the first of the arc lights julius took counsel with his watch  he  swung about and spoke tersely   you and i d better jump out here and make  the station  waldron  it s closer to train time than i thought  we re  awfully obliged to you  ridge       we ll go that way  it s only a block or two out of our course   jordan  insisted  eager to speed the parting guest     the car drew toward the string of electrics which lighted the small  suburban station at which waldron had arrived in the morning  the  glancing  silver arrowed radiance illumined the whole interior of the  car under its wide spreading  hooded top  waldron could see dorothy s  brilliant eyes  the curve of her lips  the rose colour in her cheeks  repeating warmly the deeper rose colour of the little silk bonnet which  kept her dark hair in order  all but one wild willed little curly strand  which had escaped and was blowing about her face  dorothy  in her turn   could see waldron s clean cut  purposeful face  his deep set eyes  the  modelling of his strong mouth and chin  the fine line of his cheek     as they had looked at each other when they first met  so they looked at  each other again before they parted  yet between that meeting and that  parting something had happened  it was in his eyes as he looked at her   it was in her eyes as for one instant  before she dropped bewildering  lashes  she gave him back his look  it meant that south america was not  so far away but that a voyager could come back over the same high seas  which had conveyed him there  and that when he came       i m grateful to you  mr  jordan   waldron said  shaking hands beside the  car   more than i can say to you  you have done me a greater kindness  than you know  good night  to you all      he went away with julius without a glance behind after the salute of his  lifted hat  which included everybody     by some common impulse the rest of the party all looked after the two as  they walked away toward the station door      seems like an uncommonly nice chap   was ashworth s comment   i ll wager  he s something  somewhere       he has a very interesting face   his fiancee conceded      yes  hasn t he   dorothy agreed lightly  something evidently being  expected of her      he may be the tenth wonder of the world   declared ridgeway jordan   springing in to take his old place beside her for the drive of an eighth  of a mile left to him   but i grudge him this hour by you  jove  but i  thought the drive would never end      julius  after seeing his friend off with a sense of comradeship more  worth while than any he had known  walked rapidly back  eager for a word  with dorothy  quick as he was  however  she was quicker  and he found her  locked into her own room  by insisting on talking through the door he got  her to open it  but there was not so much satisfaction in this as he had  expected  because she had extinguished her lights      how did you like him   was his first eager question      very well   said a cool  low voice in the darkness   much better than  the trick you used to carry out your wishes       trick   her brother exclaimed  all the angel innocence he could summon  in his voice   when you wouldn t tell me a word of where you were going       you guessed it  it was abominable of you       oh  see here  if i hadn t managed it you wouldn t have seen him  and he  wouldn t have seen you       and what of that   queried the cool voice  cool but sweet  dot s voice   even in real anger  was never harsh      well  what of it   was the counter question   can you honestly say you  wish you hadn t met him  a real man like that      there was silence  julius moved cautiously across the room  avoiding  chairs as best he could   be honest now  isn t he the real thing   and isn t ridge jordan        please don t talk about poor ridge that way  jule       poor ridge   cried julius   well  well  you didn t speak of him that way  this morning  what s happened       nothing has happened  that is       he came close  there was a queer little shake in dorothy s voice  she  began to laugh then quite suddenly to cry  julius came near enough to pat  her down bent head      did that confounded close call shake you up a bit   he inquired  sympathetically   by george  when i think what i let you and kirke and  everybody in for  starting earlier than they meant and all that  so we  were just in time to meet that fool in the worst place on the road       dorothy looked up  to his astonishment she sprang to her feet and clasped  him about the neck  burying her face on his shoulder  she began to say  something into his ear  laughing and crying at the same time  so that all  he was at length able to gather was that she didn t regret the close  call at all  for it had shown her  had shown her      julius had not seen ridge jordan make his move to spring from the car   but he had felt it  felt ridge s hand strike his shoulder  his knee hit  his back  he had not taken in its meaning at the instant  but when he had  turned about and seen ridge sitting stiffly facing ahead it came to him  what had happened at the crisis  he had wondered whether dot had seen it   now he knew  not that she said it  in fact  she said nothing  intelligible  but she held her brother tight before she sent him away   and somehow he understood that fate had helped him to show dorothy her   real man      somehow she had known that waldron would write  it was impossible to  recall his face and not know that he was a man of action  he would not go  away for six months and leave behind him only a memory to hold her  thoughts to his  she wondered only when his letter would come     four times a day the postman was accustomed to leave the mail in an  interesting heap upon the table in mrs  jack elliot s hall  dorothy  from  the very morning after the trip to saxifrage inn  had found herself  scanning the pile with a curious sense of anticipation  she wondered what  waldron s handwriting was like  she recalled his workmanlike little  figures upon the blackboard  and made up her mind that his penmanship  would be of a similar character  compact and regular  another man would  have sent her flowers before he sailed  instinctively she knew that  waldron would not do this  she did not expect nor wish it  but he would  write  unquestionably  how would he write  that was the question which  made her pulses thrill     it was some time before the letter came  as she had guessed it would be   he had written on shipboard  and the letter came back to her from greater  inagua  the first west indian island at which his ship had touched   coming in one september evening from a long walk through the hazy air   its breath fragrant with the peculiar pungent odour of distant forest  fires  dorothy found the letter on the hall table  she knew it was his  before she saw the postmark  recognized  as if she had often seen it  the  clean cut  regular lettering  the mark of the man of exactness and order   of the well trained mind  her heart leaped at sight of it  a heart which  had never before really leaped at sight of any man s handwriting  she  picked up the letter and went away upstairs with it to her room  here she  locked the door     she placed the letter upon her dressing table and studied its envelope  while she removed her dress  brushed and arranged her hair  and put on  the frock she intended to wear for the evening  she was going with tom  wendell to a small dance at the home of a special friend  she did not  open the letter  but left it  unopened  propped up against a little pink  silk pincushion  giving it one last glance as she switched off the light  before closing the door  on the evening of the clifford jordan wedding  ridgeway jordan  brother of the bride and best man to the bridegroom  had  offered himself in marriage to the maid of honour  dorothy broughton  she  had done her best to prevent him  but he had reached such a stage of  despairing passion that he could no longer be managed and did the deed at  a moment when she could not escape  being gently but firmly refused  he  had declared his life to be irretrievably ruined and immediately after  the wedding had flung himself out of town  vowing that she should not be  bothered with the sight of the work her hands had wrought  when another  long time friend  thomas wendell  seized the opportunity of ridge s  absence to further his own claims to dorothy s preferment  she  profiting  by painful experience  had somehow made it clear to him that only  comradeship was in her thoughts  even on these tacit terms wendell was  eager to serve as escort whenever she would allow it     on this september evening he was on hand early and bore her away with  ill concealed satisfaction   i say   he observed suddenly in the pause of  a waltz   did you happen to have a fortune left you to day       why  tommy   dorothy s face grew instantly sober      oh  don t turn off the illumination  i m sorry i spoke  it was only that  you somehow seemed  well  not exactly unhappy to night  and i couldn t  get at the cause  i should like to flatter myself that i m the cause  but  i know better       i must be a gloomy person ordinarily if there seems any change  to night  don t be foolish  thomas  i ve had no fortune left me  i never  shall have      she felt not unlike one with a fortune  however  a fortune of unknown  character about to be made known to her  as  shortly after  midnight  dorothy kept comparatively early hours when she went to  dances  she opened the door of her room again  her first glance was for  the letter  there it stood as she had left it  more than once during the  evening she had caught herself fearing that something might happen to it  in her absence  she might find the letter gone  forever gone  and unread   she smiled at it as she saw it standing there  but still she did not open  it  she took off her dancing frock  braided her hair for the night in two  heavy plaits  and slipped into a little loose gown of cambric  lace  and  ribbon before at last she approached the waiting letter     why she did all this  putting off the reading of it until the latest  possible moment  only a girl like dorothy broughton could have told  and  even when she broke the seal it was with apparently reluctant fingers  it  was so delightful not to know  yet to be upon the verge of knowing  but  as soon as the first words met her eyes there was no longer any delay   she read rapidly  her glance drinking in the letter at a draught      on board s s   westerwald   off greater inagua     august              dear dorothy broughton  the first time i saw you was the day you came to  school for the first time  you wore a blue sailor dress with a white  emblem on the sleeve  and your curly black hair was tied with red  ribbons  you did not see me that day  nor any other day for a long time   i was simply not in your field of vision  that year i was wearing my  older brother s suit  and i had pressed him rather closely in inheriting  it  so that it was none too large for me  i remember that the sleeves  were a bit short  anyhow  whether it was the fault of the suit or not  i  had a very indefinite idea what to do with my feet when they were not  in action  and even less at times when they were  i recall vividly that  there seemed to be a sort of ground swell between my desk and the  blackboard  so that i never could walk confidently and evenly from one to  the other  when by any chance i imagined your eyes were turned my way the  ground swell became a tidal wave      once  just once  i was allowed to help you with a lesson  you were  unable to make head or tail of a problem in fractions  i don t think  figures were your strong point  miss edgewood began to show you  an  interruption came along  i happened to be at her elbow  i had a sort of  reputation for figures  she called on me to help you out  i remember that  at the summons my heart turned over twice  and its action after that was  irregular  affecting my breathing and making my hand shake  luckily it  did not upset my brain  so that i was able to make the thing clear to  you  i dared not look at you  you did not get it at first and you stamped  your foot and said   but i don t see any  sense  to it   i replied with a  tremendous effort at lightening the situation   plenty of cents  and  dollars  too   at which you turned and gave me a look  at first of pride  and anger  then melting into appreciation of my wit  and ending by  blinding me with the beauty of your laughter  we went on from that  famously  and you saw the thing clearly and thanked me  i thought i knew  you then  had made myself a friend of yours  next day  alas  you passed  me with a nod  but i never forgot what it might be like to know you      we are four days out from new york  shall call at matthew town to day   another eight days will bring us to puerto colombia  then for the river  trip which will take me within thirty miles of the camp in the mountains   when i am up at the mines i shall write again  my address will be puerto  andes  colombia  the port of the company  if some day  when i go down the  trail to send off my report  i should find a letter from you  i should go  back the happier      meanwhile i am      faithfully yours      kirke waldron      dorothy went over and stood by the window  gazing out into the september  night  it was an unpretentious letter enough  but she liked it  liked it  very much  he had gone back to the beginning  picked up the one link  between them in their past  the fact that they had been schoolmates  he  had dared to remind her of his poverty  of his awkward schoolboy  personality  and of the fact that even in those days he had cared how she  might regard him  well  as for the poverty  she knew his family  knew  that it was of good stock  that his parents were people of education and  refinement  and that circumstances wholly honourable had been the cause  of their lack of resources     should she answer the letter  how should she not answer it  delay  then   lest he think her too eager with her reply  why   when she knew as well  as he  and he as well as she  that the thing was already done  that the  mutual attraction had been of the sort which holds steadily to the end   yet  being a woman  she could not fling herself into his arms at the  first invitation  and indeed he had not invited  he had counted on her  wish to begin at the beginning and play the beautiful  thrilling play  through to the end  as if it were not already decided how it was to come  out  the fact that she knew how it was to come out would not make it  less the interesting play  in a world where  after all  strange things  happen  so that no man may see the end from the beginning  nor count  upon as inevitable an outcome which all the fates may combine to  threaten and to thwart     so she delayed a little before she wrote  she let one ship  two ships   sail without her message  so that it would not be at the first tramping  of the trail into puerto andes that he should find the letter  when it  finally left her hands it was a very little letter after all  and one  which it could not be imagined would take three days to write  as it had      dear mr  waldron  i think i know quite well that the little girl of the  curly black hair  red ribbons  and blue sailor dress was a very  audacious  pugnacious little person  and i wonder that you were willing  to help her through the tangle of fractions as you did so cleverly  i  well remember thinking you a very wonderful scholar  but you were so  much older than i that i admit not thinking about you very much  it was  like that small girl to stamp her ridiculous foot  she has gone on  stamping it  more or less  all her life  but i believe she has done some  smiling  too      it will be very interesting to hear from the depths of colombia  school  days are so far gone by i had to look it up on the map  is it very hot  there  and do you live on bananas and breadfruit  i don t mind showing  how little i know  because then you may tell me about it  i am really  going to read up concerning south america at once  so that i may be an  intelligent if not a  gentle  reader      very good luck to you there      wished you by     dorothy broughton      as promptly as the return mails could bring her a reply one came   although it was  of course  a matter of weeks  during those weeks dorothy  had not only  read up  on the subject of south america with especial  reference to colombia  she had also posted herself  so far as a general  reader may  concerning the rather comprehensive subject of mining  engineering  this knowledge helped her to an understanding of waldron s  next letter  he gave her a brief but graphic description of his  surroundings in a camp upon the mountains  reached by a trail of nearly  thirty miles from puerto andes  certain long delayed and badly needed  machinery had arrived at ten o clock of the previous evening  packed over  the trail by mules  this had been unloaded by three in the morning  and  the engineers had been so glad to see the stuff at last that they had  been unwilling to go at once to bed  tired as they were  the mail had  come in by the same route  and it had been by the smouldering campfire of  the early morning that waldron had read his letter from dorothy   such a  very short letter   he said of it  and continued      yet it was more welcome than you can guess  i had done a lot of  speculating as to what it would look like when it came  if it came  and  it looked not unlike what i had fancied  i was sure you wouldn t write  one of those tall  angular hands  ten words to a page  which remind one  of linked telegraph poles  neither would you be guilty of that  commonplace little round script which school children are taught now  and  which goes on influencing their handwriting all their days  there would  be character in it  thought i  and there was      it made me long for more  that letter  i wonder if you have the least  idea what it feels like to be off in a country like this  your only real  companion another engineer  splendid fellow  hackett  and i couldn t ask  a better  and the work is great  but there comes an hour now and then  when there seems more beauty in one small letter postmarked  home  than  in all the gorgeous sunsets of this wonderful country      may i write often and at length  i can think of no happier way to spend  the hour before we turn in than in writing to you  and if you will  answer my letters  as you have been so good as to do with my first one  i  shall have the most compelling reason of my life to watch the mails      i want  as i wanted when a schoolboy   to know you   i want you to know  me  there is no way in which this can be accomplished for a long time to  come except by letters  won t you agree to this regular interchange  i  don t mean that which i presume you mean when you say it will be   interesting to hear from colombia   you mean  i suppose  a letter now  and then  at the intervals which conventionality imposes at the beginning  of a correspondence  possibly shortening as time goes on  but taking at  least half a year to get under way  i want it to get under way at once   we can receive mail but once a fortnight at the best up here  and there  are often delays  so if you answer my letters as soon as you get them i  shall not hear from you too often  please      i am an engineer  you know  that means a fellow who is trained to  action  all the time  if he can t get results fast enough by working his  men by day he works them by night also  day and night shifts  and works  with them  too  much of the time  in that way  well  samples taken from  our south drift assay more than we had dared to hope a ton  but not till  we got well in  the vein may pinch out  of course  but there are no signs  of it  i expect it to widen instead  and grow richer in quality  so  if  you ll forgive the miner s analogy  with another vein i know of  the  finest sort of gold      so the correspondence began  it was easy for a young woman of dorothy s  discernment to see that here was no case for a long distance flirtation   if she had wanted one  from the moment when she had flung her left hand  into waldron s right  and that other moment when she had told him with  absolute truth that she was not afraid with him beside her  he had taken  her at her word  she could not play with him  even if he had been near  her  far less now that thousands of miles separated them  she answered  with a letter of twice the length of her first one  a gay little letter   full of incident and her comments thereon  the reply came promptly  and  this time it was a long one  he told her many details of the situation as  it was developing in these new  extraordinarily promising mines  and she  found it as fascinating as a fairy tale  but  of course  although she  read these pages many times over  she read more often certain opening and  closing passages  one ran like this      now to bed  and to work again with the dawn  while i am writing to you i  forget everything about me  natives may chatter near me  i don t hear  them  my friend hackett may come and fire a string of questions at me   he tells me afterward my answers wouldn t do credit to a monkey on a  stick  i am lost in the attempt to put your face before me  your face as  i saw it last  there was not much light in the car  but what there was  fell on your face  i see rose colour always  what was it  the bonnet   if  they call those things bonnets  i see more rose colour  reflection  i see  a pair of eyes which were not afraid to look into mine  for a minute   only for a minute  but i can see them      the night grows cold  even in the tropics the nights may be cold in  the mountains  my fire has burned down to a few coals  my bunk awaits  me  i thought i was tired when i sat down to write  i m not tired  now  refreshed      good night  sleep well  up there somewhere in the north      after this letter dorothy broughton went about like a girl in a dream     yet she was so practical a girl  had been so thoroughly trained to fill  her days with things worth while  that she was able to keep up a very  realistic appearance of being absorbed in the old round of duties and  pleasures  she was leading a life by no means idle or useless  as for the  happiness of it  she carried about with her a constant sense that  something wonderful had happened  was happening  and was yet to  happen  which made no task too hard for her newly vitalized spirit     the day before thanksgiving the arrival of a particularly thick letter  from colombia gave her a more than ordinarily delightful sense of  anticipation  her brother julius  at home for the annual festival  saw it  upon the hall table three seconds before she did  and captured it  he  withdrew from his breast pocket another letter in a similar handwriting  addressed to himself  with an expression of great gravity he compared the  two while dorothy held out her hand in vain      don t be in a hurry   he advised her   there is a curious likeness  between these two addresses  not to mention the envelopes  which  interests but baffles me  the word  broughton  in both cases begins with  an almost precisely identical b  the small t is crossed in almost exactly  the same manner  with a black bar of ink which indicates a lavish  disposition  the whole address upon your letter seems to me to bear a  close and remarkable resemblance to the address upon mine  another point  which should not be overlooked  both are postmarked with a south american  stamp  a colombian stamp  with  yes  with the same stamp  what can this  mean  i        when you are through with your nonsense    dorothy still extended her  hand for her letter     julius sat down upon the third step of the staircase  his countenance  indicating entire absorption in the comparison before him  he held the  letters in one hand  with his other he made it clear to his sister that  her nearer approach would be resisted   there is one point where the  likeness fails   he mused   my letter is an ordinary one as to thickness   it consists of two meagre sheets of rather light weight paper  your  letter  on the other hand  strikes me as extraordinarily bulky  now  there        jule  i m busy  will you please        just as i get on the trail of this thing you insist on diverting my  mind   her brother complained bitterly  he held the two letters at arm s  length  continuing to study them while his extended hand kept his sister  away  but she now turned and walked off down the hall     he looked after her with a sparkle in his black eyes   sis   he  entreated   don t go  i need your help  have you by any chance an inkling  as to the sender of these curiously similar epistles      she turned  her eyes were sparkling  too  she shook her head      i ll tell you what   cried the inspired julius   let s read  em  together  paragraph by paragraph  look here  i dare you to   he suddenly  challenged her   mine first   stuffing his sister s letter into his  pocket he spread forth his own   i suppose you always read the last page  first   said he   i ve understood women do  so we ll begin at the last  page  listen      she would have left him but he had walked over to her and now held her by  the wrist while he began to read  it was impossible for her eyes to  resist the drawing power of that now familiar penmanship      in this way forty two miles of trail were cleared from ten to fourteen  feet wide  most of our efforts being concentrated on the grading   bridges  and corduroying  four pastures were cleaned out  of about  seven  six  and four cabullos each  or about twenty three to twenty six  acres in all  these pastures were burned and grass has started in most  of them  we built palm houses or shacks at each stopping place  we feel  pretty well satisfied with the trail  you must not get the idea that we  have an automobile road  for we haven t  but we are now much better  prepared to handle supplies and machinery   julius looked up   suppose  yours is as thrilling as that  now for a paragraph of yours  shall i  open it for you      but by a quick motion she escaped him and had the letter  she was  laughing as she slipped it into some unknown place about her dress      now see here   julius persisted  following her up the stairs   i have to  look into this  as a brother  judging by the bulk of that letter it is  not the first one from the same person  how long have you two been  corresponding in my absence and without my permission      dorothy turned and faced him  her face was full of vivid colour  but her  eyes were daring   since august       hm  does he write entertaining letters       very       gives you a full report of his operations  i suppose  with a dip into  the early history of the country and the result of his researches into  the spanish settlement       yes  indeed       ever touch on anything personal   mutually personal  i mean  of course       never      julius scanned her face   he writes me   said he   that instead of  staying only six months it s likely to be a year before he can come  north  the company who picked him to go down and put this thing through  has decided to make a much bigger thing of it than was at first intended   too bad  eh  fine for him  but a year s quite a stretch for a chap who   as i recall it  went away with some reluctance  just at the last      dorothy met his intent eyes without flinching   he is so interested in  his work i should say it was not too bad at all   she responded     she then was allowed to make her escape  while julius went back  downstairs  smiling to himself   that shot told   he exulted     in her room dorothy opened her letter  if julius s news were true she  would soon know it  out of the envelope fell a small packet of  photographs  but it was not their presence alone which had made it so  bulky  the letter itself was three times as long as her brother s     dorothy eagerly examined the photographs which had fallen out of kirke  waldron s letter  they had been taken all about his camp in colombia and  the surrounding country  picturing the progress that had been made in the  development of the mines  in one or two of the pictures  showing groups  of native workmen  she made out waldron s figure  usually presenting him  engaged in conversation  his back turned to the lens  but one picture had  been taken in front of his own shack with its palm leaf thatching  he was  standing by the door  leaning against the lintel  dressed in his working  clothes  pipe in hand  looking straightforwardly out of the picture at  her and smiling a little  the figure was that of a strong  well built   outdoors man  the face full of character and purpose  lighted by humour   the steady eyes seemed very intent upon her  and it was a little  difficult for her to remind herself that it was undoubtedly his fellow  engineer and friend  hackett  at whom he was gazing with so much  friendliness of aspect rather than at her far away self     the letter  however  toward its close set her right upon this point  he  had told her of his decision to stay and see the full development of the  mine through  in spite of the wrench it cost him to think of remaining a  year without a break  then  going on to describe the taking of the  photograph  he had written      the company is very glad to get as much as we can send it of actual  illustration of our labours  so we make it a point to snap these scenes  from time to tune  there is one picture  however  which was not taken  for the company  hackett asked me to hold the lens on him for a shot to  send to somebody up north there  so he went inside and freshened up a  bit and came out grinning  i grinned back as i took the picture  and  said i was glad to see him so cheerful  he replied that the smile was  not for me  that though he had apparently looked at me he had really  been looking through me at a person about as different from myself as i  could well imagine      it s a poor rule that doesn t work both ways  so i then took my place by  the door of our palatial residence  and gazed  apparently  at hackett s  indian red visage  i found it entirely possible to forget  as he had  done  the chap before me  and see instead  well  look at the picture  and  please don t let those lashes drop too soon  when i imagine them they  always do      it was thus that the correspondence went on  dorothy never replied  directly to such paragraphs as these  but she did send him  a few  weeks after the arrival of the colombian photographs  a little  snapshot of herself taken in winter costume as she was coming down the  steps of her home  it was an exquisite bit of portraiture  even though  of small proportions  and it called forth the most daring response he  had yet made      i know you wouldn t want it pinned up in the shack  and it s much too  valuable to risk leaving it among my other possessions there  so i carry  it about in an old leather letter case in my pocket  i hope you don t  mind  i m a little afraid of wearing it out  so i ve constructed a sort  of a frame for it  out of a heavy linen envelope  which will bear  handling better than the little picture     you are looking straight out  at me  at  me   i wish i knew it  won t you tell me  dorothy  you can  trust me  can t you  there are some things which can t be said at long  distance  they must wait  i get to feeling like a storage battery  sometimes  overcharged  meanwhile  trust me  dorothy      but she would send him only this      of course i was looking at you  why not  it s only courtesy to recognize  the salutation of a gentleman disguised in working clothes  standing in  the door of a queer looking south american residence  besides  he looks  rather well  i think      one april evening mr  julius broughton  sitting comfortably in his room  in a certain well known building at a well known university  was summoned  to telephone  bringing his feet to the floor with a thump  flinging aside  his book and puffing away at his pipe  he lounged unwillingly to the  telephone box  the following conversation ensued  causing a sudden and  distinct change in the appearance of the young man      broughton   he acknowledged the call   broughton  this is  waldron  kirke waldron       who       waldron  up from colombia  south america  forgotten me       what  forgotten you  i say  when did you come  where are you   will you       the distant voice cut in sharply   hold on  i ve just about one minute to  spend talking  can you come downtown to the warrington street station  if  you ll be there at ten  sharp  under the south side clock  i can see you  for ten minutes before i leave for the train  i want to see you very  much  explain everything then       of course i ll come  delighted  be right down  but aren t you  going to        i ll explain later   said waldron s decisive voice again   sorry to ring  off now  good bye       well  great george washington   murmured julius to himself as he  replaced the receiver on the hook and reinserted his pipe in his mouth   to emit immediately thereafter a mighty puff of smoke   i knew the  fellow was a hustler  but i should suppose that when he comes up from  south america to telephone he might spend sixty or seventy seconds at it   must be a sudden move  no hint of it in his last letter      he consulted his watch  he would have to emulate waldron s haste if he  reached the warrington street station by ten o clock  he made a number of  rapid moves  resulting in his catching a through car which bore him  downtown at express speed and landed him in the big station at a minute  before ten  hurrying through the crowd he came suddenly face to face with  the man he sought     tanned to a seasoned brown  and looking as vigorous as a lusty pine tree   waldron shook hands warmly     but before julius had more than begun his expressions of pleasure at  seeing his friend again so unexpectedly waldron turned and indicated a  young man s figure in a wheelchair   that s my friend and associate  engineer  hackett  over there  he s had a very bad illness and i m taking  him home  we ll go over and speak to him in a minute  meanwhile  i shall  have to talk fast  first  is your sister dorothy well   the direct gaze  had in it no apology for speaking thus abruptly      fine   julius assured him   haven t you heard from her lately       not since i sailed  naturally  nor for a fortnight before that  i came  away very unexpectedly  sooner than i should have done but for hackett   who needed to get home  but the trip combines that errand with a lot of  business  seeing the company directors  consulting with the firm  looking  up machinery and getting it shipped back with me on the next boat  i  haven t an hour to spare anywhere but on this flying trip to hackett s  home  which will take twenty four hours  and i shall have to work night  and day  and  i want to see your sister      again the direct look  accompanied this time  by a smile which was  like a sudden flash of sunshine  as julius well remembered  waldron  did not smile too often  but when he did smile  well  one wanted to do  what he asked      does she know   julius demanded      not a word  there was no way to let her know except to cable  and  i  have no right to send her cable orders  or requests  broughton  as i  figure it out  i have just one chance to see her  and that only with your  cooperation  and hers  i don t believe i need explain to you that it  seems to me i must see her  going back without it is unthinkable  i don t  know when i may be north again  yet i can t neglect hackett or my duty to  the company       then  how the dickens        i shall be coming back on the train that reaches this station at two  o clock saturday morning  it will go through your home city at midnight   would it be possible for you and miss dorothy to take that train when it  leaves boston friday night  and so give me the time between there and  your station      julius broughton  born plotter and situation maker as he was  rose to the  occasion gallantly  it tickled him immensely  the whole idea  he spent  five seconds in consideration  his eye fixed on the lapel of waldron s  coat  then he spoke      leave it to me  i ll have to figure it out how to get around dot  you  mustn t think she s going to jump at the chance of going to meet a man  instead of having him come to meet her  she s used to having the men  do the travelling  you know  while she stays at home and forgets  they re coming       i know  and you know  and i think she knows also  that only necessity  would make me venture to ask such a favour       i may have to scheme a bit        no  please don t  i prefer not to spend the time between stations  explaining the scheming and apologizing for it  put it to her frankly   letting her understand the situation       julius shook his head   she s not used to it  she ll find it hard to  understand why you couldn t stop off and get out to our place  if only  for an hour       then show her this      waldron took from his breast pocket a card  on which  in very small   close writing and figures  was a concise schedule of his engagements for  the coming five days  and  as he had said  nights     julius scanned it  and whistled softly a bar from a popular song   now do  you see    do eating and sleeping happen to come in on this anywhere   he  queried gently      on the run  it s this trip up into new hampshire that s crowding things   otherwise  i might have managed it very well       couldn t anybody else have seen mr   hackett home   asked julius      no   waldron s tone settled that and left no room for dispute   there  are some things that can t be done  you know  and that s one of them   he  glanced at the great clock over his head   come over and meet him      julius went     a long  thin figure  wrapped in an ulster  reached out a hand  and a  determinedly cheerful voice said  with an evident effort not to show the  severe fatigue the journey was costing the convalescent   think of me as  sackett or jackett or something  i m no hackett  they re a huskier lot       as you will be soon  of course   julius broke in confidently      colombia air is pretty fine  but new hampshire air is better  for old  new hampshire boys   asserted waldron  he nodded at a red capped  porter waiting near  and laid a hand on his friend s shoulder   this  chap is going to be all right when he gets where a certain little  mother can look after him  mothers and blood poisoning don t assimilate  a bit  and now we have to be off  for i want to get my patient settled  in his berth before the train pulls out  and it s going to be called in  about thirty seconds      he turned aside for a final word with julius   i m not asking too much       do you think you are      the two pairs of eyes searched each other      i know miss dorothy is an orphan  i know  too  that you are her only  brother  you understand that i mean to ask her to marry me  if i can have  the chance  i couldn t do it  on paper  if you approve the match  and i  think you do or you wouldn t have planned quite so cleverly last july        what       you brought about that meeting  you know   said waldron  smiling  with  such a penetrating look that julius felt it go past all defenses      how do you know i did       by a certain peculiar twist to your left eyebrow when that train came in  from the wrong direction  you forget that i went to school with you  i  have seen that twist before  it meant only one thing       well  i ll be  see here  it was after dark when that train        the hotel hand had a lantern  you unwisely allowed its rays to strike  your face      julius burst into a smothered laugh   well  you re a good one       i m glad you think so  since i m asking of you this thing you so  dislike to do       i don t dislike it  i m delighted to have the chance  i ll have her on  that train if i have to blindfold her       don t do that  show her the card      the two shook hands with a strong grip of affection and understanding   then waldron  wheeling the chair himself  took his friend hackett away as  carefully as if he were convoying a baby  julius  after seeing the party  through the gates  went back to his college rooms  his wits busy with the  task which so took hold of his fancy     julius would have enjoyed scheming involvedly  but waldron had been too  peremptory about that to allow of a particle of intrigue  so  before he  slept  he sent his sister a special delivery letter knowing she would  receive it in the morning  it stated  after describing the situation to  her  with a few private and characteristic touches of his own   that he  would call her up by telephone to receive her reply  and that he would  go through the city on a certain afternoon train on which she was to  join him  this plan would give the pair time for a leisurely dinner in  boston before meeting waldron upon the ten o clock train  when he had  dorothy on the wire next morning he was not surprised that her first  words were these      julius  is it surely julius  well  i don t see how i can go       why not  got the mumps  or any other disfiguring complaint       mercy  no  but  it can t be that it is necessary  he  he certainly  could        did you read that schedule      julius s voice had in it a commanding  no compromise quality  he knew  that this feminine evasiveness was probably inevitable  they were made  that way  these girls  but he did not intend to let the time limit of an  expensive long distance call be exceeded by mere nonsense      ye es  but        now listen  we ve got three minutes to talk  we ve used thirty seconds  already saying nothing  i m going to be on that train  i m going to have  that little trip with kirke  and if you don t have it  it will be pure  foolishness  and you ll cry your eyes out afterward to think you didn t   he can t get to you  if he could he d do it  you must know him well  enough for that if you ve been hearing from him all these months   now  will you be there       julius  i m afraid i        will you be there       why  don t you think i  perhaps i ought to have bud        no  i don t  i m all the chaperon you ll need for this affair  if you go  and get another woman mixed up with it you ll lose half of your fun  for  she ll be sure to forget she s the chaperon  you know bud  and first you  know you ll be chaperoning her  see  will you be at the station  i m  going to hang up now in just fifteen seconds       oh  jule  wait   i        all right  i ll telephone down for the seats  good bye      he was on the vestibuled platform of his car to meet her when his train  passed the home city from whose suburbs she had come in  his eager eye  fell delightedly on the trimly modish figure his sister presented  he  would be proud to take her back into his car  he knew just how two or  three sleepy fellows of his own age  in chairs near his own  would sit up  when they saw him return with this radiant girl  dot certainly knew how  to get herself up  he reflected  as he had often done before     it was april and it was  raining cats and dogs  as dorothy came aboard   but the blue rainproof serge of her beautifully fitting suit was little  the worse therefor  and the close little black hat with the fetching  feather was one to defy the elements  be they never so wildly springlike      you re a good sport   was julius s low pitched greeting as he kissed  her  the tail of his eye on one of his young fellow passengers who had  followed him to the platform for a breath of fresh air and stood with his  hands in his pockets staring at the pretty girl close by      i feel like a buccaneer  or a pirate  or something very bold and wild  and adventurous   she returned      you don t look it  except in your eye  i think i do see there the gleam  of a desperate resolve   he bent over her devotedly as he put her in her  chair  noting the effect on the young gentlemen who had been too slothful  to leave the car  but who now  as he had predicted to himself  were   sitting up   both physically and mentally  as they covertly eyed his new  travelling companion   i admit it takes courage for a new england girl to  start out to meet a barbarian from the wilds of south america   unchaperoned except by a perfectly good brother       if i could be sure the brother would be perfectly good    she  suggested  smiling at him as she slightly altered the position of her  chair so that the attentive fellow travellers were moved out of her line  of vision      i m sworn to rigorous virtue   he replied solemnly   he attended to that  for you      dorothy looked out of the window  she looked out of the window most of  the way to boston  so that the interested youths opposite were able to  enjoy only the averted line of her profile     julius  however  took delight in playing the lover for their benefit  and  his attention to his sister would have deceived the elect  the result was  a considerably heightened colour in dot s face  which added the last  touch of charm to the picture and completed her brother s satisfaction     arrived in the city  broughton treated his sister to a delicious  little dinner at a favourite hotel  which he himself relished to the  full  he questioned whether she knew what she was eating or its quality   but she maintained an appearance of composure which only herself knew  was attained at a cost     he then escorted her to a florist s and himself insisted upon pinning  upon the blue serge coat a gorgeous corsage knot of deep hued red  roses and mignonette  which added to her quiet costume the one  brilliant note that was needed to bring out her beauty as his artistic  young eye approved     she protested in vain   i don t want to wear flowers  to night  my  dear boy       why not  there s nothing conspicuous about that  these days  more  conspicuous not to  you might say  you often do it yourself       i know  but  to night       he won t know what you have on  he s slightly delirious at this very  minute  i have no doubt at all  when he sees you he ll go off his head   oh  nobody ll know it to look at him  you needn t be afraid of that       please stop talking about it   commanded his sister  but she did not  refuse to wear the red roses  no sane young woman could after having  caught a glimpse of herself in the florist s mirror  even an indifferent  shopgirl stared with interest after the pair as they left the place   wondering if  after all  flowers weren t more effective on the quiet  swells than on those of the dashing attire      we re to meet him on the train  not in the station   julius observed  as  he hurried his sister across the great concourse   he has to make rather  a close connection  so we ll be in our seats when he arrives  or  better  yet  we ll get back on the observation platform and see him when he comes  out the gates  that ll give you the advantage of the first look      their car  it turned out  was the end one and their seats at the rear  end  as julius had tried to arrange but had not been sure of  accomplishing  dorothy followed him through the car and out upon the  platform  here the two watched the crowds hurrying through the gates  toward their own and other trains  while the minutes passed  julius   watch in hand  began to show signs of anxiety      he d better be showing up soon   he announced as the stream of oncoming  passengers began to thin   it s getting pretty close to  there he is  though  good work  come on  old fellow  don t be so leisurely  by george   that s not kirke after all  those shoulders  i thought it certainly was   but he ll come  oh  he ll come all right or break a leg trying      but he did not come  the last belated traveller dashed through the gates   the last signal was given  the train began very slowly to move      he s missed the connection   said julius solemnly   but we ll hear from  him at the first stop  certainly we ll hear from him  we ll go inside the  car and be prepared to answer up      but neither at the first stop nor the second did the porter appear with  a message for mr  broughton or for miss broughton  or for anybody  whomsoever     dorothy sat quietly looking out of the window into the darkness  her  cheek supported by her hand and shaded from her brother  she was  perfectly cheerful and composed  but julius guessed rightly enough that  it was not a happy hour for her  she had come more than half way to meet  a man who had asked it of her  only to have him fail to appear  of course  there was an explanation  of course  but  well  it was not a happy hour   the red roses on her breast drooped a very little  their counterparts in  her cheeks paled slowly as the train flew on  an hour went by     some miles after stopping at a station the train slowed down again      where are we   queried julius  peering out of the window  his hand  shading his eyes   nowhere in particular  i should say      the train stopped  began to move again  backing  it presently became  apparent that it was taking a siding      that s funny for this train   said julius  and went out on the rear  platform to investigate     in a minute or two another train appeared in the distance behind  rushed  on toward them  slowed down not quite to a stop  and was instantly under  way again  a minute later their own train began to move once more      perhaps he s chartered a special and caught up   said julius  returning  to his sister   perhaps he s made so much money down in colombia that he  can afford to hire specials  that was a special  all right  big engine  and one pullman  we wouldn t be sidetracked for anything less important   i m quite sure      he stretched himself comfortably in his chair again with a furtive  glance at his sister  he sat with his back to the car  facing her  he now  saw her look down the car with an intent expression  then suddenly he saw  the splendid colour surge into her face  her eyes took fire  and julius  swung about in his chair to find out the cause  then he sprang up  and if  he did not shout his relief and joy it was because well trained young  men  even though they be not yet out of college  do not give vent to  their emotions in public      by george   he said under his breath   how in time has he made it      but waldron  as he came back through the car  was not looking at julius   dorothy had risen and was standing by her chair  and though the newly  arrived traveller shook hands with julius as he met him in the aisle  it  was only to look past him at the figure at the back of the car  the next  instant his hand had grasped hers  and he was gazing as straight down  into her eyes as a man may who has seen such eyes for the last nine  months only in his dreams   you came   he said  and there were wonder  and gratitude and joy in his voice  so that it was not quite steady     she nodded   there seemed to be nothing else to do   she answered  and  her smile was enchanting      did you want to do anything else      there must certainly have been something about him which inspired  honesty  quite naturally  from the feminine point of view  dorothy would  have liked not to answer this direct and meaning question just then  but   as once before  the necessity of speaking to this man only the truth was  instantly strong upon her  deep down  evade the issue as she might by  saying that she would have preferred to have him come to her  she knew  that she was glad to do this thing for him  since the other had been  impossible     so she lifted her eyes for an instant and let him see her answer before  she slowly shook her head  while the quick breath she could not wholly  control stirred the red roses on her breast      now see here  old man   said julius broughton   i know the time is  short and all that  and i m going to spend this next hour in the  smoking room and let you two have a chance to talk  but before i go my  natural curiosity must be satisfied or i shall burst  am i to  understand that that gilt edged special that passed us just now brought  you to your appointment  and are you king of colombia down there  or  anything like that      waldron turned  laughing  his browned cheek had a touch of a still warmer  colour in it  his eyes were glowing      that certainly was wonderful luck   said he   i reached the gate just as  the tail lights of this train were disappearing  as i turned away a man  at my elbow asked if i minded missing it  i said i minded so much that  if i could afford it i would hire a special to catch it  he said  very  much as if he had been offering me a seat in his motor  that a special  was to leave in a few minutes and that it would pass this train somewhere  within an hour  he turned out to be the president of the road  we had a  very interesting visit on the way down  or it would have been interesting  if it had happened at any other tune  i was so busy keeping an eye out  for sidetracked trains that i now and then lost the run of the  conversation       if the president of the road hadn t turned up   suggested julius   would  you mind saying what other little expedient would have occurred to you       i should have wired you  begging you to give me one more chance    admitted waldron   i should have wired you anyway  if i hadn t felt  that it would have spoiled my dramatic entrance at some siding  and i  wanted all the auxiliaries on my side      julius went away into the smoking compartment forward with a sense of  having had fate for the second time take a hand in a more telling  management of other people s affairs than even he  with all his love of  pulling wires  could effect  he looked back as he went  to see waldron  taking dorothy out upon the observation platform      it s lucky it s a mild april night   he said to himself   i suppose it  wouldn t make any difference if a northeast blizzard were on       will it chill the roses   waldron asked with a smile as he closed the  door behind them  shutting himself and dorothy out into the cool  wet  freshness of the night  where the two gleaming rails were slipping fast  away into the blackness behind and only distant lights here and there  betokened the existence of other human beings in a world that seemed  all theirs      it wouldn t matter if it did   she answered      wouldn t it  can you possibly feel  as i do  that nothing in the world  matters  now that we are together again      again the direct question  but somehow she did not in the least mind  answering  she wanted to answer  the time was so short     with other men dorothy broughton had used every feminine art of  evasion and withdrawal at moments of crisis  but she could not use  them with this man     she shook her head  laying one hand against her rose red cheek  like a  shy and lovely child  yet like a woman  too     he gently took the hand away from the glowing cheek  and kept it  fast in his      i fell desperately in love with you when i was fifteen   said kirke  waldron   i carried the image of you all through my boyhood and into  manhood  i saw you at different times while you were growing up  although  you didn t see me  i kept track of you  i thought you never could be for  me  but when we met last summer i knew that if i couldn t have you i  should never want anybody  and when  something happened that made you  glad for just a minute to be with me  i knew i should never let you go   then you gave me that last look and i dared to believe that you could be  made to care  dorothy  they were pretty poor letters from a literary  point of view that i ve been sending you all these months  but i tried to  put myself into them so that you could know just what sort of fellow i  was  and i tried to make you see  without actually telling you  what you  were to me  did i succeed       they were fine letters   said dorothy broughton   splendid  manly  letters  i liked them very much  i  loved them       oh   said kirke waldron  and became suddenly silent with joy     after a minute he looked up at the too brilliant electric lights which  flooded the platform  he glanced in at the occupants of the car  nearly  all facing forward  except for one or two who were palpably  asleep  negligible certainly  then he put his head inside the door   scanning the woodwork beside it  he reached upward with one hand and in  the twinkling of an eye the observation platform was in darkness      oh   breathed dorothy in her turn  but the next thing that happened was  the thing which might have been expected of a resourceful young mining  engineer  trained  as he himself had said   to action  all the time        the end            startles mrs  grundy      oscar  the fad boy    i want to make your flesh creep       the baron has read oscar wilde s wildest and oscarest work  called   dorian gray   a weird sensational romance  complete in one number of   lippincott s magazine   the baron  recommends anybody who revels in   diablerie   to begin it about half past ten  and to finish it at one  sitting up  but those who do not so revel he advises either not to  read it at all  or to choose the daytime  and take it in homoeopathic  doses  the portrait represents the soul of the beautiful ganymede like   dorian gray   whose youth and beauty last to the end  while his soul   like john brown s   goes marching on  into the wilderness of sin  it  becomes at last a devilled soul  and then  dorian  sticks a knife into  it  as any ordinary mortal might do  and a fork also  and next morning       lifeless but  hideous  he lay      while the portrait has recovered the perfect beauty which it possessed  when it first left the artist s easel  if oscar intended an allegory   the finish is dreadfully wrong  does he mean that  by sacrificing  his earthly life   dorian gray  atones for his infernal sins  and so  purifies his soul by suicide   heavens  i am no preacher   says the  baron   and perhaps oscar didn t mean anything at all  except to give  us a sensation  to show how like bulwer lytton s old world style he  could make his descriptions and his dialogue  and what an easy thing  it is to frighten the respectable  mrs  grundy  with a bogie   the  style is decidedly lyttonerary  his aphorisms are wilde  yet forced   mr  oscar wilde says of his story   it is poisonous if you like  but  you cannot deny that it is also perfect  and perfection is what we  artists aim at   perhaps  but  we artists  do not always hit what  we aim at  and  despite his confident claim to unerring artistic  marksmanship  one must hazard the opinion  that in this case mr  wilde  has  shot wide   there is indeed more of  poison  than of  perfection   in  dorian gray   the central idea is an excellent  if not exactly  novel  one  and a finer art  say that of nathaniel hawthorne  would  have made a striking and satisfying story of it   dorian gray  is  striking enough  in a sense  but it is not  satisfying  artistically   any more than it is so ethically  mr  wilde has preferred the sensuous  and hyperdecorative manner of  mademoiselle de maupin   and without  gautier s power  has spoilt a promising conception by clumsy unideal  treatment  his  decoration   upon which he plumes himself  is indeed   laid on with a trowel   the luxuriously elaborate details of his   artistic hedonism  are too suggestive of south kensington museum  and aesthetic encyclopaedias  a truer art would have avoided both the  glittering conceits  which bedeck the body of the story  and the  unsavoury suggestiveness which lurks in its spirit  poisonous  yes   but the loathly  leperous distilment  taints and spoils  without  in any way subserving  perfection   artistic or otherwise  if  mrs   grundy  doesn t read it  the younger  grundies  do  that is  the   grundies  who belong to clubs  and who care to shine in certain  sets wherein this story will be much discussed   i have read it  and   except for the ingenious idea  i wish to forget it   says the baron                                                 the baron has seen the new  lively  and eccentric newspaper  entitled   the whirlwind   it has reached the third number   i am informed    says the baron   that  on payment of five guineas down  i can become  a life subscriber to the  whirlwind   but what does life subscriber  mean  do i subscribe for the term of my life  or for the term of the   whirlwind s  life  suppose the  whirlwind  has to be wound up  or  whirl winded up  and suppose i am still going on  can i intervene to  stop the proceedings  and insist on my contract to be supplied with  a  whirlwind  per week for the remainder of my natural or unnatural  life being carried out  if the contract is for our lives  then  as  a life subscriber  i should insist on the  whirlwind  remaining  co existent with me  so that  up to my latest breath  i might have a   whirlwind   but if the life subscription of five guineas is only for  the term of the  whirlwind s  life  then  i fancy the proprietors   editor  and staff  that the hon  stuart erskine and mr  herbert  vivian  who are  i believe  the proprietors  editor  and staff of the   whirlwind   will have by far the better of the bargain  i resist the  temptation  and keep my five pounds five shillings in my pocket  and  am     yours truly  the baron de book worms                                                  our new

forgive you  i ve  been wanting to have another talk with you for ever so long  i ve  been thinking so  much  of what you said that evening about browning s  relation to science and the supernatural  suppose you take me  downstairs for an ice or something  and we can have it out comfortably  together          dismay of mr  b   who has entirely forgotten any theories      he may have advanced on

clever persons have found  that simple little problem of nought divided by one too much for them   would you have supposed  by the way  that there is a reservoir in  pennsylvania containing a sufficient number of gallons to supply all  london for eighteen months  you don t quite realise it  i see   how  many gallons is that   well  let me calculate roughly  taking  the population of london at four millions  and the average daily  consumption for each individual at  no  i can t work it out with  sufficient accuracy while i am dancing  suppose we sit down  and i ll  do it for you on my

your eldest girl  to dance with that absurd mr  clumpsole  it s really too  bad  of him  to make such an exhibition of her  one can t help smiling at them      second ch   oh  ethel never can bear to hurt anyone s feelings  so  different from some girls  by the way  i ve not seen  your  daughter  dancing to night  men who dance are so scarce nowadays  i suppose they  think they have the right to be a little fastidious      first ch   bella has been out so much this week  that she doesn t  care to dance except with a really first rate partner  she is not so  easily pleased as your ethel  i m afraid      second ch   ethel is  young   you see  and  when one is pressed so  much to dance  one can hardly refuse   can  one  when she has had as  many seasons as bella  she will be less energetic  i daresay          mr  boldover has at last succeeded in approaching miss      roundarm  and even in inducing her to sit out a dance with      him  but  having led her to a convenient alcove  he finds      himself totally unable to give any adequate expression to the      rapture he feels at being by her side      mr  b     determined to lead up to it somehow    i  i was rather  thinking    he  meant  to say   devoutly hoping   but  to his own  bitter disgust  it comes out like this    i should meet you here  to night      miss r   were you  why      mr  b     with a sudden dread of going too far just yet    oh     carelessly    you know how one  does  wonder who will be at a place   and who won t      miss r   no  indeed  i don t    how  does one wonder      mr  b     with a vague notion of implying a complimentary exception  in her case    oh  well  generally    with the fatal tendency of a shy  man to a sweeping statement    one may be pretty sure of meeting just  the people one least wants to see  you know      miss r   and so you thought you would probably meet me  i  see       mr  b     overwhelmed with confusion  and not in the least knowing  what he says    no  no  i didn t think that  i hoped you mightn t  i  mean  i was afraid you might           stops short  oppressed by the impossibility of explaining      miss r   you are not very complimentary to night  are you      mr  b   i can t pay compliments  to  you   i don t know how it is   but i never can talk to you as i can to other people      miss r   are you amusing when you are with other people      mr

touching proposed new standing  order  and allocation of money originally intended for publicans  all  a blank   we are still considering   says he      a most considerate government   says wilfrid

go up to table  drop a penny in the  slot  and out would come the answer   i have seen nothing  i have  heard nothing       seems that hanbury has exceptional means of obtaining information   old morality has privately shown him military report with respect to  heligoland  a confidential communication  something of the kind the  markiss carried on with the population of heligoland  but hanbury  straightway goes and tells all about it in a letter to one of his  constituents  letter gets into papers  summers reads it out to house   eagerly thirsting after knowledge on military matters  summers wants  also to see the text of report  why should hanbury have it all to  himself  quartermaster general summers would like opportunity of  studying it  and forming opinion as to accuracy of the naval and  military men who have drawn up plan  will old morality favour him  by placing him on an equality of confidence with hanbury  no  old  morality will not  howl of indignant despair from radicals  never  heard of this report before  but that hanbury should see it  and  thereby be enabled to assure his constituents  even by nods and winks   that it was all right about heligoland  was more than they could put  up with  o picton sat morose at the corner seat below the gangway   who was hanbury  that he should have the advantage of studying these  military documents when the grand nephew of picton of waterloo was  left out in the cold  his martial instincts unsatisfied  his knowledge  of strategical points of the british empire unsatiated     another instance this of the misfortune that pursues the government   little did old morality think  when in moment of weakness he showed  this important document to hanbury  what a hornet s nest it would  bring about his unoffending head      business done    irish constabulary vote passed        thursday    at last old morality has heard something and seen  something  heard how things went on to day in committee on procedure   worse and worse  prince arthur made curious blunder for one so alert   introduced into draft report admission of principle that lords might   an they pleased  refuse to consider in current session  any bill  coming up to them from commons  harcourt saw his opportunity  used  it with irresistible skill and force  committee adjourned in almost  comatose state     this is what old morality has heard from jokim  who begins to think  that  after all  life is a serious thing  what he sees is  that it  is impossible to further delay decision about business  accordingly  announces complete surrender  all  all are gone  the old familiar  faces  land purchase bill  tithe bill  and even this later project  of the new standing order   what  all our pretty chicks   cry the  agonised ministerialists      yes   said old morality  mingling his tears with theirs   our duty to  our queen and country demands this sacrifice  but   he added  bracing  up  significantly eyeing mr  g   and speaking in dear solemn tones    we reserve to ourselves absolute freedom of action on a future  occasion   opposition shouted with laughter  whilst old morality stood  and stared  and wondered what was amusing them now  new session is   according to present intentions  to open in november  will the land  purchase bill be taken first  mr  g  wants to know      sir   said old morality   i have indicated the views of the  government as to the land purchase bill  according as those views  are held at the present time    cheers from the ministerialists    encouraged by this applause  and  happy thought striking him  went on    but it is impossible for the government to say what circumstances may  occur to qualify those views      once more opposition break into storm of laughter  old morality again  regards them with dubious questioning gaze      curious thing  toby   he said to me afterwards   those fellows  opposite always laugh when i drop in my most diplomatic sentences   it s very well for machiavelli that he didn t live in these times   and lead house of commons instead of the government of the florentine  republic  he would never have opened his mouth without those

     your very faithful          and obedient servant             richard rush       sydenham  near philadelphia  february                to messrs     j b  lippincott and co      publishers     philadelphia           to    charles j  ingersoll                                                 this literary trifle is hardly worth a dedication  yet it has dared to  touch  though with incompetent hands  a high subject  and  trifle as it  is  i dedicate it to you  at an agreeable little dinner at your table  lately  where we had the new vice president  mr  breckenridge  whose  maternal stock  the stanhope smiths and witherspoons  so rich in  intellect  we knew at princeton  you said we had been friends for  upwards of sixty years  you were right  for we were merry boys together  in philadelphia before our college days at princeton  and i may here  add  that our friendship never has been interrupted     richard rush           introductory explanation     the manuscript or paper here published was prepared from a collection of  original letters from general washington on matters  for the most part   purely domestic and personal  addressed to colonel tobias lear  his  private secretary for a part of the time he was president  and then  and  during periods much longer  his confidential friend  they came into my  hands through the voluntary kindness of mrs  lear  of the city of  washington  the estimable relict of colonel lear  and niece of mrs   washington  whose friendship it was my good lot and that of my family to  enjoy  as we did that of colonel lear while he lived  the latter died in  washington in       mrs  lear first informed me of these letters ten or  twelve years ago when in washington  and offered them to my perusal and  examination  telling me to take them home and retain them as long as i  chose  and use them as i thought best  for she knew i would not abuse  this privilege  i brought them home as requested  being then too much  engaged in the business of the smithsonian institution as one of the  regents on its first organization  to examine them while in washington   she afterwards read  approved  and for some time had in her hands the  paper i drew up from them     it consisted of notices of  and extracts from these original letters   the matter being abridged  connecting links used  and omissions made  where the great author himself marked them private or from parts  otherwise not necessary to go before the world  so guarded and prepared   and with a commentary interwoven  mrs  lear left its publication to my  discretion  i returned the original letters  in number more than thirty   in the state i received them from her  i never allowed any one of them  to be copied  but gave one away  or two  for i am not at this day  certain which  to mr  polk while he was president of the united states   having first asked and obtained mrs  lear s consent for that purpose   she also gave me two of them not very long before her decease  which i  prize the more as her gift  i have other original letters from the same  immortal source  the valued donation in       of the son of colonel  lear  lincoln lear  esquire     this excellent lady  who long honored me with her friendship and  confidence in the above and other ways  after surviving colonel lear  forty years  died last december in washington  there she had continued  to live as his widow  being all this time in possession of  and as i  supposed owning  these original letters  there she lived  beloved as a  pattern of the christian virtues  and enjoying the esteem of the circle  around her as an interesting relict of days becoming historical  but  ever elevating in the associations they recall  now that she is gone  i  am induced to give to the public the paper in question  in doing so i  have the best grounds for believing that i perform an act that would  have been grateful to her were she living  she was fully informed of my  intention to publish it and could not but be sensible that the long  respect and affectionate attachment of general washington which her  husband enjoyed  as so indelibly stamped upon these letters  is a record  of his probity  capacity  and sterling worth  than which none could ever  be more precious  or be likely to endure longer  this consideration it  might be thought affects only the descendants of colonel lear or others  devoted to his memory  but i have ventured to think that the publication  may not be wholly unacceptable on broader grounds  nothing  indeed  in  authentic connection with washington s great name can ever be unwelcome  to the american people  and although it may have happened that some few  of these letters have heretofore found their way into print in whole or  in part  the number  as far as was known to mrs  lear  is believed to be  very small  hence the publication need not be forborne on that account   more especially if it should be found to carry with it the slightest  general interest in the form now presented     in regard to the narrative of arnold s treason as given by the great  chief at his table at mount vernon and afterwards written down by  colonel lear  which i have appended to the synopsis of the letters  it  was not within mrs  lear s knowledge  nor is it within mine at present   that it has ever been in print before     richard rush     sydenham  near philadelphia  february                 washington in domestic life       when first i opened and cursorily read the original letters from general  washington  mentioned in the foregoing introductory explanation  and  noticed the domestic topics which ran so largely through them  they  struck me as possessing peculiar interest  they were of value as coming  from that venerated source  and doubly so  considering how little is  known  through his own correspondence  of his domestic life  scarcely   in fact  any of its details  reading the letters again  i found the  matter to be somewhat more varied than my first eager inspection of  them  as hastily unfolded  had led me to suppose  but they were  desultory  and much broken as to dates  the occasional mixture of other  matter  especially public matter  with the domestic topics  did not  diminish the interest of the letters  but the contrary  in this  publication i follow the order of the dates  where wide chasms occur  i  have merely supplied a link in the chain by an explanatory remark here  and there  in aid of the reader  not hazarding other remarks until all  the letters are mentioned  thus much as to the plan  i proceed to speak  of the letters themselves     the first in date is of the fifth of september        it is written in  philadelphia  where washington had just then arrived from new york  mr   lear  as may be inferred from it  being in new york  he states that he  would proceed onward to mount vernon on the day following if mrs   washington s health would permit  as she had been indisposed since their  arrival in philadelphia  that before he arrived  the city corporation  had taken the house of mr  robert morris for his residence  but that it  would not be sufficiently commodious without additions           this house was in market street on the south side near       sixth street  the market house buildings then stopped at       fourth street  the town in this street extended westward       scarcely as far as ninth street  good private dwellings were       seen above fifth street  mr  morris s was perhaps the best        the garden was well inclosed by a wall      he describes the house  remarking that even with the proposed additions  the gentlemen of his family would have to go into the third story  where  also mr  lear and mrs  lear would have to go  and that there would be no  place for his own study and dressing room but in the back building   there are good stables  and the coach house would hold his carriages   but his coachmen and postilions would have to sleep over the stable  where there was no fireplace  though the room might be warmed by a  stove  the other servants could sleep in the house  he adds  if  in  addition to the present accommodations  a servants  hall were built with  one or two lodging rooms over it  these are samples of the particularity  with which he writes  he tells mr  lear that he had left his coach and  harness with the coachmaker  mr  clarke  in philadelphia  for repairs   and requests him to see that they are well done and at the time  appointed  the residue of the letter relates to the bringing on of his  servants from new york  it begins  dear sir   and after saying that mrs   washington joins with him in best wishes to mrs  lear  concludes   i am  sincerely and affectionately yours  geo  washington   the letter fills  the four pages of a sheet of letter paper in his compact but bold and  legible hand  with a few interlineations made very distinctly     the next letter is dated mount vernon  september           after saying  a few words about mr  morris s house  he reverts to the subject of  bringing his servants from new york to philadelphia  naming several of  them  but doubting the expediency of bringing all by sea  especially the  upper servants  the steward and his wife are mentioned as perhaps best  not to be brought at all  he has no wish to part with them  first   because he does not like to be changing  and secondly  because he did  not know how to supply their places  but was much mistaken if the  expenses of the second table  where the steward presided  had not  greatly exceeded the proper mark  he suspected there was nothing brought  to his own table of liquors  fruit  or other things  that had not been  used as profusely at the steward s  that if his suspicions were  unfounded he should be sorry for having entertained them  and if not  it  was at least questionable whether any successor of        might not do  the same thing  in which case there might be a change without a benefit   he leaves it with mr  lear whether to retain him or not  provided he  thought him honest  of which he would be better able to judge on  comparing his accounts with those of his former steward  which he  the  general  had not done  he concludes   with sincere regard and affection   i am yours  geo  washington            at this epoch  the seat of government had just been removed       from new york to philadelphia  making it necessary for       general washington to establish himself in the latter city        which leads him into the details given and to follow      the third letter is from mount vernon  september           it begins by  saying that since his last  the date of which is not recollected  as he  kept no copies of these letters  two had been received from mr  lear  of  which he gives the dates  he approves of his mode of removing the  furniture  and asks   how have you disposed of the pagoda  it is a  delicate piece of stuff  and will require to be handled tenderly      alluding to the house in which he had lived in new york  the lease of  which was unexpired  he says that he expected       would endeavor to  impose his own terms when he found he could not get it off his hands  we  are in his power and he must do what he pleases with us  as the  lustre   is paid for and securely packed up  and may suit the largest  drawing room at mr  morris s house in philadelphia  he does not incline  to part with it  there is a mangle in the kitchen  which mrs  morris  proposes to leave  taking his mangle instead   a mangle was a machine  for washing or pressing  then in use  and a fixture  i think   he would  not object provided his was as good  but not if he would be the gainer  by exchanging  he concludes  mrs  washington and all the family joining  in best wishes to mrs  lear and himself   i am your sincere friend and  affectionate servant   signing his name as before     the next is dated mount vernon  october          in this letter he  refers to the declaration of the ministers of britain and spain as  published in the newspapers  a  and requests mr  lear to give him the  earliest information of these or any other interesting matters  beyond  what the newspapers say  remarking that mr  jefferson s absence from new  york  mr  jefferson was then secretary of state  might be the means of  delaying the receipt of official advices to him longer than usual  he  requests mr  lear to use his endeavors for ascertaining the best schools  in philadelphia with a view to placing washington custis  mrs   washington s grandson  at the best  if the college is under good  regulations  and they have proper tutors to prepare boys of his standing  for the higher branches of education  he makes a quaere if it would not  be better to put him there at once  the presumption being that a system  may prevail there by which the gradations are better connected than in  schools which have no correspondence with each other  adverting again to  his servants  he reminds mr  lear that no mention had been made of  john s wife  and asks what he understands to be her plans  he incloses a  letter from john to her  and another from james to his  del toboso     these were four of his black servants   he requests him when able to  get at count d estaing s letters to send him a transcript of what he  says of a bust he had sent him of neckar  together with a number of  prints of neckar  and of the marquis la fayette  and concludes in the  same cordial and affectionate style as before     mount vernon  october           this is next in date  the early parts of  this letter have reference to the steps for removing his furniture and  servants from new york  to the getting rid of the house still upon his  hands there  and to the proper care and instruction of his niece  miss  harriet washington  when he should be established in philadelphia   referring again to washington custis s education  whom he had adopted as  a son and in whom he appears to have taken great interest  b  he wishes  inquiry to be made as to the higher branches taught at the college with  a view to placing his nephews  george and lawrence washington  at that  institution in philadelphia  he speaks very kindly of these nephews  and  of their desire for improvement  having left the languages  they are  engaged  he adds  under mr  harrow  in alexandria  in the study of the  mathematics and learning french  concludes as usual     next comes one from mount vernon of october           he tells mr  lear  that on his return from a twelve days  excursion up the potomac  he  finds three letters from him  which he acknowledges under their dates   and is very glad to learn that he had arrived in philadelphia  and that  the servants and furniture had got safely there  it is equally agreeable  to him that the steward and his wife had come  he leaves to mr  l  the  arrangement of the furniture  with remarks of his own as to its  disposition in some of the rooms  and wishes the rent of mr  morris s  house to be fixed before the day of his going into it  he desired to pay  a just value  more he had no idea would be asked  but intimates his  fears that the committee  of the city councils of philadelphia is  probably meant  were holding back under an intention that the rent  should be paid by the public  to which he would not consent  it would be  best  he thinks  if all the servants could be accommodated without using  the loft over the stable  as no orders he could give them would prevent  their carrying lights there  if they were to use it as lodgers  by  return of the hand that takes this and other letters from him to the  alexandria post office  he hopes to receive later dates from mr  lear   and  possibly  something more indicative of peace or war between spain  and england  and concludes   i am your affectionate friend  geo   washington      mount vernon  october           is the next date  after expressing  concern lest his house in philadelphia should not be ready in time  and  pointing out arrangements for his journey to philadelphia  he speaks  again of his carriage at the coachmaker s in philadelphia  he thinks  that a wreath round the crests on the panels would be more correspondent  with the seasons  allegorical paintings probably in medallion   which  were to remain there  than the motto  and that the motto might be put on  the plates of the harness  but leaves it to mr  lear and the coachmaker  to adopt which they thought best when the whole was looked at  as he  could not himself see it as a whole  he speaks of the boarding schools  in philadelphia  and is anxious that full and careful inquiry be made  with a view to securing proper advantages in the education of his  niece  but to be made in a way not to give any expectation of a  preference between rival seminaries  as he had come to no decision in  regard to his niece  as his family on removing to philadelphia will have  new connections to form with tradespeople  he requests mr  lear to find  out those in each branch who stand highest for skill and fair dealing   saying it is better to be slow in choosing than be under any necessity  of changing  concludes  with affectionate regards i am your sincere  friend  g w      mount vernon  november          a letter full of minute details  it sets  out with expressing his renewed anxiety respecting the education of his  adopted son washington custis  remarking that if the  schools  in the  college are under good masters  and are as fit for boys of his age  he  was probably about eight at this time  for we were schoolmates in  philadelphia at the dates of the earliest of these letters  as a private  school would be  he is still of opinion he had better be placed there  in the first instance  but the propriety of the step will depend      upon the character and ability of the masters     upon the police and  discipline of the school  and thirdly  upon the number of the pupils  if  there be too many pupils  justice cannot be done to them whatever the  ability of the masters  adding that what ought to be the due proportion  is in some measure matter of opinion  but that an extreme must be  obvious to all  he leaves it with mr  lear to decide that point if  nothing else should be finally resolved upon by himself before he  reaches philadelphia  he next incloses a letter from mr  gouverneur  morris  then in paris  but not our minister at the french court at that  time  with the bill of charges for certain articles which he had  requested him to send from paris  the plated ware far exceeds in price  the utmost bounds of his calculation  but as he is persuaded mr  morris  had only done what he thought right  he requests mr  lear to make  immediate payment in manner as he points out  among the articles of  this plated ware  were wine coolers  for holding four decanters of cut  glass  also sent by mr  morris  and he seems as little satisfied with  the size and fashion of these coolers  from the description he has  received of them  as with their unexpected cost  he thinks more  appropriate ones of real silver might be made  the pattern being  different and work lighter  giving his own ideas of a pattern  and a  little draft of it  and requesting mr  lear to talk to a silversmith on  the matter  remarking that perhaps those sent by mr  morris might give  hints for the pattern  which  if not found too heavy  as he had not yet  seen them  might after all answer  he approves of the pagoda s standing  in the smallest drawing room where mr  lear had placed it  whether the   green  curtain or a new  yellow  one is to be used for the staircase  window in the hall  may depend on his getting an exact match in color  for the former  in things of this sort one would not regard a small  additional expense  to save the eye from bad contrasts  he expresses  the hope that his study will be in readiness by the time he arrives  and  that the rubbish and other litter made by those  men of mortar and the  carpenters   will be removed so that the yard may be made and kept as  clean as the parlor  this  he says  is essential  as  by the alterations  made in the house  the back rooms had become the best and there was an  uninterrupted view from them into the yard  especially from the  dining room  he concludes by saying that as mrs  washington writes to  mrs  lear  he would only add his best wishes for her and affectionate  regards for himself   being your sincere friend  g w      mount vernon  november           this letter is a duplicate written to  inform mr  lear that he depended upon p     s coach  horses  and driver   for taking on the children to philadelphia  his reasons for writing the  duplicate was  that giles  one of his servants   who was sent on  wednesday to alexandria with his first letter with directions that if  the stage had gone to pursue it to georgetown so as to overtake the  mail  had put the letter into the hands of a passenger  who  all but  forced it from him   so anxious was this passenger to do an obliging  thing  as he  knew general washington   this passenger told his name   but it was  so comical   he could not recollect it  this was giles s  story  and the general adds that as he knew what little dependence was  to be placed on the punctual conveyance of letters by a private hand  he  writes this duplicate by post to repeat his request that mr  lear will  inform him  by return of post  what he has to expect with  certainty  as  to the coach hired for taking on a part of his family to philadelphia   his house is full of company  he adds  and concludes as usual     mount vernon  november           this letter manifests his concern about  the house in philadelphia  for  besides that it is still unfinished  the  rent  he says  has not yet been fixed  though he has long since wished  it  he is at a loss to understand it all  he hopes that the additions  and alterations made on his account whilst neat  have not been in an  extravagant style  the latter would not only be contrary to his wishes  but repugnant to his interest and convenience  as it would be the means  of keeping him from the use and comforts of the house until a later day   and because the furniture and everything else must then be in accordance  with its expensive finish  which would not agree with his present  furniture  and he had no wish to be taxed to suit the taste of others   the letter is of more length than usual and marked  private   being   with one other  the only ones in the collection so marked  i will   therefore  notice its contents no further than barely to add  that in a  part where he alludes to the still possible intention of making the  public in philadelphia pay his rent  his terms of dissent become very  emphatic  in reference to his coach  he would rather have heard that  as  repaired  it was   plain  and elegant  than   rich  and elegant    conclusion as usual     mount vernon  nov            this  he says  is a very bad day  he is  just setting off for alexandria to a dinner given to him by the citizens  of that place  the caps  jockey caps  of giles and paris  two of his  postilions  being so much worn that they will be unfit for use by the  time he has completed his journey to philadelphia  he requests that new  ones may be made  the tassels to be of better quality than the old ones   and that a new set of harness may be made for the leaders  with a  postilion saddle  the saddle cloth of which to be like the hammer cloth   that all may be of a piece when necessary to use six horses   this he  sometimes did in travelling   the letter concludes as usual      spurriers   november                    he is now on his journey to philadelphia in his own       travelling carriage with mrs  washington  the children  and       the servants in attendance on the children  being in the       stage coach hired for the occasion      he dates from this tavern twelve or fourteen miles south of baltimore   the roads  he says  are in famous  no hope of reaching baltimore that  night  as they had not yet gone to dinner but were waiting for it  the  letter is only of a few lines  and evidently written in haste  though he  never makes apologies on that account     georgetown  march                    the general and family arrived in philadelphia and took       possession of mr  morris s house  the session of congress       passed over  it was the short session  he was now on his       return to mount vernon  having reached the above town on the       maryland side of the potomac  from which he dates      this letter is on his private affairs  he expresses dissatisfaction at  the conduct of        one of his agents in the state of      in letting  out his property and receiving his rents  he is too well acquainted  he  says  with facts that bear upon the case to be imposed upon by the tale  he tells  and even his own letter proves him to be what he would not  call him     mount vernon  april          this letter is also in part on his private  affairs  it contains further complaints of this agent  in the closing  parts of it  there being at this time growing apprehensions of trouble  with the indians  he makes the remark  that until we could restrain the  turbulence and disorderly conduct of our own borderers  it would be in  vain he feared to expect peace with the indians  or that they would  govern their own people better than we did ours           it was in the following autumn that general st  clair s       army was defeated by them in the neighborhood of the miami       villages      mount vernon  april          a short letter  it mentions his intention  of continuing his journey southward the next day  his horses being well  recruited  he hopes they will go on better than they have come from  philadelphia  he incloses mr  lear  who remains in philadelphia  some  letters to be put on file  and requests him to pay a man who had been  working in the garden           the journey southward next day was the commencement of his       tour to the southern states  having made one into the       northern states before he became president  having completed       his tour  he passed several days in georgetown to execute       the powers vested in him for fixing on a place for the       permanent seat of government for the united states under the       new constitution      richmond  april           this is a letter of four closely written  pages  mainly  though not exclusively  about his servants and the  difficulties with them under the non slavery laws of philadelphia  but  as he requests that the knowledge of its contents and the sentiments he  expresses may be confined to mrs  lear and mrs  washington  i notice no  more of it     savannah  may           he here says that the continual hurry into which  he was thrown by entertainments  visits  and ceremonies in the course of  his southern tour  left him scarcely a moment he could call his own  he  gives directions as to where his letters are to be sent that they may  strike him at the proper points whilst travelling  his horses are much  worn down  he says  by the bad roads  especially the two he bought just  before leaving philadelphia   and my old white horse      fredericksburg  virginia  june           he informs mr  lear that he had  reached this place the day preceding  and expected to get back to mount  vernon the day following  he would remain there until the   th  which  was the day appointed for him to meet the commissioners at georgetown to  fix on the spot for the public buildings to be erected in the new  federal city  and writes to give mr  lear this foreknowledge of his  movements     mount vernon  june           the early part of this letter relates to  certain blank commissions signed and left with mr  lear to be filled up  under the direction and advice of the secretary of the treasury  he next  adverts to a vacancy in one of the united states judgeships  that of the  district of pennsylvania  by the death of the late incumbent  some have  applied  he says  for the appointment  and others will  in reference to  this and other offices that will be vacant  naming them   he wishes mr   lear to get the best information he can as to those who it is thought  would fill them  with the greatest ability and integrity   several  meritorious persons  he adds  have already been brought to his view     he is glad to hear that the affairs of his household in philadelphia go  on so well  and tells mr  lear it might not be improper for him to hint  how foolish it would be in the servants left there to enter into any  combinations for supplanting those in authority  meaning the upper  servants   the attempt would be futile  and must recoil upon themselves   and next  admitting that they were to make the lives of the present  steward and housekeeper so uneasy as to induce them to quit  others  would be got  and such  too  as would be equally if not more rigid in  exacting the duty required of the servants below them  the steward and  housekeeper were indispensably necessary in taking trouble off of mrs   washington s hands and his own  and would be supported in the line of  their duty  whilst any attempt to counteract them would be considered as  the strongest evidence the other servants could give of their  unworthiness  a good and faithful servant  he adds  was never afraid of  having his conduct looked into  but the reverse     mount vernon  june           he acknowledges the receipt of several  letters from mr  lear  and approves what he has done  he tells him that  in the fall he shall want blankets for his servants and people c  at  mount vernon  and the summer being the best time for buying them  he  wishes inquiry to be made on this subject  saying he should want about  two hundred  he wants to see paine s answer to burke s pamphlet on the  french revolution  and requests it may be sent to him  he says that   paris  has grown to be so lazy and self willed that john  the coachman   says he has no sort of government of him  as he did nothing that he was  told to do  and everything he was not  the general adds that his  incapacity as a postilion was such that he had determined to leave him  behind when returning to philadelphia  which would make one or two boys  necessary in his stable at that place  as assistants  and asks whether  it might not be possible to find emigrant germans to answer the purpose   he concludes   be assured of the esteem and regard of yours  affectionately  g w      mount vernon  september           he refers to the house in  philadelphia  says that he never expressed any dissatisfaction at want  of accommodation in it since he got rid of the workmen  and that that  supposition must  not  be adduced as a motive for causing a  public  edifice  to be built for his use or occupancy  that he has no intention  of interfering with the politics of pennsylvania  or the household  accommodations of his successors in the presidency  but that  for  himself  personally  he had wholly declined living in any public  building  this subject appears to have engaged some of his sensibility   and he tells mr  lear he is glad to learn he has put in writing his  views in regard to it  as that will protect him against misconception on  any point     mount vernon  october          he writes again about the blankets  some  have been offered to him in alexandria  but he likes neither the size  nor price  and speaks of those to be had in philadelphia as intolerably  narrow  he cannot think of being disappointed in his supply  as his  people would suffer in the ensuing winter  he wants one hundred of the  largest size and best quality  and one hundred of the middle size but   good  in quality  i recollect asking you if among my pamphlets you had  seen the journal of my tour to the french  the word  position  was  probably omitted here  on  la beauf  in the year       i understood you  no  but mrs  washington thinks you said yes  pray decide the point for  us  i have searched in vain for it here     mount vernon  october           in this letter he begins by saying he is  glad of the intimation given of the intentions of the minister of france   not stated what they are   and pleased though distressed at the  information that the   th instant is the day for the meeting of  congress  he had supposed it to be the   st  and intended to spend  monday and possibly tuesday in georgetown  but now he would endeavor to  reach bladensburg on monday night and lose no time afterwards in  pursuing his journey onward to philadelphia  as scarce any time would be  left to him for preparing his communications when the session opened  if  the members were punctual in attending  this makes it the more  necessary  he says  that mr  lear should look with accuracy  and without  delay  into his speeches and the laws of the past sessions  that all  might be at hand for his own review and consideration  and he requests  mr  lear  should anything else have occurred to him as fit for  recommendation or communication in his speech to congress  to note it   that it might be ready for his consideration in case it should not be  among his own memorandums  the conclusion is in his usually cordial way     this session of congress passed over  it was the long one  and ran into  may       i find in the collection only three letters to mr  lear dated  in that year  the first is from mount vernon  july          soon after  he had left philadelphia  and is familiarly descriptive of his journey  homewards  his horses plagued him a good deal  he says  and the sick  mare  owing to a dose of physic administered the night he reached  chester  was so much weakened as to be unable to carry austin  one of  the postilions  further than the susquehannah  had to be led thence to  hartford  where she was left  and two days afterwards   gave up the  ghost   as he travelled on  he heard great complaints of the hessian  fly  and of rust or mildew in the wheat  and believed that the damage  would be great in some places  but that more was said than the case  warranted  and on the whole the crops would be abundant  on arriving in  georgetown  he found many well conceived plans for the public buildings  in the new city  and remarks that it was a pleasure to him to find in  our new country so much architectural ability displayed  concludes   i  am your affectionate friend  g w      the second is dated mount vernon  september          he tells mr  lear  that he had written him but one letter since arriving at mount vernon   but was on the eve of writing a second when his of the  th of august got  to hand  with such information of his movements  mr  lear having been  away from philadelphia  as might now enable him to direct a letter to  him without danger of its  reverberating back   he thanks him for the  information afforded in his letter of the  th of august and in another  of the   st of july  says he has nothing agreeable of a domestic nature  to relate  poor george  the general is here supposed to allude to mr   george lewis  one of his nephews  then staying at mount vernon   he  fears  is not far from that place whence no traveller returns  he is but  the shadow of what he was  has not been out of his room  scarcely out of  his bed  for six weeks  has intervals of ease which flatter us a little   but he  the general  has little hope of his surviving the winter  it is  so he writes of this nephew  adding that the subject gives him much  distress  concludes   with sincere and affectionate regard i am always  your friend  g w      the third is dated mount vernon  october         in the expectation  that this letter will find mr  lear again in philadelphia  he wishes him  to begin in time to compare all his former speeches to congress with the  subsequent acts of that body that he might see what parts of them passed  altogether unnoticed or had been only partially noticed  that thus he  might be enabled to judge whether any and what parts should be brought  forward again  he requests him also  as before  to note everything that  may occur to him as fit to be noticed in his communication to congress  this year  as he desires to have all the materials collected for his  consideration in preparing his speech  he speaks again of the illness of   poor george   and says that others of his family are unwell  concludes  in his usually kind and affection manner      this session of congress  the short session  came to its regular close  on the  d of march         the general is again at mount vernon in  april  and writes to mr  lear on the  th of that month on some of his  private affairs  he tells him that his letter of the  d had been  received transmitting mr         s rental  and mr        s profession of  his inability to discharge his bond  the latter he thinks more candid  than the former  but supposes that he must be satisfied with both   knowing he will never get better terms from either  he intimates that  before doing anything with respect to the lands the latter had from him   he wishes mr  lear to have some conversation with         on a point he   the general  did not clearly understand  as he would not  put it in the  power of malice itself to charge him with any agency in measures that  could be tortured into impropriety in this matter   in regard to the  former person  the same mentioned in his letters of march    and april          as having the charge of some of his property   he requests mr   lear to endeavor to find out through members of congress  if he can  the  name of some individual in the state in question who would be likely to  make him a faithful agent  as it would not do to leave his concerns in  the hands of       any longer  he was too dependent  he feared  besides  other objections to him   for his election to the legislature to fix his  rents at a just medium  or collect them in the manner he ought to do   the conclusion of this letter has reference to the will of his deceased  nephew  mr  george lewis  who had died at mount vernon     mr  lear had now ceased to be his private secretary  but the most  intimate correspondence was still kept up with him  on the   st of june         there is a letter to him from philadelphia  mr  l  then being in  georgetown   which the general writes on purpose to say that he  considers it a very kind and friendly act in him to go to mount vernon   the letter finishes with a few lines of allusion to his private affairs     philadelphia  may          this is a letter written to mr  lear when the  latter was in england  it treats of private matters  and expresses his  pleasure at the reception he had from the earl of buchan  sir john  sinclair  and others in england to whom general washington had given him  letters  he tells him he was much obliged to him for the several  communications in his letters  and placed great reliance on them  that  the opportunities he derived from mixing with people in different walks   high and low  and of different political sentiments  must have afforded  him an extensive range for observation and comparison  more so by far  than could fall to the lot of a stationary person always revolving in a  particular circle  the general then touches on our home affairs   he was  still president  it will be remembered   he says that to tell him the  british order in council of the  th of june last respecting neutral  vessels had given much discontent in the united states  and that that of  the  th of november had thrown the people into a flame  could hardly be  new to him  in reference to all the existing difficulties with england  he tells him that many measures had been moved in congress  some of  which had passed into acts  and others were pending  that among the  former was a law for fortifying our principal seaports  and another for  raising an additional corps of eight hundred artillery men for the  defence of them and other purposes  and that the bills pending were    st  one to complete our present military establishment   d  one to  raise an army of twenty five thousand men in addition to it  and  d  a  bill to organize  put in training  and hold in readiness at a minute s  warning a select corps of eighty thousand militia  he seemed to think  that the first and last would pass  but that the result of the second  could not be so well predicted  he mentions the appointment of mr  jay  as special minister to england in the hope of settling all our  difficulties in a temperate way by fair and firm negotiation  and that  he would sail in a few days  with mr  john trumbell as his private  secretary  tells him also of mr  randolph s appointment as secretary of  state  and that mr  bradford  of pennsylvania  was made attorney general  in mr  randolph s place  in conclusion  he alludes to  little lincoln    mr  lear s son  and his  lottery tickets   which   poor little fellow    he exclaims  will never be likely to build him a baby house even  the  whole washington lottery business having turned out a bed of thorns  rather than roses  he terminates the letter by telling him that his  public avocations will not admit of more than a flying trip to mount  vernon this summer  and that this not suiting mrs  washington he has  taken a house in germantown  the vicinity of philadelphia  to avoid the  heat of philadelphia in july and august  and that mrs  washington  nelly   one of the miss custi s   and the rest of the family united with him in  every good wish for his health  prosperity  and safe return  and he begs  him to be  assured of the sincerity with which he was and always should  be his affectionate friend  g w      mount vernon  august          mr  lear had got back from england and  was now residing in georgetown or its neighborhood  the present letter  incloses him a power of attorney to vote on the general s shares in the  potomac company at a meeting of its stockholders to be held on the day  following  in georgetown  he says he would be there himself to vote in  person if possible  but that having sent to the post office in  alexandria every day since friday for letters without receiving any from  any of the officers of the government  he might probably receive a great  accumulation of them on the day following  which was again friday  and a  post day   to which he would have to give his attention and prepare  answers  it was therefore that he sent the power of attorney to meet the  contingency of his not being present  this power of attorney was in his  own handwriting     philadelphia  march           there are brief letters since the above  that touch on private business  in this of the   th of march         alluding to his pecuniary affairs  he says  that for the few years he  has to remain here  the enjoyment of less  with more ease and certainty   will be more convenient to him  and more desirable  had his resources  been adequate to it  he would have purchased the lot and houses in  alexandria which mr  lear pointed out  but that as his resources  depended on contingencies that might baffle his calculations  he chose  to tread on sure ground in all his engagements  being as unwilling to  embarrass others by uncertain contracts as to be deceived himself in his  expectations     philadelphia  april           this is one of a few lines in which he  requests mr  lear s acceptance of some garden seeds for his garden and  farm  they were portions of some sent to him from england to be planted  at mount vernon     philadelphia  november           this relates to the sale of some of his  agricultural produce  and to the disappointments he had experienced in  payments promised to him     mount vernon  march           the general is now relieved from all  public duties and cares  on the  d of march of this year he ceased to be  president by voluntarily retiring from the post after writing that  farewell address which a british historian d  has pronounced unequalled  by any composition of uninspired wisdom  he is now a private citizen  returned to his country estate at mount vernon on the banks of the  potomac  mr  lear is in georgetown  in this letter to him of the   th of  march      he speaks of plans for repairing and refitting his ancient  and loved home  but adds that in that rural vicinity he finds difficulty  in getting proper workmen  and requests mr  lear s aid in procuring some  from georgetown  or the new  federal city    as washington at that day  was usually called   skill and dispatch would be necessary  qualifications  and he thinks that his   old sergeant cornelius   might  do for one of the workmen  it seems that this person had been heard of  in those parts  and he adds that he would give him the preference as  knowing his temper and industry     not long  however  is he permitted to remain a private citizen reposing  at mount vernon amidst all its endearments  the next succeeding year  finds him again summoned by his country to her service  at the eager  solicitation of the government  the elder adams then being president   and mr  adams  own desire being seconded by the nation s voice  he was  prevailed upon to accept the supreme command of the army during the  difficulties and even quasi war that had risen up with our old ally   france  he accepted on condition of receiving no pay or emolument until  actually called into the field  nevertheless this conditional acceptance  threw upon him burdensome duties  it exposed him to  many official  calls  to a heavy correspondence  and to a flow of company   it is so  he expresses himself  in this conjuncture he writes to his attached  friend and faithful secretary mr  lear  under date of august the second         from mount vernon  he describes to him those fresh duties as  hindrances to putting his private affairs in that order so necessary  before he embarked in new scenes  it being his desire  before quitting  the scene of human action  to leave his concerns in such a condition as  to give as little trouble as possible to those who would have the  management of them afterwards  under this view of his situation he had  written to the secretary of war to be informed whether he was at liberty  to appoint his secretary  who should be entitled to the usual and proper  allowances  and concludes with asking mr  lear if he would join him in  that capacity if the secretary of war answered in the affirmative  mr   lear assents     this is the last letter in the series  i learn from mrs  lear that  others not in this collection  bespeaking a high degree of intimacy and  confidence  were written to her husband by the same hand  this may well  be conceived when it is known that mr  lear s connection with this  illustrious man began prior to the year      and continued until his  death in      that he was at his bedside when he died  and drew up the  authentic narrative  which was verified by the physicians  of his last  illness  from its commencement to the closing scene  this was published  at that time to meet the anxious feelings of his mourning countrymen   struck down at first by his death as by a shock that went through every  heart     from one of the letters there dropped out  as i unfolded it  a slip in  mr  lear s handwriting  dated may the first        containing the copy  of a message to general washington from lord cornwallis  of which  captain truxton had been the bearer from the east indies  his lordship   whom captain truxton had seen there  being then governor general of  india   congratulated general washington on the establishment of a  happy government in his country  and congratulated the country on the  accession of general washington to its chief magistracy   the message  wished  general washington a long enjoyment of tranquillity and  happiness   adding that  for himself  lord c    he  continued in  troubled waters      i have thus noticed succinctly  perhaps i might more appropriately say  described  these letters  in abridging and connecting the train of them   washington s language is used to the extent that will be seen  the style  is different from that of his official productions and other letters of  his voluminous correspondence  he naturally stepped into one more  familiar when writing to a confidential friend on family matters  relating to his home at mount vernon  or as it was to be arranged in  philadelphia while he was president  but the style has the directness  and sincerity of all his writings  it is apparent that the letters are  written without reserve  with two or three exceptions  no copies appear  to have been kept  yet everything is frank and straight forward   understanding human nature thoroughly under all its phases  he deals  wisely with men in small things as in great  but he does no one  injustice  when others are acting disingenuously towards him  though  seeing through it  he is considerate and forbearing  not taking steps  hastily  but ready to make allowances where they could be made   dishonesty or suspicion of it he never overlooks  in the second letter  he suspects his steward of extravagance in spending too much for  supplies of the table kept for his upper servants  yet he authorizes mr   lear to retain him  if  on looking into his accounts  he finds him  honest  intimating that any successor to him might act in the same way   and a dismissal might be only a change without a benefit  his  reprobation of all dishonesty is seen in more than one of the letters   as well as his restrained modes of dealing with it whilst affecting only  his own interests     as regards the minutiae seen in the letters  the details respecting his  house  furniture  servants  carriages  horses  postilions  and so on   these will be read with curiosity and interest  they suggest a new test  by which to try washington  and let him be tried by it  we have not  before had such details from himself  it is for the first time the  curtain has been so lifted     all great men  the very greatest  caesar  cromwell  napoleon  frederick   peter the great  marlborough  alexander  all on the long list of  towering names  have had contact with small things  no pinnacle in  station  no supremacy in excellence or intellect  can exempt man from  this portion of his lot  it is a human necessity  washington goes into  this sphere with a propriety and seemliness not always observable in  others of his high cast  but often signally the reverse  in dealing with  small things  he shows no undue tenacity of opinion  no selfishness  no  petulance  no misplaced excitements  he never plays the petty tyrant  he  does not forget himself  he does not forget others  he assumes nothing  from any exaltation in himself  but is reasonable and provident in all  his domestic and household arrangements     shall we seek for comparisons  or rather contrasts  with as much of  washington s domestic portraiture before us as these letters hold up   shall we turn to look at others  there is no difficulty  but in  selecting from the vast heap     frederick thought coffee too expensive an indulgence for common use in  his kingdom  saying he was himself reared on beer soup  which was surely  good enough for peasants and common fellows  as he called his people  he  wrote directions to his different cooks with his own hand the better to  pamper his appetite with every variety of the dishes and sauces he liked  best  he stinted voltaire in sugar while a guest in his palace  or gave  it to him cheap and bad  he praised him face to face  and ridiculed him  behind his back  napoleon played blind man s buff at st  helena  he lost  his temper at his coronation on perceiving that some of the princesses  of his family who were to act as trainbearers were not in their right  places  caesar was versed in all the ceremonials of state  it was said  that he would even have been a perfect roman gentleman but for a habit  of putting one of his fingers in his hair  yet such a master of forms  gave grave offence to the roman senate by not rising when they intended  him a compliment  so unwise was he in small things  cromwell in a frolic  threw a cushion at ludlow  who in turn threw one at him  he bedaubed  with ink the face of one of the justices  who  with cromwell himself   had just been condemning charles to the block  peter the great travelled  about with a pet monkey  which unceremoniously jumped upon the king of  england s shoulder when the latter visited the czar in london  some  great men have played leap frog  some practised this affectation  some  that  the book of history records too amply the child like diversions  among those who have flourished on the summits of renown  we hear of  none of this in washington  no idle whimsies  no studied or foolish  eccentricities  none of the buffoonery of ripe years  they were not in  him  or if they were  self discipline extirpated them  as it did the bad  ambition and moral callousness that have disfigured too many of the  great names of the earth  ancient and modern  whilst his matchless  purity and deathless deeds raise him above them all  this verdict is  already more than half pronounced by the most enlightened and  scrutinizing portions of mankind  and time is silently extending its  domain as he is longer tried by the parallels of history  and by the  philosophy of greatness itself     before his fame  steadily ascending from its adamantine foundation  gave  signs that it was to encircle the globe  some imagined him too prudent   some thought him devoid of sensibility  a cold  colossal mass   intrenched in taciturnity  or enfolded in a mantle of dignity  the  sequel disclosed that his complete mastery over passion  moving in  harmony with his other powers and faculties  lent its essential aid  towards his unrivalled name  opinion and passion were strong in him  the  latter existed in vehemence  but he put the curb upon it  turning it  into right directions  and excluding it otherwise from influence upon  his conduct  he stifled his dislikes  he was silent under sneers and  disparaging innuendoes lest inopportune speech might work injury to the  great cause confided to him  to the success of that cause he looked  steadily and exclusively  it absorbed his whole soul  and he determined  to concentrate upon it all his forbearance as well as energy  the  complicated dangers which encompassed it he knew  from his position   sooner and better than others  but he would not make them public  lest  the foe might hear them  or others whose prepossessions were unfriendly   preferring that temporary odium should rest upon himself  therefore his  reserve  and thus it was that the grand results of his life came out in  manifold blessings to his country  thus it was that some at first  distrustful  and others long distrustful  of his superiority  came to  admit it in the end  be it added  that his native good sense teaching  him the value of social restraint  and his knowledge of the world  its  approved observances in intercourse  the tone of the gentleman on its  best models ever also graced his public glory     an anecdote i derived from colonel lear shortly before his death in        may here be related  showing the height to which his passion would  rise yet be controlled  it belongs to his domestic life which i am  dealing with  having occurred under his own roof  whilst it marks public  feeling the most intense  and points to the moral of his life  i give it  in colonel lear s words as nearly as i can  having made a note of them  at the time     towards the close of a winter s day in       an officer in uniform was  seen to dismount in front of the president s in philadelphia  and   giving the bridle to his servant  knock at the door of his mansion   learning from the porter that the president was at dinner  he said he  was on public business and had dispatches for the president  a servant  was sent into the dining room to give the information to mr  lear  who  left the table and went into the hall where the officer repeated what  he had said  mr  lear replied that  as the president s secretary  he  would take charge of the dispatches and deliver them at the proper time   the officer made answer that he had just arrived from the western army   and his orders were to deliver them with all promptitude  and to the  president in person  but that he would wait his directions  mr  lear  returned  and in a whisper imparted to the president what had passed   general washington rose from the table  and went to the officer  he was  back in a short time  made a word of apology for his absence  but no  allusion to the cause of it  he had company that day  everything went on  as usual  dinner over  the gentlemen passed to the drawing room of mrs   washington  which was open in the evening  the general spoke courteously  to every lady in the room  as was his custom  his hours were early  and  by ten o clock all the company had gone  mrs  washington and mr  lear  remained  soon mrs  washington left the room     the general now walked backward and forward slowly for some minutes  without speaking  then he sat down on a sofa by the fire  telling mr   lear to sit down  to this moment there had been no change in his manner  since his interruption at table  mr  lear now perceived emotion  this  rising in him  he broke out suddenly    it s all over  st  clair s  defeated  routed   the officers nearly all killed  the men by wholesale   the route complete  too shocking to think of  and a surprise into the  bargain       he uttered all this with great vehemence  then he paused  got up from  the sofa and walked about the room several times  agitated but saying  nothing  near the door he stopped short and stood still a few seconds   when his wrath became terrible       yes    he burst forth   here  on this very spot  i took leave of him   i wished him success and honor  you have your instructions  i said  from  the secretary of war  i had a strict eye to them  and will add but one  word   beware of a surprise   i repeat it   beware of a surprise   you  know how the indians fight us  he went off with that as my last solemn  warning thrown into his ears  and yet   to suffer that army to be cut to  pieces  hack d  butchered  tomahawk d  by a surprise  the very thing i  guarded him against   o god  o god  he s worse than a murderer  how can  he answer it to his country   the blood of the slain is upon him  the  curse of widows and orphans  the curse of heaven       this torrent came out in tones appalling  his very frame shook  it was  awful  said mr  lear  more than once he threw his hands up as he hurled  imprecations upon st  clair  mr  lear remained speechless  awed into  breathless silence     the roused chief sat down on the sofa once more  he seemed conscious of  his passion  and uncomfortable  he was silent  his warmth beginning to  subside  he at length said in an altered voice    this must not go  beyond this room    another pause followed  a longer one  when he said  in a tone quite low    general st  clair shall have justice  i looked  hastily through the dispatches  saw the whole disaster but not all the  particulars  i will receive him without displeasure  i will hear him  without prejudice  he shall have full justice       he was now  said mr  lear  perfectly calm  half an hour had gone by  the  storm was over  and no sign of it was afterwards seen in his conduct or  heard in his conversation  the result is known  the whole case was  investigated by congress  st  clair was exculpated and regained the  confidence washington had in him when appointing him to that command  he  had put himself into the thickest of the fight and escaped unhurt   though so ill as to be carried on a litter  and unable to mount his  horse without help     a passage from one of mr  jefferson s letters which the historian sparks  records  may here be given  as its spirit covers the private as well as  public life of washington  mr  jefferson withdrew his services as  secretary of state from the administration of washington towards the  close of his first term in the presidency  his retirement from that  post took place when party spirit was violent and bitter in the extreme   never was it more so in the annals of our country  and it was known that  he had differed from washington on political questions of the greatest  importance  nevertheless  writing of him at a later period mr  jefferson  says   his integrity was most pure  his justice the most inflexible i  have ever known  no motives of interest or consanguinity  of friendship  or hatred  being able to bias his decision  he was  indeed  in every  sense of the word  a wise  a good  and a great man      i return to his letters to mr  lear  in superintending his domestic  affairs  these letters exhibit him as the head of a well ordered family   himself the regulator of it all under maxims that best conduce to order  because not too rigid  we see that he was truly hospitable  kind   devoted to his kindred whom he gathers around him  interesting himself  in their education and welfare  cheering them with a welcome at mount  vernon  and soothing them in sickness and sorrow  the kindred of mrs   washington alike share his solicitudes  paternal care  and constant  kindness  all this is discernible from the facts that drop out in these  letters  they point to a heart affectionately alive to the best social  and family feelings  we see his attention to the comfort of his  servants  slaves  and others  his government of them  upper and  subordinate  appears to have been perfect by his union of discipline  with liberality  he knew that his postilions  if they slept over the  stable  would carry lights there whether he forbade it or not  for they  would do it when he knew nothing about it and not tell on each other  he  therefore allowed no sleeping there at all     i could not avoid remarking  as characteristic throughout the whole of  this correspondence  that there is never any complaining of his labors   letter writing alone would have been a heavy labor to him but for his  system and industry  promptitude in using his pen there must necessarily  have been  or he could not have written so much  the history of the  times will show that when he wrote these letters he was simultaneously  writing others on public business  which  as the world knows  he never  neglected in any jot or tittle no matter what else he might be doing   the domestic letters must therefore have been struck off with great  facility  let us call to mind also the more than two hundred volumes of  folio manuscript of his public correspondence which congress purchased   and then remember that the sum of all he wrote is as nothing to what he   did  in his long career of activity in his country s service  military  and civil     next i remark  as a new corroboration of the modesty ever so prominent  in him  that not once throughout the whole of this correspondence does  he make any  the slightest  allusion to himself in connection with the  revolutionary war  comparatively recent as it then was  besides that the  general tenor of the correspondence might have supplied occasions for  such allusions  special opportunities were at hand while skirting the  battlegrounds and other localities of his military operations in the  war  even in his journeys between mount vernon and philadelphia  yet  they are never once made  the casual mention of his   old sergeant  cornelius    whom he happened to want as a workman about his grounds at  mount vernon  is the sole reference that could wake up the mind to his  having had anything to do with the revolution  he had helped to pave the  way for that great event by the influence of his high character thrown  into the scale when the early questions of resistance or submission were  in agitation  he had helped it on by his attachment to constitutional  liberty at that epoch though his fortune was at stake  and friendships  among the highborn and cultivated from the parent state then among his  associates in virginia  could a bosom like his have been swayed by such  thoughts  he had helped it on by the special weight of name he had won  in arms fighting side by side with the proud generals and troops of  britain confident of victory  but saved from annihilation by his inborn  fearlessness and superiority  when death was all around him and dismay  everywhere in braddock s disastrous fight  their silent homage crowning  the head of their deliverer  his triumphant sword at yorktown put the  crowning hand to the immortal work  the work that founded this great  nation  yet we could never infer from a word or hint in the course of  these letters  from first to last  that he had anything to do with the  work  except as the name of   sergeant cornelius   incidentally falls  from his pen with only a rural object  what a lesson  some extol  themselves openly  some do it under cover of self humiliation  called by  a french writer the pomp of modesty  washington is simply silent  he  will slide into no allusions to the great and glorious work of his life  in the midst of temptations to it     finally  the charm of these letters is in their being so familiar  so  out of the sphere of his correspondence generally  and therefore holding  him up in lights that seem new  mankind  long familiar with the external  attributes and grandeur of his character  looking up to his vast fame  as hero and statesman uncertain which predominates  have known less of  him at home with his family  his relations and his friends  the inner  parts of his character  the kindlier impulses of his nature  his  sympathies with those dear to him  dependent on him  or looking to him  for the solace of his kindness  seem to have remained less publicly  known  mr  sparks  in his preface to his  life and writings   remarks  that  it must be kept in mind that much the larger portion of his life  passed on a conspicuous public theatre  and that no account of it can be  written which will not assume essentially the air of history   he adds   that while in his work  anecdotes are interwoven and such incidents of a  private and personal nature as are known  they are more rare than could  be desired      the synopsis of the letters which i have given may perhaps tend in some  small degree to supply this desideratum in his illustrious life  alongside of the more copious anecdotes and reminiscences supplied by  the patriotic and filial devotion of mr  custis  this is my humble hope     since the foregoing letters were received from mrs  lear  she has  favored me with the perusal of other manuscripts introducing us to the  domestic hours of general washington  among them is a diary kept by mr   lear at mount vernon in       anterior therefore to the time when  washington became president  from this document i am permitted to copy a  passage entire  it is dated the   d of october       mr  drayton and mr   izard  gentlemen of south carolina  had been spending the day at mount  vernon  after dinner  the company still round the table  washington was  led to speak of arnold s treason  and mr  lear wrote down his account of  it in his diary of that day  although history has made us familiar with  that whole transaction in its essential facts  to hear it under such  circumstances from the lips of washington  seems to impart to it new  interest  we listen with revived curiosity and attention when such a  narrator speaks  the copy from mr  lear s diary  in which is recorded  this interesting dinner table narrative  is in the words following            mount vernon     monday  october   d            mrs  washington went to arlington with the two children  sent a letter  directed to mr  samuel storer to the post office by charles  who went up  to town  alexandria  with master thompson and lawrence washington  who  had spent their vacation here  mr  drayton and mr  izard here all day   after dinner general washington was  in the course of conversation  led  to speak of arnold s treachery  when he gave the following account of  it  which i shall put in his own words  thus   i confess i had a good  opinion of arnold before his treachery was brought to light  had that  not been the case  i should have had some reason to suspect him sooner   for when he commanded in philadelphia  the marquis la fayette brought  accounts from france of the armament which was to be sent to co operate  with us in the ensuing campaign  soon after this was known  arnold  pretended to have some private business to transact in connecticut  and  on his way there he called at my quarters  and in the course of  conversation expressed a desire of quitting philadelphia and joining the  army the ensuing campaign  i told him that it was probable we should  have a very active one  and that if his wound and state of health would  permit  i should be extremely glad of his services with the army  he  replied that he did not think his wound would permit him to take a very  active part  but still he persisted in his desire of being with the  army  he went on to connecticut  and on his return called again upon me   he renewed his request of being with me next campaign  and i made him  the same answer i had done before  he again repeated that he did not  think his wound would permit him to do active duty  and intimated a  desire to have the command at west point  i told him i did not think  that would suit him  as i should leave none in the garrison but  invalids  because it would be entirely covered by the main army  the  subject was dropt at that time  and he returned to philadelphia  it then  appeared somewhat strange to me  that a man of arnold s known activity  and enterprise  should be desirous of taking so inactive a part  i  however thought no more of the matter  when the french troops arrived at  rhode island  i had intelligence from new york that general clinton  intended to make an attack upon them before they could get themselves  settled and fortified  in consequence of that  i was determined to  attack new york  which would be left much exposed by his drawing off the  british troops  and accordingly formed my line of battle  and moved down  with the whole army to king s ferry  which we passed  arnold came to  camp at that time  and having no command  and consequently no quarters   all the houses thereabouts being occupied by the army   he was obliged  to seek lodgings at some distance from the camp  while the army was  crossing at king s ferry  i was going to see the last detachment over   and met arnold  who asked me if i had thought of anything for him  i  told him that he was to have the command of the light troops  which was  a post of honor  and which his rank indeed entitled him to  upon this  information his countenance changed  and he appeared to be quite fallen   and instead of thanking me  or expressing any pleasure at the  appointment  never opened his mouth  i desired him to go on to my  quarters and get something to refresh himself  and i would meet him  there soon  he did so  upon his arrival there  he found col  tilghman   whom he took a one side  and mentioning what i had told him  seemed to  express great uneasiness at it  as his leg  he said  would not permit  him to be long on horse back  and intimated a great desire to have the  command at west point  when i returned to my quarters  col  tilghman  informed me of what had passed  i made no reply to it  but his behavior  struck me as strange and unaccountable  in the course of that night   however  i received information from new york that general clinton had  altered his plan and was debarking his troops  this information obliged  me likewise to alter my disposition and return to my former station   where i could better cover the country  i then determined to comply with  arnold s desire  and accordingly gave him the command of the garrison at  west point  things remained in this situation about a fortnight  when i  wrote to the count rochambeau desiring to meet him at some intermediate  place  as we could neither of us be long enough from our respective  commands to visit the other   in order to lay the plan for the siege of  yorktown  and proposed hartford  where i accordingly went and met the  count  on my return i met the chevalier luzerne towards evening within  about    miles of west point  on his way to join the count at rhode  island   which i intended to reach that night  but he insisted upon  turning back with me to the next public house  where  in politeness to  him  i could not but stay all night  determining  however  to get to  west point to breakfast very early  i sent off my baggage  and desired  colonel hamilton to go forward and inform general arnold that i would  breakfast with him  soon after he arrived at arnold s quarters  a letter  was delivered to arnold which threw him into the greatest confusion  he  told colonel hamilton that something required his immediate attendance  at the garrison which was on the opposite side of the river to his  quarters  and immediately ordered a horse  to take him to the river  and  the barge  which he kept to cross  to be ready  and desired major  franks  his aid  to inform me when i should arrive  that he was gone  over the river and would return immediately  when i got to his quarters  and did not find him there  i desired major franks to order me some  breakfast  and as i intended to visit the fortifications i would see  general arnold there  after i had breakfasted  i went over the river   and inquiring for arnold  the commanding officer told me that he had  not been there  i likewise inquired at the several redoubts  but no one  could give me any information where he was  the impropriety of his  conduct when he knew i was to be there  struck me very forcibly  and my  mind misgave me  but i had not the least idea of the real cause  when i  returned to arnold s quarters about two hours after  and told colonel  hamilton that i had not seen him  he gave me a packet which had just  arrived for me from col  jemmison  which immediately brought the matter  to light  i ordered colonel hamilton to mount his horse and proceed with  the greatest despatch to a post on the river about eight miles below  in  order to stop the barge if she had not passed  but it was too late  it  seems that the letter which arnold received which threw him in such  confusion was from col  jemmison  informing him that andre was taken and  that the papers found upon him were in his possession  col  jemmison   when andre was taken with these papers  could not believe that arnold  was a traitor  but rather thought it was an imposition of the british  in order to destroy our confidence in arnold  he  however  immediately  on their being taken  despatched an express after me  ordering him to  ride night and day till he came up with me  the express went the lower  road  which was the road by which i had gone to connecticut  expecting  that i would return by the same route  and that he would meet me  but  before he had proceeded far  he was informed that i was returning by the  upper road  he then cut across the country and followed in my track till  i arrived at west point  he arrived about two hours after  and brought  the above packet  when arnold got down to the barge  he ordered his men   who were very clever fellows and some of the better sort of soldiery  to  proceed immediately on board the vulture sloop of war  as a flag  which  was lying down the river  saying that they must be very expeditious  as  he must return in a short time to meet me  and promised them two gallons  of rum if they would exert themselves  they did  accordingly  but when  they got on board the vulture  instead of their two gallons of rum  he  ordered the coxswain to be called down into the cabin and informed him  that he and the men must consider themselves as prisoners  the coxswain  was very much astonished  and told him that they came on board under the  sanction of a flag  he answered that that was nothing to the purpose   they were prisoners  but the captain of the vulture had more generosity  than this pitiful scoundrel  and told the coxswain that he would take  his parole for going on shore to get clothes  and whatever else was  wanted for himself and his companions  he accordingly came  got his  clothes and returned on board  when they got to new york  general  clinton  ashamed of so low and mean an action  set them all at liberty      this closes the account  it terminates also the use i have been  permitted  through the

zealand  and having  persuaded my friend mr  shand to accompany me  we made an arrangement for  the passage with captain kent  of the brig governor macquarie  and   bidding adieu to our friends at sydney  in a few hours  on october   th         we were wafted into the great pacific ocean     there were several other passengers on board  who were proceeding to new  zealand to form a wesleyan missionary establishment at hokianga  amongst  these were a mr  and mrs  hobbs  who were most enthusiastic in the cause   they had formerly belonged to the same mission at whangaroa  when a war  which took place amongst the natives totally destroyed their  establishment  and  after enduring great varieties of suffering  they  escaped  but lost everything they possessed  except the clothes they had  on  we had a very fine wind for nine days  and on the   th we saw a  gannet  a sure sign we were within a hundred miles of land  for these  birds are never seen at a greater distance from it  true to our  anticipations  towards the afternoon the water became discoloured  and at  midnight we saw the land     this interesting island  of which we now got sight  was first discovered  by that eminent and enterprising dutch navigator  tasman  subsequently to  the discovery of van diemen s land  his voyage from batavia in        undertaken by order of the then governor general of dutch india  anthony  van diemen  was one of the most important and successful ever undertaken   for it was during this voyage that new holland was discovered  of which  van diemen s land was then supposed to form a part  the extensive island  of new zealand being supposed to form another portion        the slight intercourse of the discoverers with the natives had so  calamitous a termination  and the exaggerated accounts it was then a kind  of fashion to give of savages  stigmatised the new zealanders with such a  character for treachery and cruelty  that their island was not visited  again for upwards of a century  when the immortal cook drew aside the  veil of error and obscurity from this unexplored land  and rescued the  character of its inhabitants from the ignominy which its original  discoverers  the dutch  had thrown upon them  this immense tract of land  was imagined by tasman to form but one island  and he most unaptly gave  it the name of new zealand  from its great resemblance  as was stated  to  his own country        in      cook discovered a strait of easy access and safe navigation   cutting the island nearly in half  thus making two islands of what had  before been imagined but one  this strait bears his name  and is often  traversed by vessels from new south wales returning home by way of cape  horn     in      his majesty s ship warsprite passed through this strait in  company with the volage  twenty eight guns  being the first english line  of battleship which had ever made the attempt  a few years since  captain  stewart  commanding a colonial vessel out of port jackson  discovered  another strait  which cut off the extreme southern point  making it a  separate island that bears his name  and now almost every year our  sealers and whalers are making additional and useful discoveries along  its coasts     these islands lie between lat     deg  and    deg s  and long      deg  and     deg e   the opening of the land to which we were now opposite  and which was our  destined port  the accurate eye of cook had observed  but did not attempt  the entrance  and it is only about ten years since  when the two store  ships  the dromedary and coromandel  loaded with spars on the coast  that  a small vessel attending on those ships first crossed the bar  but  although they took soundings and laid down buoys  the commanders of the  large vessels were afraid of attempting the entrance  which proved their  good sense  for their great draught of water would have rendered the  undertaking more hazardous than the risk was worth  yet during my  residence in this country two large vessels crossed the bar  and  recrossed it heavily laden  without the slightest accident  one the  harmony  of london      tons burden  the other the elizabeth  of sydney   of nearly equal tonnage  but in proof that it is not always safe  a few  months after this  two schooners of extremely light draught were lost   though they were both commanded by men who perfectly well knew the  channels through the bar  it was a singular circumstance that both  vessels had been built in new zealand  one  the herald  a small and  beautiful craft  built by and belonging to the church missionaries  the  crew of which escaped  but the disastrous circumstances attending the  wreck of the other  called the enterprise  i shall relate in their proper  place     the morning of the   th was foggy and unfavourable  but it suddenly  cleared up  and exhibited the entrance of hokianga right before us  and a  light breeze came to our aid to carry us in  the entrance to this river  is very remarkable  and can never be mistaken by mariners  on the north  side  for many miles  are hills of sand  white  bleak  and barren  ending  abruptly at the entrance of the river  which is about a quarter of a mile  across  where the south head rises abrupt  craggy  and black  the land  all round is covered with verdure  thus  at the first glimpse of these  heads from the sea  one is white  the other black     the only difficulty attending the entrance  and  indeed  the only thing  which prevents hokianga from being one of the finest harbours in the  world  is the bar  this lies two miles from the mouth of the river  its  head enveloped in breakers and foam  bidding defiance and threatening  destruction to all large ships which may attempt the passage  however   we fortunately slipped over its sandy sides  undamaged  in three fathom  water     after crossing the bar  no other obstacle lay in our way  and  floating  gradually into a beautiful river  we soon lost sight of the sea  and were  sailing up a spacious sheet of water  which became considerably wider  after entering it  while majestic hills rose on each side  covered with  verdure to their very summits  looking up the river  we beheld various  headlands stretching into the water  and gradually contracting in width   till they became fainter and fainter in the distance  and all was lost in  the azure of the horizon  the excitement occasioned by contemplating  these beautiful scenes was soon interrupted by the hurried approach of  canoes  and the extraordinary noises made by the natives who were in  them     footnotes      footnote    the dutch and spanish had discovered n e  australia as early  as       and the dutch had on several occasions visited the n w  and  south coasts of the continent before the date of tasman s voyage       footnote    the name given by tasman was staten landt  the name new  zealand was bestowed in      by the states general of the united  provinces            chapter ii     reception by the natives       as the arrival of a ship is always a profitable occurrence  great  exertions are made to be the first on board  there were several canoes  pulling towards us  and from them a number of muskets were fired  a  compliment we returned with our swivels  one of the canoes soon came  alongside  and an old chief came on board  who rubbed noses with captain  kent  whom he recognised as an old acquaintance  he then went round and  shook hands with all the strangers  after which he squatted himself down  upon the deck  seeming very much to enjoy the triumph of being the first  on board  but others very soon coming up with us  our decks were crowded  with them  some boarding us at the gangway  others climbing up the chains  and bows  and finding entrances where they could  all were in perfect  good humour  and pleasure beamed in all their countenances     i had heard a great deal respecting the splendid race of men i was going  to visit  and the few specimens i had occasionally met with at sydney so  much pleased me  that i was extremely anxious to see a number of them  together  to judge whether  as a nation  they were finer in their  proportions than the english  or whether it was mere accident that  brought some of their tallest and finest proportioned men before me     i examined these savages  as they crowded round our decks  with the  critical eye of an artist  they were generally taller and larger men  than ourselves  those of middle height were broad chested and muscular   and their limbs as sinewy as though they had been occupied all their  lives in laborious employments  their colour is lighter than that of the  american indian  their features small and regular  their hair is in a  profusion of beautiful curls  whereas that of the indian is straight and  lank  the disposition of the new zealander appears to be full of fun and  gaiety  while the indian is dull  shy  and suspicious     i have known indians in america from the north to the south  the  miserable  idiotic botecooda of brazil  the fierce warrior of canada  and  the gentle and civilised peruvian  yet in their features and complexions  they are all much alike  i observed their statures altered with their  different latitudes  the chilians and the canadians being nearly the  same  in figure tall  thin  and active  their climate being nearly the  same  although at the two extremes of america  while those living between  the equinoxes are short  fat  and lazy  i am persuaded that these south  sea islanders  though so nearly of the same complexion  still are not of  the same race  laziness being the characteristic of the american indian  from north to south  while the new zealanders are laborious in the  extreme  as their astonishing and minute carvings prove  the moment the  indian tasted intoxicating spirits his valour left him  he became an  idiot and a tool in the hands of the white man  here they have the utmost  aversion to every kind of  wine or strong drink   and very often severely  take us to task for indulging in such an extraordinary and debasing  propensity  or  as they call it   of making ourselves mad   but both  nations are equally fond of tobacco     the first thing which struck me forcibly was  that each of these savages  was armed with a good musket  and most of them had also a cartouch box  buckled round their waists  filled with ball cartridges  and those who  had fired their pieces from the canoes carefully cleaned the pans   covered the locks over with a piece of dry rag  and put them in a secure  place in their canoes  every person who has read captain cook s account  of the natives of new zealand would be astonished at the change which has  taken place since his time  when the firing of a single musket would have  terrified a whole village     as we sailed up the river very slowly  the throng of savages increased to  such a degree that we could scarcely move  and  to add to our confusion   they gave us  a dance of welcome   standing on one spot  and stamping so  furiously that i really feared they would have stove in the decks  which  our lady passengers were obliged to leave  as when the dance began each  man proceeded to strip himself naked  a custom indispensable among  themselves     we came to an anchor off a native village called pakanae  where two  chiefs of consequence came on board  who soon cleared our decks of a  considerable number  we paid great attention to these chiefs  admitting  them into the cabin  etc   and it had the effect of lessening the noise   and bringing about some kind of order amongst those who still continued  on deck  the names of these chiefs were moetara and akaeigh  and they  were the heads of the village opposite to which we had anchored  they  were well known to our captain  who spoke their language  they were  accustomed to the society of europeans  also to transact business with  them  and as they were flax  timber  and hog merchants  they and the  captain talked over the state of the markets during the evening  they  were clothed in mats  called kaka hoos  the ladies joined our party at  supper  and we spent a very cheerful time with our savage visitors  who  both behaved in as polite and respectful a manner as the best educated  gentlemen could have done  their pleasing manners so ingratiated them  into the good opinion of the ladies  that they all declared  they would  be really very handsome men if their faces were not tattooed      the next day we received a visit from mr  and mrs  butler  english  people  who had taken up their residence here for the purpose of trading   and we returned with them on shore  taking our female passengers with us   and leaving them in charge of mrs  butler  i determined to stroll through  the village  which is  in fact  a collection of rude huts  huddled  together without system or regularity  dock leaves and weeds of every  description were growing luxuriantly all round them  and in many places  actually overtopping the houses  few being more than four feet high  with  a doorway about two feet  scarcely any of them were inhabited  as at this  season of the year the greater part of the population prefer living in  the open air to remaining in their small  smoky ovens of houses     i had not rambled far before i witnessed a scene which forcibly reminded  me of the savage country in which i then was  and the great alteration of  character and customs a few days  sail will make  the sight to me so  appalling was that of the remains of a human body which had been roasted   and a number of hogs and dogs were snarling and feasting upon it  i was  more shocked than surprised  for i had been informed of the character of  the new zealanders long before my arrival amongst them  still  the  coming suddenly and unexpectedly upon a sight like this completely  sickened me of rambling  at least for that day  and i hastened back to  mr  butler s  eager to inquire into the particulars of the horrid  catastrophe     that gentleman informed me that the night of the arrival of our ship  a  chief had set one of his kookies  or slaves  to watch a piece of ground  planted with the kumara  or sweet potato  in order to prevent the hogs  committing depredations upon it  the poor lad  delighted with the  appearance of our vessel  was more intent upon observing her come to an  anchor than upon guarding his master s property  and suffered the hogs to  ramble into the plantation  where they soon made dreadful havoc  in the  midst of this trespass and neglect of orders his master arrived  the  result was certain  he instantly killed the unfortunate boy with a blow  on the head from his stone hatchet  then ordered a fire to be made  and  the body to be dragged to it  where it was roasted and consumed     it was now time to return on board  and we walked down to the beach for  that purpose  but it was quite low water  and the boat was full two  hundred feet off  she lay at the end of a long  slimy  muddy flat  and  while we were debating how we should manage to get to her  the native  chiefs took up the females in their arms  as though they were children   and  in spite of all their blushes and remonstrances  carried them to the  boat and placed them safely in it  each seeming to enjoy the task  they  then returned and gave us a passage  walking as easily with us upon their  backs as if we had been no heavier than so many muskets  we took care not  to shock the feelings of the females by letting them know the tragedy so  lately acted in the village  or horrify them by telling them that one of  their carriers was the murderer  it would have been difficult to have  made them believe that such a noble looking and good natured fellow had  so lately imbrued his hands in the blood of a fellow creature     we had now been lying here two days  and the curiosity of the people did  not diminish  nor were our visitors less numerous  parties were hourly  coming up and down the river to pay their respects to our captain  and  the report of there being numerous passengers on board greatly increased  their desire to hold intercourse with us  they all appeared anxious to  make themselves useful  some chopping wood for our cook  others assisting  the steward  in order to get what might be left on the plates  others  brought small presents of fish  in fact  all availed themselves of any  excuse to get on board  yet  notwithstanding the crowd  and the confusion  attending their movements  there was scarcely any thieving amongst them   they have seen the detestation that theft is held in by europeans  and  the injury it does to trade  and have  in consequence  nearly left it  off  none but the meanest slaves will now practise it  and they do so at  the risk of their lives  for  if caught in the act  and the charge is  proved against them  their heads are cut off           chapter iii     a ramble ashore       on november  rd we visited pakanae  a village lying round the base of a  large conical hill  about three hundred feet high  with a fortification  on the top  which gives it its name  pa signifying in their language a  fortified place  behind it lies a swamp  which is covered at high water   and which adds greatly to its security  for the unsettled and war like  spirit of the natives renders it absolutely necessary that they always  should have a place of strength near at hand to retreat to  as they never  know how suddenly their enemies may make an attack upon them  to the  right of this swamp is a beautiful valley  in a very high state of  cultivation  at the time i stood viewing it from the summit of the hill   i was charmed with the scene of industry and bustle it presented  all the  inhabitants of the village having gone forth to plant their potatoes   kumaras  and indian corn  in the rear  and forming a fine  bold  background  is an immense chain of high and rugged hills  covered to  their summits with thick forests  and forming  as it were  a natural  barrier and protection to this smiling and fruitful valley  while from  their wooded sides issue innumerable small streams of clear water  which   meeting at the base  form beautiful rivulets  and after meandering  through the valley  and serving all the purposes of irrigation  they  empty themselves into the hokianga river     standing on the spot from which i have described the above prospect  i  felt fully convinced of the frugality and industry of these savages  the  regularity of their plantations  and the order with which they carry on  their various works  differ greatly from most of their brethren in the  south seas  as here the chiefs and their families set the example of  labour  and when that is the case  none can refuse to toil  round the  village of pakanae  at one glance is to be seen above     acres of  cultivated land  and that not slightly turned up  but well worked and  cleared  and when the badness of their tools is considered  together with  their limited knowledge of agriculture  their persevering industry i look  upon as truly astonishing     the new zealanders have established here a wise custom  which prevents a  great deal of waste and confusion  and generally preserves to the planter  a good crop  in return for the trouble of sowing  namely  as soon as the  ground is finished  and the seed sown  it is  tabooed   that  is rendered  sacred  by men appointed for that service  and it is death to trample  over or disturb any part of this consecrated ground  the wisdom and  utility of this regulation must be obvious to every one  but  however  useful this taboo system is to the natives  it is a great inconvenience  to a stranger who is rambling over the country  for if he does not use  the greatest caution  and procure a guide  he may get himself into a  serious dilemma before his rambles be over  which had nearly been the  case with our party this day  we were ascending a hill  for the purpose  of inspecting a new zealand fortification on the summit  when a little  boy joined our party  either out of curiosity  or in hopes of getting a  fish hook from us  a thing the natives are continually asking for  but as  we had a man with us who spoke the language fluently  we did not much  regard the boy s guidance  though to us it speedily became of great  importance  we were taking a short cut  to make a quick ascent to the top  of the hill  when the little fellow uttered a cry of horror  our  interpreter asked him what he meant  when he pointed his finger forward   and told him to look  for the ground was tabooed  we did as he desired  us  but beheld nothing particular  till he showed us  in one of the  trees  among the branches  a large bunch of something  but we could not  make out what it was  this  he told us  was the body of a chief  then  undergoing the process of decomposition  previous to interment  which  process is witnessed by men appointed for that purpose  who alone are  permitted to approach the spot  the ground all round is tabooed  so that   had it not been for the interference of our young guide  we should  certainly have been placed in a most distressing situation  and it is a  question if our ignorance of their customs would have been considered a  sufficient excuse for our offence     the top of this hill was level and square  and was capable of containing  several hundred warriors  it was cut into slopes all round  and fortified  by stockades in every direction  which rendered it impregnable  the  natives assured me its strength had been often tried  the famous warrior  hongi had attacked it several times  but had always been defeated with  great loss  after inspecting this fortification  which excited our  admiration  we proceeded through the village at the bottom of the hill   nearly the whole of the inhabitants were out working in the fields  we  entered several of their habitations  and found all their property  exposed and unguarded  even their muskets and powder  which they prize  above everything  were open to our inspection  so little idea of robbery  have they amongst themselves  but as there are many hogs and dogs roaming  at large through their villages  they are very careful to fence their  dwellings round with wicker work  to preserve them from the depredations  of these animals  and as the houses are extremely low  they have very  much the appearance of bird cages or rabbit hutches  their storehouses  are generally placed upon poles  a few feet from the ground  and tabooed  or consecrated  great taste and ingenuity are displayed in carving and  ornamenting these depositories  i made drawings from several of them   which were entirely covered with carving  and some good attempts at  groups of figures  as large as life  plainly showed the dawning of the  art of sculpture amongst them  many of the attempts of the new zealanders  in that art are quite as good  if not better  than various specimens i  have seen of the first efforts of the early egyptians     painting and sculpture are both arts greatly admired by these rude  people  every house of consequence is ornamented and embellished  and  their canoes have the most minute and elaborate workmanship bestowed upon  them     their food is always eaten out of little baskets  rudely woven of green  flax  and as they generally leave some for their next meal  they hang  these baskets on sticks or props  till they are ready to eat again  thus  a village presents a very singular appearance  as it is stuck full of  sticks  with various kinds of baskets hanging from them  this plan   however  is the most rational that could be adopted  as none of their  eatables can be left on the ground  or they would become the prey of the  hogs and dogs     in the course of our long ramble we noticed many pretty little huts  some  having neat gardens all round them  planted with fruits and corn  one  house which we saw was built by a chief who had made several voyages to  port jackson  and it was really a very comfortable dwelling  it had a  high door  which we could enter without stooping  and in a separate room  was constructed a bed  after the pattern of one on ship board  he had  likewise a large sea chest in his house  the key of which  highly  polished  was hung round his neck as an ornament  in the course of our  walk we came to a spot on which a group of old people were sitting  sunning themselves  and they immediately all rose to welcome us  i  remarked one amongst them who seemed  from his silvery locks and feeble  limbs  to be very old  i asked him  among other questions  whether he  remembered captain cook  he said he did not  but well recollected captain  furneaux  and was one of the party which cut off and massacred his boat s  crew  and from other information which i received i believe his assertion  to have been correct        footnotes      footnote    captain furneaux s account of this massacre is printed in  the appendix            chapter iv     the hokianga river eighty years ago       as our missionary passengers had by this time fixed upon the spot where  they intended to establish their settlement  and it being several miles  up the river  we got under weigh to proceed thither  the captain s  agreement being to that effect  we proceeded with the first fair wind   about twenty miles up the stream  which was as far as we could with  safety take the vessel  the shores on each side this noble river are  composed of hills gradually rising behind each other  most of them  covered with woods to the water s edge  not a vestige of a habitation is  to be seen  and if it had not been for the occasional sight of a canoe   we might have imagined the country to be totally uninhabited  opposite a  small island  or  rather  sand bank  the vessel grounded  and had to  remain there till the next tide floated her off  it was a curious and  interesting spot  being a native pa and depot  and was entirely covered  with storehouses for provisions and ammunition  the centre was so  contrived that all assailants might be cut off before they could effect a  landing  and we were all much gratified by the judgment and forethought  displayed in this little military work  the next morning we got off  but  could not proceed far  as the shoals were becoming so numerous as to  render the navigation dangerous  but here we beheld  with both surprise  and satisfaction  a most unexpected sight  namely  a snug little colony  of our own countrymen  comfortably settled and usefully employed in this  savage and unexplored country  some enterprising merchants of port  jackson have established here a dockyard and a number of sawpits  several  vessels have been laden with timber and spars  one vessel has been built   launched  and sent to sea from this spot  and another of a hundred and  fifty tons burthen was then upon the stocks     on landing at this establishment at te horeke  or  as the englishmen have  called it   deptford   i was greatly delighted with the appearance of  order  bustle  and industry it presented  here were storehouses   dwelling houses  and various offices for the mechanics  and every  department seemed as well filled as it could have been in a civilised  country  to me the most interesting circumstance was to notice the great  delight of the natives  and the pleasure they seemed to take in observing  the progress of the various works  all were officious to  lend a hand    and each seemed eager to be employed  this feeling corresponds with my  idea of the best method of civilising a savage  nothing can more  completely show the importance of the useful arts than a dockyard  in it  are practised nearly all the mechanical trades  and these present to the  busy enquiring mind of a new zealander a practical encyclopaedia of  knowledge  when he sees the combined exertions of the smith and carpenter  create so huge a fabric as a ship  his mind is filled with wonder and  delight  and when he witnesses the moulding of iron at the anvil  it  excites his astonishment and emulation     the people of the dockyard informed me that  although it was constantly  crowded with natives  scarcely anything had ever been stolen  and all the  chiefs in the neighbourhood took so great an interest in the work that  any annoyance offered to those employed would immediately be revenged as  a personal affront           chapter v     journey overland to bay of islands       here we left the brig to unload her cargo  my friend shand and myself  having determined to proceed overland to the bay of islands  an  intelligent chief  hearing of our intention  offered to accompany us  himself  and lent us two of his kookies to carry our baggage  we accepted  the chieftain s offer  and several other natives joined the party to bear  us company     november     we all embarked in a canoe  in order to reach the head of  the river before we began our pedestrian tour  and  after paddling about  eight or nine miles further up  where the river became exceedingly  narrow  we came to another english settlement  this consisted of a party  of men who had come out in the rosanna  the vessel employed by the new  zealand company  when all ideas of settling were totally abandoned by the  officers sent out for that purpose  these men chose rather to remain by  themselves than to return home  and we found them busily employed in  cutting timber  sawing planks  and making oars for the sydney market  how  far they may prove successful  time only can develop  but as these  enterprising men had only their own industry to assist them  it could not  be expected that their establishment could bear a comparison with the one  at te horeke  which is supported by several of the most wealthy  merchants of new south wales     as the river became narrower  the habitations of the natives were more  numerous  the chief of this district  whose name is patuone  has a  splendid village very near the carpenters  establishment we have just  described  he had taken these industrious men under his especial  protection  and seemed very proud of having a settlement of that kind in  his territories  as it gave him power and consequence among all the  neighbouring chiefs  from the trade he carried on by means of their  exertions     patuone had likewise induced the wesleyan missionaries to settle upon his  land  about a mile below  so that the head of this river assumed quite  the appearance of a civilised colony     our party now disembarked  we landed in a dense forest  which reached to  the water s edge  and our guides and slaves began to divide the loads  each was to carry on his back  several joined us from the two english  stations on the river  and we then amounted to a very large party  all in  high spirits  and anxious to proceed on our journey  when our natives had  distributed the luggage  they loaded themselves  which they did with both  skill and quickness  for a new zealander is never at a loss for cords or  ropes  their plan is to gather a few handfuls of flax  which they soon  twist into a very good substitute  with this material they formed slings   with which they dexterously fastened our moveables on their backs  and  set off at a good trot  calling out to us to follow them           chapter vi     meeting with the chief patuone       we travelled through a wood so thick that the light of heaven could not  penetrate the trees that composed it  they were so large and so close  together that in many places we had some difficulty to squeeze ourselves  through them  to add to our perplexities  innumerable streams intersected  this forest  which always brought us europeans to a complete standstill   the only bridges which the natives ever think of making are formed by  cutting down a tree  and letting it fall across  and over these our  bare legged attendants  loaded as they were  scrambled with all the  agility of cats or monkeys  but it was not so with us  for several times  they seated one of us on the top of their load  and carried him over  the  chief  who accompanied us  made it his particular business to see me safe  through every difficulty  and many times he carried me himself over such  places as i dared scarcely venture to look down upon     in the midst of this wood we met the chief of this district  patuone   who  together with all his family  were employed in planting a small   cleared patch of land  he appeared highly delighted at beholding  strangers  and all his wives came from their occupations to welcome us   he told us that  a very few miles farther on  we should come to a village  belonging to him  where his eldest son was residing  and that we must  there pass the night      illustration  patuone  a notable hokianga chief      we thanked him for the invitation  rubbed noses with him  their token of  friendship   and parted     soon after parting with patuone  we fell in with a most beautiful bull   cow  and calf  i was amazed at seeing such fine animals in this country   but my companions soon cleared up the mystery by informing me that they  were gifts from the missionaries  who had orders from home to distribute  these useful animals amongst such chiefs as they thought would take care  of them  a wise and beneficial measure  these animals were tabooed   consequently they could ramble wherever they found food most to their  liking  about dusk we arrived at the village patuone had described to us   we were most happy to see it  as we were heartily tired  and dripping wet  from a recent and heavy shower           chapter vii     a maori village       the village was situated on the side of a small  picturesque stream  one  of the branches of the hokianga  but continued droughts had at this time  reduced it to a trifling brook  from its lofty banks  and the large trees  lying athwart it  we conjectured that during heavy rains it must be a  mighty flood  a long straggling collection of huts composed the village   a great deal of land in its vicinity was cleared and planted  which  doubtless was the ostensible object of patuone s people being here  as  the village lay upon the opposite shore from that on which we arrived  we  sat some time under the shelter of a large tree  to contemplate its  appearance  and to give time to arrange our party for passing the stream   and also for my making a sketch  the red glare of the setting sun  just  touching the top of every object  beautifully illuminated the landscape   and its rays bursting through the black woods in the background  gave the  woods an appearance of being on fire  while a beautiful rainbow  thrown  across the sky  tinged the scene with a fairy land effect     as soon as they perceived us from the opposite shore  a loud shout of  welcome was raised  and all the inhabitants came out to meet us  they  carried us over the stream  conducted us to their huts  and then sat down  to gaze at and admire us     as we were very hungry after our fatiguing walk  we soon unpacked our  baggage  and in so doing made an unavoidable display of many valuable and  glittering objects  which roused the attention of our savage spectators   and caused them  on the unfolding of every fresh object  to make loud and  long exclamations of wonder and amazement  as i was then  a stranger in  their land   and unaccustomed to their peculiarities  i felt a little  alarmed at their shouts  but  on a longer acquaintance with them  i found  my fears had been groundless     here we saw the son of patuone  accompanied by thirty or forty young  savages  sitting or lying all round us  all were exceedingly handsome   notwithstanding the wildness of their appearance and the ferocity of  their looks  let the reader picture to himself this savage group   handling everything they saw  each one armed with a musket  loaded with  ball  a cartouch box buckled round his waist  and a stone patoo patoo  or  hatchet  in his hand  while human bones were hung round each neck by way  of ornament  let the scene and situation be taken into consideration  and  he will acknowledge it was calculated to make the young traveller wish  himself safe at home  but  when i suspected  i wronged them  for after  admiring everything we had brought with us  more especially our  fowling pieces  which were very beautiful ones   they begged a little  tobacco  then retired to a distance from the hut which had been prepared  for our reception  and left us to take our supper uninterrupted  after  which they placed all our baggage in the hut  that we might be assured of  its safety     it proved a rainy  miserable night  and we were a large party  crowded  into a small  smoky hut  with a fire lighted in the middle  as  after  our supper  the natives  in order to have as much of our company as  possible  crowded it till it was literally crammed  however annoying this  might be  still i was recompensed by the novelty and picturesque  appearance of the scene  salvator rosa could not have conceived a finer  study of the horrible  a dozen men  of the largest and most athletic  forms  their cakahoos  or mat dresses  laid aside  and their huge limbs  exposed to the red glare of the fire  their faces rendered hideous by  being tattooed all over  showing by the firelight quite a bright blue   their eyes  which are remarkable for their fierce expression  all fixed  upon us  but with a look of good temper  co mingled with intense  curiosity  all my fears had by this time subsided  and  being master of  myself  i had leisure to study and enjoy the scene  we smoked a social  pipe with them  for they are all immoderately fond of tobacco   and i  then stretched myself down to sleep amidst all their chattering and  smoke     but all my attempts at slumber were fruitless  i underwent a simultaneous  attack of vermin of all descriptions  fleas  mosquitoes  and sand flies   which  beside their depredations on my person  made such a buzzing noise   that even the chattering of the natives could not drown it  or the smoke  from the fire or pipes drive them away           chapter viii     toilsome journey through the forest       next morning  at daybreak  we took leave of our hosts  and proceeded on  our journey  we had eight miles more of this thick forest to scramble  through  and this part we found considerably worse than that we had  traversed yesterday  the roots of trees covered the path in all  directions  rendering it necessary to watch every step we took  in order  to prevent being thrown down  the supple jacks  suspended and twining  from tree to tree  making in many places a complete net work  and while  we were toiling with the greatest difficulty through this miserable road   our natives were jogging on as comfortably as possible  use had so  completely accustomed them to it  that they sprung over the roots  and  dived under the supple jacks and branches  with perfect ease  while we  were panting after them in vain  the whole way was mountainous  the  climbing up  and then descending  was truly frightful  not a gleam of sky  was to be seen  all was a mass of gigantic trees  straight and lofty   their wide spreading branches mingling overhead  and producing throughout  the forest an endless darkness and unbroken gloom     after three or four hours of laborious struggling  we emerged from the  wood  and found ourselves upon an extensive plain  which  as far as the  eye could reach  appeared covered with fern  a small path lay before us   and this was our road  the new zealanders always travel on foot  one  after the other  or in indian file  their pathways are not more than a  foot wide  which to a european is most painful  but as the natives  invariably walk with the feet turned in  or pigeon toed  they feel no  inconvenience from the narrowness  when a traveller is once on the path   it is impossible for him to go astray  no other animal  except man  ever  traverses this country  and  his  track cannot be mistaken  since none  ever deviate from the beaten footpath  which was in consequence  in some  places  where the soil was light   worn so deep as to resemble a gutter  more than a road  we proceeded for many miles in this unsocial manner   unsocial  for it precludes all conversation  our natives occasionally  gave us a song  or  rather  dirge  in which they all joined chorus   having at length attained the summit of a hill  we beheld the bay of  islands  stretching out in the distance  and at sunset we arrived at the  kerikeri river  where there is a church missionary settlement      illustration  mission station  kerikeri            chapter ix     the missionary settlement at kerikeri       we had travelled all day through a country in which every object we saw  was of a character that reminded us forcibly of the savage community we  were with  occasionally we met groups of naked men  trotting along under  immense loads  and screaming their barbarous songs of recognition   sometimes we beheld an uncouthly carved figure  daubed over with red  ochre  and fixed in the ground  to give notice that one side of the road  was tabooed  an extraordinary contrast was now presented to our view  for  we came suddenly in front of a complete little english village  wreaths  of white smoke were rising from the chimneys  of neat weather boarded  houses  the glazed windows reflected the brilliant glow from the rays of  the setting sun  while herds of fat cattle were winding down the hills   lowing as they leisurely bent their steps toward the farm yard  it is  impossible for me to describe what i felt on contemplating a scene so  similar to those i had left behind me     according to the custom of this country  we fired our muskets  to warn  the inhabitants of the settlement of our approach  we arranged our  dresses in the best order we could  and proceeded towards the village  as  the report of our guns had been heard  groups of nondescripts came  running out to meet us  i could scarcely tell to what order of beings  they belonged  but on their near approach  i found them to be the new  zealand youths  who were settled with the missionaries  they were habited  in the most uncouth dresses imaginable  these pious men  certainly  have  no taste for the picturesque  they had obscured the finest human forms  under a seaman s huge clothing  boys not more than fifteen wore jackets  reaching to their knees  and buttoned up to the throat with great black  horn buttons  a coarse checked shirt  the collar of which spread half way  over their face  their luxuriant  beautiful hair was cut close off  and  each head was crammed into a close scotch bonnet     these half converted  or  rather  half  covered   youths  after rubbing  noses  and chattering with our guides  conducted us to the dwellings of  their masters  as i had a letter of introduction from one of their own  body  i felt not the slightest doubt of a kind reception  so we proceeded  with confidence  we were ushered into a house  all cleanliness and  comfort  all order  silence  and unsociability  after presenting my  letter to a grave looking personage  it had to undergo a private  inspection in an adjoining room  and the result was an invitation  to  stay and take a cup of tea   all that an abundant farm and excellent  grocer in england could supply were soon before us  each person of the  mission  as he appeared during our repast  was called aside  and i could  hear my own letter read and discussed by them  i could not help thinking   within myself  whether this was a way to receive a countryman at the  antipodes  no smile beamed upon their countenance  there were no  inquiries after news  in short  there was no touch of human sympathy   such as we  of the world  feel at receiving an englishman under our roof  in such a savage country as this     the chubby children who peeped at us from all corners  and the very  hearty appearance of their parents  plainly evidenced that theirs was an  excellent and thriving trade  we had a cold invitation to stay all night   but this the number of our party entirely precluded  so they lent us  their boat to convey us to the bay of islands  a distance of about  twenty five miles     as the night proved dark and stormy  and as our boat was crowded with  natives  our passage down the kerikeri river became both disagreeable and  dangerous  the river being filled with rocks  some under  and others just  above the water  we were obliged to keep a good look out  after  experiencing many alarms  we arrived safely at kororareka beach about  midnight  where an englishman of the name of johnstone gave us a shelter  in his hut           chapter x     the bay of islands       in the morning we beheld two vessels at anchor in the harbour  the  indian  whaler  of london  and the east india company s ship research   which latter ship had been cruising in search of the wreck of the vessels  under the command of la perouse  and had completely elucidated the  circumstances relating to that event  the bay of islands is surrounded by  lofty and picturesque hills  and is secured from all winds  it is full of  lovely coves  and a safe anchorage is to be found nearly all over it   added to this  a number of navigable rivers are for ever emptying  themselves into the bay  which is spotted with innumerable romantic  islands all covered with perpetual verdure     it is with peculiar interest that we look upon the spot where the  illustrious cook cast anchor after his discovery of this bay  some  unhappy quarrels with the natives occasioned much blood to be shed on  both sides  and for a long time caused this island to be looked upon with  horror  and avoided by all europeans  it was the courage and enterprise  of the crews of our south sea whalers who exhibited these interesting  islanders in their true character  and proved to the world that it was  quite as safe to anchor in the bay of islands as in the harbour of port  jackson           chapter xi     the massacre of the  boyd        since the time of cook  and other circumnavigators of that period  the  character of these people has undergone a thorough change  then it was  necessary when a ship anchored  that the boarding nettings should be up   and all the arms ready for immediate use  the principal object the chiefs  had in view seemed to be to lull the commanders into a fatal security   then to rush upon them  seize their vessel  and murder all the crew  too  often had they succeeded  and as often have they paid most dearly for  their treachery and cruelty  in the case of the ship boyd  though they  attained their object  they were as completely punished for their  perfidy  from their ignorance of the nature of powder  and the use of a  magazine  they blew up the ship  and vast numbers of the natives were  destroyed  besides this calamity  they brought down upon themselves the  vengeance of every vessel that visited these shores for a long period  afterwards  as the circumstances may not be generally known  mr  berry s  letter  relating the particulars of that melancholy  yet interesting  event  is here inserted                                         ship  city of edinburgh                                            lima  oct                  sir            i am very sorry to have the painful task of introducing myself to       you  with an account of the loss of your ship boyd  captain       thompson          towards the end of last year i was employed in the bay of       islands  new zealand  in procuring a cargo of spars for the cape       of good hope  about the middle of december the natives brought me       an account of a ship s being taken at whangaroa  a harbour about       fifty miles to the n w  at first we were disposed to doubt the       truth of this report  but it every day became more probable  from       the variety of circumstances they informed us of  and which were       so connected as appeared impossible for them to invent        accordingly  about the end of the month  when we had finished our       cargo  although it was a business of some danger  i determined to       go round           i set out with three armed boats  we experienced very bad       weather  and after a narrow escape were glad to return to the       ship  as we arrived in a most miserable condition  i had then       relinquished all idea of the enterprise  but having recruited my       strength and spirits  i was shocked at the idea of leaving any of       my countrymen in the hands of savages  and determined to make a       second attempt  we had this time better weather  and reached the       harbour without any difficulty  whangaroa is formed as       follows   first  a large outer bay  with an island at its       entrance  in the bottom of this bay is seen a narrow opening        which appears terminated at the distance of a quarter of a mile        but  upon entering it  it is seen to expand into two large       basins  at least as secure as any of the docks on the banks of       the thames  and capable of containing  i think  the whole british       navy  we found the wreck of the boyd in shoal water  at the top       of the harbour  a most melancholy picture of wanton mischief  the       natives had cut her cables  and towed her up the harbour till she       had grounded  and then set her on fire  and burnt her to the       water s edge  in her hold were seen the remains of her       cargo  coals  salted seal skins  and planks  her guns  iron        standards  etc   were lying on the top  having fallen in when her       decks were consumed           the cargo must have been very valuable  but it appears that the       captain  anxious to make a better voyage  had come to that port       for the purpose of filling up with spars for the cape of good       hope           not to tire you with the minutia of the business  i recovered       from the natives a woman  two children  and a boy of the name of       davies  one of your apprentices  who were the only survivors  i       found also the accompanying papers  which  i hope  may prove of       service to you  i did all this by gentle measures  and you will       admit that bloodshed and revenge would have answered no good       purpose  the ship was taken the third morning after her arrival        the captain had been rather too hasty in resenting some slight       theft  early in the morning the ship was surrounded by a great       number of canoes  and many natives gradually insinuated       themselves on board  tippahee  a chief of the bay of islands  and       who had been twice at port jackson  also arrived  he went into       the cabin  and  after paying his respects to the captain  begged       a little bread for his men  but the captain received him rather       slightingly  and desired him to go away  and not trouble him  as       he was busy           the proud old savage  who had been a constant guest at the       governor s table at port jackson  was highly offended at this       treatment  immediately left the cabin  and  after stamping a few       minutes on the deck  went into his canoe  after breakfast the       captain went on shore with four hands  and no other arms but his       fowling piece  from the account of the savages  as soon as he       landed they rushed upon him  he had only time to fire his piece        and it killed a child  as soon as the captain left the ship        tippahee  who remained alongside in his canoe  came again on       board  a number of sailors were repairing sails upon the quarter       deck  and the remainder were carelessly dispersed about  and       fifty of the natives were sitting on the deck  in a moment they       all started up  and each knocked his man on the head  a few ran       wounded below  and four or five escaped up the rigging  and in a       few seconds the savages had complete possession of the ship  the       boy davies escaped into the hold  where he lay concealed for       several days  till they were fairly glutted with human blood        when they spared his life  the woman says she was discovered by       an old savage  and that she moved him by her tears and embraces        that he  being a subordinate chief  carried her to tippahee  who       allowed him to spare her life  she says  that at this time the       deck was covered with human bodies  which they were employed in       cutting up  after which they exhibited a most horrid dance and       song in honour of their victory  and concluded by a hymn of       gratitude to their god           tippahee now took the speaking trumpet  and hailing the poor       wretches at the mast head  told them that he was now captain        and that they must in future obey his commands  he then ordered       them to unbend the sails  they readily complied  but when he       ordered them to come down they hesitated  but he enforced prompt       obedience by threatening to cut away the masts  when they came       down he received them with much civility  and told them he would       take care of them  he immediately ordered them into a canoe  and       sent them on shore  a few minutes after this the woman went on       shore with her deliverer  the first object that struck her view       was the dead bodies of these men  lying naked on the beach  as       soon as she landed a number of men started up  and marched       towards her with their patoo patoos  a number of women ran       screaming betwixt them  covered her with their clothes  and by       tears and entreaties saved her life           the horrid feasting on human flesh which followed would be too       shocking for description  the second mate begged his life at the       time of the general massacre  they spared him for a fortnight        and then killed and eat him  i think if the captain had received       tippahee with a little more civility  that he would have informed       him of his danger  and saved the ship  but that from being       treated in the manner i have mentioned  he entered into the plot       along with the others           i assure you it has been a most unpleasant thing for me to write       about  and i could only have been induced to do it from a sense       of duty  and a desire to give you all the information in my       power  which i suppose may be of some use                  i am  sir                        your obedient humble servant                                          alexander berry      considering mr  berry s limited acquaintance with these islanders  and  the horror of the scene before him  his is a good and an impartial  account  but facts which have been obtained subsequently have exonerated  the natives to a certain extent  by repeated conversations i have held  with several chiefs who were engaged in this dreadful affair  and from  information i procured at sydney  i have no doubt but that the captain  himself was the most in fault      illustration  whangaroa  scene of the  boyd  massacre      he was commissioned by the government of new south wales to land a native  chief named philip at new zealand  whom he subjected to a cruel and  impolitic punishment  this man  smarting from his stripes  and burning  with a desire to revenge his dishonourable treatment  excited all his  friends to the commission of that bloody massacre           chapter xii     the first settlement at kororareka       the tragic fate of the boyd s crew is now fast sinking into oblivion   and  like the islanders of hawaii  after the murder of cook  they seem to  wish to obliterate the remembrance of their disgraceful conduct by a kind  and friendly intercourse with our nation  the severe chastisement which  they have always received from us after a treacherous action  has proved  to them how little they gain by so debasing a line of conduct  and as  they are most anxious to possess many of our productions  they seem to  have come to a resolution to abandon their former system  which  if they  may not be sensible of the injustice of  they see is destructive to their  own interests  and now every chief is as solicitous for the safety of a  european vessel as he would have been formerly for its destruction     they have not only lost a portion of their ferocity  but also much of  their native simplicity of character  which  in all parts of the world   is so highly interesting a study for the traveller  their constant  intercourse with whalers  who are generally low  unpolished men  leaves  behind it a tinge of vulgarity  of which the native women retain the  largest portion  in many instances  they quite spoil their good looks  by  half adopting the european costume  those who are living in the  retirement of their own villages have a natural ease and elegance of  manner  which they soon lose after their introduction to our rough  sailors  i have seen a party of very handsome girls  just landing from  one of the whalers  their beautiful forms hid under old greasy red or  checked shirts  generally put on with the hind parts before  in some  cases the sailors  knowing their taste for finery  bring out with them   from london  old tawdry gowns  and fierce coloured ribands  and thus  equipped  they come on shore the most grotesque objects imaginable  each  highly delighted with her gaudy habiliments     kororareka beach  where we took up our residence  seemed the general  place of rendezvous for all europeans whom chance might bring into this  bay  at this time there were two large vessels lying at anchor within a  quarter of a mile of the shore  and i was informed there were sometimes  as many as twelve or thirteen     the spot is a most delightful one  being about three quarters of a mile  in extent  sheltered by two picturesque promontories  and possessing a  fine circular  firm  sandy beach  on which there is seldom much surf  so  that boats can at all times land and haul up  scattered amongst the  rushes and small bushes is seen a new zealand village  which at first  landing is scarcely perceptible  the huts being so low  some of them are  of english design  though of native workmanship  these are generally the  dwellings of some europeans  who are of so doubtful a character that it  would be difficult to guess to what order of society they belonged  previous to their being transplanted amongst these savages     i found a respectable body of scotch mechanics settled here  who came out  in the new zealand company s ship rosanna  and who determined to remain  at kororareka  their persevering industry as yet has been crowned with  success  and they seem well pleased with the prospects before them     here  these hardy sons of britain are employed in both carrying on and  instructing the wondering savage in various branches of useful art  here  the smith has erected his forge  and his sooty mansion is crowded by  curious natives  who voluntarily perform the hardest and most dirty work   and consider themselves fully recompensed by a sight of his mysterious  labours  every portion of which fills them with astonishment  here is  heard daily the sound of the sawpit  while piles of neat white planks  appear arranged on the beach  these laborious and useful scotchmen  interfere with no one  and pursue successfully their industrious career   without either requiring or receiving any assistance from home     but there is another class of europeans here  who are both useless and  dangerous  and these lower the character of the white people in the  estimation of the natives  these men are called  beach rangers   most of  whom have deserted from  or have been turned out of whalers for crimes   for which  had they been taken home and tried  they would have been  hanged  some few among them  having been too lazy to finish the voyage  they had begun  had deserted from their ships  and were then leading a  mean and miserable life amongst the natives     there is still a third class of our countrymen to be met with here  whose  downcast and sneaking looks proclaim them to be runaway convicts from new  south wales  these unhappy men are treated with derision and contempt by  all classes  and the new zealanders  being perfectly aware of their state  of degradation  refuse all intercourse with them  they are idle   unprincipled  and vicious in the extreme  and are much feared in the bay  of islands  for when by any means they obtain liquor  they prove  themselves most dangerous neighbours     my friend shand and myself were most comfortably situated  an intimate  friend of mine  captain duke  of the whaler the sisters  had  in  consequence of ill health  taken up his residence on shore while his  vessel completed her cruise  in his hut we found comfort and safety  and  from his information and advice we were enabled to avoid the advances of  all whom his experience had taught him were to be shunned     on terms of the closest intimacy  and with his hut adjoining that of my  friend captain duke  lived shulitea     or king george  as he styled  himself   a chief of great power  who controlled the whole of the  district where we were  we all felt grateful to him for his  manifestations of friendship  and at the same time were conscious of  enjoying a greater degree of security by his proximity  he was the first  chief who offered protection to  the white people   and he has never been  known to have broken his engagement  an unexpected and remarkable  instance of his adherence to their interests  in spite of temptation   took place a few years since  which i deem worthy of relation here     the ship brompton  in endeavouring to work out of the bay  by some  accident got on shore  and finally became a complete wreck  this fine  vessel  with a valuable cargo on board  lay helpless on the beach  and  the crew and passengers expected nothing less than plunder and  destruction  the natives from the interior  hearing of the circumstance   hastened down in vast numbers to participate in the general pillage  but  king george summoned all his warriors to his aid  and with this party  placed himself between the wreck and those who came to plunder it  i was  informed by several who were present at the time  that  after declaring  that  not an article should be taken till himself and all his party were  destroyed   he advanced  and thus explained his reasons for protecting  the strangers and their property        you   said king george   come from the interior  all of you think only  of what you can get  without considering the consequences  which  indeed   are of little import to you  living  as you do  out of reach of the  reproaches and vengeance of the white men  but look how differently i am  situated  i live on the beach  this bay is my residence  i invite the  white men to come and trade here under the promise of my protection  they  come  several years of profitable trading have passed between us  king  george  they say  is a good man  now an accident has befallen one of  their ships in my territory  what must king george do  why  he  must   assist them  which he  will  do  and defend them against everyone who  shall attempt to injure them   in consequence of this speech  and his  exertions  not a thing was taken from the wreck by the savages who had  collected for that purpose     footnotes      footnote    the chief referred to by mr  earle as shulitea  or king  george  was a noted bay of islands chief named whareumu  he was killed in  a fight with the hokianga tribes  in march         see appendix             chapter xiii     maori non progressiveness       this anecdote proves that king george and his people possessed feelings  of honour and generosity  which  if properly cultivated  might lead to  the most happy results  from the length of time these people have been  known to the europeans  it might naturally be expected that great changes  would have taken place in their habits  manners  arts  and manufactures   but this is not the case  their huts are of the same diminutive  proportions as described by captain cook  their clothing and mats  their  canoes and paddles  are precisely the same as when that navigator  described them  when they can obtain english tools  they use them in  preference to their own  still their work is not better done  the only  material change that has taken place is in their mode of warfare     the moment the new zealanders became acquainted with the nature of  firearms  their minds were directed but to one point  namely  to become  possessed of them  after many ingenious and treacherous attempts to  obtain these oft coveted treasures  and which  for the most part  ended  in their defeat  they had recourse to industry  and determined to create  commodities which they might fairly barter for these envied muskets   potatoes were planted  hogs were reared  and flax prepared  not for their  own use or comfort  but to exchange with the europeans for firearms   their plans succeeded  and they have now fairly possessed themselves of  those weapons  which at first made us so formidable in their eyes  and as  they are in constant want of fresh supplies of ammunition  i feel  convinced it will always be their wish to be on friendly terms with us   for the purpose of procuring these desirable stores  i have not heard of  a single instance in which they have turned these arms against us  though  they are often grossly insulted     in their combats with each other  firearms are used with dreadful effect   the whole soul of a new zealander seems absorbed in the thoughts of war   every action of his life is influenced by it  and to possess weapons  which give him such a decided superiority over those who have only their  native implements of offence  he will sacrifice everything  the value  attached by them to muskets  and their ceaseless desire to possess them   will prove a sufficient security to foreigners who enter their harbours   or remain on their coasts  as i know  from experience  that the new  zealanders will rather put up with injuries than run the risk of  offending those who manufacture and barter with them such inestimable  commodities           chapter xiv     a mission settlement       a few days after my arrival in the bay  i crossed to the opposite side   to visit the church missionary settlement  and to deliver a letter of  introduction i had to one of the members  here  on a beautiful bank  with  a delightful beach in front  and the entrance of the bay open to them   the clear and blue expanse of water speckled over with fertile islands   reside these comfortable teachers of the gospel  the name they have given  this spot is  marsden vale   they very soon gave us to understand they  did not wish for our acquaintance  and their coldness and inhospitality   i must acknowledge  created in my mind a thorough dislike to them  the  object of the mission  as it was first planned  might have been attained   and might have proved highly beneficial to the new zealanders  but as it  is now conducted  no good result can be expected from it  any man of  common sense must agree with me  that a savage can receive but little  benefit from having the abstruse points of the gospel preached to him  if  his mind is not prepared to receive them  this is the plan adopted here   and nothing will convince these enthusiasts that it is wrong  or induce  them to change it for one more agreeable to the dictates of reason     upon inquiring who and what these men were  i found that the greater part  of them were hardy mechanics  not well educated clergymen   whom the  benevolent and well intentioned people of england had sent out in order  to teach the natives the importance of  different trades   a most  judicious arrangement  and which ought to be the foundation of all  missions  what could be a more gratifying sight than groups of these  athletic savages  toiling at the anvil or the saw  erecting for  themselves substantial dwellings  thus leading them by degrees to know  and to appreciate the comforts resulting from peaceful  laborious  and  useful occupations  then  while they felt sincere gratitude for services  rendered them  at their leisure hours  and on certain days   these   missionaries should attempt to expound to them  in as simple a manner as  possible  the nature of revealed religion     in new zealand  the  mechanic  missionary only carries on his trade till  he has every comfort around him  his house finished  his garden fenced   and a strong stockade enclosing all  to keep off the  pagan  savages   this done  then commences the easy task of preaching  they collect a few  ragged urchins of natives  whom they teach to read and write their own  language  the english tongue being forbidden  and when these children  return to their families  they are despised by them  as being effeminate  and useless     i once saw a sturdy blacksmith in the prime of life  sitting in the midst  of a group of savages  attempting to expound to them the mysteries of our  holy redemption  perplexing his own brains  as well as those of his  auditors  with the most incomprehensible and absurd opinions  how much  better would he have been employed in teaching them how to weld a piece  of iron  or to make a nail     what causes much disapprobation here  is the contemptuous manner in which  they treat their own countrymen  as they receive most of them on the  outside of their stockade fence     on our return from marsden vale  our savage friends laughed heartily at  us  they had warned us of the reception we should meet with  and their  delight at seeing us again formed a strange contrast to that of their  christian teachers  whose inhospitable dwellings we determined never to  reenter           chapter xv     a visit from hongi       a few days after my visit to the missionaries  while we were busily  employed in constructing our huts  assisted by about fifty natives  on a  sudden a great commotion took place amongst them  each left his work and  ran to his hut  and immediately returned armed with both musket and  cartouch box  apparently all the arms in the village were mustered  and  all seemed ready for immediate use  on inquiring into the cause of all  these war like preparations  i was informed that hongi and his chief men  were crossing the bay in several large war canoes  and though he was  considered as a friend and ally  yet  as he was a man of such desperate  ambition  and consummate cunning  it was considered necessary to receive  him under arms  which he might take either as a compliment  or as a proof  of how well they were aware of the guest they were receiving     this man  hongi  was a most extraordinary character  and a person i had  long had a great curiosity to see  his daring and savage deeds having  often been the subject of conversation in new south wales  in his own  country he was looked upon as invulnerable and invincible  in the year       he had visited england  during which he had been honoured by having  a personal interview with george the fourth  and had received from his  majesty several valuable presents  amongst others  were a superb suit of  chain armour  and a splendid double barrelled gun  from possessing these  arms  so far superior to any of his neighbours  he looked upon himself  as impossible to be conquered  and commenced a career of warfare and  destruction on all his enemies  and nearly exterminated them  his friends  called him  a god   and his enemies feared him as  a devil   last year   hongi made war upon  and totally annihilated  the tribe who had fifteen  years previously attacked and murdered the crew of the boyd  he had long  determined to take revenge for that treacherous action  as he always  styled himself  the friend of the english   after this  he removed his  residence  and took possession of the conquered district  but in this his  last battle he had to fight without his invulnerable coat of mail  his  slaves having stolen it and gone over with it to the enemy  his people  were now confirmed in their superstition respecting its being proof  against shot  by his having received during the combat a bullet in the  breast  from the effects of which he is fast sinking into the grave  his  companions related the following extraordinary anecdote concerning him  after he received this wound  which proves his great presence of mind     his party were retreating  and the enemy were charging him vigorously   hongi stood alone when he received the bullet  he did not fall  immediately  and the enemy were eagerly running up to despatch him  when  he roused all his energies  and shouted aloud for the two hundred chiefs   who lay concealed  to rush forward and fall on  the foe  hearing this   paused  when about a dozen chiefs  and indeed  as hongi well knew  all  that he had  suddenly made their appearance  this caused a panic  they  turned about  the pursued became the pursuers  and nearly the whole tribe  were destroyed           chapter xvi     interview with the great maori conqueror       he landed about a mile from the village  and we lost no time in procuring  an interpreter  with whom we went instantly to pay our respects to this  celebrated conqueror     we found him and his party  his slaves preparing their morning repast   the scene altogether was highly interesting  in a beautiful bay   surrounded by high rocks and overhanging trees  the chiefs sat in mute  contemplation  their arms piled up in regular order on the beach  hongi   not only from his high rank  but in consequence of his wound being  toboo d  or rendered holy   sat apart from the rest  their richly  ornamented war canoes were drawn up on the strand  some of the slaves  were unlading stores  others were kindling fires  to me it almost seemed  to realise some of the passages of homer  where he describes the wanderer  ulysses and his gallant band of warriors  we approached the chief  and  paid our respects to him  he received us kindly  and with a dignified  composure  as one accustomed to receive homage  his look was emaciated   but so mild was the expression of his features  that he would have been  the last man i should have imagined accustomed to scenes of bloodshed and  cruelty  but i soon remarked  that when he became animated in  conversation  his eyes sparkled with fire  and their expression changed   demonstrating that it only required his passions to be roused to exhibit  him under a very different aspect  his wife and daughter were permitted  to sit close to him  to administer to his wants  no others being allowed  so to do  on account of his taboo     he was arrayed in a new blanket  which completely enveloped his figure   leaving exposed his highly tattooed face  and head profusely covered with  long  black  curling hair  adorned with a quantity of white feathers  he  was altogether a very fine study  and  with his permission  i made a  sketch of him  and also one including the whole group  finding we were  newcomers  he asked us a variety of questions  and  among others  our  opinion of his country  his remarks were judicious and sensible  and he  seemed much pleased with our admiration of his territory  i produced a  bottle of wine that i had brought with me  and his wife supplied him with  a few glasses  which seemed to revive and animate him     we were then invited to join him in a trip in one of his canoes  in which  was placed a bed for him to recline upon  his wife seated herself close  to him  while his daughter  a very pretty  interesting girl about fifteen  years of age  took a paddle in her hand  which she used with the greatest  dexterity  i took the liberty of presenting her with a bracelet  with  which she seemed highly delighted  when hongi  perceiving that i was in a  giving mood  pointed to his beard  and asked me for a razor  fortunately   i had put one in my pocket on setting out  and i now presented it to  him  by which gifts we continued on terms of great sociability and  friendship  after a pleasant cruise with this  to us  extraordinary  family  and contriving to make ourselves pretty well understood  we  returned about the close of the day  and landed at the bay  all the  natives were much delighted at our confidence in them  and we were  equally gratified by their hospitality           chapter xvii     a maori welcome       i was much amused with the punctilios used in the visit of ceremony paid  to king george  hongi  accompanied by about a dozen of his chiefs   advanced towards our settlement  leaving their guns and hatchets behind  them  as they approached  all our tribe discharged their pieces in the  air  when they met  all rubbed noses  a ceremony never to be dispensed  with on formal occasions   they were then conducted by king george to his  huts on the beach  and in the enclosure in front of them the warriors  squatted on the ground  hongi  being tabooed  or under the immediate  protection of their atua  or god  still sat apart  then the mother of  george  called tururo  or the queen  and who is regarded quite as a sybil  by the whole tribe  approached hongi with the greatest respect and  caution  and seated herself some paces from his feet  she then began   with a most melancholy cadence  her eyes streaming with tears and fixed  upon the ground   the song of welcome  all their meetings of ceremony or  friendship begin with the shedding of copious floods of tears  and as  hongi s visit was such an unhoped for and unexpected honour  so much  greater in proportion was the necessity for their lamentations  this  woeful song lasted half an hour  and all the assembly were soon in tears   and though at first i was inclined to turn it into ridicule  i was soon  in the same state myself  the pathetic strain  and the scene altogether   was most impressive  as the song proceeded  i was informed of the nature  of the subject  which was a theme highly calculated to affect all  present  she began by complimenting the wounded warrior  deploring the  incurable state of his wound  and regretting that god was wanting him   and was about so soon to take him from his friends  then she recounted  some of his most celebrated deeds of valour  naming and deploring the  number of his friends who had fallen bravely in the wars  and lamenting  that the enemies who had killed them were still living  this part seemed  to affect them powerfully  and when tururo ceased her song  being quite  exhausted  they all rose  thus demonstrating their respect and  approbation     this was followed by a general attack upon the good things king george  had prepared for them  the slaves came flocking in  bearing baskets of  hot kumaras  potatoes  and fish  i observed their tears had not spoiled  their appetites  they ate voraciously  after having done great honour to  the feast  they all started on their feet for a dance  which lasted a  long while  and with which they concluded the evening     the dances of all savage nations are beautiful  but those of the new  zealanders partake also of the horrible  the regularity of their  movements is truly astonishing  and the song  which always accompanies a  dance  is most harmonious  they soon work themselves up to a pitch of  frenzy  the distortions of their face and body are truly dreadful  and  fill the mind with horror  love and war are the subjects of their songs  and dances  but the details of the latter passion are by far the most  popular among them  i was astonished to find that their women mixed in  the dance indiscriminately with the men  and went through all those  horrid gestures with seemingly as much pleasure as the warriors  themselves     the next morning i was awakened  at daybreak  by the most dismal sounds i  had ever heard  i started up  and found it proceeded from the tribes  parting with each other  they had divided themselves into little parties   each forming a circle  and were crying most piteously  and cutting their  flesh as a cook would score pork for roasting  on such occasions each is  armed with a sharp shell  or  if he can possibly obtain so valuable a  prize  a piece of a broken glass bottle  all were streaming with tears  and blood  while hongi and his friends embarked in their large and  richly ornamented canoes  and sailed from our beach  after his departure   i soon discovered that  notwithstanding their apparent affection  king  george and his friends were most happy their visitors had left them  and  that it was more the dread of hongi s power  than love for him  that  induced them to treat him with such respect and homage           chapter xviii     excursions in the interior       i made several excursions into the interior  and each confirmed me in the  good opinion i had formed of the natives  i felt myself quite safe  amongst them  there is a great peculiarity in rambling through this  country  namely  the total absence of quadrupeds  there are abundance of  birds  which are so numerous at times as almost to darken the air  many  of them possessing very sweet notes  and wild ducks  teal  etc   cover  the various streams  wherever i went i did not discover any grass  almost  every part being covered either with fern or flax  the former yielding  the natives their principal article of food  and the latter their  clothing  to this dearth of animals may be attributed the chief cause of  their ferocity and propensity to cannibalism     in most uncivilised countries the natives use their arms against the wild  animals of the forest  the dangers and difficulties they encounter in  overcoming them form a kind of prelude to war  and perfect them in the  use of their weapons  the rifle of the north american indian would never  be so much dreaded did he not depend upon its produce for his  subsistence  i have myself  during my travels through north america  had  many opportunities of witnessing the certain aim they take both with the  arrow and the bullet  while those in the southern parts of that vast  continent  who depend on taking the wild cattle  acquire  by constant  practice  an equal dexterity with the  lassoo   which those who have not  witnessed it could scarcely imagine possible  the new zealander  while  handling a musket  is quite in a state of trepidation  and though it is  his darling weapon he seems always afraid of it  and is never sure of his  aim till he is quite close to his object  i have mentioned this fact to  several europeans who had accompanied various tribes to battle  and they  all informed me they made a sad bungling use of the musket  their aim  would be surer if they had large and ferocious animals to hunt or contend  with  there is another circumstance that operates against their acquiring  skill in the use of the gun  they are so fond of cleaning  scrubbing  and  taking them to pieces  that in a short time the locks become loose  the  screws are injured  and they are soon rendered entirely useless  to the  great surprise and dismay of their owners  who are constantly pestering  the europeans by bringing them  sick  muskets  as they call them  to look  at  and put to rights  and are quite surprised that we  cannot make them  well again   they cannot be made to comprehend that every white man does  not know how to make a musket  or  at least  to repair it           chapter xix     entertained by maori women       on the   th november we took our departure from the bay  as we had to  return to hokianga  where we had left our brig  and it was only under a  promise of making a speedy return  and remaining longer with them  that  our savage friends would suffer us to leave them  we expected to reach  the kerikeri river before night  but in this we were disappointed  it at  length became quite dark  and the ebb tide making against us  rendered  further advance impossible  we had to seek some place of shelter for the  night  and not a hut was visible  while we were debating on what was best  to be done  we observed a light from the shore  and made for it  but  it  being low water  our boat stuck fast in the slime long before we reached  the banks  we were  consequently  obliged to wade knee deep through the  slippery mud  we soon discovered a party of women sitting round a fire  made in the midst of the swamp  they had come here for the purpose of  procuring shell fish  and as they are never very fastidious about shelter  or dry beds  they had determined  according to their usual custom  to  pass the night where they had been occupied during the day  this sort of  bivouac i found excessively uncomfortable  the moment we were seated the  water began to ooze out an inch or two all round us  we sought in vain  for a dry place  for we were enveloped in darkness  and surrounded by  rushes and flags six or seven feet high  but  being very much fatigued   we slept  notwithstanding the misery of a wet bed  with a cloud of fog  for curtains  i did not wake till one of the women gave me a good shake   and informed me that the day was well up  they had prepared us a  breakfast of hot shell fish  which they had caught the preceding day  and  they all seemed delighted by our eating heartily of them  as we had some  biscuits in our boat  we sent for them  and gave our  fair founders of  the feast  a share  and we were all very sociable and merry  when we left  them  as it was again low water  the women carried us to our boat  and  took their leave of us amidst peals of laughter  this was another proof  to me that the english are quite safe  though travelling unguarded   amongst these people           chapter xx     loading spars at hokianga       about nine the next morning we reached the kerikeri river  and  it being  sunday  the members of the mission met us on landing  and used all their  endeavours to prevent our travelling on that day  but  independent of the  urgent necessity of our reaching hokianga  the captain of our vessel  who  was with us  being particularly anxious to return on board  we continued  our journey  and at night came to a bivouac in a dense wood  so that we  now had the luxury of stretching our weary limbs on dry ground  the next  day  as we journeyed towards the river  we fell in with all our old  friends  who inquired into the particulars of our adventures  and seemed  highly delighted at our return     we found  all right  on board the brig  but as she was chartered to go to  tongataboo i and my friend shand determined to remain at new zealand till  her return  our principal difficulty seemed to be which side of the  island we should make choice of for a dwelling place  when it became  known to the natives that we intended to remain with them  several chiefs  came and offered us their protection  and each would have built us a  house  but we preferred making our sojourn at the bay of islands  we were  often at a loss how to evade the kind importunities of our savage hosts  without giving them offence   is not our country as good as  theirs     are you not as safe amongst us     are we not as willing and  as capable of protecting you as shulitea   these were the arguments they  used  and  finally  we were obliged to inform them that we had a friend  and countryman  captain duke  settled on the other side  who was  preparing a house for our reception  on being informed of this  circumstance they consented to part with us  though evidently with great  reluctance     while we lay here the ship harmony  of london  captain middleton  arrived  from sydney for a cargo of spars  so large a vessel entering the port put  the whole district into commotion  and when the chiefs understood the  nature of her wants  and had seen the fine double barrelled guns and  store of powder to be given as payment for the wished for freight  they  hastened to the woods  and the axe was soon laid to the roots of the  trees  i saw them pursuing their laborious employ with alacrity  in a few  days a sufficient number of fine logs came floating down the river to  load the ship  and they were all cleared in a workmanlike manner  ready  to stow away  the chief things to induce these people to work are  firearms and powder  these are two stimulants to their industry which  never fail           chapter xxi     death of a great chief       a few days after our return to hokianga we received intelligence that a  rowa  the father of mooetara  and the eldest chief in the district  was  dead  these deaths  when they occur among men of rank  are generally  accompanied by some horrible scenes of butchery among their slaves  a  common custom among all savages  but practised here  i was informed  with  peculiar cruelty  we went on shore to witness the ceremony of a rowa s  lying in state  hoping at the same time that our presence might induce  them to dispense with some of those barbarous cruelties which generally  accompany their funeral rites  we had  indeed  every reason to think we  had conjectured rightly  for nothing of the kind took place  which was  considered by all as a circumstance somewhat remarkable  a great  concourse of savages had assembled all round the village of the deceased  chief  and there was a tremendous firing of muskets  but no particular  marks of grief  i spoke to mooetara  and requested  as a favour  if it  were not breaking through their established rules  that he would conduct  me to the body of his father  he accordingly led me to the outside of the  village  and under a rude hut  constructed for the purpose  lay the body  of the deceased chief  closely covered up with mats  leaving only part of  the face and head exposed  in his hair was stuck a profusion of long  white feathers  by way of ornament  two women  whom i understood were his  wives  sat close to the corpse  they were painted all over with red  ochre  and seemed to perform the parts of chief mourners  these kept up a  low moaning noise  and occasionally whisked off the flies from the face  of the deceased  the women  the corpse  the hut  and the ground for some  space round them  were all strictly tapued  some bundles of fish  and  some calabashes filled with oil  were left close by the body  intended  for his consumption during his passage to the next world     i imagine that one reason of no outrage having been committed during this  solemn occasion was our brig being on the point of sailing  and previous  to her departure a great deal of traffic was expected to be carried on  with the natives  for there was still a considerable quantity of muskets  undisposed of  and i think  in this instance  avarice overcame filial  affection  the minds of the chief s family being so intent upon obtaining  good bargains  that they had not time to sit and mourn over their  departed parent  nor to work themselves up into a paroxysm of passion  sufficiently violent to cause them to murder their slaves  this afforded  me a convincing proof that as soon as they are occupied by commerce  or  the useful arts  their barbarous rites will gradually be discontinued   and will speedily cease altogether     our brig having sailed  we were again alone with these wild yet  interesting people  we expected our stay might be about six months  and  had provided a stock in trade  consisting of a barrel of powder  half a  dozen muskets  some fish hooks  and a quantity of tobacco  everything we  possessed we delivered into the hands of the natives  who accounted to  us for the stock thus entrusted to their management with the most  scrupulous exactness  nothing can be fairer than their mode of bartering  with the europeans  the prices are fixed  ten large hogs  or     baskets  of potatoes  about a ton and a half   are given for a musket  for small  articles  such as fish  indian corn  or fruits  the ready money are  fish hooks and tobacco  as we were now about to become inhabitants of new  zealand  it became necessary that we should be well acquainted with the  particulars of their methods of  doing business   and that we should  apply ourselves diligently to the study of the language  which we  acquired much more readily than i had anticipated           chapter xxii     brutal murder of a wife       a few days after the departure of the brig i witnessed a specimen of  their summary method of executing justice  a chief  resident in the  village  had proof of the infidelity of one of his wives  and  being  perfectly sure of her guilt  he took his patoo patoo  or stone hatchet   and proceeded to his hut  where this wretched woman was employed in  household affairs  without mentioning the cause of his suspicion  or once  upbraiding her  he deliberately aimed a blow at her head  which killed  her on the spot  and  as she was a slave  he dragged the body to the  outside of the village  and there left it to be devoured by the dogs  the  account of this transaction was soon brought to us  and we proceeded to  the place to request permission to bury the body of the murdered woman   which was immediately granted  accordingly  we procured a couple of  slaves  who assisted us to carry the corpse down to the beach  where we  interred it in the most decent manner we could     this was the second murder i was very nearly a witness to since my  arrival  and the indifference with which each had been spoken of induced  me to believe that such barbarities were events of frequent occurrence   yet the manners of all seemed kind and gentle towards each other  but  infidelity in a wife is never forgiven here  and  in general  if the  lover can be taken  he also is sacrificed along with the adulteress   truth obliges me to confess that  notwithstanding these horrors staring  them in the face  they will  if opportunity offers  indulge in an  intrigue           chapter xxiii     another journey to bay of islands       as there were two roads across to the bay of islands  and i was anxious  to see as much of the country as possible  i determined that my second  journey should be by the longest route  i set off  accompanied only by a  native boy to carry a small portmanteau and to serve me as a guide  as   on my former journey  we travelled many miles through thick tangled  forests  fatiguing beyond description  in the midst of our toilsome  progress  night frequently overtook us  then  by means of my  fowling piece  i procured a light  the boy made a fire  and we passed the  night in this vast wilderness  far from the habitation of any human  being  at daybreak we resumed our journey  and at length  about ten  o clock  we emerged from the wood  and entered upon extensive plains   these were not naked deserts  similar to the ones i had passed through on  my former route  but were diversified with bush and brake  with a number  of small villages scattered in various directions  at mid day we arrived  at what in new zealand is considered a town of great size and importance   called ty a my  it is situated on the sides of a beautiful hill  the top  surmounted by a pa  in the midst of a lonely and extensive plain  covered  with plantations of indian corn  kumara and potatoes  this is the  principal inland settlement  and  in point of quiet beauty and  fertility  it equalled any place i had ever seen in the various countries  i have visited  its situation brought forcibly to my remembrance the  scenery around canterbury     we found the village totally deserted  all the inhabitants being employed  in their various plantations  they shouted to us as we passed  thus  bidding us welcome  but did not leave their occupations to receive us  to  view the cultivated parts of this country from an eminence a person might  easily imagine himself in a civilised land  for miles around the village  of ty a my nothing but beautiful green fields present themselves to the  eye  the exact rows in which they plant their indian corn would do credit  to a first rate english farmer  and the way in which they prepare the  soil is admirable  the greatest deficiency which i observed in the  country around me was the total absence of fences  and this defect  occasions the natives a great deal of trouble  which might very easily be  avoided  hogs are the principal part of their wealth  with which  at all  times  they can traffic with vessels touching at their ports  these  animals  consequently  are of the utmost importance to them  but during  the growth of their crops  the constant watching the hogs require to keep  them out of the plantations consumes more time than would effectually  fence in their whole country  but i have no doubt  as they already begin  to follow our advice and adopt our plans  they will soon see the utility  of fencing in their land  i have at various times held many conversations  with different chiefs on this subject  all of whom have acknowledged the  propriety of so doing     a few miles after leaving this beautiful village we came to a spot  covered with heaps of cinders and hillocks of volcanic matter  i found  all these hillocks small craters  but none of them  burning  and for  miles our road lay through ashes and lava  these fires must have been  extinguished many ages since  as there is not the slightest tradition  among any of the natives of their ever having been burning     after passing over this lava  our journey lay through a very swampy  country  intersected with streams  i got completely wearied with  stripping to wade through them  so that at length i plunged in clothes  and all  at the close of a most fatiguing day s march  we arrived in  sight of the bay  having travelled over an extent of about fifty miles  since the morning  no canoe being in sight  and we being too distant to  make signals to our brig  we had to pass another night in bivouac on a  part of the beach called waitangi  and as it did not rain we slept pretty  comfortably  the next morning i procured a canoe  and went on board our  vessel     the day following the brig took her final departure from new zealand  and  we bade farewell to captain kent  we now formally placed ourselves under  the protection of king george  who seemed highly pleased with his charge   and in a few days three good houses were ready for our reception  one for  ourselves  a second for our stores  and a third for our servants  but our  pleasant prospects were soon obscured by a circumstance totally  unexpected  which placed us in a most critical situation  and which we  had every reason to fear would lead to our total destruction           chapter xxiv     visit of a war party       i was roused one morning at daybreak by my servant running in with the  intelligence that a great number of war canoes were crossing the bay  as  king george had told us but the evening before that he expected a visit  from ta ri ah  a chief of the tribe called ngapuhis  whose territory lay  on the opposite side of the bay  and given us to understand that ta ri ah  was a man not to be trusted  and therefore feared some mischief might  happen if he really came  the sight of these war canoes naturally caused  us considerable alarm  and we sincerely wished that the visit was over     we dressed ourselves with the utmost expedition  and walked down to the  beach  the landing of these warriors was conducted with a considerable  degree of order  and could i have divested myself of all ideas of danger  i should have admired the sight excessively  all our new zealand  friends  the tribe of shulitea  were stripped naked  their bodies were  oiled  and all were completely armed  their muskets were loaded  their  cartouch boxes were fastened round their waists  and their patoo patoos  were fixed to their wrists  their hair was tied up in a tight knot at the  top of their heads  beautifully ornamented with feathers of the  albatross  as the opposite party landed  ours all crouched on the ground   their eyes fixed on their visitors  and perfectly silent  when the  debarkation was completed i observed the chief  ta ri ah  put himself at  their head  and march towards us with his party formed closely and  compactly  and armed with muskets and paddles  when they came very near  they suddenly stopped  our party continued still mute  with their  firelocks poised ready for use  for the space of a few minutes all was  still  each party glaring fiercely on the other  and they certainly  formed one of the most beautiful and extraordinary pictures i had ever  beheld  the foreground was formed by a line of naked savages  each  resting on one knee  with musket advanced  their gaze fixed on the  opposite party  their fine  broad  muscular backs contrasting with the  dark foliage in front  and catching the gleam of the rising sun  the  strangers were clothed in the most grotesque manner imaginable  some  armed  some naked  some with long beards  others were painted all over  with red ochre  every part of each figure was quite still  except the  rolling and glaring of their eyes on their opponents  the background was  formed by the beach  and a number of their beautiful war canoes dancing  on the waves  while  in the distance  the mountains on the opposite side  of the bay were just tinged with the varied and beautiful colours of the  sun  then rising in splendour from behind them     the stillness of this extraordinary scene did not last long  the ngapuhis  commenced a noisy and discordant song and dance  yelling  jumping  and  making the most hideous faces  this was soon answered by a loud shout  from our party  who endeavoured to outdo the ngapuhis in making horrible  distortions of their countenances  then succeeded another dance from our  visitors  after which our friends made a rush  and in a sort of rough  joke set them running  then all joined in a pell mell sort of encounter   in which numerous hard blows were given and received  then all the party  fired their pieces in the air  and the ceremony of landing was thus  deemed completed  they then approached each other  and began rubbing  noses  and those who were particular friends cried and lamented over each  other     the slaves now commenced the labour of making fires to cook the morning  meal  while the chiefs  squatting down  formed a ring  or  rather  an  oblong circle  on the ground  then one at a time rose up  and made long  speeches  which they did in a manner peculiar to themselves  the speaker   during his harangue  keeps running backwards and forwards within the  oblong space  using the most violent but appropriate gesticulation  so  expressive  indeed  of the subject on which he is speaking  that a  spectator who does not understand their language can form a tolerable  idea as to what the affair is then under debate  the orator is never  interrupted in his speech  but  when he finishes and sits down  another  immediately rises up and takes his place  so that all who choose have an  opportunity of delivering their sentiments  after which the assembly  breaks up     though the meeting of these hostile tribes had thus ended more amicably  than king george and his party could have expected  it was easily to be  perceived that the ngapuhis were determined on executing some atrocity or  depredations before their return  they accordingly pretended to recollect  some old offence committed by the english settlers at the other end of  the beach  they proceeded thither  and first attacked and broke open the  house of a blacksmith  and carried off every article it contained  they  then marched to the residence of an english captain  who was in england    and plundered it of everything that could be taken away  and afterwards  sent word they intended to return to our end of the beach  our fears were  greatly increased by finding that our friends were not sufficiently  strong to protect us from the superior force of the ngapuhis  and our  chief  george  being himself  we supposed  conscious of his inability   had left us to depend upon our own resources           chapter xxv     burned out of house and home       we now called a council of war of all the europeans settled here  and it  was unanimously resolved that we should protect and defend our houses and  property  and fortify our position in the best way we could  captain duke  had in his possession four twelve pounders  and these we brought in front  of the enclosure in which our huts were situated  and were all entirely  employed in loading them with round and grape shot  and had made them all  ready for action  when  to our consternation and dismay  we found we had  a new and totally unexpected enemy to contend with  by some accident one  of our houses was in flames  our situation was now perilous in the  extreme  the buildings  the work of english carpenters  were constructed  of dry rushes and well seasoned wood  and this was one of a very  respectable size  and we had hoped  in a very few days  would be finished  fit for our removing into     for some seconds we stood in mute amazement  not knowing to which point  to direct our energies  as the cry of  fire  was raised  groups of  natives came rushing from all directions upon our devoted settlement   stripping off their clothes  and yelling in the most discordant pitch of  voice  i entered the house  and brought out one of my trunks  but on  attempting to return a second time i found it filled with naked savages   tearing everything to pieces  and carrying away whatever they could lay  their hands upon  the fierce raging of the flames  the heat from the  fire  the yells of the men  and the shrill cries of the women  formed   altogether  a horrible combination  added to all this was the  mortification of seeing all our property carried off in different  directions  without the least possibility of our preventing it  the tribe  of the ngapuhis  who  when the fire began  were at the other end of the  beach  left their operations in that quarter and poured down upon us to  share in the general plunder  never shall i forget the countenance of the  chief  as he rushed forward at the head of his destroying crew  he was  called  the giant   and he was well worthy of the name  being the tallest  and largest man i had ever seen  he had an immense bushy black beard  and  grinned exultingly when he saw the work of destruction proceeding with  such rapidity  and kept shouting loudly to his party to excite them to  carry off all they could     a cask containing seventy gallons of rum now caught fire and blew up with  a terrible explosion  and  the wind freshening considerably  huge volumes  of smoke and flame burst out in every direction  two of our houses were  so completely enveloped that we had given up all hopes of saving them   the third  which was a beautifully carved tapued one  some little  distance from the others  and which we had converted into a store and  magazine  was now the only object of our solicitude and terror  for   besides the valuable property of various kinds which were deposited  within it  it contained several barrels of gunpowder  it was in vain we  attempted to warn the frantic natives to retire from the vicinity of this  danger  at length we persuaded about a dozen of the most rational to  listen while we explained to them the cause of our alarm  and they  immediately ascended to the roof  where  with the utmost intrepidity and  coolness  they kept pouring water over the thatch  thus lessening the  probability of an immediate explosion  about this time we noticed the  reappearance of king george  which circumstance rekindled our hopes  he  was armed with a thick stick  which he laid heavily on the backs of such  of his subjects as were running away with our property  thus forcing them  to relinquish their prizes  and to lay them down before his own mansion   where all was safe  by this means a great deal was recollected  the fire  was now nearly extinguished  but our two really tolerably good houses  were reduced to a heap of smoking ruins  and the greater part of what  belonged to us was taken away by the ngapuhis     this calamity had made us acquainted with another of their barbarous  customs  which is  whenever a misfortune happens to a community  or an  individual  every person  even the friends of his own tribe  fall upon  and strip him of all he has remaining  as an unfortunate fish  when  struck by a harpoon  is instantly surrounded and devoured by his  companions  so in new zealand  when a chief is killed  his former friends  plunder his widow and children  and they  in revenge  ill use and even  murder their slaves  thus one misfortune gives birth to various  cruelties  during the fire  our allies proved themselves the most adroit  and active thieves imaginable  though previously to that event we had  never lost an article  although everything we possessed was open to them     when we questioned them about our property  they frankly told us where it  was  and  after some difficulty in settling the amount of its ransom  we  got most of our things back again  with the exception of such as had been  carried off by the ngapuhis     upon the cruelty of this custom i shall make no comments  probably i  should have remained in ignorance of this savage law  had i not had the  misfortune to become its victim     by redeeming from the natives what they had purloined from the fire  we  had restored to us some of our boxes  desks  and clothes  but all our  little comforts towards housekeeping were irretrievably lost  when the  fire was over we received a visit from one of the missionaries  who made  us a cold offer of assistance  we accepted a little tea  sugar and some  few articles of crockery from them  but  although they knew we stood  there houseless  amongst a horde of savages  they never offered us the  shelter of their roofs  i am very sure that had the calamity befallen  them  we should immediately have offered our huts  and shared with them  everything we possessed  here was an opportunity of practically showing  the  pagans   as they termed the new zealanders  the great christian  doctrine of  doing to others as we would they should do unto us   i must  acknowledge i was sometimes mortified at being obliged to sleep  three of  us huddled up close together  in a small new zealand hut  filled with  filth and vermin of all kinds  while at only two miles  distance from us  stood a neat village  abounding in every comfort that a bountiful british  public could provide  and we  members of that community  and  indeed   partly contributors to the funds for its support     the high state of excitement into which the savages had been thrown by  the late conflagration gradually subsided  and as we had escaped the  dreaded calamity of our magazine blowing up  we began to look with  calmness on our desolate condition  and draw comfort from thinking how  much worse we might have been circumstanced than we then were  i hope our  distress may prove a benefit to future sojourners in this country  by  showing them the great importance of forming a proper magazine for  powder  the agonies i suffered in contemplating the destruction which six  barrels of powder  each of an hundredweight  would cause amongst a mob of  several hundred naked savages  it is impossible to imagine     king george  as well as all his people  were most anxious to build us a  new habitation entirely themselves  they requested us to give them the  dimensions of the various dwellings  and said we should have no further  trouble about them  a party accordingly proceeded to the bush to collect  materials  they first formed the skeleton of a cottage containing three  rooms  with slight sticks  firmly tied together with strips of flax   while this was in progress  another party was collecting rushes  which  grow plentifully in the neighbourhood  called ra poo   these they spread  in the sun for twenty four hours  when they considered them sufficiently  dry  they then thatched every part of the house  which for neatness and  strength was equal to anything i had ever seen  the doors and windows we  employed our carpenter to make  these being luxuries quite beyond the  comprehension of the natives  we were thus tolerably well lodged again   and our time passed on tranquilly  almost every day developing some fresh  trait of character amongst these children of nature           chapter xxvi     a hostile demonstration       i went to reside for a short time at a village about half a mile distant   where there was a pretty good house vacant  it was called ma to we  and  belonged to a chief named atoi  a relation of george s  but a much  younger man  his power was not so great  and he was every way subject to  the authority of the tribe under whose protection i had placed myself   one morning  at daybreak  we were roused by the hasty approach of king  george and all his warriors towards ma to we  all were fully equipped for  war  and each countenance looked fierce and wild  our late misfortunes  having rendered us more than usually anxious  this hostile appearance  gave us considerable alarm  we left our house to inquire the reason  thereof  and saw george and his followers enter the village  pull down  several fences  fire a few muskets in the air  dance a most hideous dance  of defiance  and then depart  but not one word of explanation could we  obtain from him  in the course of the morning  however  the women  acquainted us with the cause of this mysterious proceeding  which  determined me to remove my things back again to george s village of  kororarika as soon as possible     the affair was simply this  atoi had two wives  during the time of our  visit to his village  he was absent  and had entrusted these women to the  care of his brother  but he  instead of being faithful to the trust  reposed in him  had actually seduced one of them  this circumstance came  to the knowledge of george  and he  feeling for the honour of his absent  friend  immediately proceeded to the village  and thus gave the parties  warning that he was fully aware of the nature of their proceedings  he  had also dispatched a messenger to atoi  to inform him of his disgrace   and to request his immediate return  in the course of the day it was  expected he would arrive  and bring with him a strong party of friends   all burning with revenge  and eager to punish his brother for his  unnatural perfidy  it was thought that unless george interfered  much  bloodshed might ensue  and it may readily be imagined how anxious we were  that this dreaded meeting should be over  yet i  for one  had determined  that i would be a witness of it  therefore  when word was brought to me  that atoi was crossing the bay  i hastened down to the beach  there i  found all parties assembled from both villages  george and his followers   who were to act as mediators  sat immediately in front of the place of  landing  behind them were atoi s brother and all his partizans  and in  the rear were all the women and children  with about a dozen white faces  scattered amongst them  the scene was picturesque and exceedingly  interesting  it was near the close of a lovely summer s day  the sun   fast sinking towards the horizon  threw a warm and mellow glow over the  wide expanse of the far spreading bay  whose smooth waters were only  disturbed by the approaching canoe cutting its foamy way  it was crowded  with naked warriors  urging their rapid course towards the shore  and we  heard the loud and furious song of the chief  animating his friends to  exertion  we saw his frantic gestures  as he stood in the centre of his  canoe  brandishing his weapons  as they came near the place of landing   george ran into the stream  and as the canoe touched the shore  attacked  atoi  but in a playful manner  splashing water over him  thus irritated   atoi jumped on land  and  with a double barrelled musket in his hand  ran  towards his brother  and doubtless would have killed him on the spot  had  he not been prevented  i now saw the advantage of george and his party  being present  he and three of his subjects seized upon atoi  and tried  to wrest the weapon from his hands  which if they had been able to  effect  a mortal combat could not take place  such being the custom here   atoi was a very powerful man of about thirty  and those who attacked him  had a most difficult task  twice he broke from them  and i then watched  the countenance of his brother  which was perfectly cool and collected   though the firelock was in readiness  and the finger on the trigger   which might despatch him instantly  all parties sat perfectly quiet  during the desperate struggle  one of the barrels of atoi s piece went  off  and the contents flew amongst us  without  however  doing any  material injury  and  finally  the musket was wrested out of his hands   he then sat still for about twenty minutes  to recover his breath  when  he seized a club and rushed upon his brother  for mortal weapons were now  prohibited   the brother started up  armed in the same manner  some heavy  blows passed between them  when  having thrown aside their clubs  they  grappled each other firmly  and a dreadful struggle ensued  as they were  both completely naked  their hair was the only thing to take hold by  but  being long  thick  and strong  it afforded a firm grasp  and they  committed desperate havoc on each other s persons  at this period of the  fight their poor old mother  who was quite blind  came forward to try and  separate the combatants  the sister and younger brothers now followed her  example  and  finally  the fair and frail cause of all this commotion     the brothers  having completely exhausted their strength  were easily  separated  and as their friends had carefully removed all weapons out of  their reach  they of course were deprived of the means of injuring each  other  the members of atoi s family  together with a few friends  now sat  down in a circle  to converse and consult on the affair  atoi s wife  totally denied the charge  and protested her innocence  and many  circumstances were brought forward to corroborate her statements  the  husband at length was satisfied  and all parties were reconciled           chapter xxvii     the law of retaliation       this affair was scarcely terminated  when we found that another of a  still more serious nature was likely to arise from it and would threaten  the peace of both villages  when king george sent his messenger to inform  atoi of the infidelity of his wife  the infuriated husband assaulted the  man  and it was rumoured that he had killed him  this was an offence not  to be forgiven  and george was so exasperated by it that he vowed he  would exterminate the whole of atoi s tribe  a native  however  arrived  with the intelligence that the man was not dead  but only wounded  this  did not seem to allay george s feelings of resentment  and he instantly  made great preparations for war  when our anxiety was wound up to the  utmost  we were greatly astonished to see atoi and all his friends  approach our settlement  totally unarmed  george went out to meet them   looking so full of rage that i thought atoi stood but a slight chance for  his life  after a great deal of violent pantomimic action and grimace   the apology offered by atoi was accepted  and the visit was concluded by  a grand war dance and sham fight performed in their best manner  king  george  in the fulness of his heart at this complete restoration of  friendship  gave a great feast of kumaras and fish  to which we added  some tobacco  and the whole of the party seated themselves by each other  with the utmost sociality  a convincing proof that animosity is not long  an inmate of their breasts     i took every opportunity of inquiring into the nature of their laws and  mode of government  and i found that  in general  their method of  redressing wrongs was very summary  and that their ideas of what was  strictly just were  for the most part  simple and equitable  for any  theft  or offence of that sort  committed by one tribe on another  the  parties are called to instant account  if one native takes from another  any part of his possessions  the party injured has a right to retaliate   and the party retaliated upon must not make the slightest resistance  we  ourselves experienced a proof of this  some part of our property  which  we supposed had been destroyed by our late fire  we had been told was to  be found in the hut of a neighbouring chief  we one day took advantage of  his absence  searched the hut ourselves  and discovered our things  carefully deposited therein  thus assured of the fact  we laid our  complaint before king george  who  after hearing our story to the end   replied   well  my friends  you must go to the hut and take away all your  property  and whatever else you may find  which you may think sufficient  payment for the injury you have received   we accordingly proceeded to  the chief s dwelling  whom we found standing at his door  we charged him  with having robbed us  and entered the house to seize our property  he  held down his head  and seemed ashamed and overpowered at this discovery   he did not attempt to vindicate his conduct  but quietly allowed us not  only to take away all that had belonged to us  but likewise a musket and  double barrelled gun  which he concluded he had lost for ever  these we  had only taken away temporarily to deter him from theft in future  for a  few days after we brought them back to him  to his infinite delight and  astonishment     i was frequently shocked during my residence in this country by the  number of accidents which continually happened to the natives from  gunpowder  and not even the saddest experience could render them more  careful  we were doubtful of the strength of a french fowling piece we  had  so we loaded it to the muzzle and discharged it  in order to prove  it  some young chiefs  who saw us do this  approving of this method   as  soon as they returned home loaded a musket in the same manner  and then  discharged it  but not managing the affair as we did  by means of a  string fastened to the trigger  the piece burst  and mangled two of them  dreadfully  and we got greatly blamed for showing them what was  considered so bad an example     a few months since a native came from the interior driving a quantity of  pigs to barter for powder  he obtained several pounds  weight  and set  off to return home  on his journey he passed the night in a hut  and for  safety put the bag of powder under his head as a pillow  and as a new  zealander always sleeps with a fire close to him  the consequence was  in  the course of the night the fire communicated to the powder  and  destroyed the man and the whole of his family  who were journeying with  him           chapter xxviii     a war expedition and a cannibal feast       last year a chief  and cousin of king george  named pomare  was defeated  and killed by the people of the thames  and george was now resolved to  revenge his death  this determination having become known  we had a  constant succession of visitors  and a considerable number of blows   scratches  and rubbing noses were the consequence  our beach presented a  most interesting and busy scene  a dozen superb war canoes were lying  ready to convey the forces  and  considering their limited means  the  solidity of their structure and the carved work on them are surprising   none but men of rank are allowed to work upon them  and they labour like  slaves  some canoes were to be lengthened  others patched  others were  condemned to be broken up  and the fragments taken to complete the new  ones  every morning we were awakened by the sound of the hammer and saw   and they were much gratified by our walking down to their dockyard to  observe the progress they made  and by giving our opinions of their work   they thankfully received any hint we gave them as to better methods of  completing or proceeding with their operations  here were carvers   painters  caulkers  and sailmakers  all working in their different  departments with great good humour and industry  some of their vessels  were eighty feet long  and were entirely covered with beautiful  carving  their form was light and delicate  and if their intentions were  hostile towards us  they would be very formidable alongside any merchant  man  if our government should determine to colonise any part of new  zealand  they would find the natives hardy and willing assistants  and  very different from the natives of new south wales      illustration  maori war expedition  with mission boat accompanying  it       as their canoes were ready for launching  they ran them off the beach   jumped into them  and scudded across the bay with an almost incredible  swiftness  when it is considered that in each canoe were seated eighty  stout young men  each with a large paddle in his hand propelling the  vessel forward  the velocity with which she flew may be imagined  it was  in the midst of scenes like these that we were passing our time  and i  had just become delighted with the appearance of innocence and industry  so continually displayed by these people  when i was called upon to  witness a sight which exhibited their character in its worst light  and  confirmed all my horrible suspicions regarding their alleged cannibalism     the new zealanders have been long charged with cannibalism  but as no  person of importance or celebrity had actually been a witness to the  disgusting act  in pity to our nature such relations have been  universally rejected  and much has been written to prove the  non existence of so hideous a propensity  it was my lot to behold it in  all its horrors     one morning  about eleven o clock  after i had just returned from a long  walk  captain duke informed me he had heard  from very good authority   though the natives wished it to be kept a profound secret   that in the  adjoining village a female slave  named matowe  had been put to death   and that the people were at that very time preparing her flesh for  cooking  at the same time he reminded me of a circumstance which had  taken place the evening before  atoi had been paying us a visit  and   when going away  he recognised a girl whom he said was a slave that had  run away from him  he immediately seized hold of her  and gave her in  charge to some of his people  the girl had been employed in carrying wood  for us  atoi s laying claim to her had caused us no alarm for her life   and we had thought no more on the subject  but now  to my surprise and  horror  i heard this poor girl was the victim they were preparing for the  oven  captain duke and myself were resolved to witness this dreadful  scene  we therefore kept our information as secret as possible  well  knowing that if we had manifested our wishes they would have denied the  whole affair  we set out  taking a circuitous route towards the village   and  being well acquainted with the road  we came upon them suddenly  and  found them in the midst of their abominable ceremonies     on a spot of rising ground  just outside the village  we saw a man  preparing a native oven  which is done in the following simple manner   a  hole is made in the ground  and hot stones are put within it  and then  all is covered up close  as we approached  we saw evident signs of the  murder which had been perpetrated  bloody mats were strewed around  and a  boy was standing by them actually laughing  he put his finger to his  head  and then pointed towards a bush  i approached the bush  and there  discovered a human head  my feelings of horror may be imagined as i  recognised the features of the unfortunate girl i had seen forced from  our village the preceding evening     we ran towards the fire  and there stood a man occupied in a way few  would wish to see  he was preparing the four quarters of a human body for  a feast  the large bones  having been taken out  were thrown aside  and  the flesh being compressed  he was in the act of forcing it into the  oven  while we stood transfixed by this terrible sight  a large dog   which lay before the fire  rose up  seized the bloody head  and walked  off with it into the bushes  no doubt to hide it there for another meal   the man completed his task with the most perfect composure  telling us   at the same time  that the repast would not be ready for some hours     here stood captain duke and myself  both witnesses of a scene which many  travellers have related  and their relations have invariably been treated  with contempt  indeed  the veracity of those who had the temerity to  relate such incredible events has been everywhere questioned  in this  instance it was no warrior s flesh to be eaten  there was no enemy s  blood to drink  in order to infuriate them  they had no revenge to  gratify  no plea could they make of their passions having been roused by  battle  nor the excuse that they eat their enemies to perfect their  triumph  this was an action of unjustifiable cannibalism  atoi  the  chief  who had given orders for this cruel feast  had only the night  before sold us four pigs for a few pounds of powder  so he had not even  the excuse of want of food  after captain duke and myself had consulted  with each other  we walked into the village  determining to charge atoi  with his brutality     atoi received us in his usual manner  and his handsome  open countenance  could not be imagined to belong to so savage a monster as he had proved  himself to be  i shuddered at beholding the unusual quantity of potatoes  his slaves were preparing to eat with this infernal banquet  we talked  coolly with him on the subject  for  as we could not prevent what had  taken place  we were resolved to learn  if possible  the whole  particulars  atoi at first tried to make us believe he knew nothing about  it  and that it was only a meal for his slaves  but we had ascertained it  was for himself and his favourite companions  after various endeavours to  conceal the fact  atoi frankly owned that he was only waiting till the  cooking was completed to partake of it  he added that  knowing the horror  we europeans held these feasts in  the natives were always most anxious  to conceal them from us  and he was very angry that it had come to our  knowledge  but  as he had acknowledged the fact  he had no objection to  talk about it  he told us that human flesh required a greater number of  hours to cook than any other  that if not done enough it was very tough   but when sufficiently cooked it was as tender as paper  he held in his  hand a piece of paper  which he tore in illustration of his remark  he  said the flesh then preparing would not be ready till next morning  but  one of his sisters whispered in my ear that her brother was deceiving us   as they intended feasting at sunset     we inquired why and how he had murdered the poor girl  he replied that  running away from him to her own relations was her only crime  he then  took us outside his village  and showed us the post to which she had been  tied  and laughed to think how he had cheated her   for   said he   i  told her i only intended to give her a flogging  but i fired  and shot  her through the heart   my blood ran cold at this relation  and i looked  with feelings of horror at the savage while he related it  shall i be  credited when i again affirm that he was not only a handsome young man   but mild and genteel in his demeanour  he was a man we had admitted to  our table  and was a general favourite with us all  and the poor victim  to his bloody cruelty was a pretty girl of about sixteen years of age     while listening to this frightful detail  we felt sick almost to  fainting  we left atoi  and again strolled towards the spot where this  disgusting mess was cooking  not a native was now near it  a hot  fetid  steam kept occasionally bursting from the smothered mass  and the same  dog we had seen with the head now crept from beneath the bushes  and  sneaked towards the village  to add to the gloominess of the whole  a  large hawk rose heavily from the very spot where the poor victim had been  cut in pieces  my friend and i sat gazing on this melancholy place  it  was a lowering  gusty day  and the moaning of the wind through the  bushes  as it swept round the hill on which we were  seemed in unison  with our feelings     after some time spent in contemplating the miserable scene before us   during which we gave full vent to the most passionate exclamations of  disgust  we determined to spoil this intended feast  this resolution  formed  we rose to execute it  i ran off to our beach  leaving duke on  guard  and  collecting all the white men i could  i informed them of what  had happened  and asked them if they would assist in destroying the oven  and burying the remains of the girl  they consented  and each having  provided himself with a shovel or a pickaxe  we repaired in a body to  the spot  atoi and his friends had by some means been informed of our  intention  and they came out to prevent it  he used various threats to  deter us  and seemed highly indignant  but as none of his followers  appeared willing to come to blows  and seemed ashamed that such a  transaction should have been discovered by us  we were permitted by them  to do as we chose  we accordingly dug a tolerably deep grave  then we  resolutely attacked the oven  on removing the earth and leaves  the  shocking spectacle was presented to our view  the four quarters of a  human body half roasted  during our work clouds of steam enveloped us   and the disgust created by our task was almost overpowering  we collected  all the parts we could recognise  the heart was placed separately  we  supposed  as a savoury morsel for the chief himself  we placed the whole  in the grave  which we filled up as well as we could  and then broke and  scattered the oven     by this time the natives from both villages had assembled  and a scene  similar to this was never before witnessed in new zealand  six unarmed  men  quite unprotected  for there was not a single vessel in the harbour   nor had there been for a month   had attacked and destroyed all the  preparations of the natives for what they consider a national feast  and  this was done in the presence of a great body of armed chiefs  who had  assembled to partake of it  after having finished this exploit  and our  passion and disgust had somewhat subsided  i could not help feeling that  we had acted very imprudently in thus tempting the fury of these savages   and interfering in an affair that certainly was no concern of ours  but  as no harm accrued to any of our party  it plainly shows the influence   the white men  have already obtained over them  had the offence we  committed been done by any hostile tribe  hundreds of lives would have  been sacrificed     the next day our old friend king george paid us a long visit  and we  talked over the affair very calmly  he highly disapproved of our conduct    in the first place   said he   you did a foolish thing  which might have  cost you your lives  and yet did not accomplish your purpose after all   as you merely succeeded in burying the flesh near the spot on which you  found it  after you went away it was again taken up  and every bit was  eaten   a fact i afterwards ascertained by examining the grave and  finding it empty  king george further said   it was an old custom  which  their fathers practised before them  and you had no right to interfere  with their ceremonies  i myself   added he   have left off eating human  flesh  out of compliment to you white men  but you have no reason to  expect the same compliance from all the other chiefs  what punishment  have you in england for thieves and runaways   we answered   after trial   flogging or hanging    then   he replied   the only difference in our  laws is  you flog and hang  but we shoot and eat      after thus reproving us  he became very communicative on the subject of  cannibalism  he said  he recollected the time prior to pigs and potatoes  being introduced into the island  an epoch of great importance to the new  zealanders   and stated that he was born and reared in an inland  district  and the only food they then had consisted of fern roots and  kumara  fish they never saw  and the only flesh he then partook of was  human  but i will no longer dwell on this humiliating subject  most  white men who have visited the island have been sceptical on this point   i myself was before i had  ocular proof   consequently i availed myself  of the first opportunity to convince myself of the fact  i have reflected  upon the subject  and am thoroughly satisfied that nothing will cure the  natives of this dreadful propensity but the introduction of many  varieties of animals  both wild and tame  and all would be sure to thrive  in so mild and fine a climate           chapter xxix     slavery among the maoris       the scene i have just described brings into consideration the subject of  slavery  as it now exists in new zealand  that slavery should be the  custom of savage nations and cannibals  is not a cause of wonder  they  are the only class of human beings it ought to remain with  here slavery  assumes its most hideous shape  every one they can effect a seizure of in  an enemy s country becomes the slave of the captors  chiefs are never  made prisoners  they either fight to the last  or are killed on the spot   and their heads are preserved  by a peculiar method  as trophies   children are greatly prized  these they bring to their dwellings  and  they remain slaves for life  upon the number of slaves a chief can muster  he takes his rank as a man of wealth and consequence in society  and the  only chance these wretched beings have of being released from their  miseries  is their master getting into a rage  and murdering them without  further ceremony     on entering a village  a stranger instantly discovers which portion of  its inhabitants are the slaves  though both the complexion and the  dresses of all are alike  the free zealander is a joyous  good humoured  looking man  full of laughter and vivacity  and is chattering  incessantly  but the slaves have invariably a squalid  dejected look   they are never seen to smile  and appear literally half starved  the  beauties characteristic of a new zealander are his teeth and hair  the  latter  in particular  is his pride and study  but the slaves have their  heads half shorn  the male slave is not allowed to marry  and any  intercourse with a female  if discovered  is generally punished by death   never was there a body of men so completely cut off from all society as  these poor slaves  they never can count  with certainty  on a single  moment of life  as the savage caprice of their master may instantly  deprive them of it  if  by chance  a slave should belong to a kind and  good master  an accident happening to him  or any of his family  will  probably prove equally fatal to the slave  as some are generally  sacrificed on the death of a chief     thus these poor slaves are deprived of every hope and stimulus by which  all other classes and individuals are animated  no good conduct of theirs  towards their master  no attachment to his person or family  no fidelity  or long service can ensure kind treatment  if the slave effect his escape  to his own part of the country  he is there treated with contempt  and  when he dies  if a natural death   his body is dragged to the outside of  the village  there to be made sport of by the children  or to furnish  food for the dogs  but more frequently his fate is to receive a fatal  blow in a fit of passion  and then be devoured by his brutal master  even  the female slaves who  if pretty  are frequently taken as wives by their  conquerors  have not a much greater chance of happiness  all being  dependent upon the caprice of their owners     when i can relate anything favourable to the missionaries  i invariably  intend to do so  which will account for the introduction of the  following  a few days since  i paid a visit to one of their settlements   and noticed a remarkably fine native woman attending as a servant  she  was respectably dressed  and in every respect  except complexion  she was  similar to a european  she spoke english fluently  upon expressing my  admiration of her  i was informed that this woman had been a slave of  hongi s  and that about a year previous he had lost one of his sons  and  had determined to sacrifice this poor girl as an atonement  she was  actually bound for the purpose  and nothing but the strong interference  of the whole of the missionary society here could have saved her life   they exerted themselves greatly  and preserved her  and she had proved a  faithful and valuable servant           chapter xxx     piratical seizure of a vessel       before finally quitting the subject of slavery  i must give an account of  some white men i saw in this state of degradation  and who belonged to a  chief who visited us some weeks since  in the beginning of       the  government of new south wales hired the brig wellington to convey a  number of prisoners to norfolk island  most of whom were felons of the  worst description  the greater part were under sentence of banishment for  life  these desperadoes amounted to seventy four  by far too many for the  size of the brig  as those whose duty is was to guard them  and the crew  of the vessel  were too few to keep them under subjection  when within a  few days  sail of their destination  they rose on the guard  and  after a  desperate struggle  made themselves masters of the vessel  which was a  very fine one  and was well provided with arms and stores of every kind   amounting to a sufficiency to carry them to any part of the world they  chose  but the machinations of the wicked rarely prosper  and this was  another proof of the truth of the observation  for  after a stormy and  violent debate among themselves  they at length determined to run for the  bay of islands  and if any vessel more eligible was there  they were to  take possession of her  and leave the wellington behind  she having no  register  it is but justice to them to state that they behaved with  humanity to their captives  and no lives were lost  they appointed  officers amongst themselves  and  with the assistance of the deposed  captain  made this port  on their arrival here  they found two english  whalers  the sisters  captain duke  and the harriet  the commanders  as  is usual on these occasions  went immediately on board the newcomer   captain duke well knew the vessel  having seen her at sydney  but  of  course  had no idea of what had happened  the pirates received them with  great civility  and deceived them with a false description of their  voyage  of being bound to a southern port with prisoners  and the two  captains  not having the slightest suspicion of who their hosts really  were  passed a very merry evening with these marauders     soon  however  their bad management of the vessel  their want of  discipline  and the general confusion on board  roused a vague suspicion  in the minds of the two captains that all was not  quite right  on board  the wellington  the real captain  too  had succeeded in conveying a note  to duke  informing him of his situation  and claiming his assistance to  recapture the brig  and entreating him to release them all from  captivity     this communication produced universal alarm  as both the whalers were  quite unprovided for attack or defence  and all the missionary  settlements lay quite at the mercy of this band of pirates  had the  latter acted with promptness and spirit  they might easily have made  themselves masters of the whole  but while they were arguing and  hesitating where they would make their first attack  the whalers were  actively employed in getting their great guns out of the hold  and in  preparing their vessels for defence  so that  by the time the pirates  came to the resolution to attack them  the whalers were in a good  posture for resistance  and finally became the assailants  aided by the  prompt assistance of the natives  the whole of these outlaws were taken  into custody  with the exception of six  the extreme interest the savages  took in capturing these deluded men was truly astonishing  when they were  made to understand that these were king george s  of england  slaves  who  had broken loose  they knew  from their own laws  that they ought to be  taken  and they displayed a great deal of courage and address in  approaching and securing them     the pirates  having many passengers and others in their power  stipulated  that they should be landed at kororarika  unmolested by any of the  english  this was granted  but no sooner were they left by themselves  than a party of natives came forward  seized and bound them  stripped off  their clothes  and  after dressing themselves up in them  conducted their  prisoners on board the whalers  but notwithstanding the anxiety of the  whalers to secure the whole  and the activity of the natives  six of them  found means to elude the search  and here they now are     the day on which our houses were burned  these six landed in the train of  one of the chiefs  and i have since entertained a suspicion that it was  their desire of revenge that occasioned the destruction of our property  at the time the calamity happened  i chanced to be in the house alone   and was amazed by seeing an englishman enter the hut with his face  tattooed all over  not being aware he was one of the runaways from the  wellington  i spoke to him  he slunk into our cooking house on pretence  of lighting his pipe  and before ten minutes had elapsed  the house was  in flames           chapter xxxi     the climate and productions       the summer was now far advanced  and never  during its progress  had we  been incommoded by any very hot weather  our house was generally crowded  with visitors  for  as it was the workmanship of king george and his  people  they were prodigiously proud of it  and each seemed to think he  had an undoubted right to sit in it as much as he liked  this  at times   we felt as a great annoyance  but we were obliged to be very cautious not  to say or do anything that should give offence to them  as all were  exceedingly irritable  and we felt it to be most essential to our comfort  to continue on friendly terms with them     although we were situated in the same latitude as sydney  we found the  climate of new zealand infinitely superior  moderate heats and  beautifully clear skies succeeded each other every day  we were quite  free from those oppressive  feverish heats which invariably prevail in  the middle of the day at sydney  and from those hot pestilential winds  which are the terror of the inhabitants of new south wales  nor were we  subject to those long droughts  which are often the ruin of the  australian farmer  the temperature here was neither too hot nor too cold   neither too wet nor too dry  reflecting on this country  its situation   inhabitants  and climate  i felt convinced that  if it were the object of  our government to form a new colony  they could not select a more  desirable spot than new zealand  when we left sydney  a disease was  raging there of a most disagreeable nature  namely  catarrh  as usual  it  affected strongly the eyes and nose  and generally proved fatal to the  very old and to children  we found the poor natives here subject to the  same complaint  which they called the  murray   or  murraybad   and they  declared they caught it from us europeans     i could scarcely refrain from laughing while witnessing the strange  methods they adopted to effect a cure  sometimes they would envelope  their heads entirely in green leaves  at other times they would almost  roast themselves in a heated hut  but their universal remedy  and the one  they generally found successful  was starvation  which is  in fact  the  doctor who cures them of all the diseases the europeans have imported  amongst them  and  i confess  i have often been amazed at their rapid  recovery from maladies which i should have thought incurable  the other  day i asked the opinion of a clever medical man  who came here with one  of the whalers  and he informed me the only cases he had met with amongst  the natives  which terminated fatally  were a few instances of  consumption     after the novelty of our savage life began to wear away  i rambled much  about the country  in order to form some judgment of its capability of  improvement  i never possessed any practical knowledge of farming  and  therefore cannot give a scientific opinion or description of the  different soils  in whatever direction i travelled  and at this time i  had crossed the country in various directions several times  the soil  appeared to me to be fat and rich  and also well watered  from every  part of it which the natives have cultivated  the produce has been  immense  here  where the finest samples of the human race are to be  found  the largest and finest timber grows  and every vegetable  yet  planted  thrives  the introduction of european grasses  fruits  etc    etc   would be a great desideratum  were this done  in a very short time  farms would be more eagerly sought after here than they now are in new  south wales  all the fruits and plants hitherto introduced by the  missionary establishments have succeeded wonderfully  peaches and water  melons now were in full season  the natives brought baskets full of them  to our door every day  which they exchanged with us for the merest  trifles  such as a fish hook  or a button     indian corn was likewise very abundant  but as the natives did not  possess any means or knowledge of grinding it  they were not aware of its  full value  their only method of cooking it was one very disgusting to  europeans  they soaked the ear in water till it was quite soft and sour   the smell from which was exceedingly offensive  they then placed it in  their earth ovens to bake  and when they partook of it they seemed to  enjoy it very much     in one of my journeys across the island i was accompanied by my scotch  friend  mr  shand  who prided himself very much upon his general  knowledge of agricultural pursuits  and when i indulged in some sudden  bursts of admiration at the beauty of the surrounding prospect  he would  invariably check my enthusiasm  by observing that no animals could  possibly live in a country so overgrown with fern  and where no grass was  indigenous  these observations  often repeated  obliged me to qualify my  admiration of this picturesque and beautiful land  but my surprise  and i  may say my triumph  were complete when  on approaching the missionary  village of kirikiri  we fell in with a herd of at least a hundred fat  cattle  browsing on the sides of the hill  and having nothing else but  this very fern to eat  and  on inquiry  we found they gave as good milk   and were in as healthy a condition  as when they grazed on the rich  grasses of lincolnshire     my friend  captain duke  made great preparations for the return of his  ships  and purchased many pigs to be salted  the self denial of the  natives is wonderful  though very fond of animal food  they sell the  whole to us europeans for the means of war  thus conquering the appetite  for the purpose of possessing arms to make them terrible in the sight of  their enemies  this feeling  properly directed  may lead to their  becoming a great nation  in the course of our saltings and picklings of  pork  owing to the warmth of the weather  a considerable quantity was  spoiled  i recommended its being immediately thrown into the sea  but  duke  who knew the propensities of the people better than i did  and  wished to ingratiate himself among them  sent for some of his favourites   and presented them with the damaged meat  with which they marched off  highly delighted  and made a public feast of it in the evening      illustration  new zealand method of tattooing   from a sketch by  a  earle             chapter xxxii     the art of tattooing       the art of tattooing has been brought to such perfection here  that  whenever we have seen a new zealander whose skin is thus ornamented  we  have admired him  it is looked upon as answering the same purposes as  clothes  when a chief throws off his mats  he seems as proud of  displaying the beautiful ornaments figured on his skin as a first rate  exquisite is in exhibiting himself in his last fashionable attire  it is  an essential part of war like preparations  the whole of this district of  kororarika was preparing for the approaching war  their canoes  muskets   powder and balls  increased daily  and a very ingenious artist  called  aranghie  arrived to carry on this important branch of his art  which was  soon placed in requisition  for all the mighty men in the neighbourhood  were one by one under his operating hands     as this  professor  was a near neighbour of mine  i frequently paid him a  visit in his  studio   and he returned the compliment whenever he had  time to spare  he was considered by his countrymen a perfect master in  the art of tattooing  and men of the highest rank and importance were in  the habit of travelling long journeys in order to put their skins under  his skilful hands  indeed  so highly were his works esteemed  that i have  seen many of his drawings exhibited even after death  a neighbour of mine  very lately killed a chief who had been tattooed by aranghie  and   appreciating the artist s work so highly  he skinned the chieftain s  thighs  and covered his cartouch box with it     i was astonished to see with what boldness and precision aranghie drew  his designs upon the skin  and what beautiful ornaments he produced  no  rule and compasses could be more exact than the lines and circles he  formed  so unrivalled is he in his profession  that a highly finished  face of a chief from the hands of this artist is as greatly prized in new  zealand as a head from the hands of sir thomas lawrence is amongst us  it  was most gratifying to behold the respect these savages pay to the fine  arts  this  professor  was merely a  kooky  or slave  but by skill and  industry he raised himself to an equality with the greatest men of his  country  and as every chief who employed him always made him some  handsome present  he soon became a man of wealth  and was constantly  surrounded by such important personages as pungho pungho  ruky ruky  kivy  kivy  aranghy tooker  etc   etc  my friend shulitea  king george  sent  him every day the choicest things from his own table  though thus basking  in the full sunshine of court favour  aranghie  like a true genius  was  not puffed up with pride by his success  for he condescended to come and  take tea with me almost every evening  he was delighted with my drawings   particularly with a portrait i made of him  he copied so well  and seemed  to enter with such interest into the few lessons of painting i gave him   that if i were returning from here direct to england  i would certainly  bring him with me  as i look upon him as a great natural genius      illustration  specimens of tattooed faces and thigh   from  expedition  de l astrolabe        one of the important personages who came to the village to employ the  talent of our artist was a  mr   rooky rooky  and he was always very  particular in remembering the  mister    he brought four of his wives  with him  leaving six more at home  polygamy in new zealand being allowed  to any extent   one of this man s wives was a little girl not more than  ten years of age  and she excited a great deal of interest amongst us   which  when he discovered  he became very anxious to dispose of her to  any of us  he importuned us incessantly on the subject  saying she was  his slave  and offered her in exchange for a musket           chapter xxxiii     tribal government and religion       though from my increased knowledge of the language  i was enabled to hold  longer conversations  i could not discover that the new zealanders had  any universal form of government  there appeared to me to be no public  bodies  or any functionaries employed by the people  each chief seemed to  possess absolute power over his own slaves  and there his authority  terminated  wealth made him feared by his foes  but gave him no influence  over his friends  all offence offered to any one of a tribe  or clan  is  instantly followed by some act of retaliation by the aggrieved party  and  if one tribe is too weak to contend against the one from whom they have  received the injury  they call in the aid of another  but should the  offence be of a very aggravated nature  and several families be injured  by it  a meeting of the chiefs is called  they assemble in one of their  forts  and  after a discussion  decide either for an amicable adjustment   or for an exterminating war  thus these misguided beings are continually  destroying each other for some imaginary insult     i became acquainted with a few venerable men of truly noble and  praiseworthy characters  such as would do honour to any age  country  or  religion  they had passed their whole lives in travelling from one  chieftain s residence to another  for the purpose of endeavouring to  explain away insults  to offer apologies  and to strive by every means  in their power to establish peace between those about to plunge their  country into the horrors of war  i have several times met these  benevolent men journeying through the country on these pacific missions   and twice during my residence here they have been the happy means of  preventing bloodshed  although the new zealander is so fond of war  and  possesses such war like manners  yet are these peacemakers held in the  highest respect  although they do not hold any sacred function  indeed   no order of priesthood exists amongst the natives  i have never  discovered any symptoms of religion in these people  except it consists  in a great variety of absurd and superstitious ceremonies  before i  visited this island i used to imagine  from seeing so great a variety of  carved figures which had been brought from this country  that they were  idols  to whom they paid their devotions  but in this i was deceived   they were merely the grotesque carvings of rude artists  possessing a  lively fancy  and were a proof of their industry as well as genius  every  chief s house is adorned with an abundance of these carved monsters  one  of their favourite subjects is a lizard taking hold of the top of a man s  head  their tradition being that that was the origin of man  the lizard  is sacred  and never injured by them  several of their chiefs assured me  they believed in the existence of a great and invisible spirit  called  atna  who keeps a constant charge and watch over them  and that they are  constantly looking out for tokens of his approbation or displeasure   there is not a wind that blows but they imagine it bears some message  from him  and there are not wanting crafty men who pretend to a much more  intimate knowledge of his sentiments than the generality  and they easily  work on the minds of the credulous and the ignorant  these imposters  obtain great consideration  and their counsel and advice is most  anxiously sought after by those about to undertake any important  business  but  like ancient astrologers and modern gypsies  they speak  only in ambiguous terms  so that whatever may be the result  their  prediction may still correspond with it     like all rude and ignorant people  the new zealanders seem more to fear  the wrath of their god than to love his attributes  and constant  sacrifices  too often human ones  are offered up to appease his anger   they imagine that the just and glorious deity is ever ready to destroy   and that his hand is always stretched forth to execute vengeance     these sacred  or  more correctly speaking  these  cunning  men and women   who pretend to see into futurity  and to hold an intercourse with the  great spirit  are here  in one way  at least  turned to a good and useful  account  as they themselves are held sacred  everything they wish to have  taken particular care of  they can render sacred also  all the chiefs  find these people of the greatest use in protecting their property  for  they possess the power of tabooing  and when once this ceremony is  performed over any person or thing  no one dares to touch either  and for  a sufficiently good bribe they will impart their sacred power to any  chief  who  by means of this device  thus can protect a field of potatoes  or grain  at fifty miles distance from his settlement  more securely and  effectually than by any fences  or number of persons he might place to  guard it     this ceremony of taboo  which is common to the whole of the south sea  islands  seems the principal part of their religion  and it is really  difficult to walk without trespassing or infringing on some spot under  this influence  all those who touch a corpse are immediately taboo d  and  must be fed like an infant  as their own hands must not touch anything  that is put into their mouths  in fact  as we strolled through the  village at the time of their evening repast  it appeared as though some  dreadful disease had suddenly struck the greater part of the inhabitants   and deprived them of the use of their limbs  most of them being either  fed by their slaves  or lying flat down on the ground  and with their  mouths eating out of their platters or baskets  the canoe that carries a  corpse to the place of its interment is  from that time  taboo d and laid  up  and if any one by chance touches it  he does so at his peril     all those chiefs who were under the operating hands of aranghie  the  tatooer  were under this law  and all those who worked upon their war  canoes were similarly situated  unfortunately for me  i one day took away  a handful of chips from their dockyard to make our fire burn clearly  i  was informed they were taboo d  and upon my pleading ignorance  and  sorrow for the misdemeanour  together with a promise not to renew the  offence  i was pardoned  a poor hen of ours did not escape so well  she   poor thing  ventured to form a nest  and actually hatched a fine family  of chickens amongst these sacred shavings  loud was the outcry  and great  the horror she occasioned when she marched forth cackling  with her merry  brood around her  she and  all her little ones  were sacrificed  instantly  what became of their bodies we could never learn  probably the  workmen were not too fastidious to eat them     i have observed  since my residence here  one circumstance which proves a  kind feeling in the natives  and shows they are not averse to the  preaching of the missionaries  or the doctrines they inculcate     it was the custom of all the europeans settled here  on the beach at  kororarika  to refrain from all kinds of work on the sabbath  to shave   and dress themselves in their best habiliments  and if any of the  missionaries came over  they went forth to meet them  and hear divine  service  several of the natives generally assembled and witnessed the  ceremony  and as they observed it came every seventh day  they called it   the white taboo d day  when the pakeha  or white men  put on clean  clothes  and leave off work   and  strange to say  the natives also  abstained from working on that day  nothing could induce them to the  contrary  not that we wished to persuade them to work  but merely  endeavoured so to do to ascertain the strength of their politeness  not a  bit of work would they do upon a sunday  although it was a critical time  with them  for all the chiefs were unprepared with their war canoes for  the approaching expedition  at length we discovered that their cunning  was as conspicuous as their politeness  they had observed we generally  lay longer in bed on a sunday morning than any other  they accordingly  were up by break of day  and had completed many hours  work before we  made our appearance  but the moment one of us did appear the work was  instantly left off  this degree of outward respect  though craftily  managed  was infinitely more than could be reasonably expected from a  rude and turbulent savage  it is mere respect than we europeans pay to  any religious ceremony we do not understand  even their taboo d grounds  would not be so respected by us  if we were not quite certain they  possessed the power instantly to revenge any affront offered to their  sacred places     of all animals introduced by the europeans  the most unserviceable  and  indeed injurious  have been the dogs  they have increased rapidly  every  spot was crowded with poor half starved curs  that were all night long  committing depredations on the poultry  pigs  and goats  and if some  effectual means of diminishing this pernicious breed is not soon resorted  to  the island will be cleared of every other quadruped  goats were  beginning to increase  and the craggy heights round the bays formed a  favourite retreat for these interesting wanderers  captain duke put  himself to great expense and trouble  and effected the importation of  some sheep from van diemen s land  but the dogs soon destroyed them all       the massacre of the french navigator marion and party     our friend george generally paid us a visit after the business of the day  was over  and took a cup of tea  wine or grog he detested  so  while he  sipped his beverage  we lit our pipes  and managed  with our slight  knowledge of his language  together with his imperfect english  to keep  up a sort of conversation  sometimes this was rather wearisome  but  occasionally it became interesting in the extreme  he told us that  when  captain cook touched here  he was a little child  but that his mother   old turero  who was then with him  remembered his coming well  the  french navigator  marion  he recollected perfectly  and made one of the  party that murdered him and his people  his observation was   they were  all brave men  but they were killed and eaten      he assured us that the catastrophe was quite unpremeditated  marion s  entire ignorance of the customs of the new zealanders occasioned that  distressing event  as i have before observed  that strangers  not  acquainted with their religious prejudices  are likely to commit some  fatal error  and no action is more likely to lead a party into danger  than an incautious use of the seine  for most of the beaches  best suited  for that purpose  are taboo d  this led to the dreadful fate of marion  and his party  i understood from george  that when marion s men assembled  to trail their net on the sacred beach  the natives used every kind of  entreaty and remonstrance to induce them to forbear  but  either from  ignorance or obstinacy  they persisted in their intentions  and drew  their net to land     the natives  greatly incensed by this act of impiety  vowed revenge  and  the suspicions of the french not being roused  an opportunity soon  presented itself of taking ample retaliation  the seine being very heavy   the french required the assistance of the natives in drawing it on shore   these wily fellows instantly consented to the task  and placed themselves  alternately between each frenchman  apparently  to equalise the work   consequently  in the act of pulling  each native had a white man before  him  and  on an appointed signal  the brains of each european were  knocked out by a tremendous blow of the stone hatchet     captain marion  who  from his ship  was an eye witness of these horrid  murders  instantly hastened on shore with the remainder of his crew to  avenge the slaughter of his countrymen  led on more by ardour than  prudence  he suffered himself to be surrounded  was overpowered by  numbers  defeated  and every one was put to death     this account of george s does not  i acknowledge  exactly agree with the  published narrative of that unfortunate event  nor does his age agree  with the dates  only a few years elapsed between the time of cook and  marion  yet he declares himself to have been a child at the death of the  navigator  and a man at the murder of the latter  but as it was voluntary  on his part to give me the above detail  and even if he were not present  himself  he most probably had the facts from one who was  i thought it  worth inserting  as tending to throw light on one of the most melancholy  events which ever took place on these coasts     george also related to me the dreadful tragedy of the ship boyd  and   horrible as these relations were  i felt a particular interest  almost  amounting to pleasure  in hearing them related by an eye witness  one who  had been an actor in those bloody scenes which i had before read of   narratives which from my very childhood had always possessed particular  charms for me  and at this time i was not only looking on the very spot  the hero of my imagination  cook  had trod  but was hearing the tale from  one who had actually seen him  and was listening to every particular  concerning the transactions of marion and his men  as though they had  just taken place     even in the dreadful destruction of the boyd  george laid the blame  entirely on the english  and spoke with great bitterness of the  ill treatment of philip  the native chief  who came as passenger in the  ship  he described and mimicked his cleaning shoes and knives  his being  flogged when he refused to do this degrading work  and  finally  his  speech to his countrymen when he came on shore  soliciting their  assistance in capturing the vessel  and revenging his ill treatment  over  and over again our friend george  having worked up his passion by a full  recollection of the subject  went through the whole tragedy  the scene  thus portrayed was interesting although horrible  no actor  trained in  the strictest rules of his art  could compete with george s vehemence of  action  the flexibility of his features enabled him to vary the  expression of each passion  and he represented hatred  anger  horror  and  the imploring of mercy so ably that  in short  one would have imagined he  had spent his whole life in practising the art of imitation           chapter xxxiv     the maori view of christianity       i frequently conversed with george upon the subject of religion  and from  what he told me i found that the natives had not formed the slightest  idea of there being a state of future punishment  they refuse to believe  that the good spirit intends to make them miserable after their decease   they imagine all the actions of this life are punished here  and that  every one when dead  good or bad  bondsman or free  is assembled on an  island situated near the north cape  where both the necessaries and  comforts of life will be found in the greatest abundance  and all will  enjoy a state of uninterrupted happiness  a people of their simple  habits  and possessing so little property  have but few temptations to  excesses of any kind  excepting the cruelties practised by them in war   in which they fancy themselves perfectly justified  and the tyranny  exercised by them over their slaves  whom they look upon as mere  machines  there is  in fact  but little crime among them  for which  reason they cannot imagine any man wicked enough to deserve eternal  punishment  this opinion of theirs we saw an illustration of one sunday   when one of the missionaries paid us a visit     the ceremony of all assembling to public worship astonished the natives  greatly  though they always behaved with the utmost decorum when admitted  into the house where the ceremony takes place  on the day in question  the minister endeavoured to explain the sacred mysteries of our religion  to a number of the chiefs who were present  they listened attentively to  all he said  and expressed no doubts as to its truth  only remarking that   as all these wonderful circumstances happened only in the country of the  white men  the great spirit expected the white men only to believe them    the missionary then began to expatiate on the torments of hell  at which  some of them seemed horrified  but others said  they were quite sure such  a place could only be made for the white faces  for they had no men half  wicked enough in new zealand to be sent there   but when the reverend  gentleman added with vehemence that  all men  would be condemned  the  savages all burst into a loud laugh  declaring  they would have nothing  to do with a god who delighted in such cruelties  and then  as a matter  of right  hoped the missionary would give them each a blanket for having  taken the trouble of listening to him so patiently      i cannot forbear censuring the missionaries  inasmuch as they prevent the  natives  by every means in their power  from acquiring the english  language  they make a point of mastering the native tongue as quickly as  possible  and being able to give their whole time and attention to it   this is easily accomplished  it is of importance that they should do so   otherwise they could not carry on the duties of the mission  but by thus  engrossing the knowledge  they obtain great influence over the minds of  the natives  we ourselves were sadly puzzled by a correspondence we had  with two native chiefs  who had been taught to read and write by some of  the society  but their acquirements being in their native language  were  of no possible use  the difficulty of teaching them english would not  have been greater  and then what stores of information and improvement  might not their instructors have laid open to them             chapter xxxv     threatened invasion by hongi       we had passed some months here  and were beginning to look out for the  return of our brig  to take us again into civilised society  when we were  once more thrown into alarm by a threatened invasion  a rumour was  circulated in the village that hongi  who now lay at the point of death   had declared that he would make one last glorious effort before he  expired  he was resolved  it was reported  to collect his warriors   overcome george and his followers  possess himself of kororarika  and die  upon the conquered territory of his enemy  and i had no doubt that in his  moment of delirium such had been his exclamations  as it had always been  one of his favourite projects  when this was reported to george  he  immediately came to us  and with a most doleful countenance told us we  must take care of ourselves  for  if the report proved true  he was much  too weak to protect us  this certainly caused us some alarm  but   fortunately for us  a good sized whaler  the marianne  was then lying at  anchor in the port  having arrived but a few days previously  the  presence of a ship  all over the world  is felt as a protection to  europeans  as in case of danger it is a sure place of refuge     king george sent off his messengers in every direction to inform his  friends and dependants of the threats uttered against him by hongi  and  the next day eight large war canoes  filled with warriors  came to his  assistance  they landed at some distance from the beach  and  as it was  late in the day  they would not make their public  entree  till the next  morning  for the new zealanders are very fond of giving a grand effect to  all their public meetings  i determined to pay them a visit  to witness  the ceremonies of the night bivouack  which proved a most picturesque  scene  and wild and beautiful in the extreme  their watch fires glanced  upon the dark skins of these finely formed men  and on their bright  weapons  some groups were dancing  others were lying round a fire   chanting wild songs  descriptive of former wars  whilst the graver elders  sat in a circle  and discussed the present state of affairs  all were  delighted to see me  and each group offered to share their fire and  provisions with the  white visitor   as they termed me     the next morning these auxiliary forces were seen descending the hills to  our village  and  in order to return the compliment  we all went in our  best array to receive them  there were upwards of two hundred athletic   naked savages  each armed with his firelock  and marching with the utmost  regularity  the chiefs took the lead  the alarm such a sight might have  created was dissipated by the certainty that they came as our protectors   i even imagined their countenances were not so ferocious as usual but as  they approached near to our party  the usual sham fight began   accompanied by the war dance  and although i expected it  and indeed had  come for the purpose of witnessing it  it was conducted with so much fury  on both sides  that at length i became quite horrified  and for some  time could not divest myself of the feeling that our visitors were  playing false  so closely did this mock combat resemble a real one  the  dreadful noises  the hideous faces  the screeching of the women  and the  menacing gestures of each party  were so calculated to inspire terror   that stouter hearts than mine might have felt fear  when the tumult  subsided  the elder chiefs squatted down  and had the long talk usual on  these occasions     i was much delighted to recognise among these chiefs one i had known at  sydney  during his residence in that city i had permitted him to remain  in my house  and the few presents which he had requested on his return to  his own country i had provided him with  and sent him off delighted and  happy  and never expected to behold him again  the moment i approached he  recollected me  jumped up from the  council   ran up to me  hugged me in  his arms  and rubbed noses so forcibly with me that i felt his friendship  for some time  besides being daubed all over most plentifully with red  ochre  which he  being then on a war like and ceremonious visit  was  smeared with from head to foot     when my savage friend  whom we used to call mr  tookee  had overcome his  first burst of delight at seeing me  and had literally left off jumping  for joy  he introduced me to his father  mr  de frookee  the chief of his  tribe  a very fine specimen of an old new zealander  who was  i found   highly respected for his integrity and benevolence  his eyes overflowed  with tears when he heard i was the person who had shown such kindness to  his son at sydney  i soon felt quite  at home  with the old chief  and  experienced the good effect of having kept my word with this uncultivated  savage  i had  at the time i presented him with the gifts  been much  laughed at by my acquaintances at sydney for putting myself to such  unnecessary expense  but  from the gratitude he displayed for the  trifling services i had then rendered him  i felt assured he and his  companions would do all in their power to protect me from every danger     a long discussion was now carried on  one speaker at a time occupying the  oblong space round which the warriors sat  and the more animated the  debate  the faster ran the speaker to and fro  flourishing his hatchet in  a most dexterous manner  the instant one speaker finishes  another starts  up to answer him  but previous to rising they throw a mat or blanket over  their shoulders  and arrange it most tastefully around them  and  as  their attitudes are all striking and graceful  and a great part of the  figure is left exposed  it forms a study for an artist  well worth his  going many miles to witness  and invariably reminded me of the fine  models of antiquity     as a painter  i conceive that this must have been the great secret of the  perfection to which the greek and roman sculptors brought their works  as  they constantly contemplated the display of the human form in all its  beauty in their various gymnastic exercises  which enabled them to  transfer to marble such ease and elegance as we  living in an age of  coats and breeches  never shall be able to rival     after the important subjects had been settled by the elders  the young  men assembled without their weapons  and began another kind of sham  fight  one grappling with another  till hundreds of them were locked in  each other s arms  and were flung in heaps in every direction  after  they were tired of this pastime  a regular ring was formed  and a  wrestling match began  which was carried on in as regular and fair a  manner as a boxing match in our own country  and as much skill and  cunning were displayed in the art of throwing as the greatest connoisseur  would desire  i was pleased  also  to observe that  whatever happened   and some most severe throws and blows passed   nothing could disturb  their good humour     this party  having remained for seven days on our beach  and not hearing  anything more of our intended invaders  their provisions also becoming  rather scarce  took leave in order to return to their own district   placing scouts to give them quick intelligence of the movements of the  enemy             chapter xxxvi     arrival of a warship       a few days after the departure of this friendly tribe  a  king s ship  of  eighteen guns arrived in the bay  consequently all our fears of an  immediate invasion were over  no sooner had she cast anchor than our  friend george came to us  expressing the greatest anxiety to visit king  george of england s warship  and requesting we would accompany him  which  we readily agreed to do  and he left us to adorn himself for the  occasion  soon after he reappeared in great state  a very splendid  war mat was thrown over his shoulders  his hair was dressed  oiled  and  decorated with feathers  and his person was plentifully covered with red  ochre  he appeared a very fine looking fellow  his mother  his three  wives  and all his sons and daughters were dressed in equal magnificence   and accompanied him     in this state we went off to visit the vessel  but the moment i came  alongside  i repented my being there  for the rude and churlish manner in  which we were received distressed me considerably  in the first place  an  order was given that none but the chief himself should be allowed to come  on board  consequently his wives and daughters were obliged to remain in  the canoe  the captain spoke only a few words to george  who was allowed  to remain but a few minutes in the cabin  on getting up to take leave   george took off his fine war mantle and presented it to the captain  but   receiving no other covering in return for his gift  he went on shore  naked  the officers of the vessel behaved differently  they conducted us  all down into the gun room  where they treated us most kindly  and paid  every attention to our friend george  whose dignity was deeply wounded by  the cool and contemptuous behaviour of the captain     how greatly is it to be regretted that some arrangements are not made by  our government at home  and that there are not orders given to commanders  of ships of war touching here to pay attention to the chiefs  and to make  some trifling presents amongst them  for there never were a people more  anxious to cultivate a friendly intercourse with british subjects than  the inhabitants of new zealand  and yet there is scarcely a government  vessel that puts into port here but the natives receive some insult   though they are sent for the express purpose of supporting the dignity of  the english nation  and to cultivate the amicable feelings of the chiefs     when a  king s ship  comes to anchor  the chiefs  with all the glee of  children going to a fair  collect together their wives  children  and  friends  and pay a visit to the  fighting ships   to see king george s  warriors  as they call them   when they come alongside they are kept off  by an armed sentry  and  after a long parley  they are informed the chief  may come  but his family and friends must not  in this case  the natives  generally spit at the vessel  and  uttering execrations on their  inhospitality  return on shore     one of the savage chieftains who accompanied us to the vessel in  question  on our way back remarked   that the white warriors were   afraid  of admitting them  though they were unarmed and but a few  while  the warriors in the ships were many  and armed with their great guns      living entirely amongst these people so long as i had done  i felt the  absurdity of such conduct  and the folly of treating them so harshly  if  ever individuals are so situated as to need either the esteem or the  confidence of savages  they must bear with their prying and childish  curiosity  and not be afraid of treating them too kindly  by this means  they become the quietest and gentlest creatures in the world  but  if  treated with contumely  and their wives and families repulsed from your  ship  they become dangerous  vindictive  and cruel neighbours  as many a  dreadful deed which has taken place in this vicinity will fully prove             chapter xxxvii     the whalers and the missionaries       the south sea whalers are the ships the natives are the most anxious to  see on their coasts  and it is the crews of those vessels who have  in a  manner  civilised these hardy islanders  captain gardiner  of the  marianne  the vessel now in the harbour   is the oldest person in that  trade  and he informed me  that not longer than twenty years back  scarcely any vessel would dare to touch at new zealand  and when  from  particular circumstances  they were obliged so to do  they kept their  boarding nettings up  and kept a strict guard night and day  their fears  arose from a want of knowledge of the disposition of the people  the  vessels frequenting the island use no precautions now  hundreds of  natives are permitted to crowd on board each ship  and no accident has  ever occurred from this mode of treatment  but when a ship of war arrives  here for the first time  the precautions taken are  to arm the row guard  with cutlasses and pistols  and to harass the crew with constant  watching  while the only enemy that exists is in their own imaginations   to the courage and enterprise of the commanders of whalers all credit is  due for working the rapid change in these once bloody minded savages  and  forming safe and commodious harbours for their vessels to refit in  this  have they done in a part of the world lately looked upon with horror   what credit soever the missionaries may take to themselves  or try to  make their supporters in england believe  every man who has visited this  place  and will speak his mind freely and disinterestedly  must  acknowledge  they  have had no share in bringing about this change of  character  but  on the contrary  they have done all that in them lay to  injure the reputation of the whaler in the estimation of the natives   hitherto they have not succeeded  their want of hospitality and kindness  to their own countrymen raises a strong dislike to them in the minds of  these unsophisticated people  according to their simple notions of right  and wrong  they think the want of hospitality an unpardonable offence   and that the counsel or advice of a man who shuts his door against his  neighbour is not worthy of being attended to     i will give the reader one more anecdote of these men  who are sent out  to set an example of the beauty of the christian faith to the  unenlightened heathens  a few weeks since  the festival of christmas took  place  and englishmen  in whatever part of the world they chance to be   make a point of assembling together on that day  our recollections then  being associated with  home  and our families  uniting to spend that day  in mutual congratulations and wishes for happiness  for some time  previous to its arrival  the captains of the two whalers and myself had  been deliberating where we should spend this social day  and it was  finally settled that we should cross the bay to te puna  a beautiful and  romantic spot  the residence of an intelligent chief  called warri pork   and an englishman  named hanson  near this was a church missionary  establishment  and at this englishman s house we determined we would  spend the day  the captains of the two whalers then in the harbour  joined our party  and as everyone contributed his share towards our  picnic feast  the joint stock made altogether a respectable appearance     we proceeded to te puna in two whaleboats  it was a most delightful trip   the scenery being strikingly beautiful  the village of ranghe hue   belonging to warri pork  is situated on the summit of an immense and  abrupt hill  the huts belonging to the savages appeared  in many places   as though they were overhanging the sea  the height being crowned with a  mighty pah  at the bottom of this hill  and in a beautiful valley  the  cottages of the missionaries are situated  complete pictures of english  comfort  content  and prosperity  they are close to a bright sandy beach   a beautiful green slope lies in their rear  and a clear and never failing  stream of water runs by the side of their enclosures  as the boats  approached this lovely spot  i was in an ecstasy of delight  such a happy  mixture of savage and civilised life i had never seen before  and when i  observed the white smoke curling out of the chimneys of my countrymen  i  anticipated the joyful surprise  the hearty welcome  the smiling faces   and old christmas compliments that were going to take place  and the  great pleasure it would give our secluded countrymen to meet us  in these  distant regions  at this happy season  and talk of our relatives and  friends in england     my romantic notions were soon crushed  our landing gave no pleasure to  these secluded englishmen  they gave us no welcome  but  as our boats  approached the shore  they walked away to their own dwellings  closed  their gates and doors after them  and gazed at us through their windows   and during three days that we passed in a hut quite near them  they  never exchanged one word with any of the party  thus foiled in our hopes  of spending a social day with our compatriots  after our dinner was over  we sent materials for making a bowl of punch up the hill to the chiefs   and spent the remainder of the day surrounded by generous savages  who  were delighted with our company  and who did everything in their power to  make us comfortable  in the course of the afternoon two of the mission  came up to preach  but the savages were so angry with them for not  showing more kindness to their own countrymen  that none would listen to  them     i have visited many of the roman catholic missionary establishments   their priests adopt quite a different line of conduct  they are cheerful  and kind to the savage pagan  and polite and attentive to their european  brethren  they have gained the esteem of those they have been sent to  convert  they have introduced their own language amongst them  which  enables them to have intercourse with strangers  and  however we may  differ in some tenets of religious belief  we must acknowledge the  success of their mission  they have brought nearly the whole of the  indian population in south america into the bosom of their church  and  their converts form the greater part of the people  notwithstanding the  numerous church and sectarian missionaries sent from england  i never met  with one indian converted by them  i have attended mass in an indian  village  a native priest performed the ceremony  and the whole  congregation  except myself  were of his cast and complexion  and  it is  worthy of remark  that in peru  and some of the most populous provinces   a pagan is scarcely to be found             chapter xxxviii     threatened war       we now heard that tetoro  one of the most powerful chiefs of this part of  the island  had taken offence  and had sent a defiance to king george   saying he intended coming to seek revenge  accompanied by a strong body  of warriors  and the  herald  who brought this proclamation informed us  that the english settlers were to be attacked and plundered also     we had every reason to fear this might prove a more calamitous affair  than any we had yet experienced  as george immediately collected all his  family and dependents  and took his departure for the kawakawa river  the  residence of de kookie  the chief who had come to his assistance against  hongi s attack   leaving behind only a few slaves  thus a second time  were we left to our own resources on kororarika beach  george and his  followers were too much scattered  some were trading with the ships   others were distributed in various districts  attending to their  agricultural pursuits  thus separated  each might become an easy prey to  any of the powerful chiefs  but  were they united  they would be too  strong for any of the tribes  unfortunately the hope of gain made them  risk so great a danger  at this period  too  there was not a single  vessel in the bay to protect us  the known partiality of all the tribes  for europeans was the only consolation we had  and we endeavoured to  cheer each other with this hope  under what in reality might be  considered very appalling circumstances     after enduring this state of suspense and anxiety for several days  and  no enemy appearing  we determined to pay a visit to the camp of the  combined army of our friends  which would  at the same time  gratify our  own curiosity  and give them a degree of satisfaction  as it would prove  to them that we were not afraid of venturing amongst them  even in times  of danger  we accordingly prepared the whaleboats to proceed up the  kawakawa river  and  as i had never been there before  the present  afforded an excellent opportunity for exploring that picturesque spot     at the top of the bay of islands  two rivers disembogue  the wye catte  and the kawakawa  they are both small but beautiful streams  it was early  in the morning when we started  the dewy mist rose from the unruffled  bosom of the river like the gradual lifting up of a curtain  and  at  length  displayed its lofty sides  covered with immense trees  the  verdure extending to the very edge of the water  all was quiet   beautiful  and serene  the only sounds which broke the calm were the wild  notes of the tui  or new zealand blackbird   the splashing of our own  oars  or the occasional flight of a wild duck  or shag   disturbed by our  approach     we rowed our boat many miles without seeing the slightest vestige of any  human inhabitants or civilisation  all appeared wild and magnificent as  if just fresh from the hands of nature  and it failed not to lead the  mind up to the contemplation of the creator  it seemed utterly impossible  to reconcile the idea that such lonely  romantic  and sequestered scenes  could conceal hordes of savage cannibals  or that the tranquility of this  very place would soon be exchanged for the noise and tumult of savage  warfare  we soon reached the village where the coalesced chiefs had taken  up their station  they had fortified their position  and were waiting the  approach of the enemy  no sooner  however  was our arrival known  than  all came running down tumultuously to give us welcome  all business was  laid aside to greet our landing  and we were conducted with great  ceremony into the centre of the camp             chapter xxxix     construction of a pa       we found eight hundred warriors  who  to use a sea phrase  were  all at  quarters   the magic pen of scott might here have been well employed to  describe  the gathering   the chiefs sat apart from their followers in  deep consultation  we did not approach near enough to hear their  discussion  but it ended by their paying us a high compliment for coming  amongst them  the young and active were busily employed in constructing a  strong stockade fort to annoy the enemy as he approached  others were  preparing their weapons  or practising the use of arms     the village itself was an object of extreme interest  and  after  contemplating the war like preparations of the chiefs  we turned with  pleasure to gaze on the beauty of the surrounding country  in a plain   surrounded by high hills  with a beautiful stream of water meandering  through it  was situated a group of huts  and many acres of cultivated  ground  neatly fenced and cleared  encircled them  their harvest   consisting of indian corn  potatoes  and kumara  was now ready for  gathering  and all the women were busily occupied  as i from an eminence  looked down upon their labours  i could almost fancy i was in italy  and  beheld the peasantry at work in their vineyards  but the adjacent camp  and naked warriors soon dissipated the illusion     on approaching the village we occasioned quite a commotion  the girls  brought forth baskets filled with cooked kumaras and peaches  while the  men erected a tent to screen us from the rays of the sun  indeed  all  seemed anxious to do something that should prove acceptable to us  we had  brought with us sufficient provision for a good dinner which was soon  cooked  and we invited them to partake of our fare  and a very merry and  noisy group we formed  after our repast  the chief warriors took us round  their camp  and exhibited to us all their means of defence  and the  different works they had thrown up  where the use of artillery is  unknown  the principles of fortification are simple  and the new  zealanders seem to possess a clear notion of the art  necessity being  with them the mother of invention     in the direction where the approach of the enemy was expected  they had  erected a strong square stockade  to molest the army  while the women and  children retired to the principal fort  which was very strong  and  situated at the summit of the highest hill  it had a breast work all  round it about five feet high  and a broad ditch beyond that  the  fortress was large enough to contain several hundred men  it had a  spacious glacis in front  and every approach to it was so completely  exposed  that we thought even a body of regular troops  without  artillery  would have found it very difficult to storm  and to the new  zealand warrior it seemed a wonderful and impregnable work     the chief who had the command of this fort was our old acquaintance kiney  kiney  a younger brother of king george s  who seemed proud of this  honour  and appeared highly delighted in showing us round  and  explaining everything to us  even condescending to ask our advice as to  any means of adding strength and security to the works  he listened  attentively to all our observations  and if he approved any alteration we  suggested he ordered it instantly to be carried into effect  i noticed a  thicket too near the fort  and told him i thought it might shelter a body  of men  and before i left the pa it was reduced to a heap of ashes   sentinels were posted in every direction to give notice of the approach  of an enemy   mr   kiney kiney  as he was sometimes called  was  splendidly apparelled on this occasion  he had  by some means or other   become possessed of a light infantry sabre  with all its paraphernalia of  belts and buckles  this was girded round his naked body  which gave him a  very gallant air  and  i have no doubt  was the envy and admiration of  all his followers             chapter xl     a sham fight       after we had seen and approved all their preparations  we were treated  with a grand review and sham fight  they divided themselves into two  parties  one half the number took their station on a hill  and lay  concealed  the other party crouched on the plains to receive the attack   all kneeling on one knee  with their eyes fixed on the spot whence they  expected the rush of their pretended enemies  in a moment  the concealed  party burst forth from their ambush  with a tremendous and simultaneous  shout  and the mock battle began with great fury     nothing in nature can be imagined more horrible than the noise they make  on these occasions  i have heard  under circumstances of some peril  the  north american indian war whoop  but that is trifling compared with it  and their countenances are hideous beyond description  my principal  astonishment on these occasions was  that they did not actually kill each  other  or  at least  break each other s bones  for they seemed to strike  with all the fury and vigour of a real engagement  but they kept such  exact time  that at a moment s notice they all left off  and began joking  and laughing  except a very few  whom i observed to sneak away to wash  off some bloody witness  or to put a plaster on their broken skin     after these military and gymnastic exhibitions  they formed a grand  assembly  and the chiefs  as usual  made long speeches in rotation  this  rude parliament is one of the most beautiful features in savage  government  all public matters are discussed openly  grievances are  complained of  and justice is summarily administered     thus  after spending a pleasant day  we rose to depart  and took an  affectionate leave of our entertainers  who were most anxious that we  should remain longer  but we thought we had better return to kororarika   where our property had been left  most of the chiefs accompanied us to  our boats  and  after exhibiting various testimonies of their friendly  feeling towards us  they suffered us to depart     the day following this visit  we were alarmed by the appearance of two  war canoes crossing the bay  we waited their approach with considerable  anxiety  what few valuables we had with us we concealed about our  persons  but  as they neared our beach  our fears subsided  on finding  there were only a few men in each  three chiefs  unarmed  landed  whom we  found to be rivers and two of his near kinsmen  the most dreaded persons  of our expected invaders  but they immediately informed us they came on a  mission of peace  and  for that reason  had come to us unattended and  unarmed     we were most happy to hear this  and to find hostilities were again  likely to be deferred  though we well knew the character of these men   and that they were capable of the most treacherous acts  and the deepest  dissimulation  yet  their thus throwing themselves into our power  with  the olive branch in their hands  was irresistible  and we received them  with all the pomp we were capable of  we ordered a pig to be killed for  the feast  and requested them to remain for that night  in order to do  honour to our noble guests  and credit to our friend and ally king  george  we produced all the luxuries we had  and  in addition to the  pork  piles of pancakes and molasses were devoured  after this we gave  them tea  of which they are very fond  and  over our pipes  in the  evening  we informed them of the preparations the coalesced chiefs had  made for their reception  had their intentions been hostile     the next morning they embarked for the camp at kawakawa  where  i  understood  they had considerable difficulty in arranging the  treaty of  peace   george having been so often alarmed  now that such great  preparations had been effected  as he well know the treacherous character  of his foe   he was unwilling to give up the hopes of conquest  however   by the advice of the chiefs  it was finally settled amicably  george and  his friends accordingly returned to kororarika  leaving a strong party at  the pa to finish the fortifications  and  though peace was made  our  party still kept themselves in a posture of defence             chapter xli     return of the brig   an exciting incident       we had been expecting with great anxiety the return of our brig  and   soon after the termination of this affair  we had the pleasure of seeing  her enter the bay  after her cruise from tongataboo and tucopea  we found  that  on leaving the bay of islands  she had touched at the thames  or   as the natives call it  hauraki  in order to land two chiefs  whom  captain dillon had taken thence two years before  and  in the confusion  occasioned by the disembarking  the visiting and congratulations of  friends  the vessel being under weigh   one chief was left on board  who  had not been discovered till all the canoes were out of sight  and there  remained no other alternative for him than to proceed on the whole  voyage     this was of no importance as it respected tongataboo or tucopea  but  on  his return to kororarika  it was not only placing him  but all of us  in  a dreadful dilemma  his tribe being at deadly enmity with that of george   the moment he was seen on deck  which was as soon as the vessel arrived    george and all the men in the various canoes appeared to grow outrageous   nothing would convince them but that we were in league with their  enemies  and had brought this spy into their territories from interested  motives  and they seemed resolved upon boarding the brig and executing  vengeance upon the unfortunate victim  to all our remonstrances george  replied   any other man than this i would have pardoned  but it was only  last year he killed  and helped to eat  my own uncle  whose death still  remains unrevenged  i cannot allow him to leave my country alive  if i  did  i should be despised for ever      i was greatly grieved at the circumstance  but  as i was somewhat of a  favourite with george  i succeeded in convincing him that it arose purely  from accident  and no intention of giving him offence  and he consented  to leave him on board  but cautioned us not to allow him to land   if i  see him on shore he dies   he repeated several times  it would have been  well for us had we attended to this warning  we did not  and we  accordingly infringed on the customs of his country  thus placing  ourselves in a most perilous situation with the natives  and plainly  showing that the imprudence of our countrymen is invariably the cause of  quarrels and misunderstandings with these islanders     some days having passed since this altercation with george  we thought no  more about it  the brig  from various causes  was certain to remain some  time in this harbour  and  as our new zealand guest expressed a great  desire to go on shore one day  we consented to his accompanying us  we  had scarcely entered our house  when we had reason to repent the  imprudent step we had taken  all the natives were in commotion   messengers were sent off to george to acquaint him with the circumstance   and soon after we saw him  attended by all his relations  accoutred for  war  that is  quite naked  their skins oiled and painted  and armed with  muskets  fury was in their looks and gestures as they hastened towards  our residence  we had scarcely time to shut and fasten our door  when  they made a rush to force it  and we had a severe struggle to keep them  out  at one period their rage became so ungovernable that we expected  every instant they would fire on us for preventing their entrance  the  man who was the cause of all this violence crept into our bedroom  and  kept out of sight  but he did not  at any period of the disturbance   exhibit the least sign of fear  so accustomed are they from childhood to  these deadly frays     when the natives found we would not give up the man  but that they must  murder us before they could accomplish their revenge  the disappointment  rendered them nearly frantic  our situation was most critical and  appalling  and nothing can be a more convincing proof of the influence  the europeans have obtained over them  than that  at such a moment  they  should have refrained from setting fire to or pulling down the house  and  sacrificing every one of us  george again remonstrated with us  assuring  us it was his sacred duty to destroy this man  now he was in his  territory  a duty which  he said  he owed to the memory of his murdered  relations  and which must be performed  even though he should sacrifice  his  good english friends   he cautioned us not to stand between him and  his enemy  who must die before the sun set  pointing  at the same time   to that luminary  and ordering his slaves to kindle a large fire to roast  him on  finally  he and his friends planted themselves all round the  house to prevent the escape of their victim  thus were we environed with  fifty or sixty well armed and exasperated savages     our imprudence had given us no other alternative than either to give up  the man  who had put himself under our protection  or still to defend him  at the risk of our own lives  we instantly adopted the latter course   fortunately for us  a whaler was lying in the harbour  and a party of her  men were then on shore in the neighbourhood procuring water  we had sent  to them to explain the nature of our situation  and we saw them coming to  our assistance  though the numbers of natives at this time assembled  totally precluded all chance of our getting off by force  and a variety  of schemes were suggested as to how we should save the man s life  and  get clear of this difficulty  without sacrificing the good opinion we  were held in by the natives     we were well aware of the great importance it was to george to continue  on friendly terms with the english vessels touching here  as they not  only afforded him various sources of considerable profit  but the  intercourse gave him great importance in the eyes of his countrymen  and  we determined to make this circumstance a means of saving the man s life   as we suspected that a threat of removing the seat of trade would soon  make him compromise his revenge for his interest     we therefore sent him a formal message  that  if he was resolved to kill  his enemy in our house  we had determined not to prevent him  but that we  would not stay to witness such a cruelty  and that we should immediately  remove every thing we possessed on board ship  leave the bay of islands   and seek the protection and shelter of some other chief  and  if he  compelled us to do so  no other british ship would ever be seen at  kororarika     we accordingly ordered the ship s boats ashore  and our things were  quickly conveyed into them  i trembled when i looked on the natives  and  saw the rage depicted on their countenances  and i  trusting in  providence to avert from me the dreadful death with which i saw myself  threatened  prepared myself for some fatal catastrophe  tumultuous  discussions ensued  and it at length became difficult for the elders to  restrain the impetuosity of the younger chiefs  fortunately for us  their  vehement speeches soon produced a violent feud amongst themselves  mutual  upbraidings took place  each accused the other of being the cause of  quarrel  and the consequent loss of the white men  this was precisely the  state of things we wished for  and  while we were waiting the return of  the last boat  a messenger came from the elder chiefs  to propose an  amicable adjustment of the affair  the chiefs promised that  if we would  reland our goods and remain with them  the man we protected should go  without molestation on board the brig  but  if we persevered in leaving  them  the man should be killed before our eyes  this was what we  expected  and though i really now wished to leave them  being quite tired  of these perpetual broils  we assented  in order that the man s life  might be spared when they found we agreed to their proposal  they  retreated out of sight  thereby carefully avoiding polluting their eyes  by looking upon their enemy     no sooner had they disappeared than i visited the poor fellow who had  been the cause of all this disturbance  he seemed half dead with anxiety   but i soon revived him with the information that all was settled  amicably  and we lost no time in getting him off  which we safely  accomplished  though  as the boat which conveyed him left the shore  a  bullet whizzed close by me  aimed  no doubt  by some young fiery chief   who had concealed himself in the bushes for that purpose     during this transaction i witnessed the natural kindness of heart and  disinterested tenderness of the female sex  no matter how distressing the  circumstance or appalling the danger  they are  in all countries  the  last to forsake man  while the enraged chiefs were yelling outside our  house  and all our exertions could scarcely prevent them from making a  forcible entry  all the women were sitting with  and trying to comfort  the unhappy cause of this calamity  they had cooked for him a delicate  dinner  brought him fruit  and were using every means by which they could  keep up his spirits and buoy up his hopes  confidently assuring him the  white men would not yield him up to his ferocious foes  notwithstanding  all their exertions  he was miserable  till informed by me of his safety   and i received the warmest thanks  and even blessings  from his  fair   friends  as if i had conferred upon each a personal favour     the man being now in safety  we determined to demand satisfaction for the  affront which had been put upon us  and we sent george word we could not  again receive him into our house unless he made an ample apology for his  behaviour  painting in strong colours how deeply our feelings had been  wounded  and how much this indignity had lowered us in the esteem of all  our acquaintances     after some consultation among their leading men upon the subject of our  message  king george presented himself at the door of our hut  and  in  the most humble manner  surrendered his musket  and shortly after his  brother kiney kiney did the same  thus we gained our point  and received  both payment and apologies for their violent behaviour  friendship being  thus restored  we soon gave them back their muskets  to their infinite  surprise and satisfaction     on reflection  i felt quite convinced that the natives liked us the  better for what we had done  it afforded them also a lesson of humanity   for they all well knew we had no other object in view when we stood  forward to defend the poor fellow  who had relied upon our promise of  protecting him  several chiefs told us that they greatly admired our  principles  and should always feel themselves quite safe with men like  us  who would risk their own lives rather than break their word  or  desert a friend in the hour of danger     at the close of this eventful day we received another token of peace   which was in its manner simple and affecting  and not such as could have  been expected from a nation of savages  a procession of young girls  approached our door  each bearing a basket  some were filled with nicely  cooked potatoes  others with various fruits and flowers  which they set  down before us  chanting  in a low voice  a song in praise of our recent  exploit  a man bearing a very large fish closed the procession  he  repeated the song also  we were informed that these presents had been  sent by king george as a ratification of friendship  for the new  zealanders never think a reconciliation perfected till you have again  eaten and drank with them     two important conclusions may be drawn from the termination of this  affair  first  that if a spirited interference takes place on the part of  the europeans  murder may be at times prevented  as we actually rescued  a mortal foe from the vengeance of an exasperated enemy  and  secondly   their efforts to restore amity proves their extreme desire to have white  people settle amongst them     about a week after this event we witnessed a most extraordinary ceremony   which partook more of the ludicrous than the horrible  though i have no  doubt it was regarded by the natives as a most solemn affair  for some  days we had been honoured by the presence of a great priest  or one of  their chief tabooers  he came for the purpose of discussing with the  chiefs the affairs of the nation  particularly the approaching war with  the tribe of the thames  and the day set apart for the discussion of the  principal points was ushered in by a rich feast  not of pork nor fish   nor even the kumara  but of two old  sturdy  large dogs     i was much surprised on rising one morning to see kiney kiney  with  several chiefs of the highest rank  stripped  and performing the offices  of the meanest slave  the washing the feet of the pilgrims by cardinals  and persons of rank in rome came instantly to my remembrance   these  chiefs were making a fire and cooking  i was still more astonished  on  approaching them  to find the nature of the food they were singeing and  scraping  this bow wow meat they were preparing after the fashion of  pork  pigs being the only quadruped they have ever seen cooked  they of  course are not acquainted with any other way of dressing the animal  creation  and a sad bungling job they made of it  for the dogs were old  and tough  and the hair adhered most pertinaciously to the skin  and in  many places would not come off     there were only five persons allowed to partake of this delicious meal   which was  as well as the five partakers  strictly taboo d for the whole  of that day  and we strongly recommended them to hold a similar feast  every day  until they had cleared the country of these canine nuisances   the dogs being the greatest pests they have             chapter xlii     war like expedition to the thames       one morning i was roused out of a sound sleep by continued discharges of  musketry from a number of war canoes  i jumped up instantly in alarm  but  i soon discovered them to be atoi and his party  who had been absent  about two months on a war like expedition to the thames  and they were now  returning successful     i had witnessed the departure of this expedition  and considered it in  the light of a reconnoitring party  i could not make out what the real  object was they had been in search of  but  wherever they had been  they  had been victorious  for they now returned with quantities of plunder   human heads  human flesh  and many prisoners  after the dance and sham  fight had been duly gone through  they proceeded to land their cargo of  spoil  first came a group of miserable creatures  women and children   torn by violence from their native homes  henceforth to be the slaves of  their conquerors  some were miserably wounded and lacerated  others  looked half starved  but all seemed wretched and dejected     the women of kororarika  with their usual humanity  instantly surrounded  them  and endeavoured to console them  and then shed abundance of tears  over them  i enquired of one of the warriors what they had done with the  male prisoners  he coolly replied  they had all been eaten  except some   titbits   which had been packed up in the baskets and brought on shore   in order to regale particular friends and favourites     they had also brought with them several heads  which they have the art of  preparing in their native ovens  so as not to disfigure the countenance  nor injure the figure tatoo d upon them  one of these  the skull of a  distinguished chief  seemed to afford them amazing delight  most of our  people had known him well  and several of his near relations were  present  but cruel war seemed to have eradicated every feeling of  humanity  for all appeared to contemplate this ghastly object with great  satisfaction  these heads were decorated profusely with yellow and red  ribbons  and with white feathers  they were then stuck upon short poles   and placed  with great ceremony  in front of the old queen turero s  house  who  sitting at the door  received this token of respect with  approval and condescension     the group altogether formed an interesting picture of savage manners  in  which ferocity was strongly blended with humanity  for their respect and  devotion to the old sybil was manifested as feelingly as their hatred  towards those whom they call their enemies  in fact  the young warrior  chiefs presenting to her  as was the case with several  their first  spoils of conquest  reminded me of young lions bringing part of the  spoils of the chase to their aged dam     in this affray only a few of atoi s party had been wounded  and  twenty five of the enemy had been killed  it was a fortunate circumstance  for the wretched prisoners that none of the conquering party had been  killed  for  if that had been the case  there would have been a dreadful  slaughter of the captives on their arrival at the village  an act of  cruelty never dispensed with  this sight i dreaded i should encounter  when i went to witness the disembarkation  but  hoping that my presence  might be some restraint upon their barbarities  i awaited the result with  as much firmness as i was master of      illustration  old pa and whalers at bay of islands              chapter xliii     visits of whalers       two south sea whalers were at this time lying in the bay  the anne  from  london  a full ship  and the lynx  from sydney  since i have been living  here  five vessels of this description have visited us  and many others  would have touched here but for the want of proper regulations  and a  dread of the dispositions of the natives  there being here no  representatives of the british government  the crews of whalers are often  involved in disputes with the natives  this want of government support  has also frightened other vessels away  their commanders preferring going  on to port jackson  where they half ruin themselves by the unavoidable  expenses they incur  even when their vessels have anchored here  the  thoughtlessness and eccentricity of this class of men  when they are  under no restraint or control  has sometimes not only led to disputes  with the natives  but with each other  which eventually have proved  equally detrimental  in short  new zealand is a place of such vast  importance to so many lucrative branches of british trade  that it must  be well worthy the speedy attention of our government at home     we spoke frequently to our friend george  as well as to several other of  their powerful chiefs  respecting the erection of a small fort with a  british garrison  and of permanently hoisting the english flag  they  always expressed the utmost delight at the idea  and  from all i have  seen of them  i feel convinced it would prove a most politic measure   george  who had visited port jackson  said   this country is finer than  port jackson  yet the english go and settle there  our people are much  better than the black natives of new south wales  and yet you english  live amongst them in preference to us      the ship anne  captain gray  was out three years  and during that period  she never entered a civilised port  she had touched twice at this bay   and had cruised four months on the coast of japan  off timor  through the  sandwich and friendly islands  and passed several times over the pacific  ocean  in order to obtain a cargo of sperm oil  which she at length  accomplished  and was at this time here to refit for her voyage home to  england round cape horn  having picked up most of her cargo off this  port     for twelve years past  notwithstanding all the disadvantages  this has  been the favourite resort for ships in the above mentioned trade  here   surrounded with savages and cannibals  they heave down their vessels   land the cargoes and stores  and carry on work  both on board and on  shore  in tolerable security  the safety of the harbour  the facility of  wooding and watering  the supplies of pigs and potatoes  tempt them to  run the risk of placing themselves in the power of capricious and  barbarous people     it has been imagined that the residence of missionaries would have the  effect of civilising the natives  and adding to the safety of ships  touching here  but experience fully proves the fallacy of such an  expectation  these people  abstracted by their own gloomy reflections   look with contempt on all who are in the pursuit of  worldly wealth   and  regard the arrival of a whaler as an enemy coming to interfere with the  spiritual interests of  their flock   as they term the inhabitants   though i never yet saw one proselyte of their converting     they never visit a whaler except on a sunday  and then it is to beg for  the benefit of their society  it cannot  therefore  be expected that much  sympathy can exist between parties  where the cold formality of one  excites the contempt and disgust of the other     the ship anne  of which i have formerly spoken  arrived here lately from  wahoo  one of the sandwich islands  which possesses the advantage of a  british consul  the pacific disposition and orderly government of the  natives do not require a british garrison  or any war like force  and of  the excellent effects produced by this representation of our government  captain gray speaks with admiration and enthusiasm  the harbours were  crowded with shipping  houses  nay  even streets  were beginning to  appear  the savage character of the people was gradually subsiding into  industrious and peaceful occupations  and comfort and prosperity were  spreading their benign influence over the whole island  yet wahoo is not  nearly so well situated as a rendezvous for south sea whalers as new  zealand  at least so i have been informed by all the captains of those  ships who have conversed with me on the subject     it is rather a remarkable and novel circumstance that the natives  who  have been now for fourteen or fifteen years in close intercourse and  carrying on traffic with europeans  should not  in the course of that  period  understand the nature and value of money  a laughable instance of  which occurred to us a few days since  a native came to our house with a  serious countenance and business like manner  and said he wished to  purchase a musket  we asked to see what he had brought in exchange for  one  when  with great ceremony  he produced a copper penny piece in the  way of payment  the poor fellow had  doubtless  seen some one pass a  doubloon  and had mistaken his penny for one  as a doubloon is about the  price given for a musket in our regulated list of charges  we  of course   refrained from laughter  but he was quite astonished and mortified when  he was made to understand we could not trade with him  he took a stroll  round the beach  offering his penny  by way of barter  to every white man  he met  but everywhere with equally bad success           chapter xliv     visit of two south sea islanders       when our brig left tucopea she brought away two natives of that island   who had most earnestly entreated the captain to take them off  and leave  them upon any other land he pleased  as  according to their statement   tucopea was so overstocked with inhabitants that it was scarcely possible  to find subsistence  and the scarcity of food had become so general  that  parents destroyed their children rather than witness their sufferings  from famine  captain kent  therefore  from motives of compassion   received them on board his ship  and  not having touched at any inhabited  spot  brought them with him here  their extraordinary appearance excited  a great deal of surprise  both among europeans and new zealanders  they  appeared simple  timid creatures  though stout and comely  but their hair  was unlike anything i had before beheld  as in length it reached below  the waist  and was so abundantly thick as completely to conceal their  faces  by some curious chemical process which the natives of tucopea have  discovered  they render their hair a bright sulphur colour  and  as this  mass of yellow hangs over their faces and shoulders  they bear the most  striking resemblance to the lion monkeys of the brazils     these poor creatures  upon landing  shook with fear  and trembled greatly  when they beheld the new zealanders  whose character for cannibalism had  reached even their remote island  when our friend george went up to them   and lifted up  in order to examine closely  the curious mass of hair in  which they were enveloped  they burst into a passionate fit of tears  and  ran up to us for protection  the new zealanders  with characteristic  cunning  perceiving the horror they had created  tormented them still  more cruelly  by making grotesque signs  as if they were about to  commence devouring them  and  at the same time  like most savages    evincing the most sovereign contempt for them  from their apparent  pusillanimity     after they had been some days on shore  we had a very diverting scene  with them  which exhibited strongly the great difference there is in the  nature of the two classes of savages we now had such opportunities of  observing  i had brought my violin from sydney  on which i used to play  occasionally  the new zealanders generally expressed the greatest dislike  to it  and my companions used to rally me much on the subject  saying it  was not that the savages did not like music  but it was my discordant  playing that frightened them away  which might be true  it was  however   a useful discovery for us all  as i often took that method of civilly  driving them out of our house when we grew tired of their company  but  when i began to play before the tucopeans  the effect it had instantly  upon them was ludicrous in the extreme  they sprang up  and began dancing  most furiously  at the same time  so waving their heads about as to keep  their long hair extended at its fullest length  as i played faster  they  quickened their pace  a lively scotch reel seemed to render them nearly  frantic  and when i ceased playing  they threw themselves down on the  floor quite exhausted  and unable to articulate a word  i have observed   generally speaking  that savages are not much affected by music  but  these two tucopeans were excited to a most extraordinary degree             chapter xlv     the death of hongi       we at length received authentic intelligence of the death of the  celebrated hongi  finding his dissolution fast approaching  he convened a  meeting of all the neighbouring chiefs  and as many as could reach the  spot in time attended  the wounded warrior expired  surrounded by the men  he had so frequently led to battle and conquest  after the numerous and  desperate risks he had run  the many encounters he had sustained with  various enemies  it appeared extraordinary to us europeans that he should  die quietly in his hut  it is the custom to keep a guarded and mysterious  silence relating to the subjects which are spoken of by a dying chief  i  questioned several who had attended hongi  all spoke with the greatest  solemnity of his last moments  one sentence  uttered by him  was all i  could obtain after much manoeuvring  and that was spoken but a few  minutes before he breathed his last  which was  that  shulitea  viz   our  friend george  would not live one week longer than himself   but  as our  patron was in perfect health at the time  and all seemed peaceful around  him  i only laughed at the improbability of the prophecy being fulfilled     the natives of new zealand pay the greatest respect to courage and  war like talents  these were the only distinguishing characteristics of  hongi  yet  by possessing these  he was more feared  and had a greater  number of followers  than any other chief in the island  his hereditary  possessions were but small  and his name was little known  yet his  undaunted courage  his skill  and success in many sanguinary battles   made him  at length  a most powerful chief  and obtained for him that  which is considered wealth in this country  namely  an immense number of  slaves  in his last moments he was attended by more men of rank than had  ever before assembled to witness the dissolution of a warrior  and this  is considered the greatest proof of attention and respect one chieftain  can show towards another             chapter xlvi     a tribal conflict       our brig now sailed for hokianga to take in a cargo of planks  and my  friend  mr  shand  being tired of wandering  accompanied her  but i   being still anxious to procure more sketches of this interesting country   determined to remain as long as possible  and to take one more walk  across the island  and join the brig by the time she was loaded  i was  preparing to start on my last pedestrian tour  when a chain of events  occurred which threw all the tribes into confusion  bloodshed and  devastation stared me in the face from all quarters  and from the state  of security i had imagined myself to be in  i was roused to behold myself  beset with difficulties  to crown which  our brig  which would have been  a place of safety and refuge  was now on the opposite side of the island     arising from a trifling circumstance  which was partly caused by us   though innocently  pomare s only son had lost his life  and  as is usual  among savage tribes  the severest retaliation soon took place     by relating the particulars  the reader will perceive how easily the  war cry is raised among these turbulent savages     pomare s only surviving son  tiki  was a very finely formed  handsome  young man  of twenty years of age  and he had made an arrangement with a  captain of a ship here to supply him with a certain number of hogs   accordingly  accompanied by a party of his friends  he started into the  interior for the purpose of collecting them  in making his selection  he  not only proceeded to drive off some of his own  but actually laid claim  to  and began marching away with  some belonging to his neighbours  the  right owners remonstrated with him in vain  he  being an insolent   over bearing young fellow  persisted in his unjust claims  and set them  all at defiance  they were compelled to yield up their property  as his  tribe was a most powerful one  and tiki was driving away the stolen hogs  in triumph  when a sudden stop was put to his predatory career  finding  words were of no avail to induce the young man to restore the swine  one  of the injured party had recourse to a musket  a bullet  aimed from  behind a tree  killed tiki on the spot  but from whose hand it came could  only be conjectured  the greatest confusion instantly took place  his  companions  being well armed  the war cry was immediately raised  and the  fray becoming general  seven more lives were lost     when the account of this melancholy affair reached our beach  everyone  flew to arms  even all the women  for the young man was a general  favourite  the war cry spread in every direction   here   they exclaimed    is the last of the pomare family killed treacherously  a warrior related  to and connected with every chief of consequence in the country  and a  nephew of the great shulitea   the cry for blood and revenge was  universal  i must confess that  added to the danger it placed me in  i  was much shocked when i heard of the fate of poor tiki  for he was one of  our particular friends  and had passed many an evening in our hut  i had  taken leave of him only the day before  when he had set out  full of  health and spirits  on this hog expedition  which had terminated thus  fatally     the death of this young man excited the highest indignation in the minds  of his countrymen  as well as in those of his numerous intimate friends  and relations  for a report was industriously circulated that he had  fallen by the hands of a slave  this was considered by his tribe as a  degradation infinitely worse than the murder itself  the offended chiefs  assembled on our beach  with all their followers  armed  and none  appeared more indignant at the transaction than our friend george  who   with his brother kiney kiney  placed themselves at the head of the party   to revenge the insult which had been offered them     the night before they started on this expedition  george spent the  evening with us  he was in particularly low spirits  and said he did not  at all like the business he was going upon  but  as he was the nearest  relation of the deceased  and the eldest of the tribe  he went in hopes  of being able to prevent a great effusion of blood  and also to restrain  the impetuosity of the young men  little did we then think he would be  the first victim  although his unusual depression of mind brought to my  remembrance the prophecy of hongi  and  spite of my endeavours to banish  my forebodings  i felt convinced that the prediction would in all  probability be fulfilled     three days had elapsed from the time the avenging party had gone on their  mission  when  at midnight  a messenger  faint and nearly exhausted   arrived on our beach with the following dreadful intelligence  and that  night no other sounds were heard than those of agony and woe  the yelling  of women  and the shrieks of slaves     the substance of the man s information was  that george and the offending  party had met  but  as several days had passed since the murder of their  friend  their feelings were in some degree appeased  and they had  contented themselves with a general plunder of whatever property their  enemies possessed  they had spared their lives  and the outrage was  considered as atoned for  the chiefs were on their return home  laden  with spoil  when  like other coalesced armies  disagreements began to  take place among themselves  and discord long smothered  broke out in  every quarter of the camp     george  the principal person of their party  was the one marked to be  dissatisfied with  all were jealous of him  in consequence of his  possessions at kororarika giving him such a decided advantage over every  other tribe  by his trade and intercourse with europeans  it is probable   also  that as the other tribes went forth with an intention to fight   they were resolved not to be disappointed  and therefore determined to  create a feud among themselves  rather than return home devoid of the  pleasures or the trophies of a combat     some irritating language had been uttered by both sides  when an accident  of a fatal nature took place  which produced an instantaneous and general  appeal to arms  at the close of the day a halt was made  as usual  and  each party began erecting their temporary huts to pass the night in  one  of george s wives  assisted by a little boy  his nephew  was busily  engaged in constructing one  arms and baggage of every description being  strewed about in all directions  at this period a lad took up one of  george s muskets  and began to play with it  but not understanding the  management of it  he  by his injudicious handling  accidentally  discharged the piece  and killed both the wife and nephew  the ball  passing through both their bodies     the sensation produced by this unfortunate accident may readily be  conceived  as the woman who was killed was related to the tribe who had  been disputing with george all day  her death furnished an ostensible  motive for open war  and before the real cause of the accident could be  explained  another shot was fired  which wounded a chief of the name of  moo de wy in the thigh  this proved the signal for a general fight  each  party ran to their arms  ranged themselves under their different leaders   and a general discharge of muskets immediately took place     almost at the beginning of the combat george received a shot  which broke  both his legs  his brother and friends endeavoured to support him in  their arms  it being then nearly dark  added much to the confusion  as it  was difficult to distinguish friend from foe  indeed  so sudden had been  the onset  that many could scarcely have been aware of the cause of the  contest  but our unhappy friend  who seemed particularly marked out in  this unfortunate affray  soon after received another bullet  which struck  him on the throat  and terminated his existence  thus dying before a week  had passed since the death of his rival hongi  i heard from one of his  friends who supported him in his last moments  that he died like a hero   finding both his legs were broken  and that consequently he was totally  unable to move  he begged those friends who were about him to leave him  to his fate  and either again enter the fight  or make their escape  while they yet had time  he then gave his musket to one  took off his  mantle to present to another  and while thus in the act of exhorting his  friends and distributing amongst them his tokens of regard  he received  his death wound  and expired without a groan  when george fell  a general  flight took place  and though the engagement had lasted but a short time   great numbers had fallen on both sides             chapter xlvii     the death of king george and its consequences       this news caused mourning and lamentation along our beach  and filled all  the europeans with dismay  we could not calculate the extent of the  injury we might receive  but felt certain we should be considerable  sufferers in some way or other  the light of day seemed to add to  rather  than to diminish  the moans of george s faithful subjects  the violent  sobbings from every dwelling were most dismal  groups were scattered  about  forming small crying parties  and cutting their skins deeply with  knives and pieces of broken glass  in short  nothing was heard but  yelling and groaning  and nothing was seen but streams of blood     but however shocked i might feel by the train of accidents and deaths  which had made such cruel havoc amongst my friends  and notwithstanding  my sincere grief and regret for the fate of poor george  who was a most  humane and intelligent chief  and particularly kind to all the english   the predicament in which i was now placed demanded all my energies  for i  felt that i stood in a situation of great danger     i have before noticed their barbarous custom  on the death of a chief  of  plundering his family and friends  as we had always been considered as a  part of george s family  living under his protection  adopted by him   and admitted into his tribe  i entertained great suspicions that we also  should be sufferers by the general plunder about to take place  besides   i was so circumstanced as to be obliged to cross the country with all my  goods  and my route lay through the territories of all those chiefs who  had been fighting against george  and i was at no loss to guess in what  light they would regard me  depending  too securely  on the general  tranquility  i had not sent my luggage by sea  as i might have done  and  which would have saved me great anxiety  as i should have ventured alone  without fear  but could not manage to carry what i possessed  and to  engage any to convey them was an impossibility  for the moment i made the  proposition to any  even the meanest of the slaves  to accompany me  they  ran off into the bush  nor could any entreaty  presents  or threats  induce them to venture with me  so  for security  i removed all the  property i had  and went with it on board the marianne  whaler     for three days after the death of george  all gave themselves up to  grief  no work was done  and not an individual was to be seen but in an  agony of tears  i began to feel strangely affected with melancholy  myself  when  on the fourth morning  a scene of bustle took place  and  low spirits were banished by tumult  noise  and confusion     at six o clock on that morning we discovered upwards of twenty sail of  war canoes  crowded with armed warriors  coming into the bay  what their  intentions were we could not imagine  but for fear of the worst  the  ships in the harbour shotted their guns  and when the canoes were abreast  of us  we fired a blank one over their heads  on this they all stopped   and we saw some stir amongst them  at length a very small canoe left the  main body  and pulled directly towards us  it contained the chief persons  of the expedition  they came on board  and assured us they meant no harm  to any persons  they were merely some of the late george s friends  who  were going to pay a visit of condolence to his relations  and  after  making a most hearty breakfast with us  they went on shore  and we  accompanied them     whether the account they gave of themselves was correct  or the reverse   we knew not at the time  but we felt assured their intentions were not  hostile towards us europeans  and their quarrels with each other we were  determined not to interfere in  we soon discovered their falsehood  for  george s eldest daughter informed me that amongst the chiefs who landed  with us were several of the most inveterate foes of her father  and that  they were only restrained from committing the most dreadful outrages  and  carrying off all her relations as slaves  by witnessing the many friends  of george by whom they were surrounded  the day was spent in savage  dancing  yelling  making speeches  and debating as to who the proper  person was to succeed george in his dignities  several times i thought  the affair would end in blows  george s relation  rivers  made great  exertions  to keep the peace   and finally  by force of argument   succeeded  it was at length unanimously agreed that kiney kiney was to  succeed his brother  and that rivers should take the command until the  time of kiney kiney s mourning for the loss of george should be  completed             chapter xlviii     departure from bay of islands       after these important matters were amicably disposed of  i made a sign to  rivers  and  separating him from the crowd  i explained to him the nature  of my situation  and asked his assistance in getting me safely over to  hokianga  he replied  there would certainly be great danger in attempting  it  but i soon discovered that he magnified the difficulties in order to  increase his demand for payment  for even the greatest chiefs have here  their price  he said  and i had every reason to think he was correct   that i ran no risk of being molested by any chiefs  like himself  who  would always protect rather than molest every european  but that the  country being in such a state of commotion  in consequence of the late  events  it was full of runaway slaves  who always took advantage of such  times to make their escape  and if i chanced to fall in with any of them   i should be exposed to great peril   however  he added   keep up your  spirits  i have two confidential slaves  who shall conduct you over  and  carry your luggage  if you will make me a present of a stocking full of  powder  a bag of small shot  and a powder horn   he also proposed  as he  himself was going to the kirikiri  and thence to a village in the  interior  to meet a large assemblage of chiefs  in order to talk over the  late tragical events  that i should journey the first part of my way  with him  in his own canoe     accordingly  after having made preparations for my departure  i took  leave of all my friends at the bay of islands  both civilised and savage   i must say i felt considerable regret when i found myself really going to  take final leave of several native families  with whom i had been on  terms of intimacy since my residence here  from whom i had received many  proofs of personal regard  and whom  i felt convinced  i should never  meet or hear of more  none i regretted parting with more than the family  of poor shulitea  the mere sight of me seemed to rekindle all their grief  for the loss of their kinsman  and to remind them more forcibly than ever  of his tragical fate  his mother  old turero  in point of grief  had  rivalled niobe  she had never ceased weeping and lamenting from the time  she heard of her son s death  and had twice attempted to strangle  herself  but even in the midst of her passionate sorrow  i could scarcely  refrain from laughing  while observing her care and anxiety to get all  she could from me  after deploring the sad fate of her dear son   you  know   she continued   you promised him that you would send him a  handsome new musket from sydney  and now  poor fellow  he is dead  and  cannot shoot with it  but then you must remember that his brother kiney  kiney is still alive  and he can shoot with it  and poor george would  wish that his brother should have his new musket   this speech i felt  quite irresistible  therefore  in order to comfort the old queen  i  promised that i would send the musket for her second son  which  declaration seemed to afford her great consolation  and considerably  abated the violence of her grief     just at the dawn of morning we started from the bay in rivers  canoe   accompanied by his wife  one child  and the two stout slaves he had  mentioned to me  my luggage  which consisted of one leathern portmanteau  and my bed  was placed in the centre  i had also provided myself with a  small basket of cooked meat  with bread  and a small bottle of brandy   which was given me by the captain of one of the whalers  the day broke  around us with more than usual brightness  the dewy mists of night were  just rising from the waters  and the huge and abrupt forms of the  mountains were beginning to develop themselves  flights of wild ducks and  stray birds skimmed rapidly by us  the thoughts that crowded my mind were  strange and varied  while contemplating scenes of such tranquil beauty as  were now presented  glowing with the tints of the rising sun  i  contrasted these with the difficulties and dangers i might have to  encounter from hordes of ferocious savages  who  now flushed with  conquest  were plotting murder and destruction against each other  even a  glance at my companions banished all peaceful illusions  while the wife   son  and slaves were using the paddles with the greatest exertions   rivers was carefully examining his weapons  the beauty of the morning and  the romantic scenery was unnoticed  his thoughts were directed solely to  contemplating the depth and the width of my stocking of powder  which  seemed to afford him infinite satisfaction  he had with him a beautiful  double barrelled gun  and a very good tower musket  and seeing so many  wild ducks fly past  he drew the bullet out of one of the barrels of the  former  and  with some of my stock of small shot  fired occasionally  amongst them     at about eight o clock a light sea breeze sprang up  they then set their  sail  and all went to sleep  excepting one slave  who was employed to  steer the canoe  so that i had ample time to ruminate upon my solitary  and perilous situation  the tide failed us at twelve o clock  and we then  went on shore  kindled a fire  and soon collected such a supply of  shell fish as furnished us a splendid repast  here we remained till the  flood tide set in strong  when  again hoisting our sail  we arrived at  the kirikiri about sunset     i here found the missionaries in the greatest consternation and dismay   and learned that it was one of the chiefs of hokianga who had shot  george  and they dreaded lest the result of that deed should be that the  whole of the savage tribes on that part of the island would be opposed to  each other  that combats would ensue  and which side soever might be  victorious  it would prove equally injurious to them  as they had  settlements on both sides of the island  but their greatest alarm was  occasioned by their possessions at hokianga  as the most violent  depredations were there being committed  and as this was the very point  of my destination  the news was not very consolatory to me   so anxious    said one of  the brethren  to me   were we to inform our christian  brethren of our danger  that we actually gave a  warm piece  to a native  to carry a letter over to you  although that is strictly contrary to our  orders   i expressed a desire to know what he meant by a  warm piece   he  kicked his foot against the stock of a gun i had at the time in my hand   and  looking at me with an expression of the greatest contempt  said   it  is what  you worldly  folks call a musket      they were making considerable preparations to repair to the great meeting  of the chiefs  to which rivers was journeying  this was a wise and  politic measure for them to pursue  and they were highly delighted to  have such an addition to their party as this well known chief  and though  they would not acknowledge it  their satisfaction was very visible  i  earnestly requested them to inform me candidly  from all they had heard   whether they thought i might  with safety  venture across the country   but i could get nothing from them but vague and mysterious answers  one  thing  however  they made me very clearly understand  which was  that  they neither cared for me nor for my drawings  that their own safety  engrossed all their thoughts  and that a worldly minded  misguided  creature like me was but as dust in the balance  compared to such godly  people as themselves  who were now placed in jeopardy  they  without  scruple  applied quotations from the scriptures to themselves  such as    why do the heathen so furiously rage   etc   etc     my necessities compelled me to request a favour from them  which was   that they would allow one of their boys  who could speak english  to  accompany me  as our loads were heavy  and his being known to belong to  their establishment i thought might be some protection  but the short  answer of the monosyllable   no   soon made me repent having asked it  i  spread my bed in one of their empty rooms  and started at daybreak next  morning  with my two native slaves  i could not banish from my  remembrance the inhospitable conduct of these missionaries  they never  even inquired whether i had any provision for a journey they themselves  would not have dared to undertake  which was evident by their giving a  native a  warm piece  for merely taking a letter for them  as my shoes  were nearly worn out  and i had a long distance to go  over execrable  roads  i had intended asking them for a new pair  as they had abundance  of everything of the kind sent to them from england  to distribute to the  needy  and i fully came under that description of character   but finding  them so selfish and cold hearted  and meeting with one refusal  i  refrained  and set off  literally almost barefooted             chapter xlix     the journey to hokianga       we journeyed on all day by a road i had never been before  my attendants  evidently taking by paths to avoid meeting stragglers or runaways  i was  well laden  having to carry my musket and my basket of provisions  and  each of my men  in addition to the loads i had placed on his shoulders   bore a basket of potatoes  once or twice  during our route  we saw some  persons at a distance  and i was sorry to notice the great alarm it  occasioned to my companions  as i now had every reason to apprehend   that  in case of danger  they would slip off their burdens  make their  escape  and leave me and my baggage to my fate  which the missionaries  had told me they considered a thing very likely to happen  once we heard  a great firing of muskets  which i afterwards ascertained to be the  feu  de joie  fired at the first meeting of the chiefs  at their grand  assembling in the neutral village     at night  we arrived safe at patuone s village  where i had slept on my  first journey across the island  but it now presented a very different  appearance to what it had done then  instead of the tumult i had formerly  heard  all was silence  the numerous families then there  all fully  occupied  were exchanged for a few old surly looking slaves  and the  huts were all deserted  the inhabitants  in consequence of the rumour of  approaching war  having betaken themselves to one of their fortified pas   i had no alternative but to pass the night with these suspicious looking  creatures  who  feeling themselves beyond the control of their cruel  masters  soon gave way to their own vile passions  and became most  impertinent and intrusive  taking every advantage of my loneliness to  indulge their curiosity and familiarity     on my arrival  i had deposited my things in one of the empty huts  and  spread my bed  hoping to enjoy the luxury of a few hours  repose after  the fatigue and great anxieties of the day  but these fellows would force  themselves into the hut i had chosen  where they lighted a fire  and sat  chattering around it all the night long  finding that i did not appear  alarmed at their intrusion or noise  they kept doing everything they  could think of to rouse my fears  they threatened to break open my  portmanteau  and one old wretch sharpened his knife  and made motions as  though he were going to cut my throat and eat me  i knew my only chance  of safety was not to betray any sign of apprehension  so i forced a  laugh  and made them believe i considered their tricks an excellent joke   i gave them all my tobacco to keep them in good humour  but i passed a  most miserable night  nearly suffocated with smoke  distracted with their  noise  and annoyed by vermin of every description     i was most happy when daybreak gave me an excuse for leaving these brutal  savages  and resuming my journey  every step i took brought before me  proofs of the horrors of war  villages which had been crowded  were now  entirely desolate  and  in many instances  burned to the ground  on that  spot where i had left a party of enterprising scotchmen busily employed  in sawing timber  with crowds of natives assisting them  all was quiet  and totally deserted  with the exception of a few nearly starved   wretched looking dogs  who  hearing someone approach  came out  and tried  to bark at us  but were too weak to utter a sound             chapter l     european preparations for defence       our march along the banks of the river was through a most beautiful  country  but all the inhabitants had fled  their plantations were in a  most luxuriant state  fields which i had left bare and uncultivated were  now covered with indian corn standing higher than my head  the ripe ears  hanging fantastically in all directions  and none to gather in the  harvest  the crops of kumara and potatoes were equally abundant  i could  not help thinking that  if they expected an invasion of their enemies   they had left an ample supply of forage for their use  in the evening i  arrived at horeke  or deptford dock yard  of which i made mention in my  first journey   i here found my countrymen in a state of considerable  embarrassment  the various chiefs of that district had encamped all round  them  so near to them had they taken up their position  that  whatever  might be the result of their battles  the european settlement would be in  danger  the settlers had fortified their place of refuge in the best  manner they could  and all were determined to defend themselves and  property to the last  they had four nine pounders mounted on a hill  and  a tolerable battery made of three inch pine stuff     before the english erected their fortifications  there was a great  difference of opinion amongst them as to the propriety and utility of  adopting so strong a measure  and the affair was finally put to the vote   when the majority proved to be in favour of a strong resistance  i  opposed the measure all i could  for i felt convinced that in the event  of our allies being worsted we all should be involved in one common  massacre  whereas  if no resistance was made  plunder alone would have  been the extent of the injury we should suffer  and even of that taking  place i had strong doubts  however  as my opinion was overruled  i had to  submit  which i did unhesitatingly  and  like a good soldier  i held  myself in readiness in case of an attack     the proprietor and manager of the dock yard possessed certainly a   satisfying reason  for striving to defend himself at all hazards  the  vessel i had left here  on my former visit  in frame  was now nearly  completed  and a most beautiful one she was  he told me he would much  rather part with life than see her destroyed  and i confess i could fully  enter into his feelings on the subject  but as i had no such object at  stake  and was not quite enthusiastic enough to fight for a vessel i had  no share in  i felt very much inclined to let the natives war among  themselves without interference  but as we europeans had agreed to assist  each other  i would not be behind hand     i discharged rivers  two slaves  and rewarded them liberally for  conducting me with safety through such a wild and perilous country  they  departed  after expressing the heartiest wishes for my reaching my own  home in safety  and thanks for my generosity  to join their master at the  great meeting of the chiefs in the interior  these men  while assisting  me  were performing a great service to their master  by acting as spies   when we started from the kirikiri each was armed with a musket  but when  we had accomplished about half the journey  they concealed these in a  hollow tree  under pretence of extreme fatigue  i felt convinced at the  time that was not their real reason for so doing  and afterwards i  learned the true motive  had they been found armed when returning to  their master  who was hostile to those assembled round the dock yard    they would have been detained  but  by their coming unarmed amongst us   they were suffered to depart  and i have no doubt the information they  carried back to rivers was very important  i did not mention to anyone  the hiding of these muskets in the woods  though  according to  the  articles of war   i ought to have done so  as getting possession of them  would have added two more to our strength  and lessened that of our  enemy  my silence arose from a repugnance i felt to betray these poor  creatures  who had behaved so well to me     although prepared for war  we were very well pleased to find no attack  was made upon us  indeed  from the first  it had been my decided opinion   that unless we interfered  and made ourselves by that means obnoxious   they had too much respect for us  and were too anxious to retain our  kindly feelings towards them  to molest us  at the same time  i felt that  it might be a very politic measure to show them what powerful resistance  we could make  if driven to extremities     after passing a week of the greatest anxiety  on account of our expected  invasion  it afforded us the utmost satisfaction to receive a visit from  mr  hobbs  the wesleyan missionary  one of the persons who had visited  the war camp of the assembled chiefs  who were convened  on the death of  our lamented friend george  to debate and decide upon the momentous  question of peace or war     the subject  our informant stated  had been gone into at great length   and stormy and fierce had been the discussion  finally  the good sense of  the elder and more experienced chiefs prevailed over the fiercer passions  of the younger  and peace was decided upon  this event forms a new era in   the political history of the few zealanders   it being the first time so  great an assemblage had met to discuss openly a national question  or in  which they had allowed cool reasoning and good sense to prevail over  their habitual ferocity  as may naturally be supposed  where such various  interests were at stake  this pacific measure was not effected without  considerable opposition from the young and furious chiefs  the  provocations given by them to the elders  whose voices were for peace   were considerable  they did not confine themselves to abuse  but fired  several muskets during debate  in hopes that one shot out of the many  might prove fatal  which  if it had  and any distinguished chief had been  killed  or even wounded  it would have immediately thrown all into  confusion  even when pacific measures were decided upon by a very large  majority  and the chiefs were about to separate  a bullet was fired from  the pa  which had evidently been aimed at a chief  a well known ally of  the late shulitea  as it fell at his feet  and the earth it threw up fell  upon him  for a few seconds surprise kept all silent  but  as the angry  chief rose up  and was about to address the crowd  his friends eagerly  surrounded him  and hurried him away     this was the first instance on record  in which these people had laid a  statement of their private wrongs before a public assembly consisting of  deputies from every part of the island  and abided by the decision of the  majority  and it was the only instance of a chief being killed in battle   and his decease not having been followed up by the plundering and  destruction of his whole family or tribe     this had been a question of peculiar interest to us europeans  as several  of their great men had fallen in a skirmish  whether an accidental one or  a decided combat made not the slightest difference   we knew their  barbarous custom  and  consequently  we were preparing for scenes of  deadly revenge and insatiable fury to be acted by both parties  and which  must have involved all settled here in destruction  our feelings may  therefore be imagined  when we were informed that a parliament had been  convened  and all the parties interested were present by invitation  and  took part in the debate  a central spot was fixed on to accommodate the  various chieftains  the causes of the accident were then explained  they  wept and lamented the fallen chiefs  and finally retired satisfied to  their several homes  surely everyone who is interested in tracing our own  form of government  from the present time up to its first rude outline   will perceive the similarity of causes and events  and will anticipate  the glorious prospect of beholding a clever  brave  and  i may add  noble  race of men  like the new zealanders  rescued from barbarism  this  pacific and rational discussion among the chiefs seems  in reality  to  give promise of the germ of a regular reform  should a few more such  meetings take place  and terminate in the same amicable manner  and i  think it very probable   some clever individual may rise up amongst them   take the reins in his own hands  and establish something like a regular  form of government             chapter li     observations on the social conditions of the maoris       feeling that i was not likely now to be called upon to act offensively  i  considered myself at liberty to make numerous excursions round our  fortress  not only to admire this fertile and beautiful country  but to  visit some of my old friends  i was very much astonished and shocked at  seeing several very beautiful young women  whom i left only a few months  back in perfect health and strength  now reduced to mere  living  skeletons   and also to hear of the death of others by consumption  this  disease seems to be the scourge of the young  and when they are once  seized with its symptoms  they are very speedily brought to the grave   the natives say   it is atua  the great spirit  coming into them  and  eating up their inside  for the patient can feel those parts gradually go  away  and then they become weaker and weaker till no more is left  after  which the spirit sends them to the happy island   they never attempt any  means of curing or of alleviating the pains caused by this cruel  complaint  and all those under its influence are tabooed  i procured from  the brig all my remaining stores of tapioca  sago  arrowroot  and sugar   and distributed them in the best way i could amongst my sick friends   they were anxious for wine  but that portion of my sea stock  as well as  spirits  had been long since expended     it seems unaccountable that the natives of an atmosphere so dry as this  is  a country in which there are no marshy bogs  and where  though there  is an abundance of water  it is generally seen in clear and sparkling  rills rushing down from the mountains into the rivers  should be subject  to so fatal a disease as galloping consumption  the only cause to which i  can attribute such an affliction is  their indifference to lying out all  night exposed to every change of weather  to cold and rain  which  in  young and tender constitutions  must produce the most pernicious  consequences  if some few are rendered hardy and robust by this process   many  no doubt  are killed by it  i endeavoured to impress on the minds  of all my female friends the great danger of thus exposing themselves to  cold  but they only laughed at my precautions  and said   if atua wished  it  so it must be  they could not strive with the great spirit      i have heard so much said about the great impropriety of the white  settlers admitting the native females into their society  so much of the  scandalous conduct of captains of ships suffering their men to have  sweethearts during their stay in port  and so much urged in justification  of the indignation shown by the missionaries when this subject is touched  on by them  that i feel it necessary to state one decided benefit which  has resulted from that intercourse  and which  in my opinion  far more  than counterbalances the evil against which there has been raised so loud  an outcry     before our intercourse took place with the new zealanders  a universal  and unnatural custom existed amongst them  which was that of destroying  most of their female children in infancy  their excuse being that they  were quite as much trouble to rear  and consumed just as much food  as a  male child  and yet  when grown up  they were not fit to go to war as  their boys were  the strength and pride of a chief then consisted in the  number of his sons  while the few females who had been suffered to live  were invariably looked down upon by all with the utmost contempt  they  led a life of misery and degradation  the difference now is most  remarkable  the natives  seeing with what admiration strangers beheld  their fine young women  and what handsome presents were made to them  by  which their families were benefited  feeling also that their influence  was so powerful over the white men  have been latterly as anxious to  cherish and protect their infant girls as they were formerly cruelly bent  on destroying them  therefore  if one sin has been  to a certain degree   encouraged  a much greater one has been annihilated  infanticide  the  former curse of this country  and the cause of its scanty population  a  crime every way calculated to make men bloody minded and ferocious  and  to stifle every benevolent and tender feeling  has totally disappeared  wherever an intercourse has taken place between the natives and the crews  of european vessels     the new zealand method of  courtship and matrimony  is a most  extraordinary one  so much so  that an observer could never imagine any  affection existed between the parties  a man sees a woman whom he fancies  he should like for a wife  he asks the consent of her father  or  if an  orphan  of her nearest relation  which  if he obtains  he carries his   intended  off by force  she resisting with all her strength  and  as the  new zealand girls are generally pretty robust  sometimes a dreadful  struggle takes place  both are soon stripped to the skin  and it is  sometimes the work of hours to remove the fair prize a hundred yards  if  she breaks away  she instantly flies from her antagonist  and he has his  labour to commence again  we may suppose that if the lady feels any wish  to be united to her would be spouse  she will not make too violent an  opposition  but it sometimes happens that she secures her retreat into  her father s house  and the lover loses all chance of ever obtaining her   whereas  if he can manage to carry her in triumph into his own  she  immediately  becomes his wife  the women have a decided aversion to  marriage  which can scarcely be wondered at  when we consider how they  are circumstanced  while they remain single  they enjoy all the  privileges of the other sex  they may rove where they please  and bestow  their favours on whom they choose  and are entirely beyond control or  restraint  but when married their freedom is at an end  they become mere  slaves  and sink gradually into domestic drudges to those who have the  power of life and death over them  and whether their conduct be criminal  or exemplary  they are equally likely to receive a blow  in a moment of  passion  of sufficient force to end life and slavery together  there are  many exceptions to this frightful picture  and i saw several old couples   who had been united in youth  who had always lived in happiness together   and whose kind and friendly manner towards each other set an example well  worthy of imitation in many english families             chapter lii     a maori tangi       april  nd   this day  perceiving that an unusual number of canoes were  passing up the river  all proceeding towards the village of par finneigh   we hailed one  and  upon its coming alongside  we inquired what had  occurred  for every appearance of bustle or commotion amongst this  restless and war like people is truly alarming  they informed us that the  great chief a rowa  who died four months since  and the ceremony of whose   lying in state  i had been permitted by his eldest son to be a witness  of  was this day to be exposed to the view of his friends  was to be  cried over  and was finally to be deposited in the tomb of his ancestors   as this was one of their imposing spectacles which i had never yet seen   i was anxious to witness it  we soon got a boat ready  and a party of us  joined the throng  and proceeded with them to the village  upon our  arrival thither  we found an immense concourse of people assembled  for  here  as in most uncivilised or early states of society  the disposition  and good qualities of the deceased are made known by the number of  friends and followers who meet at his funeral  as these new zealanders  were all fully equipped in arms  they had more the appearance of a  hostile meeting in an enemy s camp  than of a group of mourners about to  be occupied in the melancholy duty of depositing out of sight for ever  the last remains of a beloved chief     mooetara  the son and successor of the deceased  came to meet us on the  beach  and seemed much gratified by our attention  our appearance on this  solemn occasion giving him importance in the eyes of all the natives then  assembled  he gave orders for our being conducted with much ceremony to  the place of mourning  where  amidst a number of uncouth pieces of  carving  which  we were informed were all tombs reared in honour of the  memory of several former chiefs  and all tabooed   was erected a small  hut  covered in at the top with thatch  but open at the sides  in the  centre of this hut the bones of the deceased chief were exposed to view   after having undergone the process of decomposition during four months   exposure to heat  wind  and rain  they had been collected  cleaned  and  decorated with a quantity of fresh white feathers  which rendered the  appearance of the skull still more frightful     the women here invariably perform the parts of chief mourners  a group of  them  with the widow of the deceased at their head  kept up a most  mournful cadence  and at every pause in their dismal song slashed their  skins with a piece of shell  till their faces  necks  and arms were  literally streaming down with blood  this mourning and cutting is  completely a matter of business  and is sometimes carried on without  their feeling any real sorrow or sympathy  parties kept arriving  and  when there was not room for them to thrust themselves round the hut  they  sat down in groups  perfectly unconcerned  employing themselves in  cleaning their firelocks  or playing off upon each other some practical  joke  but the moment a vacant space was presented near the hut  they  deliberately stripped themselves  put on a most sorrowful countenance   and  seating themselves as near to the ornamented bones as possible  they  immediately began their howling and slashing  no one seemed to like the  idea of being outdone by his neighbour  but when the time allotted to  this ceremony had expired  all instantly jumped up  wiped themselves  put  on their mats  and joined the busy throng  there was  indeed  one real  mourner  who never moved from the bones  nor once lifted up her eyes from  them  she neither howled nor cut herself  and yet she inspired me with  pity and commiseration for her forlorn state  this woman had been the  only wife of the late chief  and i was informed they had lived many years  together  and had a large family  she looked as if she herself was on the  very brink of the grave  the contemplation of the mouldering remains of  her partner through life must have been  even to her savage mind  most  lacerating     after witnessing several parties perform their funeral ceremonies  and  imbibing  in some degree  the melancholy tone of mind such a sight must  necessarily create  we arose and joined mooetara  here i witnessed a  scene that reminded me of an english country fair  an immense number of  temporary huts had been erected for the accommodation of the chiefs and  their families  where they might repose after their exertions  while  their slaves cooked their provisions  of which an abundant quantity had  been provided  consisting of piles of kumara and indian corn  with heaps  of fish  which were served out  to all who came for them  with a most  liberal hand  and which  of course  added not a little to the pleasure of  the day  after all had satisfied their hunger  and even the lowest slaves  were permitted  on this occasion  to have as much as they wished for   they jumped up  flew to their muskets  and commenced their war dance with  great noise and vigour  the violence of their exertions caused their  recent wounds to bleed afresh  and added much to the horror of their  hideous grimaces  they then divided into two parties  and had a sham  battle  i must here do justice to the temperate habits of my savage  friends  during my residence in new zealand  i have known but very few  who were addicted to drinking  and i scarcely ever saw one of them in a  state of intoxication  and  on this occasion  where a profusion of what  they esteem delicacies was provided gratuitously  they partook so  moderately of the tempting fare as not to be prevented using the most  violent exertions immediately after their meal  the entertainment being  now over  the different parties gathered up what remained of the portions  of food distributed to them  and without taking any leave of their  entertainer  or returning any thanks for his bountiful providing  they  all entered their canoes and paddled away             chapter liii     character of the new zealanders       an unfortunate prejudice has gone forth into the world against the  natives of new zealand  which i have always endeavoured to counteract  from a sense of justice  and  from a careful review of those  circumstances which have fallen immediately under my own observation   this prejudice has long retarded our knowledge of their true character   but error must gradually give way to truth  and as the circumstances  which first brought the stigma upon their name come to light  and are  investigated and properly explained  i feel confident the conduct of  these islanders will be found superior to that of any other nation in the  south seas  if we take the whole catalogue of dreadful massacres they  have been charged with  and  setting aside partiality for our own  countrymen  allow them to be carefully examined  it will be found that we  have invariably been the aggressors  and when we have given serious cause  of offence  can we be so irrational as to express astonishment that a  savage should seek revenge  the last massacre was that of  the boyd s   crew  every impartial person who reads the account of that melancholy  transaction must acknowledge the unfortunate captain was most to blame   but that event took place nineteen years back  since which time they know  us better  and respect us more  in proof of which  four years since  the  mercury brig was taken possession of by a crowd of natives  after they  had endured a series of offences and every kind of ill treatment  but the  difference in their fate  compared with that of the boyd s ship s  company  was remarkable  and proved that the savage temper of the natives  was much softened down and humanised  as they merely plundered the  vessel  but made no attempt to murder or molest any of the crew  who  if  they had possessed sufficient courage  would not have sacrificed their  vessel  but  being terrified  they abandoned her  and she was finally  wrecked  during my residence  i never heard of one of the men having been  murdered  and i feel fully convinced no massacres will ever again be  committed in any of the ports in new zealand where european vessels have  been accustomed to anchor     i once saw  with indignation  a chief absolutely knocked overboard from a  whaler s deck by the mate  twenty years ago so gross an insult would have  cost the lives of every individual on board the vessel  but  at the time  this occurred  it was only made the subject of complaint  and finally  became a cause of just remonstrance with the commander of the whaler  the  natives themselves  and i have heard the opinions of various tribes  have  invariably told me that these things occurred from our want of knowledge  of their laws and customs  which compelled them to seek revenge   it  was   they said   no act of treachery on our part  we did not invite you  to our shores for the purpose of plunder and murder  but you came  and  ill used us  you broke into our tabooed grounds  and did not atua give  those bad white men into the hands of our fathers      i am confident that a body of europeans may now reside in perfect  security in any part of these islands  the late plundering of the  missionaries at whangaroa was a peculiar circumstance  which might have  happened even in civilised europe  had the seat of war approached so near  their place of residence  if their houses and chapel had been on the  plains of waterloo during the june of      they would not have  experienced a better fate     this recent tumult has brought a circumstance into notice highly  interesting to all who may hereafter wish to settle here  it has hitherto  been their custom  when an accident occurs  such as the sudden death of a  chief  to make a general plunder of everything belonging to the family of  the deceased  and all under their protection  a knowledge of this  horrible custom has deterred many from settling in new zealand  and even  those who have resolved to run so great a risk have lived in a continued  state of alarm  lest the death of their protecting chief should leave  them at the mercy of a savage enemy     the deaths of hongi and shulitea placed the missionaries and all the  settlers on kororarika beach in considerable jeopardy  but it appeared as  if reason had begun to dawn on the minds of these benighted savages  for  this unjust and cruel custom was now for the first time discontinued  i  was on the beach at the time when an immense party  well armed  came for  the express purpose of satiating their revengeful feelings  i had taken  the precaution of removing what i possessed on board a whaler then lying  in the harbour  the chiefs first sat down to discuss the matter over  amongst themselves  and their deliberations ended in their being  satisfied with destroying the village of matowe  the one adjoining ours   and which had been the residence of pomare s son  whose death was the  cause of all the late turbulent events     the great and leading defect in this country  and the principal cause of  their frequent wars and disturbances  which harass and depopulate the  tribes  and puts a stop to all improvement  is the want of some regular  system of government  there are only two classes of people  chiefs and  slaves  and  as consanguinity constitutes a high claim  the eldest son of  a large family  who can bring the greatest number of warriors of his own  name into the field  is considered the chief of that district or tribe   and as he  by reason of his followers  can take possession of the  greatest number of prisoners or slaves  he becomes the ruling man  every  other man of his tribe considers himself on an equality with him in  everything  except that he shows him obedience  and follows him to  battle     each is independent in his own family  and holds uncontrolled power of  life and death over every individual it contains  they seem not to  exercise any coercion over the younger branches of a family  who are  allowed unbounded liberty till the girls have sweethearts and the boys  are strong enough to go to war  they are kind and hospitable to  strangers  and are excessively fond of their children  on a journey  it  is more usual to see the father carrying his infant than the mother  and  all the little offices of a nurse are performed by him with the tenderest  care and good humour  in many instances  wherein they differ from most  savage tribes  i have seen the wife treated as an equal and companion  in  fact  when not engaged in war  the new zealander is quite a domestic   cheerful  harmless character  but once rouse his anger  or turn him into  ridicule  and his disposition is instantly changed  a being  whose  passions have never been curbed from infancy  and whose only notion of  what he conceives to be his right is to retaliate for an offence with  blood  must naturally form a cruel and vindictive character  such these  islanders seemed to us on our first visiting them  the sight of beings so  extraordinary  for thus we europeans must have appeared to them  excited  in their savage minds the greatest wonder  and they thought we were sent  as a scourge and an enemy  and though cook  one of their earliest  visitors  adopted every method his ingenuity could devise to conciliate  them  yet  as they never could thoroughly understand his intentions  they  were always on the alert to attack him  hence arose the horror and  disgust expressed formerly at the mere mention of the name of  a new  zealander      i have often tried  in vain  to account for there being such a decided  dissimilarity between the natives of new holland and new zealand  so  trifling is the difference in their situation on the globe  and so   similar their climates   both having remained so long unknown to the  great continents  and so devoid of intercourse with the rest of the  world  that one would be led to imagine a great resemblance must be the  result  but the natives of the former seem of the lowest grade  the last  link in the great chain of existence which unites man with the monkey   their limbs are long  thin  and flat  with large bony knees and elbows  a  projecting forehead  and pot belly  the mind  too  seems adapted to this  mean configuration  they have neither energy  enterprise  nor industry   and their curiosity can scarcely be excited  a few exceptions may be met  with  but these are their general characteristics  while the natives of  the latter island are  cast in beauty s perfect mould   the children are  so fine and powerfully made  that each might serve as a model for a  statue of  the infant hercules   nothing can exceed the graceful and  athletic forms of the men  or the rounded limbs of their young women   these possess eyes beautiful and eloquent  and a profusion of long   silky  curling hair  while the intellects of both sexes seem of a  superior order  all appear eager for improvement  full of energy  and  indefatigably industrious  and possessing amongst themselves several arts  which are totally unknown to their neighbours             chapter liv     the settlement and trade of hokianga       on april the   th  our brig being stored with planks  flax  and potatoes   and ready for sea  i went on board of her  we had fine weather till we  dropped down to the entrance of the river  where we intended taking in  our stock of water for the voyage  when the scene suddenly changed  and a  severe gale came on  right out to sea  which we could not avail ourselves  of  neither could we get the water off  as our rafts of casks got adrift  in the attempt to get them on board  to add to our disasters  one of our  cables parted  and we had to ride out the gale  of two days  continuance   with one only  the sea rolling heavily right open before us  and we in  momentary expectation of the remaining cable s going  we had not a single  day s allowance of water on board  and at one period all hands  except  the carpenter and passengers  were out of the brig  on shore  filling the  casks  fortunately for us  the cable proved a tough one  had it parted   we should have been in a most perilous situation     april   th   for the last week we were stationary at the river s mouth   waiting for a fair wind to carry us over the bar  and during that time  there was no appearance of any change  we also heard that vessels had  been detained here for six weeks before they could accomplish it  we  were visited daily by parties of natives  who seemed to rejoice at our  being delayed  as it gave them more of our company than they had  calculated upon  they were more delighted with our society than we were  with theirs  in a small vessel they are a serious nuisance  on account of  the swarms of vermin they bring with them  and which they communicate  liberally to all  myself and all the passengers on board had our leisure  time fully occupied in dislodging these  little familiars  from their  strongholds in different parts of our apparel     during the time we were lying here  i saw and conversed with several  individuals who had attended the  great meeting   and their accounts gave  rise to various opinions respecting the policy of supplying the natives  with firearms  as i had always been an advocate for the measure  i was  gratified by hearing that it was thought to be in consequence of each  party s being possessed of a nearly equal quantity of muskets  that a  general and exterminating war was avoided  some may suppose that similar  tranquility would have been preserved  had they been equally well  supplied with their native weapons of war  but that would not have been  the case  when they found that each party could furnish forth the same  number of european muskets  they paused  well knowing that it was  contrary to the wish of all the white settlers that they should proceed  to hostilities  indeed  europeans intrepidly mingled amongst them  urging  them to a reconciliation  and threatening that  if they failed in their  endeavours  the supplies of arms and ammunition should be discontinued   this threat had its desired effect on the minds of the natives  no blood  was spilt  and each chief returned quietly to his own home     on the night we heard of the death of george and his wife   revenge and  war  was the universal cry  his party would not believe that it could be  an accident  nor would they hear of any apology being received  at this  time they imagined the tribes of hokianga were possessed of but very few  firearms  and  as the skirmish took place in that district  it was  determined that an exterminating war should be carried into the heart of  it  however  before all the preparations could be made to carry their  intentions into effect  they received certain information that the people  of hokianga were even better supplied with muskets than those of the bay  of islands  this intelligence occasioned an assemblage of the different  tribes to be proposed  and when it took place the friends of george saw  their opponents so well prepared for the  tug of war  that they deemed it  judicious to come forward and to shake hands and to acknowledge that the  death of shulitea proceeded either from accident or mistake  a curious  circumstance took place in the midst of their debate  an old chief  who  wished for a fight  and did not approve of the introduction of firearms   but was an advocate for the old method of new zealand warfare  proposed  that each party should send away  all  their muskets and ammunition  and  engage manfully with their own native weapons  and then it could be  easily proved which were the  best men   but this mode of settling the  dispute  not being agreeable to the majority  was instantly negatived   and treated with disdain     the colony of scotch carpenters  who had formed a settlement at the head  of the river  and of whom i made  honourable mention  on my first  journey  finding themselves so close to what they feared might become  the seat of war  and having no means whatever of defending themselves   made an arrangement with mooetara  the chief of parkunugh  which is  situated at the entrance of the same river   and placed themselves under  his protection  they accordingly moved down here  which gave great  satisfaction to that chief  neither could their former protector   patuone  feel offended at their removal  from the peculiar nature of the  circumstances they were placed in  these hardy north britons were  delighted to find a reasonable excuse for moving  their former  establishment being situated too far from the sea for them to reap any  advantage from ships coming into port  nothing can be more gratifying  than to behold the great anxiety of the natives to induce englishmen to  settle amongst them  it ensures their safety  and no one act of treachery  is on record of their having practised towards those whom they had  invited to reside with them     mooetara is a man of great property and high rank  and is considered a  very proud chief by the natives  yet he is to be seen every day working  as hard as any slave in assisting in the erection of houses for the  accommodation of his new settlers  he has actually removed from his old  village of parkunugh  a strong and beautiful place   and is erecting huts  for his tribe near the spot chosen by his new friends  so that  in a very  short time  a barren point of land  hitherto without a vestige of a human  habitation  will become a thriving and populous village  for it is  incredible how quickly the orders of these chiefs are carried into  effect  i was frequently a witness to the short space of time they took  to erect their houses  and  though small  they are tight  weather proof   and warm  their storehouses are put together in the most substantial and  workmanlike manner     it is very difficult to make the new zealanders explain the nature of  their religious belief  one superstition seems general with all the  tribes respecting the formation of the world  or  rather  of their own  island  for that is the place of the first importance in their  estimation  they say a man  or a god  or some great spirit  was fishing  in his war canoe  and pulled up a large fish  which instantly turned into  an island  and a lizard came upon that  and brought up a man out of the  water by his long hair  and he was the father of all the new zealanders   almost all their grotesque carvings are illustrations of this idea in  some way or other  the favourite theme on which  i observed  the  missionaries discoursed to them were  the torments of hell   this has  become a subject of ridicule to most of the natives  they do not deny  that there may be such a place  but they add  it is not for them  for if  atua had intended it so he would have sent them word about it long before  he sent the white men into their country  and they conclude by stating  that they know perfectly well the situation of the island where they are  to go to after this life             chapter lv     massacre of a schooner s crew       while remaining here wind bound  in imaginary security  and amusing  ourselves with noticing the curious customs and peculiarities of these  islanders  a dreadful tragedy was taking place only a few miles  distance  from us  and to which i before alluded  when i mentioned crossing the bar  on our first arrival from port jackson  the enterprise schooner  a very  fine vessel  which was built at the settlement on this river  had been  sent to sydney  and while we were lying there we were in hourly  expectation of her return  she did return  the unfavourable weather which  detained us so long proved fatal to her  and she was wrecked a few miles  to the northward of the river s mouth  and every soul on board perished     the moment this catastrophe was known every european hastened to the  spot  and  with feelings of horror  perceived but too plainly  from the  appearance of the wreck and the boat  and by finding also the clothes of  the crew  that they had reached the shore in safety  and had afterwards  all been murdered  but how  or by whom  it was impossible to discover   the most probable conclusion was that the tribes situated around the  european dockyard at hokianga  having meditated for some time past a  great war like expedition  waited the return of this schooner from sydney  to possess themselves of an additional supply of arms and ammunition   which might enable them to take the field with a certainty of conquest   they had regularly purchased the cargo of this vessel by their labour  and their merchandise  and the schooner was merely employed to convey it  thither from sydney  for the use of the natives  unhappily for the poor  creatures on board  in running for the mouth of the river  she fell to  leeward  and got stranded on the beach  in the very territory of that  tribe against whom these preparations were made  the tribe intended to be  invaded  though no formal declaration of war had taken place  the tribes  well knew the preparations that were making against them  and the nature  of the cargo contained in the enterprise  falling into the hands of such  fierce and vindictive savages  the fate of the crew may be imagined  all  our poor fellows were sacrificed to gratify their feelings of revenge     mooetara  the friendly chief of hokianga  no sooner heard of the fate of  the vessel and her crew than he hastened with his party to the spot  it  was owing to the investigation which then took place that the conclusion  was arrived at that all had been murdered  what remained for mooetara to  do  according to their savage notion of what was right  was to take ample  revenge on all the hostile tribes that might fall in his way  whether our  poor countrymen met their deaths through accident or treachery  mooetara  instantly commenced the work of destruction  and  having made his  vengeance complete  he returned laden with spoil  the promptness with  which he acted on this melancholy occasion greatly increased the feelings  of security possessed by those englishmen settled on the banks of the  river  as it proved to them that he was both able and willing to protect  them  and though the dead could not be restored  yet he had inflicted an  awful punishment on their murderers             chapter lvi     farewell to new zealand       on the   st a fair wind and smooth sea favoured our departure  early in  the morning the natives who were on board assured us everything would  facilitate our passing over the bar with safety  and they prepared to  leave the ship  when the moment of separation came  it caused a great  deal of emotion on both sides  i must confess i felt much affected when i  came to rub noses  shake hands  and say  farewell  to these kind hearted  people  i saw them go over the ship s side  and reflected that i should  never behold them more  there is always something repugnant to our  feelings in the idea of separating from any being for ever  and as  in  this instance  i felt assured that this was our last time of meeting  it  cast a gloom over the pleasure the fair wind and smooth sea would  otherwise have afforded me  as we fell down towards the river s mouth   and  indeed  as long as their canoes were to be seen  they kept waving  their hands towards us     thus terminated my visit to the islands of new zealand  i had arrived  with feelings of fear and disgust  and was merely induced to take up a  temporary residence amongst the natives  in hopes of finding something  new for my pencil in their peculiar and picturesque style of life  i left  them with opinions  in many respects  very favourable towards them  it  is true  they are cunning and over reaching in trade  and filthy in their  persons  in regard to the former  we europeans  i fear  set them a bad  example  of the latter  they will gradually amend  our short visit to  kororarika greatly improved them in that particular  all took great pains  to come as clean as possible when they attended our  evening  tea parties   in my opinion  their sprightly  free  and independent  deportment  together with their kindness and attention to strangers   compensates for many defects     on looking round upon their country  an englishman cannot fail to feel  gratified when he beholds the good already resulting to these poor  savages from their intercourse with his countrymen  and they themselves  are fully sensible of  and truly grateful for  every mark of kindness  manifested towards them  they have stores full of the finest indian corn   which they consider a great luxury  a food which requires little trouble  in preparing  keeps well  and is very nutritious  it is but a few years  since this useful grain was introduced amongst them  and i sincerely hope  this introduction may be followed up  not only by our sending out to them  seeds of vegetables and fruits  but by our forwarding to them every  variety of quadruped which can be used for food  abundance of the finest  water melons are daily brought alongside vessels entering their ports   these  in point of flavour  are superior to any i ever met with  i have  no doubt every variety of european produce essential to the support of  life would thrive equally well  and as food became abundant  and luxuries  were introduced  their disgusting feasts on human flesh would soon be  discontinued altogether     we were soon at sea  and speedily felt considerable apprehensions as to  the safe termination of our voyage  our vessel  the brig governor  macquarie  we well knew was a leaky one  though her leaks did not  distress us on the outward voyage  she being then only in ballast trim   but now that she was loaded to the water s edge  and the winter coming  on  we became greatly alarmed for her  another disagreeable circumstance  was having no bread or flour on board  to obviate the first evil  and to  save the sailors a great deal of hard labour  our captain offered to give  a passage to sydney to several natives  who accepted his offer  they  being always anxious to see the colony  we likewise had on board the  great chief from the thames  who had caused us so much trouble at  kororarika  these men  being fine  strong  active young fellows  were  indefatigable in their exertions at the pumps  and though we had to  contend with much heavy weather  and contrary winds  they kept our vessel  pretty dry  the want of bread was not so easily remedied  though our  captain treated it lightly  saying he was sure of getting a supply by  making a requisition to the missionaries  he accordingly waited upon  them  and acquainted them with our distressed condition  they had plenty   for only a few weeks previously they had received a large supply   and  as we knew their agent at sydney  mr  campbell  we had no doubt of  procuring a sufficiency from them to carry us home  but in this we were  disappointed  captain kent did not ask them for a supply as a gift  but  solicited merely the  loan  of a cask or two till we arrived at sydney   when he guaranteed that the owners of the brig should return the same  quantity into the missionary storehouse there  the little monosyllable   no  was again put in requisition  with this qualification   that they  did not like the botany bay skippers   through their  dislike   the  passengers and seamen of the brig might have gone unprovided to sea  had  not a  worldly minded  whaler  fortunately for us  at that critical  moment come into port  who  the instant he heard of the ill success of  our entreaty  vented his indignation in pretty coarse language  and said    if it detained his vessel a week  he would supply us   and he kept his  word  he gave us a bountiful supply  which rendered us comfortable during  the whole way home     it was most interesting to observe our savages when we got well out to  sea  they soon appeared to become accustomed to their novel situation   and seemed to feel quite at home and at their ease  on board ship   their  exertions at the pumps were indefatigable  i felt convinced they thought  that during all voyages the same labour was gone through to keep the  vessel afloat  and as it only required strength and exertion  they  cheerfully took that department entirely to themselves  especially as  they soon perceived how useless they were when they attempted to perform  any other duty on board of the brig  as their knowledge of voyaging  extended no further than the distance they go in their own canoes  which   though very beautiful  are sad leaky things at sea  and as  during the  time they are out  the greater part of the crew are baling the water out  of them  they thought the leaky state of our vessel was no uncommon  occurrence  but however cheerfully they worked during the day  nothing  could induce them to  turn out  at night  they always stowed themselves  away  but in what part of the vessel i never could conjecture  they have  a dread of some unknown evil spirit  which they imagine has power over  them at night  and this supposition makes them terrible cowards in the  dark     the second day after we were at sea  i saw a group of savages lying round  the binnacle  all intently occupied in observing the phenomenon of the  magnetic attraction  they seemed at once to comprehend the purpose to  which it was applied  and i listened with eager curiosity to their  remarks upon it      this   said they   is the white man s god  who directs them safely to  different countries  and then can guide them home again   out of  compliment to us  and respect for its wonderful powers  they seemed much  inclined to worship this silent little monitor     during our voyage to port jackson we experienced a succession of  southerly gales  which captain kent informed me were very prevalent at  this season of the year  notwithstanding all our exertions to prevent it   we were carried considerably to leeward of the port  we made lord howe s  islands  whose high and bold features rise  as it were  out of the ocean   as we passed close to them  we perceived they were well wooded and  watered  and one of the men  who had been on shore there  informed me that  there was a tolerably good harbour for small craft  a few miles to the  southward of these islands is ball s pyramid  a most singular and  sublime looking rock  rising perpendicularly out of the sea to a height  of a thousand feet  the base of it is enveloped in perpetual surf   dashing and climbing up its craggy sides  its appearance  as we saw it   relieved by the setting sun  and the coming on of a stormy night  was  awful in the extreme     nothing could exceed the delight manifested by our new zealanders as we  sailed up port jackson harbour  but  above all  the windmills most  astonished them  after dancing and screaming with joy at beholding them   they came running and asking me  if they were not gods   i found they  were inclined to attach that sacred appellation to most things they could  not understand  they did so when they first became possessed of their  muskets  and actually worshipped them  until they discovered how soon  they got out of repair  and then  notwithstanding all the prayers they  could bestow upon them  they would not mend again of their own accord     our chief from the thames  who had a great idea of his own dignity   commenced adorning his person  as he felt convinced the governor would  instantly grant him an audience when he came on shore  all our lamps were  emptied to add a more beautiful gloss to his hair and complexion  his  whole stock of feathers and bones were arranged to the greatest  advantage  he at length became quite enraged when he found that he was  allowed to sit two days on our deck  amongst all manner of dirty porters  and sailors  without either being visited or sent for  and he was loud in  his reproaches to us for having deceived him  we certainly were to blame  in having induced him to believe we had any influence with the governor   for however politic we  who had lived in new zealand  might think it  to  pay some attentions to these simple savages  his excellency   unfortunately  thought otherwise  and though the chief  attended by his  followers  used to sit in the verandah at government house from morning  till night  the governor never once deigned to speak to them  and they  were  in consequence  constantly coming to me with complaints  at length  they told me that unless they obtained an audience from our chief they  should consider it so great an insult that they would revenge it upon all  the europeans they could get into their power  and i  well knowing that  several families were settled in that part of the country wherein this  man was chief  thought it my duty to let the governor know  that  however  he might dislike their manners and appearance  it might lead to some  serious calamity  if he continued to refuse to give them an audience     i accordingly waited upon the brigade major  and explained to him how  unwise it was to treat these men with such undisguised contempt  the  result was  the governor saw the affair in the same point of view as  myself  and condescended to meet them and converse with them for about  five minutes  and with that they were satisfied  other heads of  departments  civil and military  behaved differently  and evidently felt  a pleasure in having them with them  the commander of the troops suffered  them to sit at the same table with himself and officers  and had the  war dance performed in the mess room  which i thought would have brought  the house down upon our heads  he likewise permitted them to fall into  the ranks with the soldiers  which pleased them beyond everything   inasmuch as they considered it a higher honour in being permitted to  stand by our warriors on the martial parade than to take food with our  chiefs at their own table     the attorney general of the colony took a particular interest in these  savages  and gave a large party  to which they were invited  several of  the visitors on this occasion came out of curiosity to see how these  cannibals would conduct themselves  expecting  no doubt  to witness a  display of disgusting gluttony  but in that they were disappointed  for  never did any set of men behave with greater decorum than they did     on being apprised of this invitation  they were all most anxious to  obtain european dresses  and when we refused to lend them ours  they  requested of our servants the loan of a suit  this being denied them  also  with the little money they had they attempted to bargain for whole  suits of  convict  dresses  in order to make their  debut  in style at  the table of the attorney general  when i discovered this to be the case   i explained to them the impropriety of their conduct  and roused their  pride by pointing out to them the absurdity of men of their high rank in  their own country wishing to appear in the cast off dress of degraded  slaves  and how much more suitable it was to the dignity of their  character to appear in their own national costume  accordingly  on the  appointed day  they met the company superbly attired in mats and  feathers  they made a splendid show at the dinner table  and afforded  great amusement to the evening visitors  at an early hour they got very  sleepy  but were too polite to hint how much they felt oppressed by  drowsiness  i saw their eyes grow heavy  and perceived that it was  difficult for them to sit upright on their chairs  i mentioned these  symptoms to their kind host  who immediately consented to their retiring   they accordingly withdrew into a corner of one of the adjoining rooms   where  lying down huddled together  and covering themselves with their  mats  they were soon asleep  and gave no interruption to anyone during  the remainder of the evening     the greatest treat it was in our power to bestow on them was to take them  to a review of the troops then stationed at sydney  the splendour of  their regimentals  the regularity of their movements  and the precision  of their firing  made them nearly mad with delight  they ran about the  plain literally wild with joy  occasionally stopping to gaze with wonder  on men performing what they deemed such prodigies  in their ecstasies  they occasionally vociferated their own furious war whoop  their  extravagant expressions of delight  and their many extraordinary  gestures  caused great amusement both to the military and to the  spectators assembled on the ground  and when the review was over my  savage friends were quite exhausted with fatigue and excitement     after two months  residence at sydney we had an opportunity of procuring  a passage for them to their own country  and they departed  expressing  the greatest gratitude for our attentions towards them  they were loaded  with presents of all descriptions  for  finding they generally got what  they begged for  while here  they importuned everyone they met  and they  used daily to return home burthened with the most miscellaneous and  extraordinary jumble of commodities it was possible to conceive  for  as  everything they then beheld was new to them  and might be  they thought   of some service to them in their own country  each trifle was of great  value in their estimation  and was carefully stowed away  they always  expressed their concern that so few muskets were given to them  and that  they were presented with ammunition in such small quantities  war like  stores were their grand desideratum  and though they would accept of any  thing you chose to give them  yet they always had hopes they should  finally receive their favourite presents of a stocking of powder  a piece  of lead  or a musket     the end             appendix i     massacre of capt  furneaux s boat s crew     cannibalism of the maoris         the following is the account given by captain furneaux of the massacre  of his boat s crew  referred to in earle s narrative on page                                                      the resolution  under command of captain cook  and the adventure   commanded by captain furneaux  sailed from plymouth on the   th april         to continue the exploration of new zealand begun during captain  cook s first voyage  the vessels became finally separated in a gale off  cape palliser in october        and the two navigators did not meet again  until after cook s return to england in july           captain furneaux reported that while his ship was refitting in queen  charlotte sound the astronomer s tent was robbed by a party of natives   one who was seen escaping was fired upon and wounded  when he and his  confederates made for the woods  leaving their canoe with most of the  stolen goods on the shore   this petty larceny   captain furneaux  remarks   probably laid the foundation of that dreadful catastrophe which  soon after happened   and which he thus describes      on friday  the   th  we sent out our large cutter  manned with seven  seamen  under the command of mr  john rowe  the first mate  accompanied  by mr  woodhouse  midshipman  and james tobias swilley  the carpenter s  servant  they were to proceed up the sound to grass cove to gather greens  and celery for the ship s company  with orders to return that evening   for the tents had been struck at two in the afternoon  and the ship made  ready for sailing the next day  night coming on  and no cutter appearing   the captain and others began to express great uneasiness  they sat up all  night in expectation of their arrival  but to no purpose  at daybreak   therefore  the captain ordered the launch to be hoisted out  she was  double manned  and under the command of our second lieutenant  mr   burney  accompanied by mr  freeman  master  the corporal of marines  with  five private men  all well armed  and having plenty of ammunition and  three days  provision  they were ordered first to look into east bay   then to proceed to grass cove  and if nothing was to be seen or heard of  the cutter there  they were to go farther up the cove  and return by the  west shore  mr  rowe having left the ship an hour before the time  proposed for his departure  we thought his curiosity might have carried  him into east bay  none of our people having ever been there  or that  some accident might have happened to the boat  for not the least  suspicion was entertained of the natives  mr  burney returned about  eleven o clock the same night  and gave us a pointed description of a  most horrible scene  described in the following relation         on saturday  the   th  we left the ship about nine o clock in the  morning  we soon got round long island and long point  we continued  sailing and rowing for east bay  keeping close in shore  and examining  with our glasses every cove on the larboard side  till near two o clock  in the afternoon  at which time we stopped at a beach on our left going  up east bay  to dress our dinner       about five o clock in the afternoon  and within an hour after we had  left this place  we opened a small bay adjoining to grass cove  and here  we saw a large double canoe just hauled upon the beach  with two men and  a dog  the two men  on seeing us approach  instantly fled  which made us  suspect it was here we should have some tidings of the cutter  on landing  and examining the canoe  the first thing we saw therein was one of our  cutter s rowlock ports and some shoes  one of which among the latter was  known to belong to mr  woodhouse  a piece of flesh was found by one of  our people  which at first was thought to be some of the salt meat  belonging to the cutter s men  but  upon examination  we supposed to be  dog s flesh  a most horrid and undeniable proof soon cleared up our  doubts  and convinced us we were among no other than cannibals  for   advancing further on the beach  we saw about twenty baskets tied up  and  a dog eating a piece of broiled flesh  which  upon examination  we  suspected to be human  we cut open the baskets  some of which were full  of roasted flesh  and others of fern root  which serves them for bread   searching others  we found more shoes and a hand  which was immediately  known to have belonged to thos  hill  one of our forecastle men  it  having been tattooed with the initials of his name  we now proceeded a  little way in the woods  but saw nothing else  our next design was to  launch the canoe  intending to destroy her  but seeing a great smoke  ascending over the nearest hill  we made all possible haste to be with  them before sunset       at half after six we opened grass cove  where we saw one single and  three double canoes  and a great many natives assembled on the beach  who  retreated to a small hill  within a ship s length of the water side   where they stood talking to us  on the top of the high land  beyond the  woods  was a large fire  from whence  all the way down the hill  the  place was thronged like a fair  when we entered the cove  a musketoon was  fired at one of the canoes  as we imagined they might be full of men  lying down  for they were all afloat  but no one was seen in them  being  doubtful whether their retreat proceeded from fear or a desire to decoy  us into an ambuscade  we were determined not to be surprised  and  therefore  running close in shore  we dropped the grappling near enough  to reach them with our guns  but at too great a distance to be under any  apprehensions from their treachery  the savages on the little hill kept  their ground  hallooing  and making signs for us to land  at these we now  took aim  resolving to kill as many of them as our bullets would reach   yet it was some time before we could dislodge them  the first volley did  not seem to affect them much  but on the second they began to scramble  away as fast as they could  some howling and others limping  we continued  to fire as long as we could see the least glimpse of any of them through  the bushes  among these were two very robust men  who maintained their  ground without moving an inch till they found themselves forsaken by all  their companions  and then  disdaining to run  they marched off with  great composure and deliberation  one of them  however  got a fall  and  either lay there or crawled away on his hands and feet  but the other  escaped without any apparent hurt  mr  burney now improved their panic   and  supported by the marines  leaped on shore and pursued the fugitives   we had not advanced far from the water side  on the beach  before we met  with two bunches of celery  which had been gathered by the cutter s crew   a broken oar was stuck upright in the ground  to which the natives had  tied their canoes  whereby we were convinced this was the spot where the  attack had been made  we now searched all along at the back of the beach   to see if the cutter was there  but instead of her  the most horrible  scene was presented to our view  for there lay the hearts  heads  and  lungs of several of our people  with hands and limbs in a mangled  condition  some broiled and some raw  but no other parts of their bodies   which made us suspect that the cannibals had feasted upon and devoured  the rest  at a little distance we saw the dogs gnawing their entrails  we  observed a large body of the natives collected together on a hill about  two miles off  but as night drew on apace  we could not advance to such a  distance  neither did we think it safe to attack them  or even to quit  the shore to take an account of the number killed  our troop being a very  small one  and the savages were both numerous  fierce  and much  irritated  while we remained almost stupefied on the spot  mr  fannen  said that he heard the cannibals assembling in the woods  on which we  returned to our boat  and having hauled alongside the canoes  we  demolished three of them  during this transaction the fire on the top of  the hill disappeared  and we could hear the savages in the woods at high  words  quarrelling  perhaps  on account of their different opinions   whether they should attack us and try to save their canoes  they were  armed with long lances  and weapons not unlike a sergeant s halbert in  shape  made of hard wood  and mounted with bone instead of iron  we  suspected that the dead bodies of our people had been divided among those  different parties of cannibals who had been concerned in the massacre   and it was not improbable that the group we saw at a distance by the fire  were feasting upon some of them  as those on shore had been where the  remains were found  before they had been disturbed by our unexpected  visit  be that as it may  we could discover no traces of more than four  of our friends  bodies  nor could we find the place where the cutter was  concealed  it now grew dark  on which account we collected carefully the  remains of our mangled friends  and  putting off  made the best of our  way from this polluted place  when we opened the upper part of the sound   we saw a very large fire about three or four miles higher up  which  formed a complete oval  reaching from the top of a hill down almost to  the water side  the middle space being enclosed all round by the fire   like a hedge  mr  burney and mr  fannen having consulted together  they  were both of opinion that we could  by an attempt  reap no other  advantage than the poor satisfaction of killing some more of the savages   upon leaving grass cove we had fired a volley towards where we heard the  indians talking  but by going in and out of the boat our pieces had got  wet  and four of them missed fire  what rendered our situation more  critical  it began to rain  and our ammunition was more than half  expended  we  for these reasons  without spending time where nothing  could be hoped for but revenge  proceeded for the ship  and arrived safe  aboard before midnight       it is a little remarkable that captain furneaux had been several times up  grass cove with captain cook  where they saw no inhabitants  and no other  signs of any but a few deserted villages  which appeared as if they had  not been occupied for many years  and yet  in mr  burney s opinion  when  he entered the same cove  there could not be less than fifteen hundred or  two thousand people     on thursday  the   rd of december  the adventure departed from  and made  sail out of  the sound  she stood to the eastward  to clear the straits   which was happily effected the same evening  but the ship was baffled for  two or three days with light winds before she could clear the coast  in  this interval of time the chests and effects of the ten men who had been  murdered were sold before the mast  according to an old sea custom     when captain cook was in the sound on his third voyage  he learned that  the massacre arose over an unpremeditated quarrel  kahura  who had been  active in the tragedy  told cook that a maori having brought a stone  hatchet to barter  the man to whom it was offered took it  and would  neither return it nor give anything for it  and on which the owner  snatched some bread from the party of europeans  who were at dinner on  the beach  as an equivalent  and then the quarrel began  kahura himself  had a narrow escape of being shot  while another was shot beside him  and  the europeans  outnumbered  were surrounded and killed  it was also  stated by the natives that not one of the shots fired by the party of  captain furneaux led by mr  burney to search for the missing people had  taken effect so as to kill or even to hurt a single person             appendix ii     the death of whareumu  king george        the death of this bay of islands chief  who acted as protector to mr   earle during his residence at kororareka  is thus described by messrs   hobbs and stack  wesleyan missionaries at hokianga  in a letter dated  from mangungu  hokianga  on the   nd march              on the same day that hongi died at whangaroa a son of the late pomare s   named tiki  was killed at waima by a chief of the tribe called  mahurihuri  waima is in hokianga  and only a few miles distance from us   the cause of the quarrel was this  tiki had had some of his pigs stolen  by the natives of waima  and he was seeking utu by robbing their sweet  potato plantations  for which he was shot      as soon as the report of the young man s death reached the bay of  islands      natives collected together  forming two divisions  under two  separate chiefs  whareumu  or  as he is called by the europeans  king  george  and toi  and came to hokianga  toi and his party arrived first at  waima  where he found patuone and all the natives and other chiefs of our  district  after robbing the natives of waima of their potatoes  etc    peace was made  and no further evil consequences seemed likely to arise   the next day  the   th  whareumu and his party arrived  he was highly  displeased with toi for having made peace on such easy terms  he  prevailed upon him  therefore  to break his league  whareumu was also  very insolent to muriwai  intimated that he was a coward  and poured  contempt upon the idea of the hokianga natives standing in their own  defence  on the morning of the   th a quarrel ensued between the     bay  of islanders and the natives of waima  our natives also having now become  their allies  this fray did not at the outset seem likely to be attended  with fatal results  but  as solomon justly observes  the beginning of  strife is like the letting out of water  so it was in this instance   shots were fired on both sides till several were killed and wounded  at  length muriwai  who was a pacificator  was wounded and fell  supposing he  was killed  our natives  for the natives of waima fled as soon as matters  assumed a serious aspect  no longer regarded matters lightly  but turned  round in great rage  for they also were in the act of retreating  and  singled out whareumu as a satisfaction for muriwai  whareumu received two  balls before he was killed  the one which killed him went through his  throat  as soon as he fell all his followers fled  leaving about nine of  their companions dead on the field  amongst whom was oro  the chief who  commenced our whangaroa robbing  this ended the contest  patuone and nene  immediately took up the body of the fallen chief and made great  lamentation over him  and have since placed his body between the bodies  of their own relations as a mark of respect              the edge of the war zone          i        la creste  huiry  couilly  s et m     september          dear old girl       more and more i find that we humans are queer animals     all through those early  busy  exciting days of september   can it be  only a fortnight ago   i was possessed  like the  busy bee   to   employ each shining hour  by writing out my adventures  yet  no  sooner was the menace of those days gone  than  for days at a time   i had no desire to see a pen     perhaps it was because we were so absolutely alone  and because   for days  i had no chance to send you the letters i had written  nor to  get any cable to you to tell you that all was well     there was a strange sort of soulagement in the conviction that we  had  as my neighbors say   echappe bien   i suppose it is human  it  was like the first days of a real convalescence  life is so good  the  world is so beautiful  the war was still going on  we still heard the  cannon  they are booming this minute  but we had not seen the  spiked helmets dashing up my hill  nor watched the walls of our little  hamlet fall  i imagine that if human nature were not just like that  life  could never be beautiful to any thinking person  we all know that   though it be not today  it is to be  but we seem to be fitted for that   and the idea does not spoil life one bit     it is very silent here most of the time  we are so few  everybody  works  no one talks much  with the cannon booming out there no  one feels in the humor  though now and then we do get shaken up a  bit  everything seems a long time ago  yet it is really only nine days  since the french troops advanced  nine days since paris was saved     the most amazing thing of all is that our communications  which were  cut on september    were reopened  in a sort of a way  on the   th   that was only one week of absolute isolation  on that day we were  told that postal communication with paris was to be reopened with an  automobile service from couilly to lagny  from which place  on the  other side of the marne  trains were running to paris     so amelie gathered up my letters  and carried them down the hill  and  dropped them hopefully in the box under the shuttered window of the  post office in the deserted town     that was six days ago  and it is only this morning that i began to feel  like writing to you again  i wanted to cable  but there is no way yet  so  i can only hope that you know your geography well enough not to  have worried since the  th     although we are so shut in  we got news from the other side of the  marne on wednesday  the  th  the day after i wrote to you  the fifth  day of the battle  of course we had no newspapers  our mairie and  post office being closed  there was no telegraphic news  besides  our  telegraph wires are dangling from the poles just as the english  engineers left them on september    it seems a century ago     we knew the germans were still retreating because each morning  the booming of the cannon and the columns of smoke were further  off  and because the slopes and the hills before us  which had been  burning the first three days of the battle  were lying silent in the  wonderful sunshine  as if there were no living people in the world  except us few on this side of the river     at no time can we see much movement across the river except with a  glass  the plains are undulating  the roads are tree lined  we trace  them by the trees  but the silence over there seems different today   here and there still thin ribbons of smoke  now rising straight in the  air  and now curling in the breeze  say that something is burning  not  only in the bombarded towns  but in the woods and plains  but what   no one knows     one or two of our older men crossed the marne on a raft on the   th   the sixth day of the battle  they brought back word that thousands  from the battles of the  th   th  and  th had lain for days un buried  under the hot september sun  but that the fire department was  already out there from paris  and that it would only be a few days  when the worst marks of the terrible fight would be removed  but they  brought back no news  the few people who had remained hidden in  cellars or on isolated farms knew no more than we did  and it was  impossible  naturally  to get near to the field ambulance at  neufmortier  which we can see from my lawn     however  on the  th  the very day after the french advanced from  here  we got news in a very amusing way  we had to take it for what  it was worth  or seemed to be  it was just after noon  i was working in  the garden on the south side of the house  i had instinctively put the  house between me and the smoke of battle when amelie came  running down the hill in a high state of excitement  crying out that the  french were  coming back   that there had been a  great victory    and that i was to  come and see      she was in too much of a hurry to explain or wait for any questions   she simply started across the fields in the direction of the demi lune   where the route nationale from meaux makes a curve to run down the  long hill to couilly     i grabbed a sunbonnet  picked up my glasses  and followed her to a  point in the field from which i could see the road     sure enough  there they were  cuirassiers  the sun glinting on their  helmets  riding slowly towards paris  as gaily as if returning from a  fete  with all sorts of trophies hanging to their saddles     i was content to go no nearer  it was no army returning  it was only a  small detachment  still  i could not help feeling that if any of them  were returning in that spirit  while the cannon were still booming  all  must be well     amelie ran all the way to the demi lune  a little more than a quarter  of a mile  i could see her simply flying over the ground  i waited where  i was until she came back  crying breathlessly  long before she  reached me      oh  madame  what do you think  the regiment which was here  yesterday captured a big  big cannon      that was good news  they really had not looked it      and oh  madame   she went on  as she reached me   the war is  over  the germans have asked for peace   and she sat right down  on the ground      peace   i exclaimed   where  who told you that       a man out there  he heard it from a soldier  they have asked for  peace  those boches  and general gallieni  he told them to go back  to their own frontier  and ask for it there       and have they gone  amelie   i asked     she replied quite seriously that they were going  and she was terribly  hurt because i laughed  and remarked that i hoped they would not be  too long about it     i had the greatest possible difficulty in making her realize that we  were only hearing a very small part of a battle  which  judging by the  movements which had preceded it  was possibly extending from here  to the vicinity of verdun  where the crown prince was said to be  vainly endeavoring to break through  his army acting as a sort of a  pivot on which the great advance had swung  i could not help  wondering if  as often happens in the game of  snap the whip   von  kluck s right wing had got swung off the line by the very rapidity with  which it must have covered that long arc in the great two weeks   offensive     amelie  who has an undue confidence in my opinion  was terribly  disappointed  quite downcast  ever since the british landed  she has  such faith in the british  she has believed in a short war  of course i  don t know any more than she does  i have to guess  and i m not a  lucky guesser as a rule  i confess to you that even i am absolutely  obsessed by the miracle which has turned the invaders back from the  walls of paris  i cannot get over the wonder of it  in the light of the  sudden  unexpected pause in that great push i have moments of  believing that almost anything can happen  i ll wager you know more  about it on your side of the great pond than we do here within hearing  of the battle     i don t even know whether it is true or not that gallieni is out there   if it is  that must mean that the army covering paris has advanced   and that joffre has called out his reserves which have been  entrenched all about the seventy two miles of steel that guards  the capital  i wondered then  and today  seven days later  i am  wondering still     it was useless to give these conjectures to amelie  she was too deep  in her disappointment  she walked sadly beside me back to the  garden  an altogether different person from the one who had come  racing across the field in the sunshine  once there  however  she  braced up enough to say      and only think  madame  a woman out there told me that the  germans who were here last week were all chauffeurs at the galeries  lafayette and other big shops in paris  and that they not only knew all  the country better than we do  they knew us all by name  one of  them  who stopped at her door to demand a drink  told her so himself   and called her by name  he told her he had lived in paris for years      that was probably true  the delivery automobiles from all the big  shops in paris came out here twice  and some of them three times a  week  it is no secret that paris was full of germans  and has been  ever since that beastly treaty of frankfort  which would have expired  next year     after amelie had gone back to her work  i came into the library and  sat down at my desk to possess my soul with what patience i could   until official news came  but writing was impossible     of course to a person who has known comparatively few restraints of  this sort  there is something queer in this kind of isolation  i am afraid  i cannot exactly explain it to you  as i could not work  i walked out on  to the chemin madame  on one side i looked across the valley of the  marne to the heights crowned by the bombarded towns  on the other  i looked across the valley of the grande morin  where  on the heights  behind the trees  i knew little towns like coutevoult and montbarbin  were evacuated  in the valley at the foot of the hill  couilly and st   germain  montry and esbly were equally deserted  no smoke rose  above the red roofs  not a soul was on the roads  even the railway  station was closed  and the empty cars stood  locked  on the side   tracks  it was strangely silent     i don t know how many people there are at voisins  i hear that there  is no one at quincy  as for huiry  well  our population  everyone  accounted for before the mobilization  was twenty nine  the hamlet  consists of only nine houses  today we are six grown people and  seven children     there is no doctor if one should be so silly as to fall ill  there are no  civil authorities to make out a death certificate if one had the bad  taste to die  and one can t die informally in france  if anyone should   so far as i can see  he would have to walk to his grave  dig it  and lie  down in it himself  and that would be a scandal  and i am positive it  would lead to a proces  the french love lawsuits  you know  no  respectable family is ever without one     however  there has not been a case of illness in our little community  since we were cut off from the rest of the world     somehow  at times  in the silence  i get a strange sensation of  unreality  the sort of intense feeling of its all being a dream  i wish i  didn t  i wonder if that is not nature s narcotic for all experiences  outside those we are to expect from life  which  in its normal course   has tragedies enough     then again  sometimes  in the night  i have a sensation as if i were  getting a special view of a really magnificent spectacle to which the  rest of  my set  had not been invited  as if i were seeing it at a risk   but determined to see it through     i can imagine you  wrinkling your brows at me and telling me that that  frame of mind comes of my theatre going habit  well  it is not worth  while arguing it out  i can t  there is a kind of veil over it     nor were the day s mental adventures over     i was just back from my promenade when my little french friend from  the foot of the hill came to the door  i call her  my little friend    though she is taller than i am  because she is only half my age   she came with the proposition that i should harness ninette and go  with her out to the battlefield  where  she said  they were sadly in  need of help     i asked her how she knew  and she replied that one of our old men  had been across the river and brought back the news that the field  ambulance at neufmortier was short of nurses  and that it was  thought that there were still many wounded men in the woods who  had not yet been picked up     i asked her if any official call for help had come  she said  no   but  she presented so strong a case in favor of volunteering that  at first  it  seemed to me that there was nothing to do but go  and go quickly     but before she got outside the gate i rushed after her to tell her that it  seemed impossible   that i knew they didn t want an old lady like me   however willing  an old lady very unsteady on her feet  absolutely  ignorant of the simplest rules of  first aid to the wounded   that they  needed skilled and tried people  that we not only could not lend  efficient aid  but should be a nuisance  even if  which i doubted  we  were allowed to cross the marne     all the time i was explaining myself  with that diabolical dual  consciousness which makes us spectator and listener to ourselves   in the back of my brain  or my soul  was running this query   i wonder  what a raw battlefield looks like  i have a chance to see if i want to    perhaps   i suppose that was an attack of involuntary  unpremeditated  curiosity  i did not want to go     i wonder if that was not the sort of thing which  if told in the  confessional in ancient times  got one convicted of being  possessed  of the devil      of course mlle  henriette was terribly disappointed  her mother would  not let her go without me  i imagine the wise lady knew that i would  not go  she tried to insist  but my mind was made up     she argued that we could  hunt for the dead   and  carry consolation  to the dying   i shook my head  i even had to cut the argument short  by going into the house  i felt an imperative need to get the door  closed between us  the habit i have  you know it well  it is often  enough disconcerting to me  of getting an ill timed comic picture in  my mind  made me afraid that i was going to laugh at the wrong  moment  if i had  i should never have been able to explain to her  and  hope to be understood     the truth was that i had a sudden  cinematographical vision of my  chubby self  me  who cannot walk half a mile  nor bend over without  getting palpitation  stumbling in my high heeled shoes over the fields  ploughed by cavalry and shell  breathlessly bent on carrying  consolation to the dying  i knew that i should surely have to be picked  up with the dead and dying  or  worse still  usurp a place in an  ambulance  unless eternal justice  in spite of my age  my sex  and my  white hairs  left me lying where i fell  and serve me good and right     i know now that if the need and opportunity had come to my gate  as  it might  i should  instinctively  have known what to do  and have  done it  but for me to drive deliberately nine miles  we should have  had to make a wide detour to cross the marne on the pontoons    behind a donkey who travels two miles an hour  to seek such an  experience  and with several hours to think it over en route  and the  conviction that i would be an unwelcome intruder  that was another  matter     i am afraid mlle  henriette will never forgive me  she will soon be  walking around in a hospital  looking so pretty in her nurse s dress  and veil  but she will always think that she lost a great opportunity that  day  and a picturesque one     by the way  i have a new inmate in my house  a kitten  he was  evidently lost during the emigration  amelie says he is three months  old  he arrived at her door crying with hunger the other morning   amelie loves beasties better than humans  she took him in and fed  him  but as she has six cats already  she seemed to think that it was  my duty to take this one  she cloaked that idea in the statement that it  was  good for me  to have  something alive  moving about me in the  silent little house  so she put him in my lap  he settled himself down   went to sleep  and showed no inclination to leave me     at the end of two hours he owned me  the very first cat i ever knew   except by sight     so you may dismiss that idea which torments you  i am no longer  alone     i am going to send this letter at once to be dropped in the box in front  of the post office  where i am very much afraid it may find that of last  week  for we have had no letters yet nor have i seen or heard  anything of the promised automobile postale  however  once a  stamped letter is out of my hand  i always feel at least as if it had  started  though in all probability this may rest indefinitely in that  box in the  deserted village            ii    september               it is over a week since i wrote you  but i have really been very busy   and not had a moment     to begin with  the very day after i wrote to you  amelie came down  with one of her sick headaches  and she has the most complete sort i  ever met     she crawled upstairs that morning to open my blinds  i gave one look  at her  and ordered her back to bed  if there is anything that can  make one look worse than a first class bilious attack i have never met  it  one can walk round and do things when one is suffering all sorts of  pain  or when one is trembling in every nerve  or when one is dying of  consumption  but i defy anyone to be useful when one has an active  sick headache     amelie protested  of course   the work must be done   i did not see  why it had to be  she argued that i was the mistress   had a right to  be attended to  had a right to expect it   i did not see that either   i told her that her logic was false  she clinched it  as she thought   by declaring that i looked as if i needed to be taken care of     i was indignant  i demanded the handglass  gave one look at myself   and i was inclined to let it slide off the bed to the floor  a la camille   only amelie would not have seen the joke  i did look old and seedy   but what of that  of course amelie does not know yet that i am like  the  deacon s one hoss shay   i may look dilapidated  but so long  as i do not absolutely drop apart  i can go     so i told amelie that if i were the mistress  i had a right to be obeyed   and that there were times when there was no question of mistress  and maid  that this was one of those times  that she had been a  trump and a brick  and other nice things  and that the one thing i  needed was to work with my own hands  she finally yielded  but not  to my arguments  to nature     perhaps owing to the excitement of three weeks  perhaps to the fact  that she had worked too hard in the sun  and also  it may be  owing to  the long run she took  of which i wrote you in my letter of last week  it  is the worst attack i ever saw  i can tell you i wished for a doctor  and  she is even now only a little better     however  i have had what we used to call  a real nice time playing  house   having nothing else to do  i really enjoyed it  i have swept  and dusted  and handled all my little treasures  touching everything  with a queer sensation  it had all become so very precious  all the  time my thoughts flew back to the past  that is the prettiest thing  about housework  one can think of such nice things when one is  working with one s hands  and is alone  i don t wonder burns wrote  verses as he followed the plough  if he really did     i think i forgot to tell you in my letter of last week that the people    drummed out of the towns on the other side of the marne  that is to  say  the near by towns  like those in the plain  and on the hilltops from  which the germans were driven before the   th  began to return on  that night  less than a fortnight after they fled  it was unbelievable to  me when i saw them coming back     when they were drummed out  they took a roundabout route  to  leave the main roads free for the army  they came back over the  route nationale  they fled en masse  they are coming back slowly  in  family groups  day after day  and night after night the flocks of sheep   droves of cattle  carts with pigs in them  people in carts leading now  and then a cow  families on foot  carrying cats in baskets  and leading  dogs and goats and children  climb the long hill from couilly  or thread  the footpaths on the canal     they fled in silence  i remember as remarkable that no one talked  i  cannot say that they are coming back exactly gaily  but  at any rate   they have found their tongues  the slow procession has been  passing for a fortnight now  and at almost any hour of the day  as i sit  at my bedroom window  i can hear the distant murmur of their voices  as they mount the hill     i can t help thinking what some of them are going to find out there in  the track of the battle  but it is a part of the strange result of war   borne in on me by my own frame of mind  that the very fact that they  are going back to their own hearths seems to reconcile them to  anything     of course these first people to return are mostly the poorer class   who did not go far  their speedy return is a proof of the morale of the  country  because they would surely not have been allowed to come  back by the military authorities if the general conviction was not that  the german advance had been definitely checked  isn t it wonderful   i can t get over it     even before they began to return  the engineers were at work  repairing the bridges as far as chalons  and the day i wrote to you  last week  when amelie went down the hill to mail your letter  she  brought back the news that the english engineers were sitting astride  the telegraph poles  pipes in mouth  putting up the wires they cut  down a fortnight ago  the next day our post office opened  and then i  got newspapers  i can tell you i devoured them  i read joffre s order  of the day  what puzzled me was that it was dated on the morning of  september    yet we  with our own eyes  saw the battle begin at noon  on the  th   a battle which only stopped at nine that night  to begin  again at four the next morning  but i suppose history will sometime  explain that     brief as the news was in the papers  it was exciting to know that the  battle we had seen and heard was really a decisive fight  and that it  was considered won by the english and french  in a rainstorm  as  long ago as the   th  and that the fighting to the east of us had been  far more terrible than here     i suppose long before this our myriads of  special telegraph  men  have sent you over details and anecdotes such as we shall never  see  we get a meagre  communique official  and have to be content  with that  it is now and then hard for me  who have been accustomed  to something different     none of our shops is open yet  indeed almost no one has returned to  couilly  and meaux  they say  is still deserted  yet i cannot honestly  say that i have suffered for anything  i have an abundance of fruit   we have plenty of vegetables in pere s garden  we have milk and  eggs  rabbits and chickens run about in the roads simply asking to  be potted  there is no petrol  but i  luckily  had a stock of candles   and i love candlelight  it suits my house better than lamps  it is over a  fortnight since we had sugar or butter or coffee  i have tea  i never  would have supposed that i could have got along so well and not felt  deprived  i suppose we always have too much  i ve had the proof   perhaps had there been anyone with me i should have felt it more   being alone i did not give it a thought     sunday afternoon  the weather being still fine and the distant  booming of the cannon making reading or writing impossible  i am  not yet habituated to it  i went for a walk  i took the road down the hill  in the direction of the marne  it is a pretty walk  not a house all the  way     it leads along what is called the pave du roi  dropping down into the  plain of the valley  through the woods  until the wheat fields are  reached  and then rising from the plain  gently  to the high suspension  bridge which crosses the canal  two minutes beyond which lies the  river  here very broad and sluggish     this part of the canal  which is perfectly straight from conde to  meaux  is unusually pretty  the banks are steep  and  tall poplar  trees  cast long shadows across grass edged footpaths  above which  the high bridge is swung  there is no bridge here across the marne   the nearest in one direction is at the iles les villenoy  and in the other  at meaux  so  as the germans could not have crossed the marne  here  the canal bridge was not destroyed  though it was mined  the  barricades of loose stones which the english built three weeks ago   both at the bridgehead and at a bend in the road just before it is  reached  where the road to mareuil sur marne turns off  were still  there     the road along the canal and through mareuil is the one over which  the german cavalry would have advanced had von kluck s army  succeeded in crossing the marne at meaux  and it was patrolled and  guarded by the yorkshire boys on september    and the bedfords  from the night of the  d to the morning of the  th     the road from the canal to the river  separated here by only a few  yards  leads through a wide avenue  across a private estate  belonging to the proprietor of the plaster quarries at mareuil  to a  ferry  beside which was the lavoir  there is a sunken and terraced  fruit garden below the road  and an extensive enclosure for fancy  fowl     the bank of the river showed me a sad sight  the wash houses were  sunk  they lay under water  with their chimneys sticking out  the little  river piers and all the row boats had been smashed and most of them  sunk  a few of them  drawn up on the bank  were splintered into  kindling wood  this work of destruction had been done  most  effectively  by the english  they had not left a stick anywhere that  could have served the invaders  it was an ugly sight  and the only  consolation was to say   if the boches had passed  it would have  been worse   this was only ugly  that would have been tragic     the next day i had my first real news from meaux  a woman arrived  at amelie s  leading two dogs tied together with rope  she was a  music teacher  living at meaux  and had walked over thirty miles  and  arrived exhausted  so they took her in for the night  and the next  morning pere harnessed ninette and took her and her weary dogs to  meaux  it was over two hours each way for ninette  but it was better  than seeing an exhausted woman  almost as old as i am  finishing  her pilgrimage on foot  she is the first person returning to meaux that  we have seen  besides  i imagine pere was glad of the excuse to go  across the marne     when he came back we knew exactly what had happened at the  cathedral city     the picturesque mill bridges across the marne have been partly  saved  the ends of the bridges on the town side were blown up  and  the mills were mined  to be destroyed on the german approach  pere  was told that an appeal was made to the english commanders to  save the old landmarks if possible  and although at that time it  seemed to no one at all likely that they could be saved  this  precaution did save them  he tells me that blowing up the bridge   heads smashed all the windows  blew out all the doors  and damaged  the walls more or less  but all that is reparable     do you remember the last time we were at meaux  how we leaned on  the stone wall on that beautiful promenade des trinitaires  and  watched the waters of the marne churned into froth by the huge  wheels of the three lines of mills lying from bank to bank  i know you  will be glad they are saved  it would have been a pity to destroy that  beautiful view  i am afraid that we are in an epoch where we shall  have to thank fate for every fine thing and every well loved view  which survives this war between the marne and the frontier  where  the ground had been fought over in all the great wars of france since  the days of charlemagne     it seems that more people stayed at meaux than i supposed   monsignor morbeau stayed there  and they say about a thousand of  the poor were hidden carefully in the cellars  it had fourteen thousand  inhabitants  only about five buildings were reached by bombs  and  the damage is not even worth recording     i am sure you must have seen the bishop in the days when you lived  in paris  when he was cure at st  honore d eylau in the place victor  hugo  at that time he was a popular priest  mondain  clever and  eloquent  at meaux he is a power  no figure is so familiar in the  picturesque old streets  especially on market day  saturday  as this  tall  powerful looking man in his soutane and barrette  with his air of  authority  familiar yet dignified  he seems to know everyone by name   is all over the market  his keen eyes seeing everything  as influential  in the everyday life of his diocese as he is in its spiritual affairs  a  model of what a modern archbishop ought to be     i hear he was on the battlefield from the beginning  and that the first  ambulances to reach meaux found the seminary full of wounded  picked up under his direction and cared for as well as his resources  permitted  he has written his name in the history of the old town  under that of bossuet  and in the records of such a town that is no  small distinction     the news which is slowly filtering back to us from the plains is another  matter     some of the families in our commune have relatives residing in the  little hamlets between cregy and monthyon  and have been out to  help them re install themselves  very little in the way of details of the  battle seems to be known  trees and houses dumbly tell their own  tales  the roads are terribly cut up  but road builders are already at  work  huge trees have been broken off like twigs  but even there men  are at work  uprooting them and cutting the wood into lengths and  piling it neatly along the roadside to be carted away  the dead are  buried  and paris automobiles are rapidly removing all traces of the  battles and carrying out of sight such disfigurements as can be  removed     but the details we get regarding the brief german occupation are too  disgusting for words  it is not the actual destruction of the battle  for  barcy alone of the towns in sight from here seems to be practically  destroyed  which is the most painful  it is the devastation of the  german occupation  with its deliberate and filthy defilement of the  houses  which defies words  and will leave a blot for all time on the  records of the race so vile minded as to have achieved it  the  deliberate ingenuity of the nastiness is its most debasing feature  at  penchard  where the germans only stayed twenty four hours  many  people were obliged to make bonfires of the bedding and all sorts of  other things as the only and quickest way to purge the town of danger  in such hot weather     i am told that penchard is a fair example of what the germans did in  all these small towns which lay in the line of their hurried retreat     it is not worth while for me to go into detail regarding such disgusting  acts     your imagination  at its most active  cannot do any wrong to the race  which in this war seems determined to offend where it cannot  terrorize     it is wonderfully characteristic of the french that they have accepted  this feature of their disaster as they have accepted the rest  with  courage  and that they have at once gone to work to remove all the  german  hall marks  as quickly as possible  and now have gone  back to their fields in the same spirit     it was not until yesterday that i unpacked my little hat trunk and  carefully put its contents back into place     it has stood all these days under the stairs in the salon  hat  cape   and gloves on it  and shoes beside it  just as i packed it     i had an odd sensation while i was emptying it  i don t know why i put  it off so long  perhaps i dreaded to find  locked in it  a too vivid  recollection of the day i closed it  it may be that i was afraid that  with  the perversity of inanimate things  it had the laugh on me     i don t believe i put it off from fear of having to repack it  for  so  far as i can know myself  i cannot find in my mind any signs  even   of a dread that what had happened once could happen again  but  i don t know     i wish i had more newsy things to write you  but nothing is happening  here  you see           ili        october              well  amelie came back yesterday  and i can tell you it was a busy  day  i assure you that i was glad to see her about the house again  i  liked doing the work well enough   for a little while  but i had quite  all i wanted of it before the fortnight was over  i felt like  giving  praise  when i saw her coming into the garden  looking just as  good as new  and  my word for it  she made things hum yesterday     the first thing she did  after the house was in order  and lunch out of  the way  was to open up the cave in which she had stored her  household treasures a month ago  and i passed a rare afternoon  i  spent a good part of it getting behind something to conceal my silent  laughter  if you had been here you would have enjoyed it  and her     i knew something was as it should not be when i saw her pushing the  little wheelbarrow on which were all my waste baskets  i have needed  them  but when i got them back  it about finished my attempts at  sobriety  i told her to put them on the dining room table and i would  unpack them and put the contents in place  but before that was done   i had to listen to her  tale of woe      she had hidden practically everything  clocks  bed and table linen  all  her mattresses  except the ones she and pere slept on  practically all  their clothes  except what they had on their backs and one change  i  had not given it much thought  though i do remember her saying   when the subterranean passage was sealed up   let the boches  come  they ll find mighty little in my house      well  the clocks are rusted  they are soaking in kerosene now  and i  imagine it is little good that will do them  all her linen is damp and  smelly  and much of it is mildewed  as for the blankets and flannels    ough     i felt sympathetic  and tried to appear so  but i was in the condition of   l homme qui rit   the smallest effort to express an emotion tended  to make me grimace horribly  she was so funny  i was glad when she  finished saying naughty words about herself  and declaring that   madame was right not to upset her house   and that the next time  the boches thought of coming here they would be welcome to  anything she had   for   she ended   i ll never get myself into this sort  of a mess again  my word of honor   and she marched out of the  house  carrying the bottle of eau de javelle with her  the whole  hamlet smells of it this minute     i had a small sized fit of hysterics after she had gone  and it was not  cured by opening up my waste baskets and laying out the  treasures   she had saved for me  i laughed until i cried     there were my bouillion cups  and no saucers  the saucers were  piled in the buffet  there were half a dozen decorated plates which  had stood on end in the buffet   just as color notes  no value at all   there were bits of silver  and nearly all the plated stuff  there was an  old painted fan  several strings of beads  a rosary which hung on a  nail at the head of my bed  a few bits of jewelry  you know how little i  care for jewelry   and there were four brass candlesticks     the only things i had missed at all were the plated things  i had not  had teaspoons enough when the english were here  not that they  cared  they were quite willing to stir their tea with each other s  spoons  since there was plenty of tea   and a  stick  went with it     you cannot deny that it had its funny side     i could not help asking myself  even while i wiped tears of laughter  from my eyes  if most of the people i saw flying four weeks ago might  not have found themselves in the same fix when it came to taking  stock of what was saved and what was lost     i remember so well being at aix les bains  in       when the hotel du  beau site was burned  and finding a woman in a wrapper sitting on a  bench in the park in front of the burning hotel  with the lace waist of  an evening frock in one hand  and a small bottle of alcohol in the  other  she explained to me  with some emotion  that she had gone  back  at the risk of her life  to get the bottle from her dressing table    for fear that it would explode      it did not take me half an hour to get my effects in order  but poor  amelie s disgust seems to increase with time  you can t deny that if i  had been drummed out and came back to find my house a ruin  my  books and pictures destroyed  and only those worthless bits of china  and plated ware to  start housekeeping again   it would have been  humorous  real humor is only exaggeration  that would surely have  been a colossal exaggeration     it is not the first time i have had to ask myself  seriously   why this  mania for possession   the ferryman on the styx is as likely to take it  across as our railroad is to  handle  it today  yet nothing seems able  to break a person born with that mania for collecting     i stood looking round at it all when everything was in place  and i  realized that if the disaster had come  i should have found it easy to  reconcile myself to it in an epoch where millions were facing it with  me  it is the law of nature  material things  like the friends we have  lost  may be eternally regretted  they cannot be eternally grieved for   we must    be up and doing  with a heart for any fate      all the same  it was a queer twist in the order of my life  that  hunting  in all directions for a quiet retreat in which to rest my weary spirit  i  should have ended by deliberately sitting myself down on the edge of  a battlefield   even though it was on the safe edge   and stranger still   that there i forgot that my spirit was weary     we are beginning to pick up all sorts of odd little tales of the  adventures of some of the people who had remained at voisin  one  old man there  a mason  who had worked on my house  had a very  queer experience  like all the rest of them  he went on working in the  fields all through the menacing days  i can t make out whether he had  no realization of actual danger  or whether that was his way of  meeting it  anyway  he disappeared on the morning the battle began   september    and did not return for several days  his old wife had  made up her mind that the germans had got him  when one morning  he turned up  tired  pale  and hungry  and not in any state to explain  his absence     it was some days before his wife could get the story out of him  he  owns a field about halfway between voisins and mareuil  close to the  route de pave du roi  and on the morning that the battle began he  was digging potatoes there  suddenly he saw a small group of  horsemen riding down from the canal  and by their spiked helmets he  knew them for germans     his first idea  naturally  was to escape  he dropped his hoe  but he  was too paralyzed with fear to run  and there was nothing to hide  behind  so he began walking across the field as well as his trembling  old legs would let him  with his hands in his pockets     of course the uhlans overtook him in a few minutes  and called out to  him  in french  to stop  he stopped at once  expecting to be shot  instantly     they ordered him to come out into the road  he managed to obey  by  the time he got there terror had made him quite speechless     they began to question him  to all their questions he merely shook  his head  he understood well enough  but his tongue refused its  office  and by the time he could speak the idea had come to him to  pretend that he was not french  that he was a refugee  that he did  not know the country   was lost   in fact  that he did not know  anything  he managed to carry it off  and finally they gave him up as  a bad job  and rode away up the hill towards my house     then he had a new panic  he did not dare go home  he was afraid  he would find them in the village  and that they would find out he had  lied and harm his old wife  or perhaps destroy the town  so he had  hidden down by the canal until hunger drove him home  it is a simple  tale  but it was a rude experience for the old man  who has not got  over it yet     i am afraid all this seems trivial to you  coming out of the midst of this  terrible war  but it is actually our life here  we listen to the cannon in  ignorance of what is happening  where would be the sense of my  writing you that the battle front has settled down to uncomfortable  trench work on the aisne  that manoury is holding the line in front of  us from compiegne to soissons  with castelnau to the north of him   with his left wing resting on the somme  that maud huy was behind  albert  and that rheims cathedral had been persistently and brutally  shelled since september     we only get news of that sort  intermittently  our railroad is in the hands of the minister of war  and  every day or two our communications are cut off  from military  necessity  you know  i am sure  more about all this than we do  with  your cable men filling the newspapers     but if i am seeing none of that  i am seeing the spirit of these people   so sure of success in the end  and so convinced that  even if it takes  the whole world to do it  they will yet see the hohenzollern dynasty go  up in the smoke of the conflagration it has lighted     of course  the vicious destruction of the great cathedral sends  shivers down my back  every time i hear the big guns in that direction  i think of the last time we were there  do you remember how we sat   in the twilight of a rainy day  in our top floor room  at the lion d or  in  the wide window seat  which brought us just at a level with that dear  tympanum  with its primitive stone carving of david and goliath  and  all those wonderful animals sitting up so bravely on the lacework of  the parapet  such a wave of pity goes over me when i think that not  only is it destroyed  but that future generations are deprived of seeing  it  that one of the greatest achievements of the hands of man  a work  which has withstood so many wars in what we called  savage times    before any claims were made for  kultur   should have been  destroyed in our days  men have come and men have gone   apologies to tennyson   it is the law of living  but the wilful   unnecessary destruction of the great works of man  the testimony  which one age has left as a heritage to all time  for that loss neither  man nor time has any consolation  it is a theft from future ages  and  for it germany will merit the hatred of the world through the coming  generations           iv        october               amelie and i went up to paris day before yesterday  for the first time  since the battle   you see everything here dates  before  and  after   the battle  and will for a long time     trains had been running between paris and meaux for ten days  and  will soon go as far as chalons  where the etat major was the last time  we heard of it  isn t that pretty quick work  and with three big bridges  to build  but the army needed the road  and the engineers were at  work five days after the battle     there are but few trains  none yet on our branch road  so we had to  go to esbly  it took two hours to get to paris  hardly more than twelve  miles  we simply crawled most of the way  we crept through the  tunnel this side of lagny  and then stood on this side of the marne   and whistled and shrieked a long time before we began to wiggle  across the unfinished bridge  with workmen hanging up on the  derricks and scaffoldings in all sorts of perilous positions  and all sorts  of grotesque attitudes  i was glad when we were over     i found the town more normal than it was when i was there six weeks  ago  if i had not seen it in those first days of the mobilization it would  have seemed sadder than it did  and  by contrast  while it was not the  paris that you know  it was quiet and peaceful   no excitement of any  sort in the streets  practically no men anywhere  all the department  shops were open  but few people were in them  and very little to sell   many of the small shops were closed  and will be  i imagine  until the  end of the war  all the austrian and german shops  and there were  many of them  are  of course  closed for good  making wide spaces of  closed shutters in the avenue de l opera and the rue de la paix  and  the rue scribe  where so many of the steamship offices are  that  and  the lack of omnibuses and tramways and the scarcity of cabs  makes  the once brilliant and active quarter look quite unnatural  however  it  gives one a chance to see how really handsome it is     a great many of the most fashionable hotels are turned to hospitals   and everywhere  especially along the champs elysees  the flags of  the red cross float over once gay resorts  while big white bunting  signs extend across almost every other facade  carrying the name  and number of a hospital     every sort of business is running short handed  and no big office or  bank is open between the hours of noon and two o clock     i saw no one  there was no one to see  i finished the little business i  had to do and then i went back to the station and sat on the terrace of  the cafe opposite  and  for an hour  i watched the soldiers going in at  one gate  and the public  indian file  presenting its papers at another   no carriages can enter the courtyard  no one can carry anything but  hand luggage  and porters are not allowed to pass the gates  so one  had to carry one s bundles one s self across the wide  paved court   however  it is less trying to do this than it was in other days  as one  runs no risk from flying motor cabs     we did not leave paris until six  it was already dark  and there were  few lights along the road  the germans would love to destroy this  road  which is on the direct line to the front  but i cannot imagine a  bomb from an aeroplane reaching it at night  except by accident     by the way  the attitude of the public towards these war airships is  queer  it seems a great deal more curiosity than fear  i had heard this  stated  and i had a chance to see it exemplified  just as amelie and i  were stumbling in the dusk over the rough pavement of the court  we  heard an aeroplane overhead  everyone stopped short and looked  up  some fool called  une taube  une taube   people already inside  the station turned and ran back to see  of course  it wasn t a taube   still  the fact that someone said it was  and that everyone ran out to  look up at it  was significant  as i am sure they would have done just  the same if it had really been a german machine     we came back even more slowly than we had gone up  it took ten  minutes by my watch to cross the bridge at chalifere  we jigged a bit  and stopped  staggered a bit  and trembled  and stopped  crawled a  bit  and whistled  i had a feeling that if anyone disobeyed the order  pasted on every window  and leaned out  we should topple over into  the stream  still  no one seemed to mind  with the curtains drawn   everyone tried to read  by the dim light  a newspaper  it is remarkable  how even ordinary people face danger if a panic can be prevented   the really great person is the one who even in a panic does not lose  his head  and the next best thing to not being feazed at danger is  i  believe  to be literally paralyzed  total immobility often passes for  pluck     it was nearly half past eight when we reached esbly  the town was  absolutely dark  pere was there with the donkey cart  and it took  nearly an hour and a half to climb the hill to huiry  it was pitch dark   and oh  so cold  both conde and voisins  as well as esbly  had street  lamps  gas  before the war  but it was cut off when mobilization  began  and so the road was black  this ordinary voyage seemed like  journeying in a wilderness  and i was as tired as if i had been to  london  which i take to be the hardest trip for the time it consumes  that i know  i used to go to london in seven hours  and this trip to  paris and back had taken four hours and a half by train and three by  carriage     i found your letter dated september     in reply to my first one mailed  after the battle  i am shocked to hear that i was spectacular  i did not  mean to be  i apologize  please imagine me very red in the face and  feeling a little bit silly  i should not mind your looking on me as a  heroine and all those other names you throw at me if i had had time  to flee along the roads with all i could save of my home on my back   as i saw thousands doing     but i cannot pick up your bouquets  considering that all i had to do  was  sit tight  for a few days  and watch  at a safe distance  a battle  sweep back  all you must say about that is  she did have luck   that s  what i say every day     as our railway communication is to be cut again  i am hurrying this  off  not knowing when i can send another  but as you see  i have no  news to write  just words to remind you of me  and say that all is well  with me in this world where it is so ill for many           v        november              it was not until i got out my letter book this morning that i realized  that i had let three weeks go by without writing to you  i have no  excuse to offer  unless the suspense of the war may pass as one     we have settled down to a long war  and though we have settled  down with hope  i can tell you every day demands its courage     the fall of antwerp was accepted as inevitable  but it gave us all a  sad day  it was no use to write you things of that sort  you  i presume   do not need to be told  although you are so far away  that for me   personally  it could only increase the grief i felt that washington had  not made the protest i expected when the belgian frontier was  crossed  it would have been only a moral effort  but it would have  been a blow between the eyes for the nervous germans     all the words we get from the front tell us that the boys are standing  the winter in the trenches very well  they ve simply got to  that is all  there is to that     amelie is more astonished than i am  when she first realized that  they had got to stay out there in the rain and the mud and the cold   she just gasped out that they never would stand it     i asked her what they would do then  lie down and let the germans  ride over them  her only reply was that they would all die  it is hard  for her to realize yet the resistance of her own race     i am realizing in several ways  in a small sense  what the men are  enduring  i take my bit of daily exercise walking round my garden  i  always have to carry a trowel in my sweater pocket  and i stop every  ten steps to dig the cakes of mud off my sabots  i take up a good bit  of my landed property at every step  so i can guess  at least  what it  must be out in the trenches  this highly cultivated  well fertilized  french soil has its inconveniences in a country where the ground  rarely freezes as it does in new england     also i am very cold     when i came out here i found that the coal dealer was willing to  deliver coal to me once a week  i had a long  covered box along the  wall of the kitchen which held an ample supply of coal for the week   the system had two advantages  it enabled me to do my trading in  the commune  which i liked  and it relieved amelie from having to  carry heavy hods of coal in all weathers from the grange outside  but   alas  the railroad communications being cut  no coal  i had big wood  enough to take me through the first weeks  and have some still  but it  will hardly last me to christmas  nor does the open fire heat the  house as the salamandre did  but it is wartime  and i must not  complain  yet     you accuse me in your last letter of being flippant in what seems to  you tragic circumstances  i am sorry that i make that impression on  you  i am not a bit flippant  i can only advise you to come over here   and live a little in this atmosphere  and see how you would feel  i am  afraid that no amount of imagining what one will or will not do  prepares one to know what one will really do face to face with such  actualities as i live amongst  i must confess that had i had anyone  dear to me here  anyone for whose safety or moral courage i was  or  imagined i was  responsible  for  after all  we are responsible for no  one   my frame of mind and perhaps my acts might have been  different  i don t know  why  none of the men that i see have the air of  feeling they are heroes  they just seem to think of it all as if it were  merely  in the day s work      for example  do you remember that handsome younger brother of  my sculptor friend  the english boy who was in the heavy artillery  and  had been in china and north nigeria with sir frederick ludgard as an  aide de camp  and finally as assistant governor general  well  he  was with the first division of the british expedition which landed in  france in the middle of august  he made all that long  hard retreat  from belgium to the marne  and was in the terrible battle of the  rivers  i am enclosing a letter i have just received from him  because  i think it very characteristic  besides  if you remember him  i am sure  that it will interest you  i don t know where it is from  they are not  allowed to tell  it came  as army letters do  without any stamp  the  carriage is free  with the round red stamp of the censor  a crown in  the middle  and the words  passed by the censor   and the number  printed around it  here it is       my dearest m     october             last night i heard your account of your experiences between  september   and    and it made me boil anew with disappointment  that my attempts to reach huiry on september   were frustrated  i  was disappointed enough at the time  but then my regret was  tempered by the thought that you were probably safe in paris  and i  should only find an empty house at la creste  now that i know that i  should have found you  you     it makes me wild  even after this  interval of time  to have missed a sight of you  now let me tell you  how it came about that you nearly received a visit from me     i left england august     with the   th heavy battery   d division    we landed at rouen  and went by train  via amiens  to houtmont  a  few kilometres west of mauberge  there we detrained one morning at  two o clock  marched through malplaquet into belgium  and came in  contact with the enemy at once     the story of the english retreat must be familiar to you by now  it was  a wonderful experience  i am glad to have gone through it  though i  am not anxious to undergo such a time again  we crossed the marne  at meaux  on september    marching due east to signy signets   funnily enough it was not until i had actually crossed the marne that i  suddenly realized that i was in your vicinity  our route  unfortunately   led right away from you  and i could not ask to get away while we  were actually on the march  and possibly going many miles in another  direction  the following day  however  the  th  we retraced our steps  somewhat  and halted to bivouac a short distance west of a village  named la haute maison  roughly about six miles from you  i  immediately asked permission to ride over to huiry  the major  with  much regret  declined to let me leave  and  since we received orders  to march again an hour later  he was right  we marched all that night   i have marked out our road with arrows on the little map enclosed   we reached a place called fontenay about      the next morning  by  which time i was twenty miles from you  and not in a condition to want  anything but sleep and food  that was our farthest point south  but   sad to say  in our advance we went by a road farther east  and quite  out of reach of you  and crossed the marne at a place called nanteuil   i got your first letter about one day s march south of mons     best love  dearest m        write again       isn t that a calm way to state such a trying experience as that retreat   it is only a sample of a soldier s letter     if he were disappointed you can imagine that i was  luckily i had  seen him in june  when he was here on a visit  having just returned  from north nigeria  after five years in the civil service  to take up his  grade in the army  little dreaming there was to be a war at once     if he had come that afternoon imagine what i should have felt to see  him ride down by the picket at the gate  he would have found me  pouring tea for captain edwards of the bedfords  it would have surely  added a touch of reality to the battle of the next days  of course i  knew he was somewhere out there  but to have seen him actually  riding away to it would have been different  yet it might not  for i am  sure his conversation would have been as calm as his letters  and  they read as much as if he were taking an exciting pleasure trip  with  interesting risks thrown in  as anything else  that is so english  on  some future day i suppose we shall sit together on the lawn  he will  probably lie on it  and swap wonderful stories  for i am going to be  one of the veterans of this war     i must own that when i read the letter i found it suggestive of the days  that are gone  imagine marching through malplaquet and over all that  west flanders country with its memories of marlborough  and where   had the dutch left the duke a free hand  he would have marched on  paris  with other allies  as he did on lille  i must own that history  with  its records of bitter enemies yesterday  bosom friends today  does not  inspire one with much hope of seeing the dreamer s vision of  universal peace realized     still  i must confess that the attitude of french and english to one  another today is almost thrilling  the english tommy atkins and the  french poilu are delightful together  for that matter  the french  peasants love the english  they never saw any before  and their  admiration and devotion to  tommee   as they call him  is  unbounded  they think him so  chic   and he is     no one  not even i  who so love them  could ever accuse the  piou   piou  of being chic     the french conscript in his misfits has too long been the object of  affectionate sarcasm and the subject of caricature to be unfamiliar to  the smiles of the whole world     you see the army outfits are made in three sizes only  so far as my  observation goes none of the three measurements fits anyone today   and as for the man who is a real  between   well  he is in a sad box   but what of that  he doesn t seem to care  he is so occupied today  fighting  just as he did in the days of the great napoleon  that no one  cares a rap how he looks  and surely he does not     you might think he would be a bit self conscious regarding his  appearance when he comes in contact with his smarter looking ally   not a bit of it  the poilu just admires tommy and is proud of him  i do  wish you could see them together  the poilu would hug tommy and  plant a kiss on each of his cheeks  if he dared  but  needless to say   that is the last sort of thing tommy wants  so  faute de mieux the  poilu walks as close to tommy as he can  when he gets a chance    and the undemonstrative  sure of himself tommy permits it without a  smile  which is doing well  still  in his own way tommy admires back    it is mutual     the englishman may learn to unbend  i don t know  the spirit which  has carried him all over the world  rubbed him against all sorts of  conditions and so many civilizations without changing his character   and made of him the one race immune to home sickness  has  persisted for centuries  and may be so bred in the bone  fibre  and  soul of the race as to persist forever  it may have made his legs and  his spine so straight that he can t unbend  he has his own kind of fun   but it s mostly of the sporting sort  he will  i imagine  hardly contract  the frenchman s sort  which is so largely on his lips  and in his  mentality  and has given the race the most mobile faces in the world     i am enclosing a copy of the little map captain s      sent me  it may  give you an idea of the route the english were moving on during the  battle  and the long forced march they made after the fighting of the  two weeks ending august        i imagine they were all too tired to note how beautiful the country was   it was lovely weather  and coming down the route from haute  maison  by la chapelle  to the old moated town of crecy en brie at  sunset  must have been beautiful  and then climbing by voulangis to  the forest of crecy on the way to fontenay by moonlight even more  lovely  with the panorama of villiers and the valley of the morin seen  through the trees of the winding road  with montbarbin standing   outlined in white light  on the top of a hill  like a fairy town  tired as  they were  i do hope there were some among them who could still  look with a dreamer s eyes on these pictures     actually the only work i have done of late has been to dig a little in the  garden  preparing for winter  i did not take my geraniums up until last  week  as for the dahlias i wrote you about  they became almost a  scandal in the commune  they grew and grew  like jack s beanstalk    prodigiously  i can t think of any other word to express it  they were  eight feet high and full of flowers  which we cut for the jour des morts   i know you won t believe that  but it is true  a few days later there  came a wind storm  and when it was over  in spite of the heavy poles  i put in to hold them up  they were laid as flat as though the german  cavalry had passed over them  i was heart broken  but pere only  shrugged his shoulders and remarked   if one will live on the top of a  hill facing the north what can one expect   and i had no reply to  make  fortunately the wind can t blow my panorama away  though at  present i don t often look out at it  i content myself by playing in the  garden on the south side  and  if i go out at all  it is to walk through  the orchards and look over the valley of the morin  towards the south     my  but i m cold  too cold to tell you about  the ends of my fingers  hurt the keys of my machine           vi        november             i am sorry that  as you say in your letter of october     just received   you are disappointed that i  do not write you more about the war    dear child  i am not seeing any of it  we are settled down here to a  life that is nearly normal  much more normal than i dreamed could be  possible forty miles from the front  we are still in the zone of military  operations  and probably shall be until spring  at least  our  communications with the outside world are frequently cut  we get our  mail with great irregularity  even our local mail goes to meaux  and is  held there five days  as the simplest way of exercising the censorship   it takes nearly ten days to get an answer to a letter to paris     all that i see which actually reminds me of the war  now that we are  used to the absence of the men  i see on the route nationale  when i  drive down to couilly  across the fields it is a short and pretty walk   amelie makes it in twenty minutes  i could  if it were not for climbing  that terrible hill to get back     besides  the mud is inches deep  i have a queer little four wheeled  cart  covered  if i want to unroll the curtains  i call it my perambulator   and really  with ninette hitched in  i am like an overgrown baby in its  baby carriage  and any nurse i ever knew would push a perambulator  faster than that donkey drags mine  yet it just suits my mood  i sit  comfortably in it  and travel slowly  time being non existent  so slowly  that i can watch the wheat sprout  and gaze at the birds and the view  and the clouds  i do hold on to the reins  just for looks  though i have  no need to  and i doubt if ninette suspects me of doing anything so  foolish  on the road i always meet officers riding along  military cars  flying along  army couriers spluttering along on motor cycles  heavy  motor transports groaning up hill  or thundering down  and now and  then a long train of motor ambulances  almost any morning  at nine  i  can see the long line of camions carrying the revitaillement towards  the front  and the other afternoon  as i was driving up the hill  i met a  train of ambulances coming down  the big grey things slid  one after  another  around the curve of the demi lune  and simply flew by me   raising such a cloud of dust that after i had counted thirty  i found i  could not see them  and the continual tooting of the horns began to  make ninette nervous  she had never seen anything like that before    so  for fear she might do some trick she never had done in her life   like shying  and also for fear that the drivers  who were rushing by  exactly in the middle of the road  might not see me in the dust  or a  car might skid  i slid out  and led my equipage the rest of the way  i  do assure you these are actually all the war signs we see  though  of  course  we still hear the cannon     but  though we don t see it  we feel it in many ways  my neighbors  feel it more than i do  for one example  the fruit crop this year has  been an absolute loss  luckily the cassis got away before the war  was declared  but we hear it was a loss to the buyers  and it was held  in the channel ports  necessarily  and was spoiled  but apples and  pears had no market  in ordinary years purchasers come to buy the  trees  and send their own pickers and packers  and what was not  sold in that way went to the big saturday market at meaux  this year  there is no market at meaux  the town is still partly empty  and the  railroad cannot carry produce now  this is a tragic loss to the small  cultivator  though  as yet  he is not suffering  and he usually puts all  such winnings into his stocking     we still have no coal to speak of  i am burning wood in the salon    and green wood at that  the big blaze  when i can get it  suits my  house better than the salamandre did  but i cannot get a temperature  above    fahrenheit  i am used to sixty  and i remember you used to  find that too low in paris  i blister my face  and freeze my back  just as  we used to in the old days of glorious october at the farm in new  sharon  where my mother was born  and where i spent my summers  and part of the autumn in my school days     you might think it would be easy to get wood  it is not  the army  takes a lot of it  and those who  in ordinary winters  have wood to sell   have to keep it for themselves this year  pere has cut down all the old  trees he could find  old prune trees  old apple trees  old chestnut  trees  and it is not the best of firewood  i hated to see even that done   but he claimed that he wanted to clear a couple of pieces of land  and  i try to believe him  did you ever burn green wood  if you have   enough said     unluckily  since you expect me to write often  i am a creature of  habit     i never could write as you can  with a pad on my knees  huddled over  the fire  i suppose that i could have acquired the habit if i had begun  my education at the sorbonne  instead of polishing off there  i  remember when i first began to haunt that university  eighteen years  ago  how amazed i was to see the students huddled into a small  space with overcoats and hats on their knees  a note book on top of  them  an ink pot in one hand and a pen in the other  and  in spite of  obstacles  absorbed in the lecture  i used to wonder if they had ever  heard of  stylos   even while i understood  as i never had done  before  the real love of learning that marks the race  alas  i have to  be halfway comfortable before i can half accomplish anything     i am thankful to say that the temperature has been moderating a little   and life about me has been active  one day it was the big threshing   machine  and the work was largely done by women  and the air was  full of throbbing and dust  yesterday it was the cider press  and i  stood about  at amelie s  in the sun  half the afternoon  watching the  motor hash the apples  and the press squeeze out the yellow juice   which rushed foaming into big vats  did you ever drink cider like that     it is the only way i like it  it carried me back to my girlhood and the  summers in the sandy river valley  i don t know why it is  of late  that  my mind turns so often back to those days  and with such affection   perhaps it is only because i find myself once more living in the  country  it may be true that life is a circle  and as one approaches the  end the beginning becomes visible  and associated with both the  beginning and end of mine there is a war  however it is to be  explained  there remains the fact that my middle distances are getting  wiped out     in these still nights  when i cannot sleep  i think more often than of  anything else of the road running down the hill by the farm at new  sharon  and of the sounds of the horses and wagons as they came  down and crossed the wooden bridge over the brook  and of the  voices  so strange in the night  as they passed  there were more  night sounds in those memories than i ever hear here  more crickets   more turnings over of nature  asleep or awake  i rarely hear many  night sounds here  from sundown  when people go clattering by in  their wooden shoes from the fields  to daylight  when the birds awake   all is silence  i looked out into the moonlight before i closed my  shutters last night  i might have been alone in the world  yet i like it     the country is lovely here in winter  so different from what i  remember of it at home  my lawn is still green  so is the corbeille  d argent in the garden border  which is still full of silvery bunches of  bloom  and will be all winter  the violets are still in bloom  even the  trees here never get black as they do in new england  for the trunks  and branches are always covered with green moss  that is the  dampness  of course  we never have the dry invigorating cold that  makes a new england winter so wonderful  i don t say that one is  more beautiful than the other  only that each is different in its charm   after all  life  wherever one sees it  is  if one has eyes  a wonderful  pageant  the greatest spectacular melodrama i can imagine  i m glad  to have seen it  i have not always had an orchestra stall  but what of  that  one ought to see things at several angles and from several  elevations  you know           vii        december            we have been having some beautiful weather     yesterday amelie and i took advantage of it to make a pilgrimage  across the marne  to decorate the graves on the battlefield at  chambry  crowds went out on all soul s day  but i never like doing  anything  even making a pilgrimage  in a crowd     you can realize how near it is  and what an easy trip it will be in  normal times  when i tell you that we left esbly for meaux at half past  one  only ten minutes by train  and were back in the station at meaux  at quarter to four  and had visited monthyon  villeroy  neufmontier   penchard  chauconin  barcy  chambry  and vareddes     the authorities are not very anxious to have people go out there  yet  nothing to prevent is really done  it only takes a little diplomacy  if i  had gone to ask for a passport  nine chances out of ten it would have  been refused me  i happened to know that the wife of the big livery   stable man at meaux  an energetic  and  incidentally  a handsome    woman  who took over the business when her husband joined his  regiment  had a couple of automobiles  and would furnish me with all  the necessary papers  they are not taxi cabs  but handsome touring   cars  her chauffeur carries the proper papers  it seemed to me a very  loose arrangement  from a military point of view  even although i was  assured that she did not send out anyone she did not know   however  i decided to take advantage of it     while we were waiting at the garage for the car to be got out  and the  chauffeur to change his coat  i had a chance to talk with a man who  had not left meaux during the battle  and i learned that there were  several important families who had remained with the archbishop and  aided him to organize matters for saving the city  if possible  and  protect the property of those who had fled  and that the measures  which those sixty citizens  with archbishop marbeau at their head   took for the safety of the poor  the care for the wounded and dead  is  already one of the proudest documents in the annals of the historic  town     but never mind all these things  which the guides will recite for you  i  imagine  when you come over to make the grand tour of fighting  france  for on these plains about meaux you will have to start your  pilgrimage     i confess that my heart beat a little too rapidly when  as we ran out of  meaux  and took the route departmentale of senlis  a soldier stepped  to the middle of the road and held up his gun  baionette au canon     we stopped     were we after all going to be turned back  i had the guilty knowledge  that there was no reason why we should not be  i tried to look  magnificently unconcerned as i leaned forward to smile at the soldier   i might have spared myself the effort  he never even glanced inside  the car  the examination of the papers was the most cursory thing  imaginable  a mere formality  the chauffeur simply held his stamped  paper towards the guard  the guard merely glanced at it  lifted his  gun  motioned us to proceed  and we proceeded     it may amuse you to know that we never even showed the paper  again  we did meet two gendarmes on bicycles  but they nodded and  passed us without stopping     the air was soft  like an early autumn day  rather than december as  you know it  there was a haze in the air  but behind it the sun shone   you know what that french haze is  and what it does to the world   and how  through it  one gets the sort of landscape painters love   with how many of our pilgrimages together it is associated  we have  looked through it at the walls of provins  when the lindens were rosy  with the first rising of the sap  we have looked through it at the circular  panorama from the top of the ruined tower of montlhery  we have  looked through it across jean jacques rousseau s country  from the  lofty terrace of montmorency  and from the platform in front of the  prison of philippe auguste s unhappy danish wife  at etampes   across the valley of the juine  and from how many other beautiful  spots  not to forget the view up the seine from the terrace of the  tuileries     sometime  i hope  we shall see these plains of the marne together   when we do  i trust it will be on just such another atmospheric day as  yesterday     as our road wound up the hill over the big paving stones  characteristic of the environs of all the old towns of france   everything looked so peaceful  so pretty  so normal  that it was hard  to realize that we were moving towards the front  and were only about  three miles from the point where the german invasion was turned  back almost three months ago to a day  and it was the more difficult  to realize as we have not heard the cannon for days     a little way out of meaux  we took a road to the west for chauconin   the nearest place to us which was bombarded  and from a point in  the road i looked back across the valley of the marne  and i saw a  very pretty white town  with red roofs  lying on the hillside  i asked the  chauffeur      what village is that over there      he glanced around and replied   quincy      it was my town  i ought not to have been surprised  of course i knew  that if i could see chauconin so clearly from my garden  why   chauconin could see me  only  i had not thought of it     amelie and i looked back with great interest  it did look so pretty  and  it is not pretty at all  the least pretty village on this side of the hill    distance  does  indeed   lend enchantment   when you come to see  me i shall show you quincy from the other side of the marne  and  never take you into its streets  then you ll always remember it as a  fairy town     it was not until we were entering into chauconin that we saw the first  signs of war  the approach through the fields  already ploughed  and  planted with winter grain  looked the very last thing to be associated  with war  once inside the little village  we always speak of it as  le  petit chauconin    we found destruction enough  one whole street of  houses was literally gutted  the walls stand  but the roofs are off and  doors and windows gone  while the shells seem burned out  the  destruction of the big farms seems to have been pretty complete   there they stood  long walls of rubble and plaster  breeched  ends of  farm buildings gone  and many only a heap of rubbish  the surprising  thing to me was to see here a house destroyed  and  almost beside it   one not even touched  that seemed to prove that the struggle here  was not a long one  and that a comparatively small number of shells  had reached it     neufmortier was in about the same condition  it was a sad sight  but  not at all ugly  ruins seem to  go  with the french atmosphere and  background  it all looked quite natural  and i had to make an effort to  shake myself into a becoming frame of mind  if you had been with me  i should have asked you to pinch me  and remind me that  all this is  not yet ancient history   and that a little sentimentality would have  become me  but amelie would never have understood me     it was not until we were driving east again to approach penchard that  a full realization of it came to me  penchard crowns the hill just in the  centre of the line which i see from the garden  it was one of the towns  bombarded on the evening of september    and  so far as i can  guess  the destruction was done by the french guns which drove the  germans out that night     they say the germans slept there the night of september    and  were driven out the next day by the french soixante quinze  which  trotted through chauconin into penchard by the road we had just  come over     i enclose you a carte postale of a battery passing behind the apse of  the village church  just as a guarantee of good faith     but all signs of the horrors of those days have been obliterated   penchard is the town in which the germans exercised their taste for  wilful nastiness  of which i wrote you weeks ago  it is a pretty little  village  beautifully situated  commanding the slopes to the marne on  one side  and the wide plains of barcy and chambry on the other  it is  prosperous looking  the home of sturdy farmers and the small  rentiers  it has an air of humble thrift  with now and then a pretty  garden  and here and there suggestions of a certain degree of  greater prosperity  an air which  in france  often conceals  unexpected wealth     you need not look the places up unless you have a big map  no  guide book ever honored them     from penchard we ran a little out to the west at the foot of the hill  on  top of which stand the white walls of montyon  from which  on  september    we had seen the first smoke of battle     i am sure that i wrote some weeks ago how puzzled i was when i  read joffre s famous ordre du jour  at the beginning of the marne  offensive  to find that it was dated september    whereas we had  seen the battle begin on the  th  here i found what i presume to be  the explanation  which proves that the offensive along the rest of the  line on the  th had been a continuation simply of what we saw that  saturday afternoon     at the foot of the hill crowned by the walls of montyon lies villeroy    today the objective point for patriotic pilgrimages  there  on the  th of  september  the    th regiment was preparing its soup for lunch   when  suddenly  from the trees on the heights  german shells fell  amongst them  and food was forgotten  while the french at st   soupplet on the other side of the hill  as well as those at villeroy   suddenly found themselves in the thick of a fight  the battle we saw     they told me at villeroy that many of the men in the regiments  engaged were from this region  and here the civilians dropped their  work in the fields and snatched up guns which the dead or wounded  soldiers let fall and entered the fight beside their uniformed neighbors   i give you that picturesque and likely detail for what it is worth     at the foot of the hill between montyon and villeroy lies the tomb in  which two hundred of the men who fell here are buried together   among them is charles peguy  the poet  who wore a lieutenant s  stripes  and was referred to by his companions on that day as  un  glorieux fou dans sa bravoure   this long tomb  with its crosses and  flags and flowers  was the scene on all soul s day of the  commemorative ceremony in honor of the victory  and marks not only  the beginning of the battle  but the beginning of its triumph     from this point we drove back to the east  almost along the line of  battle  to the hillside hamlet of barcy  the saddest scene of desolation  on this end of the great fight     it was a humble little village  grouped around a dear old church  with a  graceful square tower supporting a spire  the little church faced a  small square  from which the principal street runs down the hill to the  open country across which the french  push  advanced  no house  on this street escaped  some of them are absolutely destroyed  the  church is a mere shell  its tower is pierced with huge holes  its bell  lies  a wreck  on the floor beneath its tower  the roof has fallen in  a  heaped up mass of debris in the nave beneath  its windows are  gone  and there are gaping wounds in its side walls  oddly enough   the chemin de la croix is intact  and some of the peasants look on  that as a miracle  in spite of the fact that the high altar is buried under  a mass of tiles and plaster     the doors being gone  one could look in  over the temporary barrier   to the wreck inside  and by putting a donation into the contribution  box for the restauration fund it was possible to enter  at one s own  risk  by a side door  it was hardly worth while  as one could see no  more than was visible from the doorways  and it looked as if at any  minute the whole edifice would crumble  however  amelie wanted to  go inside  and so we did     we entered through the mairie  which is at one side  into a small  courtyard  where the school children were playing under the propped   up walls as gaily as if there had never been a bombardment     the mairie had fared little better than the church  and the  schoolroom  which has its home in it  had a temporary roofing  the  upper part being wrecked     the best idea that i got of the destruction was  however  from a  house almost opposite the church  it was only a shell  its walls alone  standing  as its windows and doors had been blown out  we could  look in from the street to the interior of what had evidently been a  comfortable country house  it was now like an uncovered box  in the  centre of which there was a conical shaped heap of ashes as high as  the top of the fireplace  we could see where the stairs had been  but  its entire contents had been burned down to a heap of ashes  burned  as thoroughly as wood in a fireplace  i could not have believed in  such absolute destruction if i had not seen it     while we were gazing at the wreck i noticed an old woman leaning  against the wall and watching us  out of her weather beaten  time   furrowed old face looked a pair of dark eyes  red rimmed and blurred  with much weeping  she was rubbing her distorted old hands  together nervously as she watched us  it was inevitable that i should  get into conversation with her  and discover that this wreck had been   for years  her home  that she had lived there all alone  and that  everything she had in the world  her furniture  her clothing  and her  savings  had been burned in the house     you can hardly understand that unless you know these people  they  keep their savings hidden  it is the well known old story of the french  stocking which paid the war indemnity of       they have no  confidence in banks  the state is the only one they will lend to  and  the fact is one of the secrets of french success     if you knew these people as i do  you would understand that an old  woman of that peasant type  ignorant of the meaning of war  would  hardly be likely to leave her house  no matter how many times she  was ordered out  until shells began to fall about her  even then  as  she was rather deaf  she probably did not realize what was  happening  and went into the street in such fear that she left  everything behind her     from barcy we drove out into the plain  and took the direction of  chambry  following the line of the great and decisive fight of  september   and       we rolled slowly across the beautiful undulating country of grain and  beet fields  we had not gone far when  right at the edge of the road   we came upon an isolated mound  with a rude cross at its head  and  a tiny tricolore at its foot  the first french grave on the plain     we motioned the chauffeur to stop  and we went on  on foot     first the graves were scattered  for the boys lie buried just where they  fell  cradled in the bosom of the mother country that nourished them   and for whose safety they laid down their lives  as we advanced they  became more numerous  until we reached a point where  as far as  we could see  in every direction  floated the little tricolore flags  like  fine flowers in the landscape  they made tiny spots against the far off  horizon line  and groups like beds of flowers in the foreground  and  we knew that  behind the skyline  there were more     here and there was a haystack with one grave beside it  and again  there would be one  usually partly burned  almost encircled with the  tiny flags which said   here sleep the heroes      it was a disturbing and a thrilling sight  i give you my word  as i stood  there  i envied them  it seemed to me a fine thing to lie out there in  the open  in the soil of the fields their simple death has made holy   the duty well done  the dread over  each one just where he fell  defending his mother land  enshrined forever in the loving memory of  the land he had saved  in graves to be watered for years  not only by  the tears of those near and dear to them  but by those of the heirs to  their glory  the children of the coming generation of free france     you may know a finer way to go  i do not  surely  since death is  it is  better than dying of old age between clean sheets  near the end of  the route we came to the little walled cemetery of chambry  the scene  of one of the most desperate struggles of the  th and  th of  september  you know what the humble village burying grounds are  like  its wall is about six feet high  of plaster and stone  with an  entrance on the road to the village  to the west and northwest the  walls are on the top of a bank  high above the crossroads  i do not  know the position of the pursuing french army  the chauffeur who  drove us could not enlighten us  as near as i could guess  from the  condition of the walls  i imagine that the french artillery must have  been in the direction of penchard  on the wooded hills     the walls are pierced with gun holes  about three feet apart  and  those on the west and southwest are breeched by cannon and shell   fire  here  after the position had been several times stormed by  artillery  the zouaves made one of the most brilliant bayonet charges  of the day  dashing up the steep banks and through the breeched  walls  opposite the gate is another steep bank where can still be  seen the improvised gun positions of the french when they pushed  the retreat across the plain     the cemetery is filled with new graves against the wall  for many of  the officers are buried here  nearly all of the regiment of zouaves   which was almost wiped out in the charge before the position was  finally carried   it was taken and lost several times     from here we turned east again towards vareddes  along a fine road  lined with enormous old trees  one of the handsomest roads of the  department  many of these huge trees have been snapped off by  shells as neatly as if they were mere twigs  along the road  here and  there  were isolated graves     vareddes had a tragic experience  the population was shockingly  abused by the germans  its aged priest and many other old men  were carried away  and many were shot  and the town badiy  damaged     we had intended to go through vareddes to the heights beyond   where the heroes of the    d     th     th  and of the regiment  which began the battle at villeroy  the    th  are buried  but the  weather had changed  and a cold drizzle began to fall  and i saw no  use in going on in a closed car  so we turned back to meaux     it was still light when we reached meaux  so we gave a look at the old  mills  and put up a paean of praise that they were not damaged  beyond repair  on our way to the station     as we came back to esbly i strained my eyes to look across to the hill  on which my house stands   i could just see it as we crawled across  the bridge at the iles les villenoy   and felt again the miracle of the  battle which swept so near to us     in my innermost heart i had a queer sensation of the absurdity of my  relation to life  fate so often shakes its fist in my face  only to  withhold the blow within a millimetre of my nose  perhaps i am  being schooled to meet it yet     i brought back one fixed impression  how quickly time had laid its  healing hand on this one battlefield  i don t know what will be the  effect out there where the terrible trench war is going on  but here   where the fighting turned  never to return  at least we believe it never  will  it has left no ugly traces  the fields are cleaned  the roads are  repaired  rain has fallen on ruins and washed off all the marks of  smoke  even on the road to vareddes the thrifty french have already  carried away and fagotted the wrecked trees  and already the huge   broken trunks are being uprooted  cut into proper length  and piled  neatly by the roadside to be seasoned before being carted away   there was nothing raw about the scene anywhere  the villages were  sad  because so silent and empty     i had done my best to get a tragic impression  i had not got it  i had  brought back instead an impression heroic  uplifting  altogether  inspiring     by the time you come over  and i lead you out on that pilgrimage  it  will be even more beautiful  but  alas  i am afraid that day is a long  way off           viii        december               i would wish above all things  if some fairy gave me the chance  to be  a hibernating animal this year  during which the weather has almost  called an armistice along our front  locked from the swiss border to  the sea     there is but one consolation  and that is that  costly and terrible as  have been the first four months of the war  three of the great aims of  the german strategy have been buried too deep ever to be dug up    their hope of a short war is gone  they did not get to paris  and now  know that they never will  they did not  and never can get to calais   and  in spite of their remarkable feats  and their mighty strength  in  the face of those three facts even their arrogance cannot write   victory  against their arms     i have to confess that i am almost as cold as the boys out there in the  rain and the mud  i have managed to get a little coal  or what is called  coal this year  it is really charbon de forge  a lot of damp  black dust  with a few big lumps in it  which burns with a heavy  smelly  yellow  smoke  in normal times one would never dignify it by the name of  coal  but today we are thankful to get it  and pay for it as if it were  gold  it will only burn in the kitchen stove  and every time we put any  on the fire  my house  seen from the garden  appears like some sort  of a factory  please  therefore  imagine me living in the kitchen  you  know the size of a compact french kitchen  it is rather close quarters  for a lady of large ideas     the temperature of the rest of the house is down almost to zero   luckily it is not a cold winter  but it is very damp  as it rains  continually  i have an armchair there  a footstool  and use the kitchen  table as a desk  and even then  to keep fairly warm  i almost sit on  top of the stove  and i do now and then put my feet in the oven     i assure you that going to bed is a ceremony  amelie comes and puts  two hot bricks in the foot of the bed  i undress in the kitchen  put on  felt shoes  and a big wrap  and  with my hotwater bottle in one hand  and a book in the other  i make a dash for the arctic regions  and  amelie tidies up the kitchen  locks the doors behind her  and takes  the keys away with her     i am cosy and comfy in bed  and i stay there until amelie has built the  fire and got the house in order in the morning     my getting up beats the lever de marie antoinette in some of its  details  though she was accustomed to it  and probably minded less  than i do  i am not really complaining  you know  but you want to  know about my life  so from that you can imagine it  i shall get  acclimated  of course  i know that     i was in paris for christmas  not because i wanted to go  but because  the few friends i have left there felt that i needed a change  and  clinched the matter by thinking that they needed me  besides i  wanted to get packages to the english boys who were here in  september  and it was easier to do it from paris than from here     while i was waiting for the train at esbly i had a conversation with a  woman who chanced to sit beside me on a bench on the quai  which  seemed to me significant     today everyone talks to everyone  all the barriers seem to be down   we were both reading the morning paper  and so  naturally  got to  talking  i happened to have an english paper  in which there was a  brief account of the wonderful dash made by the royal scots at petit  bois and the gordon highlanders at maeselsyeed spur  under cover  of the french and british artillery  early in the month  and i translated  it for her  it is a moral duty to let the french people get a glimpse of  the wonderful fighting quality of the boys under the union jack     in the course of the conversation she said  what was self evident    you are not french   i told her that i was an american  then she  asked me if i had any children  and received a negative reply     she sighed  and volunteered that she was a widow with an only son  who was  out there   and added   we are all of us french women of  a certain class so stupid when we are young  i adore children  but i  thought i could only afford to have one  as i wanted to do so much for  him  now if i lose that one  what have i to live for  i am not the sort of  woman who can marry again  my boy is a brave boy  if he dies he will  die like a brave man  and not begrudge the life he gives for his  country  i am a french mother and must offer him as becomes his  mother  but it was silly of me to have but this one  i know  now that it  is too late  that i could have done as well  and it may be better  with  several  for i have seen the possibilities demonstrated among my  friends who have three or four      of course i did not say that the more she had  the more she might  have had to lose  because i thought that if  in the face of a disaster  like this  french women were thinking such thoughts  and if one  does  hundreds may  it might be significant     i had a proof of this while in paris  i went to a house where i have  been a visitor for years to get some news of a friend who had an  apartment there  i opened the door to the concierge s loge to put my  question  i stopped short  in the window  at the back of the half dark  room  sat the concierge  whom i had known for nearly twenty years  a  brave  intelligent  fragile woman  she was sitting there in her black  frock  gently rocking herself backward and forward in her chair  i did  not need to put a question  one knows in these days what the  unaccustomed black dress means  and i knew that the one son i had  seen grow from childhood  for whom she and the father had  sacrificed everything that he might be educated  for whom they had  pinched and saved  was gone     i said the few words one can say  i could not have told five minutes  later what they were  and her only reply was like the speech of the  woman of another class that i had met at esbly      i had but the one  that was my folly  now i have nothing  and i have  a long time to live alone      it would have been easy to weep with her  but they don t weep  i have  never seen fewer tears in a great calamity  i have read in  newspapers sent me from the states tales of women in hysterics  of  women fainting as they bade their men goodbye  i have never seen  any of it  something must be wrong with my vision  or my lines must  have fallen in brave places  i can only speak of what i see and hear   and tears and hysterics do not come under my observation     i did not do anything interesting in paris  it was cold and grey and  sad  i got my packages off to the front  they went through quickly   especially those sent by the english branch post office  near the  etoile  and when i got home  i found the letters of thanks from the  boys awaiting me  among them was one from the little corporal who  had pulled down my flags in september  who wrote in the name of  the c company  yorkshire light infantry  and at the end of the letter  he said   i am sorry to tell you that captain simpson is dead  he was  killed leading his company in a charge  and all his men grieved for  him      that gave me a deep pang  i remembered his stern  bronzed  but  kindly face  which lighted up so with a smile  as he sat with me at tea  on that memorable wednesday afternoon  and of all that he did so  simply to relieve the strain on our nerves that trying day  i know  nothing about him  who he was  what he had for family  he was just a  brave  kindly  human being  who had met me for a few hours  passed  on  and passed out  he is only one of thousands  but he is the one  whose sympathetic voice i had heard and who  in all the hurry and  fatigue of those hard days  had had time to stop and console us here   and whom i had hoped to see again  and i grieved with his men for  him     i could not write last week  i had no heart to send the usual greetings  of the season  words still mean something to me  and when i sat  down  from force of habit  to write the letters i have been accustomed  to send at this season  i simply could not  it seemed to me too absurd  to even celebrate the anniversary of the days when the angel hosts  sang in the skies their  peace on earth  good will to men  to herald  the birth of him who added to religion the command   love one  another   and man  only forty miles away  occupied in wholesale  slaughter  we have a hard time juggling to make our pretensions and  our acts fit     if this cold and lack of coal continues i am not likely to see much or  write much until the spring campaign opens  here we still hear the  guns whenever rheims or soissons are bombarded  but no one  ever  for a minute  dreams that they will ever come nearer     though i could not send you any greetings last week  i can say  with  all my heart  may      bring us all peace and contentment           ix        january               i have been trying to feel in a humor to write all this month  but what  with the changeable weather  a visit to paris  and the depression of  the terrible battle at soissons   so near to us  i have not had the  courage  all the same  i frankly confess that it has not been as bad  as i expected  i begin to think things are never as bad as one  expects     do you know that it is not until now that i have had a passport from  my own country  i have never needed one  no one here has ever  asked me for one  and it was only when i was in paris a week ago  that an american friend was so aghast at the idea that i had  in case  of accident  no real american protection  that i went to the embassy   for the first time in my life  and asked for one  and seriously took the  oath of allegiance  i took it so very seriously that it was impressed on  me how careless we  who live much abroad  get about such things     i know that many years ago  when i was first leaving the states  it  was suggested that such a document might be useful as an  identification  and i made out my demand  and it was sent after me to  rome  i must have taken the oath at that time  but it was in days of  peace  and it made no impression on me  but this time i got a great  big choke in my throat  and looked up at the stars and stripes over  the desk  and felt more american than i ever felt in my life  it cost me  two dollars  and i felt the emotion was well worth the money  even at  a high rate of exchange     i did practically nothing else in paris  except to go to one or two of the  hospitals where i had friends at work     paris is practically normal  a great many of the american colony who  fled in september to bordeaux and to london have returned  and the  streets are more lively  and the city has settled down to live through  the war with outward calm if no gaiety  i would not have believed it  would be possible  in less than five months  and with things going  none too well at the front  that the city could have achieved this  attitude     when i got back  i found that  at least  our ambulance was open     it is only a small hospital  and very poor  it is set up in the salle de  recreation of the commune  which is beside the church and opposite  the mairie  backed up against the wall of the park of the chateau de  quincy  it is really a branch of the military hospital at meaux  and it is  under the patronage of the occupant of the chateau de quincy  who  supplies such absolute necessities as cannot be provided from the  government allowance of two francs a day per bed  there are twenty   eight beds     most of the beds and bedding were contributed by the people in the  commune  the town crier went about  beating his drum  and making  his demand at the crossroads  and everyone who could spare a bed  or a mattress or a blanket carried his contribution to the salle  the  wife of the mayor is the directress  the doctor from crecy en brie  cares for the soldiers  with the assistance of soeur jules and soeur  marie  who had charge of the town dispensary  and four girls of the  red cross society living in the commune     the installation is pathetically simple  but the room is large and  comfortable  with four rows of beds  and extra ones on the stage  and  it is heated by a big stove  naturally it gets more sick and slightly  wounded than serious cases  but the boys seem very happy  and  they are affectionately cared for  there is a big court for the  convalescents  and in the spring they will have the run of the park     about the twelfth we had a couple of days of the worst cannonading  since october  it was very trying  i stood hours on the lawn listening   but it was not for several days that we knew there had been a terrible  battle at soissons  just forty miles north of us     there is a great difference of opinion as to how far we can hear the  big guns  but an officer on the train the other day assured me that  they could be heard  the wind being right  about one hundred  kilometres  that is to say  eighty miles  so you can judge what it was  like here  on the top of the hill  half that distance away by road  and  considerably less in a direct line     our official communique  as usual  gave us no details  but one of the  boys in our town was wounded  and is in a near by ambulance   where he has been seen by his mother  she brings back word that it  was  as he called it   a bloody slaughter in a hand to hand fight   but  of course  nothing so far has been comparable to the british stand at  ypres  the little that leaks slowly out regarding that simply makes  one s heart ache with the pain of it  only to rebound with the glory     human nature is a wonderful thing  and the locking of the gate to  calais  by the english  will  i imagine  be  to the end of time  one of  the epics  not of this war alone  but of all war  talk about the  thin red  line   the english stood  we are told  like a ribbon to stop the german  hordes   and stopped them     it almost seems a pity that  up to date  so much secrecy has been  maintained  i was told last week in paris that london has as yet no  dream of the marvellous feat her volunteer army achieved  a feat that  throws into the shade all the heroic defenses sung in the verse of  ancient times  luckily these achievements do not dull with years     on top of the soissons affair came its result  the french retreat  across the aisne caused by the rising of the floods which carried  away the bridges as fast as the engineers could build them  and cut  off part of the french  even an ambulance  and  report says  the men  left across the river without ammunition fought at the end with the  butts of their broken guns  and finally with their fists     of course this brings again that awful cry over the lack of preparation   and lack of ammunition     it is a foolish cry today  since the only nation in the world ready for  this war was the nation that planned and began it     even this disaster  and there is no denying that it is one  does not  daunt these wonderful people  they still see two things  the germans  did not get to paris  nor have they got to calais  so  in spite of their  real feats of arms  one cannot deny those  an endeavor must be  judged by its purpose  and  so judged  the germans have  thus far   failed  luckily the french race is big enough to see this and take  heart of grace  god knows it needs to  and thank him it can     don t you imagine that i am a bit down  i am not  i am cold  but  when  i think of the discomfort in the hurriedly constructed trenches  where  the men are in the water to their ankles  what does my being cold in a  house mean  just a record of discomfort as my part of the war  and it  seems  day after day  less important  but oh  the monotony and  boredom of it  do you wonder that i want to hibernate           x        march               can it be possible that it is two months since i wrote to you  i could  not realize it when i got your reproachful letter this morning  but i  looked in my letter book  and found that it was true     the truth is  i have nothing to write about  the winter and its  discomforts do not inspire me any more than the news from the front  does  and no need to tell you that does not make one talkative     it has been a damp and nasty and changeable winter  one of the  most horrid i ever experienced  there has been almost no snow   almost never has the ground frozen  and not only is there mud  mud  everywhere  but freshets also  today the marne lies more like an  open sea than a river across the fields in the valley  one can imagine  what it is like out there in the trenches     we have occasional lovely sunny days  when it is warmer out of   doors than in  and when those days came  i dug a bit in the dirt   planted tulips and sweet peas     sometimes i have managed to get fuel  and when that happened  i  was ever so cosy in the house  usually  when the weather was at its  worst  i had none  and was as nicely uncomfortable as my worst  enemy could ask     as a rule my days have been divided into two parts  in the forenoon i  have hovered about the gate watching for the newspaper  in the  afternoon i have re chewed the news in the vain endeavor to extract  something encouraging between the lines   and failed  up to date i  have not found anything tangible to account for such hope as  continues to  spring eternal  in all our breasts  it springs  however   the powers be thanked  at present it is as big an asset as france  has     a zeppelin got to paris last night  we are sorry  but we ll forget it as  soon as the women and children are buried  we are sorry  but it is not  important     things are a bit livened up here  day before yesterday a regiment of  dragoons arrived  they are billeted for three months  they are men  from the midi  and  alas  none too popular at this moment  still  they  have been well received  and their presence does liven up the place   this morning  before i was up  i heard the horses trotting by for their  morning exercise  and got out of bed to watch them going along the  hill  after the deadly tiresome waiting silence that has reigned here all  winter  it made the hillside look like another place     add to that the fact that the field work has begun  and that  when the  sun shines  i can go out on the lawn and watch the ploughs turning  up the ground  and see the winter grain making green patches  everywhere  and i do not need to tell you that  with the spring  my  thoughts will take a livelier turn  the country is beginning to look  beautiful  i took my drive along the valley of the grande morin in the  afternoon yesterday  the wide plains of the valley are being  ploughed  and the big horses dragging ploughs across the wide fields  did look lovely  just like a millet or a daubigny canvas     since i wrote you i have been across to the battlefield again  to  accompany a friend who came out from paris  it was all like a new  picture  the grain is beginning to sprout in tender green about the  graves  which have been put in even better order than when i first  saw them  the rude crosses of wood  from which the bark had not  even been stripped  have been replaced by tall  carefully made  crosses painted white  each marked with a name and number  each  single grave and each group of graves has a narrow footpath about  it  and is surrounded by a wire barrier  while tiny approaches are  arranged to each  everywhere military signs are placed  reminding  visitors that these fields are private property  that they are all planted   and entreating all politely to conduct themselves accordingly  which  means literally   keep off the wheat      the german graves  which  so far as i remember  were unmarked  when i was out there nearly four months ago  have now black disks  with the number in white     you must not mind if i am dull these days  i have been studying a  map of the battle front  which i got by accident  it is not inspiring  it  makes one realize what there is ahead of us to do  it will be done  but  at what a price     still  spring is here  and in spite of one s self  it helps           xi        may               all through the month of april i intended to write  but i had not the  courage     all our eyes were turned to the north where  from april    to  thursday  may     five days ago  we knew the second awful battle at  ypres was going on  it seems to be over now     what with the new war deviltry  asphyxiating gas  with which the  battle began  and which beat back the line for miles by the terror of its  surprise  and the destruction of the lusitania on the  th  it has been a  hard month  it has been a month which has seen a strange change  of spirit here     i have tried to impress on you  from the beginning  that odd sort of  optimism which has ruled all the people about me  even under the  most trying episodes of the war  up to now  the hatred of the  germans has been  in a certain sense  impersonal  it has been a  racial hatred of a natural foe  an accepted evil  just as the uncalled for  war was  it had wrought a strange  unexpected  altogether  remarkable change in the french people  their faces had become  more serious  their bearing more heroic  their laughter less frequent   and their humor more biting  but  on the day  three weeks ago  when  the news came of the first gas attack  before which the zouaves and  the turcos fled with blackened faces and frothing lips  leaving  hundreds of their companions dead and disfigured on the road to  langtmarck  there arose the first signs of awful hatred that i had  seen     i frankly acknowledge that  considering the kind of warfare the world  is seeing today  i doubt very much if it is worse to be asphyxiated  than to be blown to pieces by an obus  but this new and devilish arm  which germany has added to the horrors of war seemed the last  straw  and within a few weeks  i have seen grow up among these  simple people the conviction that the race which planned and  launched this great war has lost the very right to live  and that none of  the dreams of the world which looked towards happiness can ever be  realized while prussia exists  even if the war lasts twenty years  and  even if  before it is over  the whole world has to take a hand in it     into this feeling  ten days ago  came the news of the destruction of  the lusitania     we got the news here on the  th  it struck me dumb     for two or three days i kept quietly in the house  i believe the people  about me expected the states to declare war in twenty four hours  my  neighbors who passed the gate looked at me curiously as they  greeted me  and with less cordiality as the days went by  it was as if  they pitied me  and yet did not want to be hard on me  or hold me  responsible     you know well enough how i feel about these things  i have no  sentimentality about the war  a person who had that  and tried to live  here so near it  would be on the straight road to madness  if the world  cannot stop war  if organized governments cannot arrive at a code of  morals which applies to nations the same law of right and wrong  which is enforced on individuals  why  the world and humanity must  take the consequences  and must reconcile themselves to the belief  that such wars as this are as necessary as surgical operations  if one  accepts that point of view  and i am ready to do so   then every  diabolical act of germany will rebound to the future good of the race   as it  from every point of view  justifies the hatred which is growing up  against germany  we are taught that it is right  moral  and  from  every point of view  necessary to hate evil  and  in this   th century   germany is the most absolute synonym of evil that history has ever  seen  having stated that fact  it does not seem to me that i need say  anything further on the subject     in the meantime  i have gone on imitating the people about me  they  are industriously tilling their fields  i continue cutting my lawn   planting my dahlias  pruning my roses  tying up my flowering peas   and watching my california poppies grow like the weeds in the fields     when i am not doing that  with a pot in one hand  and the tongs in  the other  i am picking slugs out of the flower beds and giving them a  dose of boiling water  or lugging about a watering pot  i do it  energetically  but my heart is not in it  though the garden is grateful all  the same  and is as nice a symbol of the french people as i can  imagine     we have the dragoons still with us  they don t interest me hugely  not  as the english did when they retreated here last september  nor as  the french infantry did on their way to the battlefield  these men  have never been in action yet  still they lend a picturesqueness to the  countryside  though to me it is  as so much of the war has been  too  much like the decor of a drama  every morning they ride by the gate   two abreast  to exercise their lovely horses  and just before noon they  come back  all the afternoon they are passing in groups  smoking   chatting  and laughing  and  except for their uniforms  they do not  suggest war  of which they actually know as little as i do     after dinner  in the twilight  for the days are getting long  and the  moon is full  i sit on the lawn and listen to them singing in the street at  voisins  and they sing wonderfully well  and they sing good music   the other evening they sang choruses from  louise  and  faust    and a wonderful baritone sang  vision fugitive   the air was so still  and clear that i hardly missed a note     a week ago tonight we were aroused late in the evening  it must have  been nearly midnight  by an alerte announcing the passing of a  zeppelin  i got up and went out of doors  but neither heard nor saw  anything  except a bicycle going over the hill  and a voice calling   lights out   evidently it did not get to paris  as the papers have been  absolutely dumb     one thing i have done this week  when the war began i bought  as  did nearly everyone else  a big map of germany and the battle fronts  surrounding it  and little envelopes of tiny british  belgian  french   montenegrin  servian  russian  german  and austrian flags   mounted on pins  every day  until the end of last week  i used to put  the flags in place as well as i could after studying the day s  communique     i began to get discouraged in the hard days of last month  when day  after day i was obliged to retreat the allied flags on the frontier  and  when the russian offensive fell down  i simply tore the map off the  wall  and burned it  flags and all     of course i said to myself  in the spirit i have caught from the army    all these things are but incidents  and will have no effect on the final  result  a nation is not defeated while its army is still standing up in its  boots  so it is folly to bother over details      do you ever wonder what the poets of the future will do with this war   is it too stupendous for them  or  when they get it in perspective  can  they find the inspiration for words where now we have only tightened  throats and a great pride that  in an age set down as commercial   such deeds of heroism could be     who will sing the dirge of general hamilton in the little cemetery of  lacouture last october  when the farewell salute over his grave was  turned to repel a german attack  while the voice of the priest kept on   calm and clear  to the end of the service  who will sing the  destruction of the royal scots  two weeks later  in the battle of  ypres  who will sing the arrival of general moussy  and of the  french corps on the last day of that first battle of ypres  when a  motley gathering of cooks and laborers with staff officers and  dismounted cavalry  in shining helmets  flung themselves pellmell into  a bayonet charge with no bayonets  to relieve the hard pressed  english division under general bulfin  and did it  who will sing the  great chant in honor of the         who held ypres against half a  million  and locked the door to the channel  who will sing the bulldog  fighting qualities of rawlinson s  th division  which held the line in  those october days until reinforcements came  and which  at the end  of the fight  mustered    officers out of      and only      men out  of         who will sing the stirring scene of the french chasseurs   advancing with bugles and shouting the  marseillaise   to storm and  take the col de bonhomme in a style of warfare as old as french  history  and these are but single exploits in a war now settled down  to sullen  dull trench work  a war only in the early months of what  looks like years of duration     doesn t it all make your blood flow fast  you see it tempts me to  make an oration  you must overlook my eloquence  one does  over  here  in the midst of it  feel such a reverence for human nature today   the spirit of heroism and self sacrifice lives still amongst us  a world  of machinery has not yet made a race incapable of greatness  i have  a feeling that from the soil to which so many thousands of men have  voluntarily returned to save their country s honor must spring up a  france greater than ever  it is the old story of atlas  besides   what  more can a man do   you know the rest  it is one of the things that  make me sorry to feel that our own country is evidently going to avoid  a movement which might have been at once healthy and uplifting  i  know that you don t like me to say that  but i ll let it go           xii        june              well  i have really had a very exciting time since i last wrote you  i  have even had a caller  also my neighbor at voulangis  on the top of  the hill  on the other side of the morin  has returned from the states   to which she fled just before the battle of the marne  i even went to  paris to meet her  to tell you the actual truth  for a few days  i  behaved exactly as if there were no war  i had to pinch myself now  and then to remind myself that whatever else might be real or unreal   the war was very actual     i must own that paris seems to get farther and farther from it every  day  from daybreak to sunset i found it hard to realize that it was the  capital of an invaded country fighting for its very existence  and the  invader no farther from the boulevards than noyon  soissons  and  rheims  on a battle front that has not changed more than an inch or  two  and often an inch or two in the wrong direction  since last  october     i could not help thinking  as i rode up the champs elysees in the sun    it was sunday  how humiliated the kaiser  that crowned head of  terrorizers  would be if he could have seen paris that day     children were playing under the trees of the broad mall  automobiles  were rushing up and down the avenue  crowds were sitting all along  the way  watching the passers and chatting  all the big hotels  turned  into ambulances  had their windows open to the glorious sunny  warmth  and the balconies were crowded with invalid soldiers and  white garbed nurses  not even arms in slings or heads in bandages  looked sad  for everyone seemed to be laughing  nor did the crippled  soldiers  walking slowly along  add a tragic note to the wonderful  scene     it was strange  it was more than strange  it seemed to me almost  unbelievable     i could not help asking myself if it could last     every automobile which passed had at least one soldier in it  almost  every well dressed woman had a soldier beside her  those who did  not  looked sympathetically at every soldier who passed  and now  and then stopped to chat with the groups  soldiers on crutches   soldiers with canes  soldiers with an arm in a sling  or an empty  sleeve  leading the blind  and soldiers with nothing of their faces  visible but the eyes     by every law i knew the scene should have been sad  but some law  of love and sunshine had decreed that it should not be  and it was  not     it was not the paris you saw  even last summer  but it was paris with  a soul  and i know no better prayer to put up than the cry that the  wave of love which seemed to throb everywhere about the soldier  boys  and which they seemed to feel and respond to  might not  with  time  die down  i knew it was too much to ask of human nature  i was  glad i had seen it     in this atmosphere of love paris looked more beautiful to me than  ever  the fountains were playing in the place de la concorde  in the  tuileries gardens  at the rond point  and the gardens  the avenue  and the ambulances were bright with flowers  i just felt  as i always do  when the sun shines on that wonderful vista from the arc de  triomphe to the louvre  that nowhere in the world was there another  such picture  unless it be the vista from the louvre to the arc de  triomphe  when i drove back up the hill at sunset  with a light mist  veiling the sun through the arch  i felt so grateful to the fate which had  decreed that never again should the german army look on that  scene  and that a nation which had a capital that could smile in the  face of fate as paris smiled that day  must not  cannot  be conquered     of course after dark it is all different  it is then that one realizes that  paris is changed  the streets are no longer brilliantly lighted  there  are no social functions  the city seems almost deserted  one misses  the brightness and the activity  i really found it hard to find my way  about and recognize familiar street corners in the dark  a few days of  it were enough for me  and i was glad enough to come back to my  quiet hilltop  at my age habits are strong     also let me tell you things are slowly changing here  little by little i  can feel conditions closing up about me  and i can see  coming  events  casting  their shadows before      let me give you a little example     a week ago today my new york doctor came down to spend a few  days with me  it was a great event for a lady who had not had a visitor  for months  he wanted to go out to the battlefield  so i arranged to  meet his train at esbly  go on with him to meaux  and drive back by  road     i started for esbly in my usual sans gene manner  and was disgusted  with myself on arriving to discover that i had left all my papers at  home  however  as i had never had to show them  i imagined it  would make no difference     i presented myself at the ticket office to buy a ticket for meaux  and  you can imagine my chagrin when i was asked for my papers  i  explained to the station master  who knows me  that i had left them at  home  he was very much distressed   said he would take the  responsibility of selling me a ticket if i wanted to risk it   but the new  orders were strict  and he was certain i would not be allowed to leave  the station at meaux     naturally  i did not want to take such a risk  or to appear  in any way   not to be en regle  so i took the doctor off the train  and drove back  here for my papers  and then we went on to meaux by road     it was lucky i did  for i found everything changed at meaux  in the first  place  we could not have an automobile  as general joffre had  issued an order forbidding the circulation inside of the military zone of  all automobiles except those connected with the army  we could  have a little victoria and a horse  but before taking that  we had to go  to the prefet de police and exhibit our papers and get a special sauf   conduit   and we had to be diplomatic to get that     once started  instead of sliding out of the town past a guard who  merely went through the formality of looking at the driver s papers  we  found  on arriving at the entrance into the route de senlis  that the  road was closed with a barricade  and only one carriage could pass  at a time  in the opening stood a soldier barring the way with his gun   and an officer came to the carriage and examined all our papers  before the sentinel shouldered his musket and let us pass  we were  stopped at all the cross roads  and at that between barcy and  chambry   where the pedestal of the monument to mark the limit of  the battle in the direction of paris is already in place   we found a  group of a dozen officers  not noncommissioned officers  if you  please  but captains and majors  there our papers  including  american passports  were not only examined  but signatures and  seals verified     this did not trouble me a bit  indeed i felt it well  and high time  and  that it should have been done ten months ago     it was a perfect day  and the battlefield was simply beautiful  with the  grain well up  and people moving across it in all directions  these  were mostly people walking out from meaux  and soldiers from the  big hospital there making a pilgrimage to the graves of their  comrades  what made the scene particularly touching was the  number of children  and the nurses pushing babies in their carriages   it seemed to me such a pretty idea to think of little children roaming  about this battlefield as if it were a garden  i could not help wishing  the nation was rich enough to make this place a public park     in spite of only having a horse we made the trip easily  and got back  here by dinner time     two days later we had an exciting five minutes     it was breakfast time  the doctor and i were taking our coffee out of   doors  on the north side of the house  in the  shade of the ivy clad  wall of the old grange  there the solitude is perfect  no one could see  us there  we could only see the roofs of the few houses at  joncheroy  and beyond them the wide amphitheatre like panorama   with the square towers of the cathedral of meaux at the east and  esbly at the west  and mareuil les meaux nestled on the river in the  foreground     you see i am looking at my panorama again  one can get used to  anything  i find     it was about nine o clock     suddenly there was a terrible explosion  which brought both of us to  our feet  for it shook the very ground beneath us  we looked in the  direction from which it seemed to come  meaux  and we saw a  column of smoke rising in the vicinity of mareuil  only two miles away   before we had time to say a word we saw a second puff  and then  came a second explosion  then a third and a fourth  i was just rooted  to my spot  until amelie dashed out of the kitchen  and then we all ran  to the hedge   it was only a hundred feet or so nearer the smoke  and  we could see women running in the fields   that was all     but amelie could not remain long in ignorance like that  there was a  staff officer cantoned at voisins and he had telephonic  communication with meaux  so down the hill she went in search of  news  and fifteen minutes later we knew that a number of taubes had  tried to reach paris in the night  that there had been a battle in the air  at crepy les valois  and one of these machines had dropped four  bombs  evidently meant for meaux  near mareuil  where they had  fallen in the fields and harmed no one     we never got any explanation of how it happened that a taube  should be flying over us at that hour  in broad daylight  or what  became of it afterward  probably someone knows  if someone does   he is evidently not telling us     amelie s remark  as she returned to her kitchen  was   well  it was  nearer than the battle  perhaps next time    she shrugged her  shoulders  and we all laughed  and life went on as usual  well  i ve  heard the whir r of a german bomb  even if i did not see the machine  that threw it     the doctor did not get over laughing until he went back to paris  i am  afraid he never will get over guying me about the shows i get up to  amuse my visitors  i expect that i must keep a controlling influence  over him  or  before he is done joking  the invisible taube will turn into  a zeppelin  or perhaps a fleet of airships           xiii        june               having an american neighbor near by again has changed life more  than you would imagine     she is only five miles away  she can come over on horseback in half  an hour  and she often arrives for coffee  which is really jolly  now  and then she drives over unexpectedly  and carries me back with her  for the night  i never feel like staying longer  but it changes the  complexion of life  besides  we can talk about our native land  in  english  and that is a change     now don t imagine that i have been lonely  i have not  i was quite  contented before she returned  but i have never concealed from you  that the war is trying  i needed  now and then  to exchange words  with one of my own race  and to say things about my own country  which i d be burned at the stake before i  d say before a french  person     beside  the drive from here to voulangis is beautiful  we have three  or four ways to go  and each one is prettier than the other   sometimes we go through quincy  by the chateau de moulignon  to  pont aux dames  and through the old moated town of crecy en brie   sometimes we go down the valley of the mesnil  a hilly path along the  edge of a tiny river  down which we dash at a breakneck speed  only  possible to an expert driver  indeed pere never believes we do it  he  could not  since he could not  to him it is impossible to anyone     just now the most interesting way is through couilly and st  germain   by the bois de misere  to villiers sur morin  whence we climb the hill  to voulangis  with the valley dropping away on one side  it is one of  the loveliest drives i know  along the morin  by the mills  through the  almost virgin forest     the artillery  territorials  is cantoned all along here  at villiers  at  crecy  and at voulangis  the road is lined with grey cannon and  ammunition wagons  every little way there is a sentinel in his box  and  horses are everywhere     some of the sentinel boxes are  as we used to say in the states   too  cute for words   the prettiest one in the department is right here  at  the corner of the route madame  which crosses my hill  and whence  the road leads from the demi lune right down to the canal  it is  woven of straw  has a nice floor  a gothic roof  a gothic door  and the  tiniest gothic window  and a little flag floating from its peak     it is a little bijou  and i did hope that i could beg  borrow  steal   or buy it from the dragoon who made it  but i can t  the lieutenant  is attached to it  and is going to take it with him  alas     i happened to be at voulangis when the territorials left  quite  unexpectedly  as usual  they never get much notice of a releve     we were sitting in the garden at tea when the assemblage general  was sounded  and the order read to march at four next morning     you never saw such a bustle   such a cleaning of boots  such a  packing of sacks  such a getting together of the officers  canteens    orderlies getting about quickly  and trying to give demonstrations of   efficiency   how i detest the very word    and such a rounding up of  last things for the commissary department  including a mobilization of  brie cheese  this is its home   and such a pulling into position of  cannon  all the inevitable activity of a regiment preparing to take the  road  after a two months  cantonnement  in absolute ignorance of the  direction they were to take  or their destination     the last thing i saw that night was the light of their lanterns  and the  last thing i heard was the march of their hob nailed boots  the first  thing i heard in the morning  just as day broke  was the neighing of  the horses  and the subdued voices of the men as the teams were  harnessed     we had all agreed to get up to see them start  it seemed the least we  could do  so  well wrapped up in our big coats  against the chill of four  o clock  we went to the little square in front of the church  from which  they were to start  and where the long line of grey cannon  grey  ammunition  camions  grey commissary wagons were ready  and the  men  sac au dos  already climbing into place  one mounted on each  team of four horses  three on each gun carriage  facing the horses   with three behind  with their backs to the team  the horses of the  officers were waiting in front of the little inn opposite  from which the  officers emerged one by one  mounted and rode to a place in front of  the church  we were a little group of about twenty women and  children standing on one side of the square  and a dead silence hung  over the scene  the men  even  spoke in whispers     the commander  in front of his staff  ran his eyes slowly over the line   until a sous officier approached  saluted  and announced   all ready    when the commander rode to the head of the line  raised one hand  above his head  and with it made a sharp forward gesture  the  unspoken order  en avant   and backed his horse  and the long grey  line began to move slowly towards the foret de crecy  the officers  falling into place as it passed     some of the men leaned down to shake hands as they went by   some of the men saluted  not a word was spoken  and the silence  was only broken by the tramp of the horses  the straining of the  harnesses  and rumble of the wheels     it was all so different  as everything in this war has been  from  anything i had ever dreamed when i imagined war  yet i suppose that  the future dramatist who uses this period as a background can get his  effects just the same  without greatly falsifying the truth  you know i  am like uncle sarcey  a really model theatre audience  no effect   halfway good  passes me by  so  as i turned back at the garden gate  to watch the long grey line winding slowly into the forest  i found that i  had the same chill down my back and the same tightness over my  eyes and in my throat  which  in the real theatre goers  announce that  an effect has  gone home      the only other thing i have done this month which could interest you  was to have a little tea party on the lawn for the convalescent boys of  our ambulance  who were  personally conducted  by one of their  nurses     of course they were all sorts and all classes  when i got them  grouped round the table  in the shade of the big clump of lilac bushes   i was impressed  as i always am when i see a number of common  soldiers together  with the fact that no other race has such intelligent   such really well modelled faces  as the french  it is rare to see a fat  face among them  there were farmers  blacksmiths  casters   workmen of all sorts  and there was one young law student  and the  mixed group seemed to have a real sentiment of fraternity     of course  the law student was more accustomed to society than the  others  and became  naturally  a sort of leader  he knew just what to  do  and just how to do it   how to get into the salon when he arrived   and how to greet his hostess  but the rest knew how to follow suit   and did it  and  though some of them were a little shy at first  not one  was confused  and in a few minutes they were all quite at their ease   by the time the brief formality of being received was over  and they  were all gathered round the tea table  the atmosphere had become  comfortable and friendly  and  though they let the law student lead the  conversation  they were all alert and interested  and when one of  them did speak  it was to the point     when tea was over and we walked out on the lawn on the north side  of the house to look over the field of the battle in which most of them  had taken part  they were all ready to talk  they were on ground they  knew  one of them asked me if i could see any of the movements of  the armies  and i told him that i could not  that i could only see the  smoke  and hear the artillery fire  and now and then  when the wind  was right  the sharp repeating fire of rifles as well as mitrailleuses   and that i ended by distinguishing the soixante quinze from other  artillery guns      look down there  in the wide plain below montyon   said the law  student  i looked  and he added   as nearly as i can judge the ground  from here  if you had been looking there at eleven o clock in the  morning  you would have seen a big movement of troops      of course i explained to him that i had not expected any movement in  that direction  and had only watched the approach from meaux     beyond that one incident  these wounded soldiers said no word about  battles  most of the conversation was political     when the nurse looked at her watch and said it was time to return to  the hospital  as they must not be late for dinner  they all rose  the law  student came  cap in hand  made me a low bow  and thanked me for  a pleasant afternoon  and every man imitated his manner  with  varying degrees of success  and made his little speech and bow  and  then they marched up the road  turning back  as the english soldiers  had done  how long ago it seems  to wave their caps as they went  round the corner     i did wish that you could have been there  you always used to love  the french  you would have loved them more that afternoon     it is wonderful how these people keep up their courage  to me it  seems like the uplift of a holy cause  they did expect a big summer  offensive  but it does not come  and we hear it rumored that  while we  have men enough  the germans have worked so hard  while the  english were recruiting  that they are almost impregnably entrenched   and that while their ammunition surpasses anything we can have for  months yet  it would be military suicide to throw our infantry against  their superior guns  in the meantime  while the allies are working like  mad to increase their artillery equipments  the germans are working  just as hard  and time serves one party as well as the other  i  suppose it will only be after the war that we shall really know to what  our disappointment was due  and  as usual  the same cry consoles  us all   none of these things will change the final result   and most  people keep silent under the growing conviction that this  may go on  for years      one thing i really must tell you  not a person mentioned the lusitania  at the tea party  which was  i suppose  a handsome effort at  reticence  since the lady of the house was an american  and the  stars and stripes  in little  were fluttering over the chimney     i take note of one remark in your last letter  in reply to mine of may      you twit me with  rounding off my periods   i apologize  you must  remember that i earned my bread and salt doing that for years  and  habit is strong  i no longer do it with my tongue in my cheek  my word  for that           xiv        august              well  dear girl  not a bit of news to tell you  i have really done nothing  this last month but look at my flowers  superintend the gathering of  my plums  put up a few pots of confiture  mow the lawn  and listen to  the guns  now and then  read the communiques  and sigh over the  disasters in the east and the deadlock at gallipoli     at the end of the first year of the war the scene has stretched out so  tremendously that my poor tired brain can hardly take it in  i suppose  it is all clear to the general staff  but i don t know  to me it all looks  like a great labyrinth   and the germans are at the gates of warsaw   of course this does not  alter the final result   when that comes  but it  means more destruction  more land to win back  and  i imagine  such  desolation in poland as makes even the belgian disaster look  by  comparison  small     oddly enough  while we know that this will brace up the germans   fighting all about their borders on invaded territory  it does not effect  the faith of the people here  who have even the courage to turn aside  from their own grief  with tears in their eyes  to pity poland  what a  price belgium pays for her courage to be honorable  and at what a  price poland must accept her independence  everyone is philosophical  here  but one does not have to be heartless to be that     i find it ironical that my flowers bloom  that gay humming birds hover  over my mas de perse  that i have enough to eat  that sleep comes  to me  and that the country is so beautiful     our dragoons have ridden away  on to the front  i am told  and  silence has settled down on us     i am well  there ends the history of a month  and i am not the only  one in france leading a life like that   and still the cannon are  pounding on in the distance         xv        august              well  the sans gene days seem to be passed     up to now  as i have told you  the sauf conduit matter  except on the  last day i was at meaux  was the thinnest sort of formality  i had to  have one to leave the commune  but the blank forms were lying  around everywhere  i had only to stop at the hotel at couilly  step into  the cafe  pick up a form and ask the proprietor to fill it out  and that  was all that was necessary  i might have passed it on to anyone  for   although my name was written on it  no one ever took the trouble to  fill out the description  the ticket seller at the station merely glanced  at the paper in my hand when i bought a ticket  and the gendarmes at  the ticket window in paris  when there were any   often there were  none  did no more  of course  the possession of a sauf conduit  presupposes all one s papers en regle  but i never saw anyone  examining to make sure of that     all this is ended  we are evidently under a new regime     i had my first intimation yesterday  when i had a domiciliary visit from  the gendarmes at esbly  it was a very formal  thorough affair  the two  officers treating me  at the beginning of the interview  as if i were a  very guilty person     i was upstairs when i saw them arrive on their wheels  i put down my  sewing  and went down to be ready to open the door when they  knocked  they didn t knock  i waited a bit  then opened the door   there was no one on the terrace  but i heard their voices from the  other side of the house  i went in search of them  they were  examining the back of the house as if they had never seen one like it  before  when they saw me  one of them said sharply  without the  slightest salute   there is no bell      i acknowledged the self evident fact      how does one get in  since you keep your door locked   he added      well   i replied  with a smile   as a rule  one knocks      to that his only reply was   your name      i gave it to him     he looked on his paper  repeated it  mispronouncing it  of course   and evidently sure that i did not know how to pronounce it myself      foreigner   he stated     i could not deny the charge  i merely volunteered  americaine      then the inquiry continued like this   live here       evidently       how long have you lived here       since june            that seemed to strike him as a very suspicious date  and he stared at  me hard for a moment before he went on   what for       principally because i leased the house       why do you remain here in war time       because i have nowhere else to go   and i tried not to smile      why don t you go home       this is my home       haven t you any home in america      i resisted telling him that it was none of his business  and did my best  to look pathetic  it was that  or laugh  as i answered   alas  i have  not      this seemed to strike both of them as unbelievable  and they only  stared at me as if trying to put me out of countenance     in the meantime  some of the people of huiry  interested always in  gendarmes  were standing at the top of the hill watching the scene   so i said   suppose you come inside and i will answer your questions  there   and i opened the door of the salon  and went in     they hesitated a moment  but decided to follow me  they stood  very  stiffly  just inside the door  looking about with curiosity  i sat down at  my desk  and made a motion to them to be seated  i did not know  whether or not it was correct to ask gendarmes to sit down  but i  ventured it  evidently it was not correct  for they paid no attention to  my gesture     when they were done looking about  they asked me for my papers     i produced my american passport  they looked at the huge steel   engraved document with great seriousness  i am sure they had never  seen one before  it impressed them  as well it might  in comparison  with the civil papers of the french government     they satisfied themselves that the picture affixed was really i  that the  name agreed with that on their books  of course  they could not read  a word of it  but they looked wise  then they asked me for my french  papers  i produced my permis de sejour  permitting me to stay in  france provided i did not change my residence  and to which was  affixed the same photograph as that on my passport  my declaration  of my civil situation  duly stamped  and my  immatriculation   a leaf  from the register on which all foreigners are written down  just as we  would be if admitted to a hospital or an insane asylum     the two men put their heads together over these documents    examined the signatures and the seals with great gravity  with evident  regret to find that i was quite en regle     finally they permitted me to put the documents all back in the case in  which i carry them     i thought the scene was over  not at all  they waited until i shut the  case  and replaced it in my bag  and then      you live alone   one asked     i owned that i did      but why       well   i replied   because i have no family here       you have no domestic      i explained that i had a femme de menage      where is she      i said that at that moment she was probably at couilly  but that  ordinarily when she was not here  she was at her own home      where is that   was the next question     so i took them out on to the terrace again  and showed them  amelie s house     they stared solemnly at it  as if they had never seen it before  and  then one of them turned on me quickly  as if to startle me   vous etes  une femme de lettres       it is so written down in my papers   i replied      journaliste      i denied my old calling without the quiver of an eyelash  i hadn t a  scruple  besides  my old profession many a time failed me  and it  might have been dangerous to have been known as even an ex   journalist today within the zone of military operations     upon that followed a series of the most intimate questions anyone  ever dared put to me   my income  my resources  my expectations   my plans  etc   and all sorts of questions i too rarely put to myself  even  and never answer to myself  practically the only question they  did not ask was if i ever intended to marry  i was tempted to volunteer  that information  but  as neither man had the smallest sense of  humor  i decided it was wiser to let well enough alone     it was only when they were stumped for another single question that  they decided to go  they saluted me politely this time  a tribute i  imagine to my having kept my temper under great provocation to lose  it  went out of the gate  stood whispering together a few minutes  and  gazing back at the house  as if afraid they would forget it  looked up  at the plaque on the gate post  made a note  mounted their wheels   and sprinted down the hill  still in earnest conversation     i wondered what they were saying to one another  whatever it was  i  got an order early the next morning to present myself at the  gendarmerie at esbly before eleven o clock     pere was angry  he seemed to feel  that  for some reason  i was  under suspicion  and that it was a man s business to defend me  so   when ninette brought my perambulator to the gate  there was pere   in his veston and casquette  determined to go with me and see me  through     at esbly i found a different sort of person  a gentleman  he told me  he was not a gendarme by metier  but a volunteer  and  although he  put me through practically the same paces  it was different  he was  sympathetic  not averse to a joke  and  when it was over  he went out  to help me into my baby cart  thanked me for troubling myself   assured me that i was absolutely en regle  and even went so very far  as to say that he was pleased to have met me  so i suppose  until the  commander at esbly is changed  i shall be left in peace     this will give you a little idea of what it is like here  i suppose i  needed to be shaken up a bit to make me realize that i was near  the war  it is easy to forget it sometimes     amelie came this morning with the tale that it was rumored that all  foreigners were to be  expelled from the zone des armees   it might  be  still  i am not worrying   sufficient to the day   you know           xvi        september              you have the date quite right     it is a year ago today  this very  th of september  since i saw the  french soldiers march away across the hill  over what we call the   champs madame   no one knows why  on their way to the battle  behind meaux     by chance  you could not have planned it  since the time it takes a  letter to reach me depends on how interesting the censor finds it    your celebration of that event reached me on its anniversary     you are absolutely wrong  however  to pull such a long face over my  situation  you write as if i had passed through a year of misery  i have  not  i am sure you never got that impression from my letters  and i  assure you that i am writing exactly as i feel  i have no facade up for  you     i own it has been a year of tension  it has been three hundred and  sixty five days and a fourth  not one of which has been free from  anxiety of some sort or other  sometimes i have been cold   sometimes i have been nervous  but all the same  it has been fifty   two weeks of growing respect for the people among whom i live  and  of ever mounting love of life  and never failing conviction that the sum  of it is beauty  i have had to fight for the faith in that  but i have kept  it  always  in the midst of life we are in death   but not always is death  so fine and beautiful a thing as in these days  no one would choose  that such things as have come to pass in the last year should be  but  since they are  don t be so foolish as to pity me  who have the chance  to look on  near enough to feel and to understand  even though i am  far enough off to be absolutely safe   alas  eternally a mere spectator   and speaking of having been cold reminds me that it is beginning to  get cold again  we have had heavy hailstorms already  hail as big  and hard as dried peas  and i have not as yet been able to get fuel   so i am looking forward to another trying winter  in the spring my  coal dealer assured me that last winter s situation would not be  repeated  and i told him that i would take all the coal he could get me   having said that  i took no further thought of the matter  up to date he  has not been able to get any  the railroad is too busy carrying war  material     i was pained by the tone of your last letter  evidently mine of the  fourth of july did not please you  evidently you don t like my politics  or my philosophy  or my  deadly parallels   or any of my thoughts  about the present and future of my native land  destroy the letter   forget it  and we ll talk of other things  and  to take a big jump      did you ever keep cats     there is a subject in which you can find no offence  and if it does not  appeal to you it is your own fault     if you never have kept cats  you have missed lots of fun  you are not  half educated  you have not been disciplined at all    a cat is a  wonderful animal  but he is not a bit like what  on first making his  acquaintance  you think he is going to be  and he never becomes it     now i have been living a year this september with one cat  and part  of the time  with two  i am wiser than i used to be  by fits and starts i  am more modest     i used to think that a cat was a tame animal  who lapped milk  slept   rolled up ornamentally on a rug  now and then chased his tail  and  now and then played gracefully with a ball  came and sat on your  knee when you invited him  and caught mice  if mice came where he  was     all the cats i had seen in the homes of my friends surely did those  things  i thought them  so pretty    so graceful    so soft   and i  always said they  gave a cosy look to a room      but i had never been intimate with a cat     when the english soldiers were here a year ago  amelie came one  morning bringing a kitten in her apron  you remember i told you of  this  he was probably three months old  so amelie says  and she  knows all about cats  she said off hand   c est un chat du mois de  juin   she seems to know what month well behaved cats ought to be  born  so far as i know  they might be born in any old month  he was  like a little tiger  with a white face and shirt front  white paws and  lovely green eyes     he had to have a name  so  as he had a lot of brown  the color of the  english uniform  and came to me while the soldiers were here  i  named him khaki  he accepted it  and answered to his name at  once  he got well rapidly  his fur began to grow  and so did he     at first he lived up to my idea of what a kitten should be  he was  always ready to play  but he had much more originality than i knew  cats to have  he was so amusing that i gave lots of time to him  i had  corks  tied to strings  hanging to all the door knobs and posts in the  house  and  for hours at a time  he amused himself playing games  like basket ball and football with these corks  i lost hours of my life  watching him  and calling amelie to  come quick  and see him  his  ingenuity was remarkable  he would take the cork in his front paws   turn over on his back  and try to rip it open with his hind paws  i  suppose that was the way his tiger ancestors ripped open their prey   he would carry the cork  attached to the post at the foot of the  staircase  as far up the stairs as the string would allow him  lay it  down and touch it gently to make it roll down the stairs so that he  could spring after it and catch it before it reached the bottom  all this  was most satisfactory  that was what i expected a cat to do     he lapped his milk all right  i did not know what else to give him  i  asked amelie what she gave hers  she said  soup made out of bread  and drippings   that was a new idea  but amelie s cats looked all  right  so i made the same kind of soup for khaki  not he  he turned  his back on it  then amelie suggested bread in his milk  i tried that   he lapped the milk  but left the bread  i was rather in despair  he  looked too thin  amelie suggested that he was a thin kind of a cat  i  did not want a thin kind of a cat  i wanted a roly poly cat     one day i was eating a dry biscuit at tea time  he came and stood  beside me  and i offered him a piece  he accepted it  so  after that  i  gave him biscuit and milk  he used to sit beside his saucer  lap up his  milk  and then pick up the pieces of biscuit with his paw and eat them   this got to be his first show trick  everyone came to see khaki eat   with his fingers      all amelie s efforts to induce him to adopt the diet of all the other cats  in huiry failed  finally i said   what does he want  amelie  what do  cats  who will not eat soup  eat      reluctantly i got it   liver      well  i should think he did  he eats it twice a day     up to that time he had never talked even cat language  he had never  meowed since the day he presented himself at amelie s and asked  for sanctuary     but we have had  from the beginning  a few collisions of will power   the first few weeks that he was a guest in my house  i was terribly  flattered because he never wanted to sleep anywhere but on my  knees  he did not squirm round as amelie said kittens usually did  he  never climbed on my shoulders and rubbed against my face  he  simply jumped up in my lap  turned round once  lay down  and lay  perfectly still  if i got up  i had to put him in my chair  soothe him  a bit  as you would a baby  if i expected him to stay  but  even then   nine times out of ten  as soon as i was settled in another chair   he followed  and climbed into my lap     now things that are flattering finally pall  i began to guess that it was  his comfort  not his love for me  that controlled him  well  it is the old  story     but the night question was the hardest  he had a basket  he had a  cushion  i have the country habit of going to bed with the chickens   the cat came near changing all that  i used to let him go to sleep in  my lap  i used to put him in his basket by the table with all the care  that you would put a baby  then i made a dash for upstairs and  closed the doors  ha  ha  in two minutes he was scratching at the  door  i let him scratch   he must be disciplined   i said  there was a  cushion at the door  and finally he would settle  down and in the  morning he was there when i woke   he will learn   i said  h m     one night  while i was in my dressing room  i neglected to latch the  bedroom door  when i was ready to get into bed  lo  there was khaki  on the foot of the bed  close against the footboard  fast asleep  not  only was he asleep  but he was lying on his back  with his two white  paws folded over his eyes as if to keep the lamplight out of them   well  i had not the heart to drive him away  he had won  he slept  there  he never budged until i was dressed in the morning  when he  got up  as if it were the usual thing  and followed  in his most dignified  manner  down to breakfast     well  that was struggle number one  khaki had scored     but  no sooner had i got myself reconciled  i felt pretty shamefaced    when he changed his plans  the very moment i was ready for bed he  wanted to go out  he never meowed  he just tapped at the door  and  if that did not succeed  he scratched on the window  and he was so  one idea ed that nothing turned him from his purpose until he was let  out     for a time i used to sit up for him to come in  i was ashamed to let  amelie know  but  one night  after i had been out in the garden with a  lantern hunting for him at midnight  i heard a gentle purring sound   and  after looking in every direction  i finally located him on the roof of  the kitchen  being a bit dull  i imagined that he could not get down  i  stood up on a bench under the kitchen window  and called him  he  came to the eaves  and i could just reach him  but  as i was about to  take him by a leg and haul him down  he retreated just out of my  reach  and said what i imagined to be a pathetic  meow   i talked to  him  i tried to coax him to come within reach again  but he only went  up the roof to the ridgepole and looked down the other side and said   meow   i was in despair  when it occurred to me to get the step   ladder  you may think me impossibly silly  but i never supposed that  he could get down     i went for the key to the grange  pulled out the ladder  and hauled it  along the terrace  and was just putting it up  when the little devil  leaped from the roof into the lilac bush  swayed there a minute  ran  down  scampered across the garden  and dashed up a pear tree   and  well  i think he laughed at me     anyway  i was mad  i went in and told him that he might stop out all  night for all i cared  still  i could not sleep for thinking of him  used  to comfort  out in the night  and it was chilly  but he had to be  disciplined     i had to laugh in the morning  for he was playing on the terrace when  i opened the door  and he had a line of three first class mice laid out  for me  i said   why  good morning  khaki  did mother make him stay  out all night  well  you know he was a naughty cat      he gave me a look  i fancied it was quizzical  rolled over  and  showed his pretty white belly  then jumped up  gave one look up at  the bedroom window  scampered up the salon shutter  crouched on  the top  and  with one leap  was through the bedroom window  when  i rushed upstairs  to see if he had hurt himself  i suppose   he was  sitting on the foot of the bed  and i think he was grinning     so much for disciplining a cat     however  i had learned something  and  evidently  he had also  i had  learned that a cat can take care of himself  and has a right to live a  cat s life  and he learned that i was dull  we treat each other  accordingly  the truth is  he owns me  and the house  and he knows  it     since then he asks for the door  and gets it when he asks  he goes  and comes at his own sweet will  when he wants to come in  in the  daytime  he looks in at all the windows until he finds me  then he  stands on his hind legs and beats the window with his paws until i  open it for him  in the night  he climbs to the bedroom window  and  taps until he wakens me  you see  it is his house  not mine  and he  knows it  what is the drollest of all  he is never one minute late to his  meals     he is familiarly known to all my neighbors as  the grand duc de  huiry  and he looks the part  still  from my point of view  he is not an  ideal cat  he is not a bit caressing  he never fails to purr politely when  he comes in  but he is no longer playful  he never climbs up to my  shoulder and rubs against my face as some of amelie s commoner  cats will do  he is intelligent and handsome  just a miniature tiger   and growls like a new arrival from the jungle when he is displeased    and he is a great ratter  moreover amelie has decided that he is an   intellectuel      one morning  when he had been out all night  and did not return until  almost breakfast time  he was sitting on my knee  making his toilette   while i argued the matter with him  amelie was dusting  i reproached  him with becoming a rodeur  and i told him that i should be happier  about him if i knew where he was every night  and what he did     he yawned as if bored  jumped off my knees and began walking  round the library  and examining the books      well   remarked amelie   i can tell you where he goes  he has a  class in maria s grange  where the wheat is stored  a class of mice   he goes every evening to give conferences on history and the war   and he eats up all the stupid pupils      i had to laugh  but before i could ask her how she knew  khaki  jumped up on top of the lowest line of books  and disappeared  behind     amelie shrugged her shoulders  and said   voila  he has gone to  prepare his next conference   and he really had chosen a line of  books on history     you see amelie knows beasties better than i do  there really is a sort  of freemasonry between certain people and dumb animals  i have not  a bit of it  though i love them  you would adore to see amelie play  with cats  she knows how  and as for her conversation with them  it is  wonderful  i remarked the fact to her one day  when her morning  salutations with the cats had been unusual  she replied  with her  customary shrug   eh bien  madame  toujours  entre eux  les betes  se comprennent      so much in brief for cat number one  number two is a different  matter     in the spring  four kittens were born at amelie s  they were all sorts of  mongrels  there was a dear little fluffy  half angora  which i named  garibaldi  and amelie  as usual  vulgarized it at once into  didine    there was a long legged blue kitten which i dubbed roi albert  there  was a short legged  sturdy little energetic striped one which i called  general joffre  and a yellow and black fellow  who was  of course   nicolas  i regretted there weren t two more  or three     garibaldi was about the dearest kitten i ever saw  he attached  himself to me at once  when he was only a round fluffy ball he would  try to climb into my lap whenever i went to see the kittens  the result  was that when he was still very young  he came to live with me  and i  never saw so altogether loveable an animal  he has all the cat  qualities i ever dreamed of  as amelie says   ii a tout pour lui  et il ne  manque que la parole   and it is true  he crawls up my back  he will  lie for hours on my shoulder purring his little soft song into my ear  he  will sit beside me on my desk  looking at me with his pretty yellow  eyes  as if he and i were the whole of his world  if i walk in the  garden  he is under my feet  if i go up to amelie s he goes too     his attachment has its drawbacks  he tries to sit on my book when i  am reading  and longs to lie on the keyboard of my machine when i  am writing  if i try to read a paper when he is on my lap he  immediately crawls under it  and gets between my eyes and the print   i am terribly flattered  but his affection has its inconveniences   needless to say  khaki hates him  and never passes him without  growling  luckily didine is not a bit afraid of him  up to date they have  never fought  didine has a great admiration for khaki  and will tag  him  the difference in their characters is too funny  for example  if  didine brings a mouse into the garden khaki never attempts to touch  it  he will sit apart  indulgently watching didine play with his prey   torment it  and finally kill it  and never offer to join in the sport  on  the contrary  if khaki brings in a mouse  didine wants to join in the fun  at once  result  khaki gives one fierce growl  abandons his catch  and goes out of the garden  difference  i suppose  between a  thoroughbred sport and  well  a common cat     i could fill a volume with stories about these cats  don t worry  i shall  not     you ask me if i have a dog  yes  a big black caniche named dick  a  good watch dog  but too fond of playing  i call him an  india rubber  dog   because when he is demanding  a frolic  or asking to have a  stone thrown for him  his idea of happiness  he jumps up and down  on his four stiff legs exactly like a toy woolly dog on an elastic     he is a good dog to walk with  and loves to  go   he is very obedient  on the road for that reason  knows if he is naughty he can t go next  time     so now you have the household complete  i ll warrant you won t be  content  if you are not  there is no satisfying you  when i pour all my  political dreams on paper  and shout on to my machine all my  disappointments over the attitude of washington  you take offence   so what can i do  i cannot send you letters full of stirring adventures   i don t have any  i can t write you dramatic things about the war  it is  not dramatic here  and that is as strange to me as it seems to be to  you           xvii        october              we have been as near to getting enthusiastically excited as we have  since the war began     just when everyone had a mind made up that the allies could not be  ready to make their first offensive movement until next spring    resigned to know that it would not be until after a year and a half  and  more  of war that we could see our armies in a position to do more  than continue to repel the attacks of the enemy  we all waked up on  september    to the unexpected news that an offensive movement  of the french in champagne had actually begun on the   th  and  was successful     for three or four days the suspense and the hope alternated  every  day there was an advance  an advance that seemed to be supported  by the english about loos  and all the time we heard at intervals the  far off pounding of the artillery     for several days our hearts were high  then there began to creep  into the papers hints that it had been a gallant advance  but not a  great victory  and far too costly  and that there had been blunders   and we all settled back with the usual philosophy  studied the map of  our first line trenches on september     when the attack began     running through souain and perthes  mesnil  massiges  and ville sur  tourbe  we compared it with the line on the night of september      when the battle practically ended  running from the outskirts of  auderive in the west to behind cernay in the east  and took what  comfort we could in the    kilometres of advance  and three hilltops  gained  it looked but a few steps on the map  but it was a few steps  nearer the frontier     long before you get this  you will have read  in the american papers   details hidden from us  though we know more about this event than  about most battles     you remember the tea party i had for the boys in our ambulance in  june  well  among the soldiers here that day was a chap named  litigue  he was wounded  his second time  on september     the  first day of the battle  he was nursed in our ambulance the first time  by mlle  henriette  and yesterday she had a letter from him  which she  lets me translate for you  because it will give you some idea of the  battle  of the spirit of the poilus  and also because it contains a bit of  news and answers a question you asked me several weeks ago   after the first use of gas attacks in the north       a l hopital st  andre de luhzac     september          mademoiselle     i am writing you tonight a little more at length than i was able to do  this morning  then i had not the time  as my nurse was waiting beside  my bed to take the card to the post  i wrote it the moment i was able   at the same time that i wrote to my family  i hope it reached you     i am going to tell you in as few words as possible  how the day  passed  the attack began the   th  at exactly quarter past nine in the  morning  the preparatory bombardment had been going on since the    d  all the regiments had been assembled the night before in their  shelters  ready to leap forward     at daybreak the bombardment recommenced  a terrible storm of  shells of every calibre  bombs  torpedoes  flew overhead to salute  the boches  and to complete the destruction which had been going  on for three days     without paying attention to the few obus which the boches sent over  in reply to our storm  we all mounted the parapets to get a view of the  scene  all along our front  in both directions  all we could see was a  thick cloud of dust and smoke  for four hours we stood there  without  saying a word  waiting the order to advance  officers  common  soldiers  young and old  had but one thought   to get into it and be  done with it as quickly as possible  it was just nine o clock when the  officers ordered us into line  ready to advance   sac au dos  bayonets  fixed  musettes full of grenades and asphyxiating bombs  everyone of  us knew that he was facing death out there  but i saw nowhere the  smallest sign of shrinking  and at quarter past nine  when we got the  signal to start  one cry   en avant  et vive la france   burst from  thousands and thousands of throats  as we leaped out of the  trenches  and it seemed to me that it was but one bound before we  were on them     once there i seem to remember nothing in detail  it was as if  by  enchantment  that i found myself in the midst of the struggle  in heaps  of dead and dying  when i fell  and found myself useless in the fight  i  dragged myself  on my stomach  towards our trenches  i met  stretcher bearers who were willing to carry me  but i was able to  crawl  and so many of my comrades were worse off  that i refused  i  crept two kilometres like that until i found a dressing station  i was  suffering terribly with the bullet in my ankle  they extracted it there  and dressed the ankle  but i remained  stretched on the ground  two  days before i was removed  and i had nothing to eat until i reached  here yesterday  four days after i fell  but that could not be helped   there were so many to attend to     i will let you know how i get on  and i hope for news from you  in the  meantime i send you my kindest regards  and my deep gratitude     your big friend     lltigue  a       i thought you might be interested to see what sort of a letter a real  poilu writes  and litigue is just a big workman  young and energetic     you remember you asked me if the allies would ever bring  themselves to replying in sort to the gas attacks  you see what litigue  says so simply  they did have asphyxiating bombs  naturally the  most honorable army in the world cannot neglect to reply in sort to a  weapon like that  when the boches have taken some of their own  medicine the weapon will be less freely used  besides  today our men  are all protected against gas     i had hardly settled down to the feeling that the offensive was over  and that there was another long winter of inaction  a winter of the  same physical and material discomforts as the first  lack of fuel   suspense   when the news came which makes my feeling very  personal  the british offensive in the north has cost me a dear friend   you remember the young english officer who had marched around  me in september of last year  during the days preceding the battle of  the marne  he was killed in belgium on the morning of september      the second day of the offensive  he was in command of an anti   aeroplane battery advanced in the night to what was considered a  well concealed position  the german guns  however  got the range   shrapnel nearly wiped out the command  and the captain was  wounded in the head  he died at the hospital at etaples half an hour  after he arrived  and lies buried in the english cemetery on the dunes   with his face towards the country for which he gave his young life     i know one must not today regret such sacrifices  death is  and no  one can die better than actively for a great cause  but  when a loved  one goes out in youth  when a career of achievement before which a  really brilliant future opened  is snapped  one can still be proud  but it  is through a veil of tears     i remember so well that sunday morning  the   th of september  it  was a beautiful day  the air was clear  the sun shone  i sat all the  morning on the lawn watching the clouds  so small and fleecy  and  listening to the far off cannon  not knowing then that it meant the  big  offensive   oddly enough we spoke of him  for amelie was examining  the cherry tree  which she imagined had some sort of malady  and  she said   do you remember when captain noel was here last year  how he climbed the tree to pick the cherries   and i replied that the  tree hardly looked solid enough now to bear his weight  i sat thinking  of him  and his life of movement and activity under so many climes   and wondered where he was  little thinking that already  that very  morning  the sun of his dear life was told  and that we should never   as i had dreamed  talk over his adventures in france as we had so  often talked over those in india  in china  and in africa     it is odd  but when a friend so dear as he was  yet whom one only  saw rarely  in the etapes of his active career  goes out across the  great bourne  into the silence and the invisible  it takes time to realize  it  it is only after a long waiting  when not even a message comes  back  that one comprehends that there are to be no more meetings  at the cross roads  i moved one more portrait into the line under the  flags tied with black  that was all     you hardly knew him  i know  but no one ever saw his upright figure   his thin  clear cut features  bronzed by tropic suns  and his direct  gaze  and forgot him           xviii        december              it is two months since i wrote  i know it  but you really must not  reproach me so violently as you do in yours of the   st of november   just received     to begin with  there is no occasion for you to worry  i may be  uncomfortable  i am in no danger  as for the discomforts  well  i am  used to them  i cannot get coal very often  and when i do i pay  twenty six dollars a ton for it  and it is only imitation coal  at that  i  cannot get washing done oftener than once in six weeks  nothing  dries out of doors in this country of damp winters  i am often forced to  live my evenings by candle light  which is pretty extravagant  as  candles are costly  and it takes a good many to get through an  evening  they burn down like paper tapers in these days     when i don t write it is simply because i have nothing more  interesting than things like that to tell you  the situation is chronic   and  like chronic diseases  much more likely to get worse than to get  better     you should be grateful to me for sparing you  instead of blaming me     i might not have found the inspiration to write today if something had  not happened     this morning the town crier beat his drum all over the hill  and read a  proclamation forbidding all foreigners to leave the commune during  the next thirty days without a special permit from the general in  command of the  th army corps     no one knows what this means  i have been to the mairie to enquire  simply because i had promised to spend christmas at voulangis   and  if this order is formal  i may have difficulty in going  i have no  desire to celebrate  only there is a child there  and the lives of little  children ought not to be too much saddened by the times and events  they do not understand     i was told at the mairie that they had no power  and that i would have  to address myself to monsieur le general  they could not even tell  me what form the request ought to take  so i came home  and wrote  the letter as well as i could     in the meantime  i am distinctly informed that until i get a reply from  headquarters i cannot go out of the commune of quincy segy     if i really obey the letter of this order i cannot even go to amelie s  her  house is in the commune of couilly  and mine in quincy  and the  boundary line between the two communes is the path beside my  garden  on the south side  and runs up the middle of my road from  that point     it is annoying  as i hardly know quincy  and don t care for it  and  never go there except to present myself at the mairie  it is further off  the railroad line than i am here  couilly i know and like  it is a pretty  prosperous village  it has better shops than quincy  which has not  even a pharmacie  and i have always done my shopping there  my  mail comes there  and the railway station is there  and everyone  knows me     the idea that i can t go there gives me  for the first time since the  battle  a shut in feeling  i talked to the garde champetre  whom i met  on the road  as i returned from the mairie  and i asked him what he  thought about the risk of my going to couilly  he looked properly  grave  and said      i would not  if i were in your place  better run no risks until we  understand what this is to lead to      i thanked him  with an expression just as serious and important as  his   i ll obey   i said to myself   though to obey will be comic      so i turned the corner on top of the hill  i drove close to the east side  of the road  which was the quincy side  and as i passed the entrance  to amelie s court i called to pere to come out and get ninette and the  cart  i then climbed out and left the turn out there     i did not look back  but i knew pere was standing in the road looking  after me in amazement  and not understanding a bit that i had left my  cart on the quincy side of the road for him to drive it into couilly   where i could not go      i ll obey   i repeated to myself  viciously  as i strolled down the  quincy side of the road and crossed in front of the gate where the  whole width of the road is in my commune     i hadn t been in the house five minutes before amelie arrived      what s the matter   she demanded  breathlessly      nothing       why didn t you drive into the stable as usual       i couldn t       why couldn t you       because i am forbidden to go to couilly      i thought she was going to see the joke and laugh  she didn t  she  was angry  and i had a hard time to make her see that it was funny   in fact  i did not really make her see it at all  for an hour later   wanting her  i went up to the quincy side of the road  leaned against  the wall  opposite her entrance  and blew my big whistle for ten  minutes without attracting her attention     that attempt at renewing the joke had two results  i must tell you that  one of the few friends who has ever been out here felt that the only  annoying thing about my being so absolutely alone was that  if  anything happened and i needed help  i had no way of letting anyone  know  so i promised  and it was agreed with amelie  that  in need  i  should blow my big whistle  it can be heard half a mile  but that was  over two years ago  i have never needed help  i have used the  whistle to call dick     i whistled and whistled and whistled until i was good and mad  then i  began to yell   amelie  melie  pere   and they came running out   looking frightened to death  to find me  red in the face  leaning against  the wall  on the quincy side of the road      what s the matter   cried amelie      didn t you hear my whistle   i asked      we thought you were calling dick      the joke was on me     when i explained that i wanted some fresh bread to toast and was  not allowed to go to their house in couilly for it  it ceased to be a joke  at all     it was useless for me to laugh  and to explain that an order was an  order  and that couilly was couilly  whether it was at my gate or down  the hill     pere s anger was funnier than my joke  he saw nothing comic in the  situation  to him it was absurd  monsieur le general  commandant de  la cinquieme armee ought to know that i was all right  if he didn t  know it  it was high time someone told him     in his gentle old voice he made quite a harangue     all frenchmen can make harangues     it was difficult for me to convince him that i was not in the slightest  degree annoyed  that i thought it was amusing  that there was  nothing personally directed against me in the order  that i was only  one of many foreigners inside the zone des armees  that the only way  to catch the dangerous ones was to forbid us all to circulate     i might have spared myself the breath it took to argue with him  if i  ever thought i could change the conviction of a french peasant  i  don t think so since i have lived among them  i spent several days  last summer trying to convince pere that the sun did not go round the  earth  i drew charts of the heavens   you should have seen them    and explained the solar system  he listened attentively  one has to  listen when the patronne talks  you know  and i thought he  understood  when it was all over  it took me three days  he said to  me      bien  all the same  look at the sun  this morning it was behind  maria s house over there  i saw it  at noon it was right over my  orchard  i saw it there  at five o clock it will be behind the hill at  esbly  you tell me it does not move  why  i see it move every day   alors  it moves      i gave it up  all my lovely exposition of us rolling through space had  missed  so there is no hope of my convincing him that this new  regulation regarding foreigners is not designed expressly to annoy  me     i often wonder exactly what all this war means to him  he reads his  newspaper religiously  he seems to understand  he talks very well  about it  but he is detached in a way  he hates it  it has aged him  terribly  but just what it means to him i can t know             xix        christmas day            well  here i am  alone  on my second war christmas  all my efforts to  get a permis de sortir failed     ten days after i wrote you last  there was a rumor that all foreigners  were to be expelled from the zone of military operations  my friends in  paris began to urge me to close up the house and go into town   where i could at least be comfortable     i simply cannot  i am accustomed now to living alone  i am not fit to  live among active people  if i leave my house  which needs constant  care  it will get into a terrible condition  and  once out of it  there is  no knowing what difficulty i might have to get back  the future is all  so uncertain  besides  i really want to see the thing out right here     i made two efforts to get a permission to go to voulangis  it is only  five miles away  i wrote to the commander of the  th army corps  twice  i got no answer  then i was told that i could not hope to reach  him with a personal letter  that i must communicate with him through  the civil authorities  i made a desperate effort  i decided to dare the  regulations and appeal to the commander of the gendarmes at esbly     there i had a queer interview  at first very discreet and very  misleading  so far as they were concerned  in the end  however  i  had the pleasure of seeing my two letters to monsieur le general  attached to a long sheet of paper  full of writing   my dossier  they  called it  they did not deign to tell me why my letters  sent to the army  headquarters  had been filed at the gendarmerie  i suppose that was  none of my business  nor did they let me see what was written on the  long sheet to which the letters were attached  finally  they did stoop  to tell me that a gendarme had been to the mairie regarding my case   and that if i would present myself at quincy the next morning  i would  find a petition covering my demand awaiting my signature  it will be  too late to serve the purpose for which it was asked  but i ll take it for  paris  if i can get it     for lack of other company i invited khaki to breakfast with me today   he didn t promise formally to come  but he was there  by devoting  myself to him he behaved very well indeed  and did not disturb the  table decorations  luckily  they were not good to eat  he sat in a chair  beside me  and now and then i had to pardon him for putting his  elbow on the table  i did that the more graciously as i was surprised  that he did not sit on it  he had his own fork  and except that  now and  then  he got impatient and reached out a white paw to take a bit of  chicken from my fork just before it reached my mouth  he committed  no grave breach of table manners  he did refuse to keep his bib on   and he ate more than i did  and enjoyed the meal better  in fact  i  should not have enjoyed it at all but for him  he had a gorgeous time     i did not invite garibaldi  he did not know anything about it  he is too  young to enjoy a  function   he played in the garden during the meal   happy and content to have a huge breakfast of bread and gravy  he  is a bread eater  thoroughly french     i even went so far as to dress for khaki  and put a christmas rose in  my hair  alas  it was all wasted on him     this is all the news i have to send you  and i cannot even send a  hopeful message for       the end looks farther off for me than it did  at the beginning of the year  it seems to me that the world is only now  beginning to realize what it is up against           xx        january               well  i have really been to paris  and it was so difficult that i ask  myself why i troubled     i had to await the pleasure of the commander of the cinquieme  armee  as the embassy was powerless to help me  although they did  their best with great good will  i enclose you my sauf conduit that you  may see what so important a document is like  then i want to tell you  the funny thing    never had to show it once  i was very curious to  know just how important it was  i went by the way of esbly  on buying  my ticket i expected to be asked for it  as there was a printed notice  beside the window to the ticket office announcing that all purchasers  of tickets must be furnished with a sauf conduit  no one cared to see  mine  no one asked for it on the train  no one demanded it at the exit  in paris  nor  when i returned  did anyone ask for it either at the  ticket office in paris or at the entrance to the train  considering that i  had waited weeks for it  had to ask for it three times  had to explain  what i was going to do in paris  where i was going to stay  how long   etc   i had to be amused     i was really terribly disappointed  i had longed to show it  it seemed  so chic to travel with the consent of a big general     of course  if i had attempted to go without it  i should have risked  getting caught  as  at any time  the train was liable to be boarded and  all papers examined     i learned at the embassy  where the military attache had consulted  the ministry of war  that an arrangement was to be made later  regarding foreigners  and that we were to be provided with a special  book which  while it would not allow us to circulate freely  would give  us the right to demand a permission  and get it if the military  authorities chose  no great change that     the visit served little purpose except to show me a sad looking paris  and make me rejoice to get back     now that the days are so short  and it is dark at four o clock  paris is  almost unrecognizable  with shop shutters closed  tramway windows  curtained  very few street lights  none at all on short streets  no  visible lights in houses  the city looks dead  you  d have to see it to  realize what it is like     the weather was dull  damp  the cold penetrating  and the  atmosphere depressing  and so was the conversation  it is better  here on the hilltop  even though  now and then  we hear the guns     coming back from paris there were almost no lights on the platforms  at the railway stations  and all the coaches had their curtains drawn   at the station at esbly the same situation  a few lights  very low  on  the main platform  and absolutely none on the platform where i took  the narrow gauge for couilly  i went stumbling  in absolute blackness   across the main track  and literally felt my way along the little train to  find a door to my coach  if it had not been for the one lamp on my  little cart waiting in the road  i could not have seen where the exit at  couilly was  it was not gay  and it was far from gay climbing the long  hill  with the feeble rays of that one lamp to light the blackness   luckily ninette knows the road in the dark     in the early days of the war it used to be amusing in the train  as  everyone talked  and the talk was good  those days are passed   with the now famous order pasted on every window     taisez vous  mefiez vous   les oreilles ennemies vous ecoutent    no one says a word  i came back from paris with half a dozen officers  in the compartment  each one  as he entered  brought his hand to  salute  and sat down  without a word  they did not even look at one  another  it is one of the most marked changes in attitude that i have  seen since the war  it is right  we were all getting too talkative  but it  takes away the one charm there was in going to paris  i ve had no  adventures since i wrote to you christmas day  although we did  have  a few days after that  five minutes of excitement     one day i was walking in the garden  it was a fairly bright day  and  the sun was shining through the winter haze  i had been counting my  tulips  which were coming up bravely  admiring my yellow crocuses   already in flower  and hoping the sap would not begin to rise in the  rose bushes  and watching the marne  once more lying like a sea  rather than a river over the fields  and wondering how that awful  winter freshet was going to affect the battle front  when  suddenly   there was a terrible explosion  it nearly shook me off my feet     the letter carrier from quincy was just mounting the hill on his wheel   and he promptly tumbled off it  i happened to be standing where i  could see over the hedge  but before i could get out the stupid  question   what was that   there came a second explosion  then a  third and a fourth     they sounded in the direction of paris      zeppelins   was my first thought  but that was hardly the hour for  them     i stood rooted to the spot  i could hear voices at voisins  as if all the  world had rushed into the street  then i saw amelie running down the  hill  she said nothing as she passed  the postman picked himself up   passed me a letter  shrugged his shoulders  and pushed his wheel up  the hill     i patiently waited until the voices ceased in voisins  i could see no  smoke anywhere  amelie came back at once  but she brought no  explanation  she only brought a funny story     there is an old woman in voisins  well on to ninety  called mere r      the war is too tremendous for her localized mind to grasp  out of  the confusion she picks and clings to certain isolated facts  at the first  explosion  she rushed  terrorized  into the street  gazing up to the  heavens  and shaking her withered old fists above her head  she  cried in her shrill  quavering voice   now look at that  they told us the  kaiser was dying  it s a lie  it s a lie  you see  for here he comes  throwing his cursed bombs down on us      you know all this month the papers have had guillaume dying of that  ever recurring cancer of the throat  i suppose the old woman thinks  guillaume is carrying all this war on in person  in a certain sense she  is not very far wrong     for a whole week we got no explanation of that five minutes   excitement  then it leaked out that the officer of the general staff   who has been stationed at the chateau de conde  halfway between  here and esbly  was about to change his section  he had  in the park  there  four german shells from the marne battlefield  which had not  been exploded  he did not want to take them with him  and it was  equally dangerous to leave them in the park  so he decided to  explode them  and had not thought it necessary to warn anybody but  the railroad people     it is a proof of how simple our life is that such an event made  conversation for weeks             xxi        february               well  we are beginning to get a little light  we foreigners  on our  situation  on february    i was ordered to present myself again at the  mairie  i obeyed the summons the next morning  and was told that  the military authorities were to provide all foreigners inside the zone  des armees  and all foreigners outside  who  for any reason  needed  to enter the zone  with what is called a  carnet d etrangere   and that   once i got that  i would have the privilege of asking for a permission  to circulate  but  until that document was ready  i must be content not  to leave my commune  nor to ask for any sort of a sauf conduit     i understand that this regulation applies even to the doctors and  infirmieres  and ambulance drivers of all the american units at work in  france  i naturally imagine that some temporary provision must be  made for them in the interim     i had to make a formal petition for this famous carnet  and to furnish  the military authorities with two photographs  front view   size and  form prescribed     i looked at the mayor s secretary and asked him how the old scratch    i said frankly diable  i was to get photographed when he had  forbidden me to leave my commune  and knew as well as i that there  was no photographer here     quite seriously he wrote me a special permit to go to couilly where  there is a man who can photograph  he wrote on it that it was good  for one day  and the purpose of the trip  to be photographed by the  order of the mayor in order to get my carnet d etrangere   and he  solemnly presented it to me  without the faintest suspicion that it was  humorous     between you and me  i did not even use it  i had still one of the  photographs made for my passport and other papers  amelie carried  it to couilly and had it copied  very few people would recognize me by  it  it is the counterfeit presentment of a smiling  fat old lady  but it is  absolutely reglementaire in size and form  and so will pass muster  i  have seen some pretty queer portraits on civil papers     we are promised these carnets in the course of  a few weeks   so   until then  you can think of me as  to all intents and purposes  really  interned     it may interest you to know that on the  th   just a week ago  a  zeppelin nearly got to meaux  it was about half past eleven in the  evening when the drums beat  lights out   along the hillside  there  weren t many to put out  for everyone is in bed at that hour  and we  have no street lights  but an order is an order  the only result of the  drum was to call everyone out of bed  in the hope  to see a zeppelin    we neither heard nor saw anything     amelie said with a grin next morning   eh  bien  only one thing is  needed to complete our experiences  that a bomb should fall shy of  its aim  the railroad down there  and wipe huiry off the map  and write  it in history      i am sorry that you find holes in my letters  it is your own fault  you do  not see this war from my point of view yet  alas  but you will  make a  note of that  the thing that you will not understand  living  as you do   in a world going about its daily routine  out of sight  out of hearing of  all this horror  is that germany s wilful destruction is on a  preconceived plan  a racial principle  the more races she can reduce  and enfeeble the more room there will be for her  germany wants  belgium  but she wants as few belgians as possible  so with poland   and servia  and northeast france  she wants them to die out as fast  as possible  it is a part of the programme of a people calling  themselves the elect of the world  the only race  in their opinion   which ought to survive     she had a forty four years  start of the rest of the world in preparing  her programme  it is not in two years  or in three  that the rest of the  world can overtake her  that advantage is going to carry her a long  way  some people still believe that advantage will exist to the end  i  don t  still  one of the overwhelming facts of this war is to me that   germany held belgium and northeast france at the end of       and  yet  all along the allied fronts  with germany fighting on invaded  territory  they cried   she is beaten   so  indeed  her strategy was  at  the end of      she had two new allies  and held all of servia   montenegro  and russian poland  and still the allies persisted   she  is licked  but she does not know it yet   it is one of the finest proofs of  the world s faith in the triumph of the right that so many believe this  to be true     you are going to come some day to the opinion i hold  that if we want  universai peace we must first get rid of the race that does not want it  or believe in it  forbidden subject  i know  but when i resist  temptation you find holes in my letters  and seem to imagine that i am  taking no notice of things that happen  i notice fast enough  and i am  so interested that i hope to see the condemnation  already passed in  england  against kaiser  kronprinz and company  for  wilful murder    executed  even if i cannot live to see germany invaded     this is what you get for saying   you make no comment on the  overrunning of servia or the murder of edith cavell  or the failure of  the gallipoli adventure   after all  these are only details in the great  undertaking  as we say of every disaster   they will not affect the final  result   it is getting to be a catch word  but it is true     germany is absolutely right in considering great britain her greatest  enemy  she knows today that  even if she could get to paris or  petrograd  it would not help her  she would still have britain to settle  with  i wonder if the kaiser has yet waked up to a realization of his  one very great achievement  the reawakening of greater britain  he  dreamed of dealing his mother s country a mortal blow     the blow landed  but it healed instead of killing     this war is infernal  diabolical  and farcical  if we look at the deeds  that are done every day  luckily we don t and mustn t  for we all know  that there are things in the world a million times worse than death   and that there are future results to be aimed at which make death  gloriously worth while  those are the things we must look at     i have always told you that i did not find the balance of things much  changed  and i don t  i am afraid that you cannot cultivate  civilize   humanize  choose your word  man to such a point that  so long as he  is not emasculated  his final argument in the cause of honor and  justice will not be his fists  with or without a weapon in them  which is  equivalent to saying  i am afraid  that so long as there are two men  on earth there will always be the chance of a fight     thus far february has been a droll month  i have seen februaries in  france which have been spring like  with the chestnut trees in bud   and the primroses in flower  and lilacs in leaf  this february has been  a strange mixture of spring awkwardly slipping out of the lap of winter  and climbing back again  there have been days when the sun was  so warm that i could drive without a rug  and found furs a burden   there have been wonderful moonlit nights  but the most of the time   so far  it has been nasty  on warm days flowers began to sprout and  the buds on the fruit trees to swell  that made pere sigh and talk  about the lune rousse  we have had days of wind and rain which be   longed in a correct march  i am beginning to realize that the life of a  farmer is a life of anxiety  if i can take pere s word for it  it is always  cold when it should not be  the hot wave never arrives at the right  moment  when it should be dry it rains  and when the earth needs  water the rain refuses to fall  in fact  on his testimony  i am convinced  that the weather is never just right  except to the mere lover of nature   who has nothing to lose and nothing to gain by its caprices     the strange thing is that we all stand it so well  if anyone had told me  that i could have put up with the life i have been living for two winters  and be none the worse for it  i should have thought him heartless   yet  like the army  i am surely none the worse for it  and  in the army   many of the men are better for it  the youngsters who come home on  leave are as rugged as possible  they have straightened up and  broadened their chests  even the middle aged are stronger  there is  a man here who is a master mason  a hard working  ambitious   honest chap  very much loved in the commune  he worked on my  house  so i know him well  before the war he was very delicate  he  had chronic indigestion  and constantly recurring sore throats  he  was pale  and his back was beginning to get round  as he has five  children  he is in an ammunition factory  he was home the other day   i asked him about his health  he looked so rosy  so erect  and strong   he laughed  and replied   never so well in my life  i haven t had a  cold this winter  and i sleep in a board shanty and have no fire  and i  eat in a place so cold my food is chilled before i can swallow it  my  indigestion is a thing of the past  i could digest nails      you see i am always looking for consolations in the disaster  one  must  you know           xxii        march              we are living these days in the atmosphere of the great battle of  verdun  we talk verdun all day  dream verdun all night  in fact  the  thought of that great attack in the east absorbs every other idea  not  in the days of the marne  nor in the trying days of ypres or the aisne  was the tension so terrible as it is now  no one believes that verdun  can be taken  but the anxiety is dreadful  and the idea of what the  defence is costing is never absent from the minds even of those who  are firmly convinced of what the end must be     i am sending you a forain cartoon from the figaro  which exactly  expresses the feeling of the army and the nation     you have only to look on a map to know how important the position is  at verdun  the supposed to be strongest of the four great fortresses    verdun  toul  epinay  and belfort  which protect the only frontier by  which the kaiser has a military right to try to enter france  and which  he avoided on account of its strength     verdun itself is only one day s march from metz  if you study it up on  a map you will learn that  within a circuit of thirty miles  verdun is  protected by thirty six redoubts  but what you will not learn is that this  great fortification is not yet connected with its outer redoubts by the  subterranean passages which were a part of the original scheme  it is  that fact which is disturbing  every engineer in the french army  knows that the citadel at metz has underground communications with  all its circle of outer ramparts  probably every german engineer  knows that verdun s communication passages were never made   isn t it strange  when we remember that  even in the days of walled  cities  there were always subterraneans leading out of the fortified  towns beyond the walls  wonderful works of masonry  intact today   like those of provins  and even here on this hill  that a nation which  did not want war should have left unfinished the protection of such a  costly fortress     you probably knew  as usual  before we did  that the battle had  begun  we knew nothing of it here until february     three days after  the bombardment began  with the french outer lines nine miles  outside the city  although only twenty four hours after was the full  force of the german artillery let loose  with fourteen german divisions  waiting to march against the three french divisions holding the  position  can you wonder we are anxious     we have been buoyed up for weeks by the hope of an allied  offensive  and instead came this     the first day s news was bad  so was that of the   th  i have never  since the war began felt such a vibrant spirit of anxiety about me  to  add to it  just before midnight on the   th snow began to fall  in the  morning there was more snow on the ground than i had ever seen in  france  it was a foot deep in front of the house  and on the north  side  where it had drifted  it was twice that depth  this was so unusual  that no one seemed to know what to do  amelie could not get to me   no one is furnished with foot gear to walk in snow  except men who  happen to have high galoshes  i looked out of the window  and saw  pere shovelling away to make a path to the gate  but with an iron  shovel it was a long passage  it was nine o clock before he got the  gate open  and then amelie came slipping down  pere was busy all  day keeping that path open  for the snow continued to fall     this meant that communications were all stopped  trains ran slowly  on the main lines  but our little road was blocked  it continued to snow  for two days  and for two days we had no news from the outside  world     on the morning of the   th one of our old men went to the demi   lune and watched for a military car coming in from meaux  after  hours of waiting  one finally appeared  he ran into the road and hailed  it  and as the chauffeur put on his brakes  he called      et verdun       elle tient   was the reply  and the auto rushed on     that was all the news we had in those days     when communications were opened the news we got was not  consoling  first phase of the battle closed six days ago  with the  germans in douaumont  and the fighting still going on  but the spirit  of the french not a jot changed  here  among the civilians  they say    verdun will never fall   and out at the front  they tell us that the  poilus simply hiss through their clenched teeth  as they fight and fall    they shall not pass   and all the time we sit inactive on the hilltop  holding that thought  it s all we can do     we were livened up a bit last week because the village clown was on  his home leave  he is a lad of twenty three with a young wife and a  little three year old girl  who has learned to talk since  dada  saw her   and is her father right over  full of fun  good humor  and laughter     i have told you that we almost never hear war talk  we did hear some  while our local clown was home  but how much was true and how  much his imagination i don t know  anyway  his drollery made us all  laugh  his mother in law had died since he left  and when his wife  wept on his shoulder  he patted her on the back  and winked over his  shoulder at his admiring friends  as he said   chut  ma fille  if you are  going to cry in these days because someone dies  you ll have no time  to sleep  only think of it  the old lady died in bed  and that is  everything which is most aristocratic in these days      i regret to say that this did not console wife one bit     as he never can tell anything without acting it out  he was very comic  when he told about the battle in which the prussian guard was wiped  out  he is in the artillery  and he acted out the whole battle  when he  got to the point where the artillery was ordered to advance  he gave  an imitation of himself scrambling on to his gun  and swaying there   as the horses struggled to advance over the rough road ploughed  with shell  until they reached the field where the guard had fallen   then he imitated the gesture of the officer riding beside the guns  and  stopping to look off at the field  as  with a shrug  he said   ah  les  beaux gars  then swung his sabre and shouted   en avant      then came the imitation of a gunner hanging on his gun as the gun   carriage went bumping over the dead  the sappers and petrole  brigade coming on behind  ready to spray and fire the field  shouting    allez aux enfers  beaux gars de prusse  et y attendre votre kaiser      it was all so humorous that one was shocked into laughter by the  meeting of the comic and the awful  i laughed first and shuddered  afterward  but we do that a great deal these days     i don t think i told you that i had found a wonderful woman to help me  one day in the week in the garden  her name is louise  and she was  born in the commune  and has worked in the fields since she was  nine years old  she is a great character  and she is handsome  very  tall and so straight  thirty three  married  with three children   never  been sick in her life  she is a brave  gay thing  and i simply love to  see her striding along the garden paths  with her head in the air   walking on her long legs and carrying her body as steadily as though  she had a bucket of water on her head  it is beautiful     well  louise has a brother named joseph  as handsome as she is   and bigger  joseph is in the heavy artillery  holding a mountain top in  alsace  and  would you believe it  he has been there twenty months   and has never seen a german     of course  when you think of it  it is not so queer  really  the heavy  artillery is miles behind the infantry  and of course the gunners can t  see what they are firing at  that is the business of the officers and the  eyes of the artillery  the aeroplanes  still  it is queer to think of  firing big guns twenty months and never seeing the targets  odder  still  joseph tells me he has never seen a wounded or a dead  soldier since the war began  put these little facts away to ponder on   it is a war of strange facts           xxiii        april               i have lived through such nerve trying days lately that i rarely feel in  the humor to write a letter     nothing happens here     the spring has been as changeable as even that which new england  knows  we had four fairly heavy snowstorms in the first fortnight of  the awful fighting of verdun  then we had wet  and then unexpected  heat  the sort of weather in which everyone takes cold  i get up in the  morning and dress like a polar bear for a drive  and before i get back  the sun is so hot i feel like stripping     there is nothing for anyone to do but wait for news from the front  it is  the same old story  they are see sawing at verdun  with the germans  much nearer than at the beginning  and still we have the firm faith  that they will never get there  doesn t it seem to prove that had  germany fought an honest war she could never have invaded  france     now  in addition  we ve all this strain of waiting for news from dublin   the affairs of the whole world are in a mess     there are many aspects of the war which would interest you if you  were sitting down on my hilltop with me  conditions which may seem  more significant than they are  for example  the government has  sent back from the front a certain number of men to aid in the farm  work until the planting is done  our commune does not get many of  these  our old men and boys and women do the work fairly well  with  the aid of a few territorials  who guard the railway two hours each  night and work in the fields in the daytime  the women here are used  to doing field work  and don t mind doing more than their usual stunt     i often wonder if some of the women are not better off than in the  days before the war  they do about the same work  only they are not  bothered by their men     in the days before the war the men worked in the fields in the  summer  and in the carriere de platre  at mareuil les meaux  in the  winter  it was a hard life  and most of them drank a little  it is never  the kind of drunkenness you know in america  however  most of them  were radical socialists in politics  which as a rule meant  ag in  the  government   of course  being socialists and french  they simply  had to talk it all over  the cafe was the proper place to do that  the  provincial cafe being the workingman s club  of course  the man  never dreamed of quitting until legal closing hour  and when he got  home  if wife objected  why he just hit her a clip   it was  of course  for  her good    a woman  a dog  and a walnut tree    you know the  adage     almost always in these provincial towns it is the woman who is thrifty   and often she sees but too little of her man s earnings  still  she is  in  her way  fond of him  tenacious in her possession of him  and  sundays and fete days they get on together very handsomely     all the women here  married or not  have always worked  and worked  hard  the habit has settled on them  few of them actually expect their  husbands to support them  and they do not feel degraded because  their labor helps  and they are wonderfully saving  they spend almost  nothing on their clothes  never wear a hat  and usually treasure  for  years  one black dress to wear to funerals  the children go to school  bareheaded  in black pinafores  it is rare that the humblest of these  women has not money put aside     you don t have to look very deep into the present situation to discover  that  psychologically  it is queer  marriage is  after all  in so many  classes  a habit  here are the women of the class to which i refer  working very little harder than in the days before the war  only  for  nearly two years they have had no drinking man to come home at  midnight either quarrelsome or sulky  no man s big appetite to cook  for  no man to wash for or to mend for  they have lived in absolute  peace  gone to bed early to a long  unbroken sleep  and get twenty   five cents a day government aid  plus ten cents for each child  as  they all raise their own vegetables  keep chickens and rabbits  and  often a goat  manage to have a little to take to market  and a little time  every week to work for other people  and get war prices for their  time   well  i imagine you can work out the problem yourself      mind you  there is not one of these women  who  in her way  will not  assure you that she loves her husband  she would be drawn and  quartered before she would harm him  if anything happens to him she  will weep bitterly  but  under my breath  i can assure you that there is  many a woman of that class a widow today who is better off for it  and  so are her children  the husband who died  en hero   the father dead  for his country  is a finer figure in the family life than the living man  ever was or could have been     of course  it is in the middle classes  where the wives have to be  kept  where marriage is less a partnership than in the working classes  and among the humbler commercial classes  that there is so much  suffering  but that is the class which invariably suffers most in any  disaster     i do not know how characteristic of the race the qualities i find among  these people are  nor can i  for lack of experience  be sure in what  degree they are absolutely different from those of any class in the  states  for example  this craving to own one s home  almost no one  here pays rent  there is a lad at the foot of the hill  in voisins  who  was married just before the war  he has a tiny house of two rooms  and kitchen which he bought just before his marriage for the sum of  one hundred and fifty francs  less than thirty dollars  he paid a small  sum down  and the rest at the rate of twenty cents a week  there is a  small piece of land with it  on which he does about as intensive  farming as i ever saw  but it is his own     the woman who works in my garden owns her place  she has been  paying for it almost ever since she was married   sixteen years ago     and has still forty dollars to pay  she cultivates her own garden  raises  her own chickens and rabbits  and always has some to sell  her  husband works in the fields for other people  or in the quarries  and  she considers herself prosperous  as she has been able to keep her  children in school  and owes no one a penny  except  of course  the  sum due on her little place  she has worked since she was nine  but  her children have not  and  when she dies  there will be something for  them  if it is no more than the little place  in all probability  before  that time comes  she will have bought more land  to own ground is  the dream of these people  and they do it in such a strange way     i remember in my girlhood  when i knew the sandy river valley  country so well  that when a farmer wanted to buy more land he  always tried  at no matter what sacrifice  to get a piece adjoining what  he already owned  and put a fence around it  it is different here   people own a piece of land here  and a piece there  and another  piece miles away  and there are no fences     for example  around pere abelard s house there is a fruit garden and  a kitchen garden  the rest of his land is all over the place  he has a  big piece of woodland at pont aux dames  where he was born  and  another on the route de mareuil  he has a field on the route de  couilly  and another on the side of the hill on the route de meaux  and  he has a small patch of fruit trees and a potato field on the chemin  madame  and another big piece of grassland running down the hill  from huiry to conde     almost nothing is fenced in  grain fields  potato patches  beet fields  belonging to different people touch each other without any other  barrier than the white stones  almost level with the soil  put in by the  surveyors     of course they are always in litigation  but  as i told you  a lawsuit is a  cachet of respectability in france     as for separating a french man or woman from the land  it is almost  impossible  the piece of woodland that abelard owns at pont aux  dames is called  le paradis   it is a part of his mother s estate  and  his sister  who lives across the morin  owns the adjoining lot  it is of  no use to anyone  they neither of them ever dream of cutting the  wood  now and then  when we drive  we go and look at it  and pere  tells funny stories of the things he did there when he was a lad  it is  full of game  and not long ago he had an offer for it  the sum was not  big  but invested would have added five hundred francs a year to his  income  but no one could make either him or his sister resolve to part  with it  so there it lies idle  and the only thing it serves for is to add  to the tax bill every year  but they would rather own land than have  money in the bank  land can t run away  they can go and look at it   press their feet on it  and realize that it is theirs     i am afraid the next generation is going to be different  and the  disturbing thing is that it is the women who are changing  so many of  them  who never left the country before  are working in the  ammunition factories and earning unheard of money  and spending it   which is a radical and alarming feature of the situation     you spoke in one of your recent letters of the awful cost of this war in  money  but you must remember that the money is not lost  it is only  redistributed  whether or not the redistribution is a danger is  something none of us can know yet  that is a thing only the future can  show  one thing is certain  it has forcibly liberated women     you ask how the cats are  they are remarkable  khaki gets more  savage every day  and less like what i imagined a house cat ought to  be  he has thrashed every cat in the commune except didine  and  never got a scratch to show for it  but he has never scratched me  i  slapped him the other day  he slapped back   but with a velvet paw   never even showed a claw     didn t you always think a cat hated water  i am sure i did  he goes  out in all weathers  last winter he played in the snow like a child  and  rolled in it  and no rainstorm can keep him in the house  the other  day he insisted on going out in a pouring rain  and i got anxious about  him  finally i went to the door and called him  and  after a while  he  walked out of the dog s kennel  gave me a reproachful look as if to  say   can t you leave a chap in peace   and returned to the kennel   the one thing he really hates is to have me leave the house  he goes  where his sweet will leads him  but he seems to think that i should be  always on the spot               xxiv        may               i begin to believe that we shall have no normal settled weather until  all this cannon play is over  we ve had most unseasonable hailstorms  which have knocked all the buds off the fruit trees  so  in addition to  other annoyances  we shall have no fruit this year     there is nothing new here except that general foch is in the  ambulance at meaux  no one knows it  not a word has appeared in  the newspapers  it was the result of a stupid  but unavoidable   automobile accident  to avoid running over a woman and child on a  road near here  the automobile  in which he was travelling rapidly in  company with his son in law  ran against a tree and smashed  luckily  he was not seriously hurt  though his head got damaged     on thursday poincare passed over our hill  with briand  en route to  meet joffre at the general s bedside  i did not see them  but some of  the people at quincy did  it was a lucky escape for foch  he would  have hated to die during this war of a simple  unmilitary automobile  accident  and the army could ill afford just now to lose one of the  heroes of the marne  carefully as the fact has been concealed  we  knew it here through our ambulance  which is a branch of that at  meaux  where he is being nursed     three months since the battle at verdun began  and it is still going  on  with the germans hardly more than four miles from the city  and  yet it begins to look as if they knew themselves that the battle  the  most terrible the world has ever seen  was a failure  still  i have  changed my mind  i begin to believe that had germany centred all  her forces on that frontier in august        when her first line troops  were available  and their hopes high  she would probably have  passed  no one can know that  but it is likely  and many military men  think so  isn t it a sort of poetic justice to think that it is even  possible that had germany fought an honorable war she might have  got to paris   whom the gods destroy  they first make mad      i do nothing but work in the garden on rare days when it does not  rain  and listen to the cannon  that can t be very interesting stuff to  make a letter of  the silence here  which was so dear to me in the  days when i was preparing the place  still hangs over it  but  oh  the  difference  now and then  in spite of one s self  the very thought of all  that is going on so very near us refuses to take its place and keep in  the perspective  it simply jumps out of the frame of patriotism and the  welfare of the future  then the only thing to do is to hunt for the visible  consolations  and one always finds them     for example  wouldn t it seem logical that such a warfare would  brutalize the men who are actually in it  it doesn t  it seems to have  just the contrary effect  i can t tell you how good the men are to one  another  or how gentle they are to the children  it is strange that it  should be so  but it is  i don t try to understand it  i merely set it down  for you           xxv        june               you can imagine how trying and unseasonable the weather is when i  tell you that i not only had a fire yesterday  but that i went to bed with  a hotwater bottle  imagine it  i have only been able to eat out of doors  once so far     this is not a letter  just a line  lest you worry if you do not hear that i  am well  i am too anxiously watching that see saw at verdun  with the  german army only four miles from the city  at the end of the fourth  month  to talk about myself  and in no position to write about things  which you know  one gets dumb  though not hopeless  to add to our  anxieties the crops are not going to be good  it was continually wet at  planting time  and so cold  and there has been so little sun that  potatoes are rotting in the fields already  and the harvest will be  meagre  the grain  especially that planted last fall  is fairly good  but   as i told you  after the tempest we had  there is to be no fruit  when i  say none  i absolutely mean none  i have not one cherry  louise  counted six prunes on my eight trees  and i have just four pears and  not a single apple  pere s big orchard is in the same condition  in  addition  owing to the terrible dampness   the ground is wet all the  time   the slugs eat up all the salad  spoil all the strawberries  and  chew off every young green thing that puts its head above the  ground  and that in spite of very hard work on my part  every morning  early  and every afternoon  at sundown  i put in an hour s hard work     hard  disgusting work   picking them up with the tongs and dropping  them into boiling water  so you see every kind of war is going on at  the same time  where is the good of wishing a bad harvest on  germany  when we get it ourselves at the same time  however  i  suppose that you in the states can help us out  and england has jolly  well fixed it so that no one can easily help germany out           xxvi        august              well  here we are in the third year of the war  as kitchener foresaw   and still with a long way to go to the frontier     thanks  by the way  for the article about kitchener  after all  what can  one say of such an end for such a man  after such a career  in which  so many times he might have found a soldier s death  then to be  drowned like a rat  doing his duty  it leaves one simply speechless  i  was  you see  i hadn t a comment to throw at you     it s hot at last  i m thankful to say  and equally thankful that the news  from the front is good  it is nothing to throw one s hat in the air about   but every inch in the right direction is at least prophetic     nothing to tell you about  not the smallest thing happens here  i do  nothing but read my paper  fuss in the garden  which looks very  pretty  do up a bundle for my filleul once in a while  write a few letters   and drive about  at sundown  in my perambulator  if that is not an  absurd life for a lady in the war zone in these days  i  d like to know  what it is     i hope this weather will last  it is good for the war and good for the  crops  but i am afraid i shall hope in vain           xxvii        september               this has been the strangest summer i ever knew  there have been  so few really summer days  i could count the hot days on my fingers   none of the things have happened on which i counted     what a disappointment poor russia has been to the big world  which  knew nothing about her except that she could put fifteen millions of  men in the field  however  as we say   all that is only a detail   we are  learning things every day  nothing has opened our eyes more than  seeing set at naught our conviction that  once the rumanian frontier  was opened to the russians  they would be on the danube in no  time     do you remember how glibly we talked of the  russian steam roller    in september        i remember that  at that time  i had a letter from  a very clever chap who told me that  expert military men  looked to  see the final battle on our front  somewhere near waterloo  before the  end of october  and that even  before that  the russian steam roller  would be crushing its way to berlin   how much expert military men  have learned since then     still  wasn t it  in a certain sense  lucky that  in spite of the warning  of kitchener  we did not  in the beginning  realize the road we had  to travel  as i look back on the two years  it all looks to me more  and more remarkable  seen even at this short perspective  that the  allied armies  and most of all  the civilians behind the lines have  in  the face of the hard happenings of each day  stood up  and taken  it as they have  and hoped on     i have got into a mood where it seems simply stupid to talk about it   since i am  as usual  only eternally a spectator  i only long to keep my  eyes raised in a wide arc towards the end  to live each day as i can   and wait  so why should i try to write to you of things which i do not  see  and of which only the last  faint  dying ripples reach us here     you really must not pity me  as you insist upon doing  because  military restrictions draw a line about me  which i may not cross at my  own sweet will  i am used to it  it is not hard  for that matter  it is  much more trying to my french neighbors than it is to me     i seem never to have told you that even they may not leave the  commune without a sauf conduit  to be sure  they have only to go to  the mairie  and ask for it  to get it     for months now the bridge over the marne  at meaux  has been  guarded  and even those going to market cannot cross without  showing their papers  the formality is very trying to them  for the  reason that the mairie opens at eight  and closes at twelve not to  reopen again until three and close at six  you see those hours are  when everyone is busiest in the fields  the man or woman who has to  go to market on saturday must leave work standing and make a long  trip into quincy  and often they have three or four miles to go on foot  to do it  just at the hour when it is least easy to spare the time     to make it harder still  a new order went out a few weeks ago  every  man  woman  and child  over fifteen  in the war zone has to have   after october    a carte d identite  to which must be affixed a  photograph     this regulation has resulted in the queerest of embarrassments  a  great number of these old peasants  and young ones too  never had  a photograph taken  there is no photographer  the photographer at  esbly and the two at meaux could not possibly get the people all  photographed  and  in this uncertain weather  the prints made  in the  delay allowed by the military authorities  a great cry of protestation  went up  photographers of all sorts were sent into the commune  the  town crier beat his drum like mad  and announced the places where  the photographers would be on certain days and hours  and ordered  the people to assemble and be snapped     one of the places chosen was the courtyard at amelie s  and you  would have loved seeing these bronzed old peasants facing a  camera for the first time  some of the results were funny  especially  when the hurried and overworked operator got two faces on the  same negative  as happened several times     real autumn weather is here  but  for that matter  it has been more  like autumn than summer since last spring  the fields are lovely to  see on days when the sun shines  i drove the other day just for the  pleasure of sitting in my perambulator  on the hillside  and looking  over the slope of the wide wheat fields  where the women  in their  cotton jackets and their wide hats  were reaping  the harvesting  never looked so picturesque  i could pick out  in the distance  the tall  figure of my louise  with a sheaf on her head and a sickle in her  hand  striding across the fields  and i thought how a painter would  have loved the scene  with the long rays of the late september  sunset illuminating the yellow stretch     last wednesday we had a little excitement here  because sixteen  german prisoners  who were working on a farm at vareddes   escaped  some of them disguised as women     i wasn t a bit alarmed  as it hardly seemed possible that they would  venture near houses in this district  but pere was very nervous  and  every time the dog barked he was out in the road to make sure that i  was all right     oddly enough  it happened on the very day when two hundred  arrived at meaux to work in the sugar refinery  the next day there  was a regular battue  as the gendarmes beat up the fields and woods  in search of the fugitives     if they caught them  they don t tell  but we have been ordered to  harbor no strangers under a severe penalty  but that condition has  really existed since the war broke out  as no one is even allowed to  engage a workman whose papers have not been vise at the mairie     i have had to have a wood fire today  it is alarming  with winter  ahead  and so little fuel  to have to begin heating up at the end of  september  three weeks or a month earlier than usual           xxviii        november               it is raining   a cold and steady downpour  i don t feel in the least like  writing a letter  this is only to tell you that i have got enough  anthracite coal to go to the end of february  and that the house is  warm and cosy  and i am duly thankful to face this third war winter  free from fear of freezing  it cost thirty two dollars a ton  how does  that sound to you     i have planted my tulip bulbs  cleaned up the garden for winter and  settled down to life inside my walls  with my courage in both hands   and the hope that next spring s offensive will not be a great  disappointment     in the meantime i am sorry that franz josef did not live to see this  war of his out and take his punishment  i used to be so sorry for him  in the old days  when it seemed as if fate showered disasters on the  heads of the hapsburgs  i wasted my pity  the blows killed everyone  in the family but father  the way he stood it and never learned to be  kind or wise proved how little he needed pity     all the signs say a cold winter  how i envy hibernating animals  i want  to live to see this thing out  but it would be nice to crawl into a hole   like a bear  and sleep comfortably until the sun came out in the  spring  and the seeds began to sprout  and the army was thawed out   and could move  in the silence on this hilltop  where nothing happens  but dishwashing and bedmaking and darning stockings  it is a long  way to springtime  even if it comes early     i amused myself last week by defying the consign  i had not seen a  gendarme on the road for weeks  i had driven to couilly once or  twice  though to do it i had to cross  the dead line   i had met the  garde champetre there  and even talked to him  and he had said  nothing  so  hearing one day that my friend from voulangis had a  permission to drive to the train at esbly  and that she was returning  about nine in the morning  i determined to meet her on the road  and  at least see how she was looking and have a little chat  i felt a longing  to hear someone say   hulloa  you    just a few words in english     so if you could have seen the road  just outside of couilly  thursday  morning  just after nine  you would have seen a southern girl sitting in  a high cart facing east  and an elderly lady in a donkey cart facing  west  and the two of them watching the road ahead for the coming of  a bicycle pedalled by a gendarme with a gun on his back  as they  talked like magpies  it was all so funny that i was convulsed with  laughter  there we were  two innocent  harmless american women   talking of our family affairs and our gardens  our fuel  our health  and  behaving like a pair of conspirators  we didn t dare to get out to  embrace each other  for fear  in case we saw a challenge coming    that i could not scramble back and get away quickly enough  and we  only stayed a quarter of an hour  we might just as well have carried  our lunch and spent the day so far as i could see  only if anyone had  passed and had asked for our papers there would have been trouble   however  we had our laugh  and decided that it was not worth while  to risk it again  but i could not help asking myself how  with all their  red tape  they ever caught any real suspect     do you remember that i told you some time ago about louise s  brother  joseph  in the heavy artillery  who had never seen a boche   well  he is at home again for his eight days  he came to see me  yesterday  i said to him   well  joseph  where did you come from this  time       from the same place  the mountains in alsace  we ve not budged  for nearly two years       how long are you going to stay there       to the end of the war  i imagine       but why   i asked      what can we do  madame   he replied   there we are  on the top of  a mountain  we can t get down  the germans can t get up  they are  across the valley on the top of a hill in the same fix       but what do you do up there   i demanded      well   he replied   we watch the germans  or at least the aeroplanes  do  we can t see them  they work on their defenses  they pull up  new guns and shift their emplacements  we let them work  then our  big guns destroy their work       but what do they do  joseph       well  they fire a few shots  and go to work again  but i ll tell you  something  madame  as sure as that we are both living  they would  not do a thing if we would only leave them in peace   but we don t       well  joseph   i asked   have you seen a boche yet       oh  yes  madame  i ve seen them  i see them  with a glass  working  in the fields  ploughing  and getting ready to plant them       and you don t do anything to prevent them       well  no  we can t very well  they always have a group of women  and children with every gang of workmen  they know  only too well   that french guns will not fire at that kind of target  it is just the same  with their commissary trains  always women at the head  in the  middle  and in the rear      comment is unnecessary           xxix        december              well  at last  the atmosphere on the hilltop is all changed  we have a  cantonnement de regiment again  and this time the most interesting  that we have ever had   the   d dragoons  men on active service   who are doing infantry work in the trenches at tracy le val  in the  foret de laigue  the nearest point to paris  in the battle front     it is  as usual  only the decorative and picturesque side of war  but it  is tremendously interesting  more so than anything which has  happened since the battle of the marne     as you never had soldiers quartered on you  and perhaps you never  will have  i wish you were here now     it was just after lunch on sunday  a grey  cold day  which had  dawned on a world covered with frost  that there came a knock at the  salon door  i opened it  and there stood a soldier  with his heels  together  and his hand at salute  who said   bon jour  madame  avez   vous un lit pour un soldat      of course i had a bed for a soldier  and said so at once     you see it is all polite and formal  but if there is a corner in the house  which can serve the army the army has a right to it  everyone is  offered the privilege of being prettily gracious about it  and of letting  it appear as if a favor were being extended to the army  but  in case  one does not yield willingly  along comes a superior officer and  imposes a guest on the house     however  that sort of thing never happens here  in our commune the  soldiers are loved  the army is  for that matter  loved all over france   no matter what else may be conspue  the crowd never fails to cry   vive l armee   although there are places where the soldier is not  loved as a visitor     i asked the adjutant in  and showed him the room  he wrote it down  in his book  saluted me again with a smiling   merci bien  madame    and went on to make the rounds of the hamlet  and examine the  resources of voisins  joncheroy  and quincy     the noncommissioned officers  who arrange the cantonnements  are  very clever about it  they seem to know  by instinct  just what sort of  a man to put in each house  and they rarely blunder     all that sunday afternoon they were running around in the mud and  the cold drizzle that was beginning to fall  arranging  not only quarters  for the men  but finding shelter for three times as many horses  and  that was not easy  although every old grange on the hilltop was  cleaned out and put in order     for half an hour the adjutant tried to convince himself that he could  put four horses in the old grange on the north side of my house  i was  perfectly willing  only i knew that if one horse kicked once  the floor of  the loft would fall on him  and that if four horses kicked once  at least  three walls would fall in on them  that would not be so very important  to me  but i d hate to have handsome army horses killed like that on  my premises     he finally decided that i was right  and then i went with him up to  amelie s to see what we could do  i never realized what a ruin of a  hamlet this is until that afternoon  by putting seven horses in the old  grange at pere s   a tumble down old shack  where he keeps lumber  and dead farm wagons   he never throws away or destroys anything    we finally found places for all the horses  there were eleven at  pere s  and it took amelie and pere all the rest of the afternoon to run  the stuff out of the old grange  which stands just at the turn of the  road  and has a huge broken door facing down the hill     i often mean to send you a picture of that group of ruins  there are  five buildings in it  they were originally all joined together  but some of  them have had to be pulled down because they got too dangerous to  stand  and in the open spaces there is  in one place  a pavement of  red tiles  and in another the roof to a cellar  with stone steps leading  up to it  not a bit of it is of any use to anyone  though the cellars  under them are used to store vegetables  and amelie keeps rabbits  in one     it was while we were arranging all this  and amelie was assuring them  that they were welcome  but that she would not guarantee that the  whole group of ruins would not fall on their heads  and everything  was as gay as if we were arranging a week end picnic rather than a  shelter for soldiers right out of the trenches   that the adjutant  explained how it happened that  in the third year of the war  the  fighting regiments were  for the first time  retiring as far as our  hill for their repos     he told us that almost all the cavalry had been dismounted to do  infantry work in the trenches  but their horses were stalled in the rear   it had been found that the horses were an embarrassment so near to  the battle front  and so it had been decided to retire them further  behind the line  and send out part of the men to keep them exercised  and in condition  giving the men in turn three weeks in the trenches  and three weeks out     they had first withdrawn the horses to nanteuil le haudrouin a little  northwest of us  about halfway between us and the trenches in the  foret de laigue  but that cantonnement had not been satisfactory  so  they had retired here     by sundown everything was arranged  four hundred horses along the  hilltop  and  they tell us  over fifteen thousand along the valley  we  were told that the men were leaving nanteuil the next morning  and  would arrive during the afternoon     it was just dusk on monday when they began riding up the hill  each  mounted man leading two riderless horses     it was just after they passed that there came a knock at the salon  door     i opened it with some curiosity  when you are to lodge a soldier in a  house as intimately arranged as this one is  i defy anyone not to be  curious as to what the lodger is to be like     there stood a tall  straight lad  booted and spurred  with a crop in one  gloved hand  and the other raised to his fatigue cap in salute  and a  smile on his bonny face   as trig in his leather belted bleu de ciel tunic  as if ready for parade  and not a sign of war about him but his  uniform      bon jour  madame  he said   permit me to introduce myself  aspirant  b          d dragoons       regular army   i said  for i knew by the look of him that this was a  professional soldier      st  cyr   he replied  that is the same as our west point      you are welcome  aspirant   i said   let me show you to your room       thank you   he smiled   not yet  i only came to present myself  and  thank you in advance for your courtesy  i am in command of the  squad on your hill  replacing an officer who is not yet out of the  hospital  i must see my men housed and the horses under shelter   may i ask you  if my orderly comes with my kit  to show him where to  put it  and explain to him how he may best get in and out of the  house  when necessary  without disturbing your habits      i had to laugh as i explained to him that locking up  when soldiers  were in the hamlet  was hardly even a formality  and that the orderly  could come and go at his will      good   he replied   then i ll give myself the pleasure of seeing you  after dinner  i hope i shall in no way disturb you  i am always in before  nine   and he saluted again  backed away from the door  and  marched up the hill  he literally neither walked nor ran  he marched     i wish i could give you an idea of what he looks like  at first sight i  gave him nineteen years at the outside  in spite of his height and his  soldierly bearing and his dignity     before he came in at half past eight his orderly had brought his kit   unpacked and made himself familiar with the lay of the house  and  made friends with amelie  so the aspirant settled into an armchair in  front of the fire  having asked my permission  to chat a bit  and  account for himself  and it was evident to me that he had already  been asking questions regarding me  spurred  as usual  by the  surprise of finding an american here  as the officers  mess is at the  foot of the hill  at voisins  that had been easy     so  knowing intuitively  just by his manner and his words  that he had  asked questions about me  he even knew that i had been here from  the beginning of the war  i  with the privilege of my white hairs  asked  him even how old he was  he told me he was twenty  a year older  than i thought  that he was an only son  that his father was an officer  in the reserves and they lived about forty five miles the other side of  rheims  that his home was in the hands of the germans  and the  house  which had been literally stripped of everything of value  was  the headquarters of a staff officer  and it was all told so quietly  so  simply  with no sign of emotion of any sort     at exactly nine o clock he rose to his feet  clicked his heels together   made me a drawing room bow  of the best form  as he said   eh   bien  madame  je vous quitte  bon soir et bonne nuit   then he  backed to the foot of the stairs  bowed again  turned and went up  lightly on the toes of his heavy boots  and i never heard another  sound of him     of course in twenty four hours he became the child of the house  i  feel like a grandmother to him  as for amelie  she falls over herself  trying to spoil him  and before the second day he became  monsieur  andre  to her  catch her giving a boy like that his military title  though  he takes his duties most seriously     the weather is dreadful  cold  damp  drizzly  but he is in and out  and  the busiest person you can imagine  there isn t a horse that has to  have his feet washed that he isn t on the spot to see it done properly   there isn t a man who has a pain that he isn t after him to see if he  needs the doctor   and i don t need to tell you that his men love him   and so do the horses     i am taking a full course in military habits  military duties  and military  etiquette  i smile inside myself sometimes and wonder how they can  keep it up during these war times  but they do     this morning he came down at half past seven ready to lead his  squad on an exercise ride  i must tell you that the soldier who comes  downstairs in the morning  in his big coat and kepi  ready to mount his  horse  is a different person from the smiling boy who makes me a  ballroom bow at the foot of the stairs in the evening  he comes down  the stairs as stiff as a ramrod  lifts his gloved hand to his kepi  as he  says   bon jour  madame  vous allez bien ce matin      this morning i remarked to him as he was ready to mount   well   young man  i advise you to turn up your collar  the air is biting      he gave me a queer look as he replied   merci   pas reglementaire      but he had to laugh  as he shook his head at me  and marched out to  his horse     you do not need to be told how all this changes our life here  and yet  it does not bring into it the sort of emotion i anticipated  thus far i  have not heard the war mentioned  the tramping of horses  the  moving crowd of men  simply give a new look to our quiet hamlet     this cantonnement is officially called a  repos  but seems little like  that to me  it seems simply a change of work  every man has three  horses to groom  to feed  to exercise  three sets of harness to keep in  order  stables to clean  but they are all so gay and happy  and as this  is the first time in eighteen months that any of them have  slept in  beds they are enjoying it     of course  i have little privacy  you know how my house is laid out    the front door opens into the salon  and the staircase is there also   when the aspirant is not on duty outside he has to be here where he  can be found  so he sits at the salon desk to do his writing and fix up  his papers and reports  and when he is not going up and down stairs  his orderly is  there seems always to be a cleaning of boots  brushing  of coats  and polishing of spurs and rubbing up of leather going on  somewhere     it did not take the men long to discover that there was always hot  water in my kitchen  and that they were welcome to it if they would  keep the kettles filled  and that i did not mind their coming and going    and i don t  for a nicer crowd of men i never saw  they are not only  ready  they are anxious  to do all sorts of odd jobs  from hauling coal  and putting it in  to cleaning the chimneys and sweeping the terrace   when they groom the horses they always groom gamin  our dapple   grey pony  and ninette  which were never so well taken care of in  their lives  so brushed and clipped that they are both handsomer than  i knew  though the regiment has only been here three days every  day has had its special excitement     the morning after they got here we had a royal ten minutes of  laughter and movement     in the old grange at the top of the hill  where they stabled seven  horses  there had been a long bar across the back wall  fixed with  cement into the side walls  and used to fasten the wagons  they  found it just right to tie the horses  it was a fine morning  for a wonder   the sun was shining  and all the barn doors were open to it  the  aspirant and i were standing on the lawn just before noon  he had  returned from his morning ride  looking across the marne at the  battlefield  the regiment had been in the battle   but he was  at that  time  still at st  cyr  suddenly we heard a great rumpus behind us   and turned just in season to see all the horses trotting out of the  grange  they wheeled out of the wide door in a line headed down the  hill  the last two carrying the bar to which they had been attached  like  the pole of a carriage  between them  they were all  feeling their  oats   and they thundered down the hill by us  like a cavalry charge   and behind them came half a dozen men simply splitting with  laughter     amelie had been perfectly right  the old grange was not solid  but  they had not pulled the walls down on themselves  they had simply  pulled the pole to which they were attached out of its bed     the aspirant tried not to smile  an officer in command must not  i  suppose  even if he is only twenty  he whistled gently  put up his  hand to stop the men from running  and walked quietly into the road   still whistling  five of the horses  tossing their heads  were thundering  on towards the canal  the span  dragging the long pole  swerved on  the turn  and swung the pole  which was so long that it caught on the  bank  i expected to see them tangle themselves all up  what with the  pole and the halters  not a bit of it  they stopped  panting  and still  trying to toss their heads  and the aspirant quietly picked up a halter   and passed the horses over to the men  saying  in a most nonchalant  manner   fasten that pole more securely  some of you go quietly  down the hill  you ll meet them coming back   and he returned to the  garden  and resumed the conversation just where it had been  interrupted     it had been a lively picture to me  but to the soldiers  i suppose  it had  only been an every day s occurrence     my only fear had been that there might be children or a wagon on the  winding road  luckily the way was clear     an hour later  the men returned  leading the horses  they had  galloped down to the river  and returned by way of voisins  where  they had stopped right in front of the house where the captain was  quartered  and the captain had been in the garden and seen them     this time the aspirant had to laugh  he slapped one of the horses  caressingly on the nose as he said   you devils  couldn t you go on a  lark without telling the captain about it  and getting us all into  trouble      to make this all the funnier  that very night three horses stabled in a  rickety barn at voisins  kicked their door down  and pranced and  neighed under the captain s bedroom window     the captain is a nice chap  but he is not in his first youth  and he is  tired  and  well  he is a bit nervous  he said little  but that was to the  point  it was only   you boys will see that these things don t happen   or you will sleep in the straw behind your horses      this is the first time that i have seen anything of the military  organization  and i am filled with admiration for it  i don t know how it  works behind the trenches  but here  in the cantonnement  i could set  my clocks by the soup wagon  a neat little cart  drawn by two sturdy  little horses  which takes the hill at a fine gallop  and passes my gate  at exactly twenty five minutes past eleven  and twenty five minutes  past five every day  the men wait  with their gamelles  at the top of  the hill  the soup looks good and smells delicious  amelie says that it  tastes good  she has five soldiers in her house  and she and pere  often eat with them  so she knows     from all this you can guess what my life is like  and probably will be  like until the impatiently awaited spring offensive  but what you will  find it hard to imagine is the spirit and gaiety of these men  it is hard  to believe that they have been supporting the monotony of trench life  for so long  and living under bombardment   and cavalry at that   trained and hoping for another kind of warfare  there is no sign of it  on them           xxx        december               well  we did not keep our first division of dragoons as long as we  expected  they had passed part of their three weeks out of the  trenches at nanteuil  and on the journey  so it seemed to us as  though they were hardly settled down when the order came for them  to return  they were here only a little over a week     i had hardly got accustomed to seeing the aspirant about the house   either writing  with the cat on his knees  or reading  with dick sitting  beside him  begging to have his head patted  when one evening he  came in  and said quietly   well  madame  we are leaving you in a  day or two  the order for the releve has come  but the day and hour  are not yet fixed      but during the week he was here i got accustomed to seeing him sit  before the fire every evening after dinner for a little chat before  turning in  he was more ready to talk politics than war  and full of  curiosity about  your mr  wilson   as he called him  now and then he  talked military matters  but it was technique  and the strategy of war   not the events  he is an enthusiastic soldier  and to him  of course   the cavalry is still  la plus belle arme de france   he loved to explain  the use of cavalry in modern warfare  of what it was yet to do in the  offensive  armed as it is today with the same weapons as the infantry   carrying carbines  having its hand grenade divisions  its mitrailleuses   ready to go into action as cavalry  arriving like a flash au galop  over  ground where the infantry must move slowly  and with difficulty  and  ready at any time to dismount and fight on foot  to finish a pursuit  begun as cavalry  it all sounded very logical as he described it     he had been under bombardment  been on dangerous scouting  expeditions  but never yet in a charge  which is  of course  his  ambitious dream  there was an expression of real regret in his voice  when he said one evening   helas  i have not yet had the smallest  real opportunity to distinguish myself      i reminded him that he was still very young     he looked at me quite indignantly as he replied   madame forgets that  there are aspirants no older than i whose names are already  inscribed on the roll of honor      you see an elderly lady  unused to a soldier s point of view  may be  very sympathetic  and yet blunder as a comforter     the releve passed off quietly  it was all in the routine of the soldiers   lives  they did not even know that it was picturesque  it was late last  friday night that an orderly brought the news that the order had come  to move on the morning of the eleventh  three days later   and it was  not until the night of the fifteenth that we were again settled down to  quiet     the squad we had here moved in two divisions  early monday  morning  the eleventh  the horses were being saddled  and at ten  o clock they began to move  one half of them were in full equipment   the other half acted as an escort as far as meaux  from which place  they led back the riderless horses     the officers explained it all to me  the division starting that day for the  trenches dismounted at meaux  and took a train for the station  nearest to the foret de laigue  there they had their hot soup and  waited for night  to march into the trenches under cover of the  darkness  they told me that it was not a long march  but it was a hard  one  as it was up hill  over wet and clayey ground  where it was  difficult not to slip back as fast as they advanced     on arriving at the trenches they would find the men they were to  relieve ready to march out  to slip and slide down the hill to the  railway  where they would have their morning coffee  and await the  train for meaux  where they were due at noon next day  barring  delays     so  on the afternoon of the twelfth  the men who had acted as escort  the day before led the horses to meaux  and just before four o clock  the whole body arrived on the hill     this time i saw men right out of the trenches  they were a sorry sight   in spite of their high spirits  the clayey yellow mud of three weeks   exposure in the trenches was plastered on them so thick that i  wondered how they managed to mount their horses  i never saw a  dirtier crowd  their faces even looked stiff     they simply tumbled off their horses  left the escort to stable them   and made a dash for the bath house  which is at the foot of the hill  at  joncheroy  if they can t get bathed  disinfected  and changed before  dark  they have to sleep their first night in the straw with the horses   as they are unfit  in more ways than i like to tell you  to go into  anyone s house until that is done  and they are not allowed     these new arrivals had twenty four hours  rest  and then  on  thursday  they acted as escort to the second division  and with that  division went the aspirant  and the men they relieved arrived friday  afternoon  and now we are settled down for three weeks     before the aspirant left he introduced into the house the senior  lieutenant  whom he had been replacing in the command on my hill  a  man a little over thirty  a business man in private life and altogether  charming  very cultivated  a book lover and an art connoisseur  he is  a nephew of lepine  so many years prefet de police at paris  and a  cousin of senator reynault  who was killed in his aeroplane at toule   famous not only as a brave patriot  but as a volunteer for three  reasons exempt from active service  a senator  a doctor  and past  the age     i begin to believe  on the testimony of my personal experiences  that  all the officers in the cavalry are perfect gentlemen  the lieutenant  settled into his place at once  he puts the coal on the fire at night  he  plays with the animals  he locks up  and is as quiet as a mouse and  as busy as a bee     this is all my news  except that i am hoping to go to paris for  christmas  and to go by the way of voulangis  it is all very uncertain   my permission has not come yet     it is over a year since we were shut in  my friends in paris call me  their permissionaire  when i go to town  in the few shops where i am  known everyone laughs when i make my rare appearances and  greets me with   ah  so they ve let you out again   as if it were a huge  joke  and i assure you that it does seem like that to me     the soldiers in the trenches get eight days  permission every four  months  i don t seem to get much more   if as much           xxxi        january               i went to paris  as i told you i hoped to do  nothing new there  in spite  of the fact that  in many ways  they are beginning to feel the war  and  there is altogether too much talk about things no one can really know  anything about  i was still amazed at the gaiety  in a way it is just now  largely due to the great number of men en permission  the streets   the restaurants  the tea rooms are full of them  and so  they tell me   are the theatres     do you know what struck me most forcibly  you ll never guess  it was  that men in long trousers look perfectly absurd  i am so used to  seeing the culotte and gaiters that the best looking pantaloons i saw  on the boulevards looked ugly and ridiculous     i left the officer billeted in my house to take care of it  the last i saw  of him he was sitting at the desk in the salon  his pipe in his mouth   looking comfortable and cosy  and as if settled for life  i only stayed a  few days  and came home  on new year s eve  to find that he had  left the night before  having been suddenly transferred to the staff of  the commander of the first army  as officier de la liaison  and i had in  his place a young sous officier of twenty two  who proves to be a  cousin of the famous french spy  captain luxe  who made that  sensational escape  in       from a supposed to be impregnable  german military prison  i am sure you remember the incident  as the  american papers devoted columns to his unprecedented feat  the  hero of that sensational episode is still in the army  i wonder what the  germans will do with him if they catch him again  they are hardly  likely to get him alive a second time     i wonder if the german books on military tactics use that escape as a  model in their military schools  do you know that in every french  military school the reconnaisance which count zeppelin made in  alsace  in the days of       when he was a cavalry officer  is given  as a model reconnaissance both for strategy and pluck  i did not   until i was told  oddly enough  not all that zeppelin has done since to  offend french ideas of decency in war can dull the admiration felt by  every cavalry officer for his clever feat in          last thursday   that was the  th   we had our second releve     the night before they left some of the officers came to say au revoir   and to tell me that the aspirant  who had been with me in december   would be quartered on me again  if i wanted him  of course i did     then the senior lieutenant told me that the regiment had suffered  somewhat from a serious bombardment the days after christmas   that the aspirant had not only shown wonderful courage  but had had  a narrow escape  and had been cite a l ordre du jour  and was to  have his first decoration     we all felt as proud of him as if he belonged to us  i was told that he  had been sent into the first line trenches  only two hundred yards  from the german front  during the bombardment   to encourage and  comfort his men   i quote   and that a bomb had exploded over the  trench and knocked a hole in his steel helmet     i don t know which impressed me most  the idea of a lad of twenty  having so established the faith in his courage amongst his superior  officers as to be safe as a comfort and encouragement for the men   or the fact that  if the army had had those steel casques at the  beginning of the war  many lives would have been saved     the aspirant came in with the second detachment the night before  last  the eighth  the regiment was in and all quartered before he  appeared     we had begun to fear something had happened to him  when he  turned up  freshly shaved and clean  but with a tattered overcoat on  his arm  and a battered helmet in his hand     amelie greeted him with   well  young man  we thought you were  lost      he laughed  as he explained that he had been to make a toilet  see  the regimental tailor  and order a new topcoat      i would not  for anything in the world  have had madame see me in  the state i was in an hour ago  she has to see my rags  but i spared  her the dirt   and he held up the coat to show its rudely sewed up  rents  and turned over his helmet to show the hole in the top      and here is what hit me   and he took out of his pocket a rough  piece of a shell  and held it up  as if it were very precious  indeed  he  had it wrapped in a clean envelope  all ready to take up to paris and  show his mother  as he is to have his leave of a week while he is  here     i felt like saying  don t   but i didn t  i suppose it is hard for an  ambitious soldier of twenty to realize that the mother of an only son   and that son such a boy as this  must have some feeling besides  pride in her heart as she looks at him     so now we are settled again  and used to the trotting of horses  the  banging of grenades and splitting of mitrailleuses  from the window  as i write  i am up in the attic  which amelie calls the  atelier    because it is in the top of the house and has a tiny north light in the  roof  that being the only place where i am sure of being undisturbed    i can see horses being trained in the wide field on the side of the hill  between here and quincy  they are manoeuvring with all sorts of  noises about them  even racing in a circle while grenades and guns  are fired     in spite of all that  there came near being a lovely accident right in  front of the gate half an hour ago     the threshing machine is at work in front of the old grange on the  other side of the road  just above my house  the men had come  back from breakfast  and were starting the machine up just as two  mounted soldiers  each leading two horses  rode out of the grange at  amelie s  and started down the hill at a trot  the very moment the  horses were turning out to pass the machine   and the space was  barely sufficient between the machine and the bank  a heedless man  blew three awful blasts on his steam whistle to call his aids  the  cavalry horses were used to guns  and the shrill mouth whistles of the  officers  but that did not make them immune to a steam siren  and in  a moment there was the most dangerous mix up i ever saw  i  expected to see both riders killed  and i don t know now why they  were not  but neither man was thrown  even in spite of having three  frightened horses to master     it was a stupid thing for the man on the machine to do  he would  have only had to wait one minute and the horses would have been by  with a clear road before them if they shied  but he  didn t think   the  odd thing was that the soldiers did not say an ugly word  i suppose  they are used to worse     you have been reproaching me for over a year that i did not write  enough about the war  i do hope that all this movement about me  interests you  it is not war by any means  but the nearest relation to it  that i have seen in that time  it is its movements  its noise  its clothes   it is gay and brave  and these men are no  chocolate soldiers            xxxii        january               my  but it is cold here  wednesday the   th it was    below zero  and  this morning at ten o clock it was   below  of course this is in  centigrade and not fahrenheit  but it is a cold from which i suffer  more  it is so damp  than i ever did from the dry  sunny  below zero  as you know it in the states  not since      have i seen such cold as  this in france  i have seen many a winter here when the ground has  hardly frozen at all  this year it began to freeze a fortnight ago  it  began to snow on the   th  a fine dry snow  and as the ground was  frozen it promises to stay on  it has so far  in spite of the fact that  once or twice since it fell the sun has shone  it looks very pretty  quite  unnatural  very reminiscent of new england     it makes life hard for us as well as the soldiers  but they laugh and  say   we have seen worse   they prefer it to rain and mud  but it  makes roading hard  everything is so slippery  and if you ever  happened to see a french horse or a french person  walking on ice   i don t need to say more     well  the unexpected has happened  the cavalry has moved on   they expected  as much as a soldier ever expects anything  to have  divided their time until march between our hill and the trenches in the  foret de laigue  but on the twenty second orders began to rush in  from headquarters  announcing a change of plan  a move was  ordered and counter ordered every few hours for three days  until  thursday afternoon  the twenty fifth  the final order came  the whole  division to be ready to mount at seven thirty the next morning  orders  for the direction to come during the night     you never saw such a rushing about to collect clothes and get them  dried  you see it has been very hard to get washing done  the morin   where the wash houses are  is frozen  and even when things are  washed  they won t dry in this air  and there is no coal to heat the  drying houses     however  it was done after a fashion  everyone who had wood kept a  fire up all night     on wednesday afternoon i had a little tea party for some of the sous   officiers  mere boys  a simple goodbye spread of bread and butter  and dry cookies   nothing else to be had  i could not even make  cake  as we have had no fine sugar for months  however  the tea  was extra good  sent me from california for christmas  and i set the  table with all my prettiest things  and the boys seemed to enjoy  themselves     they told me before leaving that never since they were at the front  had they been anywhere so well received or so comfortable as they  have been here  and that it would be a long time before they  forgot  huiry   well  we on our side can say that we never dreamed that a  conscript army could have a whole regiment of such fine men  so you  see we are all very much pleased with each other  and if the   d  dragoons are not going to forget us  we are as little likely to forget  them     thursday evening  before going to bed  the aspirant and i sat at the  kitchen table and made a lot of sandwiches  as they are carrying  three days  provisions  they expected a five hours  march on the first  day  and a night under the tents  then another day s march  during  which they would receive their orders for their destination  when the  sandwiches were done  and wrapped up ready for his orderly to put in  the saddlebags  with his other provisions  he said   well  i am going  to say goodbye to you tonight  and thank you for all your kindness       not at all   i answered   i shall be up in the morning to see you start      he protested  it was so cold  so early  etc  but my mind was made  up     i assure you that it was cold      below   but i got up when i heard  the orderly arrive in the morning  i had been awake for hours  for at  three o clock the horses were being prepared  every man had three  to feed and saddle  and pack  orderlies were running about doing the  last packing for the officers  and carrying kits to the baggage wagons   amelie came at six  when i got downstairs i found the house warm  and coffee ready  the aspirant was taking his standing  it was more  convenient than sitting in a chair  indeed  i doubt if he could have sat     i had to laugh at the picture he made  i never regretted so much that i  have not indulged in a camera  he was top booted and spurred  he  had on his new topcoat and his mended helmet  catch a young  soldier who has been hit on the head by his first obus having a new  and unscarred one  he was hung over with his outfit like a santa  claus  i swore he could never get into the saddle  but he scorned my  doubts     to the leather belt about his waist  supported by two straps over his  shoulders  were attached his revolver  in its case with twenty rounds  of cartridges  his field glasses  his map case  his bidon  for his wine   square document case  his mask against asphyxiating gas  and  if  you please  his kodak  over one shoulder hung a flat  half circular  bag  with his toilet articles  over the other its mate  with a change  and  a few necessary articles     he looked to me as if he would ride two hundred pounds heavy  and  he hasn t an ounce of extra flesh on him     i laughed even harder when i saw him mounted  in one side of the  holster was his gamelle  in the other  ammunition  the saddlebags  contained on one side twenty pounds of oats for the horse  on the  other three days  provisions for himself  i knew partly what was in that  bag  and it was every bit as heavy as the horse s fodder  for there  were sandwiches  sugar  coffee  chocolate  tinned meat  peas  corn   fruit  etc  behind the saddle was rolled his blanket  inside his section  of tent cover   it takes six of them to make a real tent  they are  arranged to button together     i was sitting in the bedroom window when he rode on to the terrace  i  had to laugh as i looked down at him      and why does madame laugh   he asked  trying to keep a sober  face himself      well   i replied   i am only wondering if that is your battle array       certainly   he answered   why does it surprise you      i looked as serious as i could  as i explained that i had supposed   naturally  that the cavalry went into action as lightly equipped as  possible     he looked really indignant  as he snapped   that would be quite  unnatural  what do you suppose that peppino and i are going to do  after a battle  wait for the commissary department to find us  no   madame  after a battle it will not be of my mother nor home  nor even  of you  that we will be thinking  we shall think of something to eat and  drink   then he added  with a laugh   alas  we shan t have all these  nice things you have given us  they will have been eaten by  tomorrow      i apologized  and said i d know better another time  and he patted his  horse  as he backed away  and said to him   salute the lady   peppino  and tell her prettily that you had the honor of carrying teddy  roosevelt the day he went to the review   and the horse pawed and  bowed and neighed  and his rider wheeled him carefully as he saluted  and said   au revoir  i shall write  and  after the war  i shall give  myself the pleasure of seeing you   and he rode carefully out of the  gate  a very delicate operation  as only half of it was open  laden  as the horse was  he just made it  and away he galloped down the  hill to voisins  where the cavalry was assembling     i stayed in the window a few minutes to wave a goodbye to the men  as they led each their three horses down the hill  then i put on my  heaviest coat  a polo cap  all my furs and mittens  thrust my felt shoes  into my sabots  and with one hand in my muff  i took the big french  flag in the other and went through the snow down to the hedge to  watch the regiment pass  on the road to esbly     even before i got out of the house the news came that the    th  regiment of infantry  the boys who retook vaux in the great battle at  verdun  had been marching in from meaux  and were camped   waiting to take up the billets the   d dragoons were vacating     i stood in the snow for nearly half an hour  holding up the heavy flag   which flapped bravely in the icy wind  and watching the long grey line  moving slowly along the road below  i could see half a mile of the line    grey  steel helmeted men  packed horses  grey wagons  winding  down the hill in the winter landscape  so different from the france i  had always known  hardly a sound came back  no music  no colors    the long  grey column moved in a silent  almost colorless world  i  shifted the heavy flag from one hand to the other as my fingers got  stiff  but  alas  i could not shift my feet  long before the line had  passed i was forced to fasten the flag to a post in the hedge and  leave it to float by itself  and limp into the house  as a volunteer color   bearer i was a failure  i had to let amelie take off my shoes and rub  my feet  and i had hard work not to cry while she was doing it  i was  humiliated  especially as i remembered that the boys had a five  hours  march as their first etape  and a bivouac at the end of it     i had intended to go out later on the route madame to watch the  cavalry coming down from the hills on the other side of the morin  but  i could not face the cold  there is nothing heroic about me  so i  contented myself with helping amelie set the house in order     needless to tell you that no one knows what this unexpected big  movement of troops means     it is inevitable that we should all imagine that it concerns the coming  spring offensive  at any rate  the cavalry is being put back into its  saddles  and the crack regiments are coming out of verdun  the  famous corps which has won immortal fame there  and written the  name of verdun in letters of flame in the list of the world s great  battles  and enshrined french soldiers in the love of all who can be  stirred by courage in a noble cause  or know what it means to have  the heart swell at the thought of the  sacred love of home and  country      although i have sworn  and more than once  that i will not talk politics  with you again  or discuss any subject which can be considered as its  most distant blood relation  yet every time you reiterate  aren t the  french wonderfully changed  aren t you more and more surprised at  them   it goes against the grain     does it never occur to you that france held her head up wonderfully  after the terrible humiliation of       does it never occur to you what  it meant to a great nation  so long a centre of civilization  and a great  race  so long a leader in thought  to have found herself without a  friend  and to have had to face such a defeat   a defeat followed by a  shocking treaty which kept that disaster forever before her  do you  never think of the hidden shame  the cankering mortification of the  consciousness of that nation across the frontier  which had battened  on its victory  and was so strong in brute force  that  however brave a  face one might put on  there was behind that smiling front always a  hidden fear of germany  an eternal foe  ever gaining in numbers and  eternally shaking her mailed fist     no nation so humiliated ever rose out of her humiliation as france  did  but the hidden memory  the daily consciousness of it  set its  outward mark on the race  it bred that sort of bravado which was  eternally accusing itself  in the consciousness that it had taken a  thrashing it could never hope to avenge  count up the past dares that  france has had to take from germany  so strong in mere numbers  and physical strength that to attempt to fight her alone  as she did in        meant simply to court annihilation  and fruitlessly  that does not  mean that france was really afraid  but only that she was too wise to  dare attempt to prove that she was not afraid  so many things in the  french that the world has not understood were the result of the  cankering wound of       this war has healed that wound  germany  is not invincible  and the chivalrous  loving aid that rallied to help  france is none the less comforting simply because since      all  nations have learned that the trend of germany s ambition was a  menace to them as well as to france           xxxiii        february              i had hardly sent my last letter to the post when news came that the    d dragoons had arrived safely at their new cantonnement  but here  is the letter  which will tell the story  sorry that you insist on having  these things in english  they are so very much prettier in french       with the army  january     dear madame     bravo for the pretty idea you had in flinging to the winter breezes the  tri colored flag in honor of our departure  all the soldiers marching out  of voisins saw the colors and were deeply touched  let me bear  witness to their gratitude     how i regret la creste  one never knows how happy he is until  afterward  i am far from comfortably installed here  i am lodged in an  old deserted chateau  there are no fires  and we are literally  refrigerated  however  we shall not stay long  as i am returning to the  trenches in a day or two  it will hardly be warm there  but i shall have  less time to remember how much more than comfortable i was at  huiry     we made a fairly decent trip to this place  but i assure you that  in  spite of my  extreme youth   i was near to being frozen en route  we  were so cold that finally the whole regiment had to dismount and  proceed on foot in the hope of warming up a bit  we were all  in the  end  sad  cross  and grumbly  you had spoiled us all at huiry and  voisins  for my part i longed to curse someone for having ordered  such a change of base as this  in such weather  wasn t i well enough  off where i was  toasting myself before your nice fire  and drinking my  tea comfortably every afternoon     however  we are working tremendously for the coming offensive  and  i hope it will be the final one  for the germans are beginning to show  signs of fatigue  news comes to us from the interior  from a reliable  source  which indicates that the situation on the other side of the  rhine is anything but calm  more than ever now must we hang on  for  the victory is almost within our clutch     accept  madame  the assurance of my most respectful homage     a      b             so you see  we were all too previous in expecting the offensive  the  cavalry is not yet really mounted for action  but we hope all the same     the    th is slowly settling down  but i ll tell you about that later           xxxiv        february               well  the    th has settled down to what looks like a long  cantonnement  it is surely the liveliest as well as the biggest we ever  had here  and every little town and village is crowded between here  and coulommier  not only are there five thousand infantry billeted  along the hills and in the valleys  but there are big divisions of  artillery also  the little square in front of our railway station at  couilly is full of grey cannon and ammunition wagons  and there  are military kitchens and all sorts of commissary wagons along  all the roadsides between here and crecy en brie  which is the  distributing headquarters for all sorts of material     as the weather has been intolerably cold  though it is dry and often  sunny  the soldiers are billeted in big groups of fifty or sixty in a room  or grange  where they sleep in straw  rolled in their blankets  packed  like sardines to keep warm     they came in nearly frozen  but they thawed out quickly  and now  they don t mind the weather at all     hardly had they got thawed out when an epidemic of mumps broke  out  they made quick work of evacuating those who had it  and stop  its spreading  to the regret  i am afraid  of a good many of the boys   one of them said to me the day after the mumpy ones were taken  over to meaux   lucky fellows  i wish i had the mumps  after verdun  it must be jolly to be in the hospital with nothing more dangerous than  mumps  and a nice  pretty girl  in a white cap  to pet you  i can t think  of a handsomer way to spend a repos than that      when i tell you that these soldiers say   men who have not been at  verdun have not seen the war yet   and then add that the life of the     th here looks like a long picnic  and that they make play of their  work  play of their grenade practice  which they vary with football  play  of their twenty miles hikes  i give you leave to laugh at my way of  seeing the war  and i ll even laugh with you     that reminds me that i never see a thousand or so of these boys on  the big plain playing what they call football that i don t wish some  american chaps were here to teach them the game  all they do here  is to throw off their coats and kick the ball as far  and as high  as  possible  and run like racers after it  while the crowd  massed on the  edge of the field  yells like mad  the yelling they do very well indeed   and they kick well  and run well  but  if they only knew the game    active  and agile  and light as they are  they would enjoy it  and play it  well     i had one of the nicest thrills i have had for many a day soon after the     th arrived     it was a sunny afternoon  i was walking in the road  when  just at the  turn above my house  two officers rode round the corner  saluted me   and asked if the road led to quincy  i told them the road to the right at  the foot of the hill  through voisins  would take them to quincy  they  thanked me  wheeled their horses across the road and stood there  i  waited to see what was going to happen  small events are interesting  here  after a bit one of them said that perhaps i would be wise to step  out of the road  which was narrow  as the regiment was coming     i asked  of course   what regiment   and  what are they coming  for   and he answered  the    th   and that it was simply  taking a  walk      so i sauntered back to my garden  and down to the corner by the  hedge  where i was high above the road  and could see in both  directions  i had hardly got there when the head of the line came  round the corner  in columns of four  knapsacks on their backs  guns  on their shoulders  swinging at an easy gait  all looking so brown  so  hardy  so clear eyed  the men from verdun marched by     i had thought it cold in spite of the sun  and was well wrapped up  with  my hands thrust into my big muff  but these men had beads of  perspiration standing on their bronzed faces under their steel  helmets     before the head of the line reached the turn into voisins  a long shrill  whistle sounded  the line stopped  someone said   at last  my  but  this has been a hot march   and in a second every man had slipped  off his knapsack and had a cigarette in his mouth     almost all of them dropped to the ground  or lay down against the  bank  a few enterprising ones climbed the bank  to the field in front of  my lawn  to get a glimpse of the view  and they all said what everyone  says   i say  this is the best point to see it      i wondered what they would say to it if they could see it in summer  and autumn if they found it fine with its winter haze     but that is not what gave me my thrill     the rest was a short one  two sharp whistles sounded down the hill   instantly everyone slipped on his sac  shouldered his gun  and at that  minute  down at the corner  the military band struck up  chant du  depart   every hair on my head stood up  it is the first time i have  heard a band since the war broke out  and as the regiment swung  down the hill to the blare of brass  well  funnily enough  it seemed  less like war than ever  habit is a deadly thing  i have heard that  band  a wonderful one  as such a regiment deserves   many times  since  but it never makes my heart thump as it did when  so  unexpectedly  it cut the air that sunny afternoon     i had so often seen those long lines marching in silence  as the  english and the french did to the battle of the marne  as all our  previous regiments have come and gone on the hillside  and never  seen a band or heard military music that i had ceased to associate  music with the soldiers  although i knew the bands played in the  battles and the bugle calls were a part of it     we have had all sorts of military shows  which change the  atmosphere in which the quiet about us had been for months and  months only stirred by the far off artillery     one day  we had a review on the broad plain which lies along the  watershed between the marne and the grande morin  overlooking the  heights on the far side of both valleys  with the grande route on one  side  and the walls to the wooded park of the handsome chateau de  quincy on the other  it was an imposing sight  with thousands of  steel helmeted figures sac au dos et bayonnette au canon  marching  and counter marching in the cold sunshine  looking in the distance  more like troops of louis xiii than an evolution from the french  conscript of the ante bellum days of the pantalon rouge     two days later we had the most magnificent prise d armes on the  same plain that i have ever seen  much more stirring  though less  tear moving  than the same ceremony in the courtyard of the  invalides at paris  where most foreigners see it  at the invalides one  sees the mutiles and the ill  here one only saw the glory  in paris  the  galleries about the court  inside the walls of the soldiers  home  are  packed with spectators  here there were almost none  but here the  heroes received their decorations in the presence of the comrades  among whom they had been won  in the terrible battles of verdun  it  was a long line of officers  and men from the ranks  who stood so  steadily before the commander and his staff  inside the hollow  square  about the regimental colors  to have their medals and  crosses fastened on their faded coats  receive their accolade  and  the bravos of their companions as their citations were read  there  were seven who received the legion d honneur     it was a brave looking ceremony  and it was a lovely day  even the  sun shone on them     there was one amusing episode  these celebrations are always a  surprise to the greater part of the community  and  in a little place like  this  it is only by accident that anyone sees the ceremony  the  children are always at school  and the rest of the world is at work  so   unless the music attracts someone  there are few spectators  on the  day of the prise d armes three old peasants happened to be in a field  on the other side of the route nationale  which skirts the big plain on  the plateau  they heard the music  dropped their work and ran  across the road to gape  they were all men on towards eighty  too  old to have ever done their military service  evidently no one had  ever told them that all frenchmen were expected to uncover when  the flag went by  poor things  they should have known  but they  didn t  and you should have seen a colonel ride down on them  i  thought he was going to cut the woollen caps off their heads with his  sabre  at the risk of decapitating them  but i loved what he said to  them      don t you know enough to uncover before the flag for which your  fellow citizens are dying every day      isn t that nice  i loved the democratic  fellow citizens   so pat and  oratorically french     i flung the stars and stripes to the french breezes on the  th in  honor of the rupture  it was the first time the flag has been unfurled  since captain simpson ordered the corporal to take it down two years  ago the third of last september  i had a queer sensation as i saw it  flying over the gate again  and thought of all that had happened since  the little corporal of the king s own yorks took it down   and the  germans still only forty two miles away           xxxv        february               what do you suppose i have done since i last wrote to you     i have actually been to the theatre for the first time in four years   would you ever have believed that i could keep out of the theatre  such a long time as that  still  i suppose going to the theatre  to a  sort of variety show  seems to you  who probably continue to go once  or twice a week  a tame experience  well  you can go to the opera   which i can t do if i like  but you can t see the heroes of verdun not  only applauding a show  but giving it  and that is what i have been  doing not only once but twice since i wrote you     i am sure that i have told you that our ambulance is in the salle de  recreation of the commune  which is a small rectangular room with a  stage across one end  it is the only thing approaching a theatre which  the commune boasts  it is well lighted  with big windows in the sides   and a top light over the stage  it is almost new  and the walls and  pointed ceiling are veneered with some canadian wood  which looks  like bird s eye maple  but isn t     it is in that hall that the matinees  which are given every other sunday  afternoon  take place  they are directed by a lieutenant colonel  who  goes into it with great enthusiasm  and really gets up a first class  programme     the boys do all the hard work  and the personnel of the ambulance  aids and abets with great good humor  though it is very upsetting  but  then it is for the army  and what the army wants these days  it must  have     luckily the men in our ambulance just now are either convalescent   or  at any rate  able to sit up in bed and bear excitement  so the beds  of the few who cannot be dressed are pushed close to the stage  and  around their cots are the chairs and benches of their convalescent  comrades  the rest of the beds are taken out  the big military band is  packed into one corner of the room  chairs are put in for the officers  of the staff and their few invited guests  there are rarely more than  half a dozen civilians  behind the reserved seats are a few benches  for the captains and lieutenants and the rest of the space is given up  to the poilus  who are allowed to rush when the doors are opened     of course the room is much too small  but it is the best we have  the  wide doors are left open  so are the wide windows  and the boys are  even allowed to perch on the wall opposite the entrance  from which  place they can see the stage     the entire programme is given by the poilus  only one performer had  a stripe on his sleeve  though many of them wore a decoration  what  seems to me the prettiest of all is that all the officers go  and applaud  like mad  even the white haired generals  who are not a bit backward  in crying  bis  bis   like the rest     the officers are kind enough to invite me and the card on my chair is  marked  mistress aldrich   isn t that shakesperian  i sit among the  officers  usually with a commandant on one side and a colonel on the  other  with a general de division  and a general de brigade in front of  me  and all sorts of gilt stripes about me  which i count with curiosity   now that i have learned what they mean  as i surreptitiously try to  discover the marks that war has made on their faces  and don t find  them     the truth is  the salle is fully as interesting to me as the performance   good as that is  with a handsome  delicate looking young professor of  music playing the violin  an actor from the palais royale showing a  diction altogether remarkable  two well known gymnasts doing  wonderful stunts on horizontal bars  a prize pupil from the  conservatory at nantes acting  as only the french can  in a well   known little comedy  two clever  comic monologists of the la scala  sort  and as good as i ever heard even there  and a regimental band  which plays good music remarkably  there is even a prix de rome in  the regiment  but he is en conge  so i  ve not heard him yet  i wonder  if you take it in  do you realize that these are the soldiers in the ranks  of the french defence  consider what the life in the trenches means  to them     they even have artists among the poilus to paint back drops and  make properties  so you see it is one thing to go to the theatre and  quite another to see the soldiers from verdun giving a performance  before such a public  the men from the trenches going to the play in  the highest of spirits and the greatest good humor     at the first experience of this sort i did long to have you there  it was  such a scene as i could not have believed possible in these days and  under these conditions if i had not actually taken part in it     as soon as the officers had filed in and taken their seats the doors  and windows were thrown open to admit  la vague   and we all stood  up and faced about to see them come  it was a great sight     in the aisle down the centre of the hall  there is only one   between  the back row of reserved seats  stood mlle  henriette  in her white  uniform  white gloved  with the red cross holding her long white veil to  the nurse s coiffe which covered her pretty brown hair  her slight  tall   white figure was the only barrier to prevent  la vague  from sweeping  right over the hall to the stage  as they came through the door it did  not seem possible that anything could stop them  or even that they  could stop themselves  and i expected to see her crushed  yet two  feet from her  the mass stopped  the front line became rigid as steel  and held back the rest  and  in a second  the wave had broken into  two parts and flowed into the benches at left and right  and  in less  time than it takes you to read this  they were packed on the benches   packed in the windows  and hung up on the walls  a queer murmur   half laugh and half applause  ran over the reserved seats  and the  tall  thin commandant beside me said softly   that is the way they  came out of the trenches at verdun   as i turned to sit down i had  impressed on my memory forever that sea of smiling  clean shaven   keen eyed  wave on wave of french faces  all so young and so gay    yet whose eyes had looked on things which will make a new france     i am sending you the programme of the second matinee  i lost that of  the first     i do wish  for many reasons  that you could have heard the recitation  by brochard of jean bastia s  l autre cortege   in which the poet  foresees the day  when joffre shall return down the champs  elysees  to the frenzied cries of the populace saluting its victorious  army  and greeting with wild applause  petain  who kept verdun  inviolated    de castelnau  who three times in the fray saw a son fall  at his side    gouraud  the fearless    marchand  who rushed on the  boches brandishing his cane    mangin  who retook douaumont    and  all those brave young officers  modest even in glory  whose  deeds the world knows without knowing their names   and the soldier  heroes who held the frontier  like a wall of steel from flanders to  alsace    the heroes of souchez  of dixmude  of the maison du  passeur  of souain  of notre dame de lorette  and of the great  retreat  it made a long list and i could feel the thrill running all over  the room full of soldiers who  if they live  will be a part of that  triumphal procession  of which no one talks yet except a poet     but when he had pictured that scene the tempo of the verse  changed  the music began softly to play a schumann reverie to the  lines beginning   but this triumphal cortege is not enough  the return  of the army demands another cortege    the triumph of the mutiles    the martyrs of the war who have given more than life to the defence  of france  the most glorious heroes of the war     the picture the poet made of this  other cortege  moved the soldiers  strangely  the music  which blended wonderfully with brochard s  beautiful voice  was hardly more than a breath  just audible  but  always there  and added greatly to the effect of the recitation  there  was a sigh in the silence which followed the last line  and an almost  whispered  bravo   before the long shouts of applause broke out     it is the only number on any programme that has ever touched  even  remotely  on war  it came as a surprise  it had not been announced   but the intense  rather painful  feeling which had swept over the  audience was instantly removed by a comic monologue  and i need  not tell you that these monologues   intended to amuse the men from  the trenches and give them a hearty laugh   are usually very la  scala  that is to say  rosse  but i do love to hear the boys shout with  glee over them     the scene in the narrow streets of quincy after the show is very  picturesque  the road mounts a little to moulignon  and to see the  blue grey backs of the boys  quite filling the street between the grey  walls of the houses  as they go slowly back to their cantonnements   makes a very pretty picture     it does seem a far cry from this to war  doesn t it  yet isn t it lucky to  know and to see that these boys can come out of such a battle as  verdun in this condition  this spirit  you see  is the hope of the future   you know  when you train any kind of a dog to fight  you put him  through all the hard paces and force him to them  without breaking  his spirit  it seems to me that is just what is being done to the men at  the front           xxxvi        march              well  i have been very busy for some time now receiving the  regiment  and all on account of the flag  it had been going up in the   dawn s early light   and coming down  with the twilight s last  gleaming  for some weeks when the regiment marched past the gate  again  i must tell you the truth   the first man who attempted to cry   vivent les etats unis  was hushed by a cry of  attendez patience    pas encore   and the line swung by  that was all right  i could afford  to smile   and  at this stage of the game  to wait  you are always  telling me what a  patient man  wilson is  i don t deny it  still  there  are others     the first caller that the flag brought me was on the morning after the  regiment marched by it  i was upstairs  amelie called up that there  was  un petit soldat  at the door  they are all  les petits soldats  to  her  even when they are six feet tall  she loves to see them coming  into the garden  i heard her say to one of them the other day  when  he  did not wish to disturb madame  if she is busy    mais  entrez  donc  les soldats ne genent jamais ma maitresse      i went downstairs and found a mere youngster  with a sergeant s  stripe on his sleeve  blushing so hard that i wondered how he had got  up the courage to come inside the gate  he stammered a moment   then he pointed to the flag  and  clearing his throat  said      you aire an americaine      i owned it      i haf seen the flag  i haf been so surprised  i haf had to come in      i opened the door wide  and said   do   and he did  and almost with  tears in his eyes  he was very young  and blonde  he explained that  he was a canadian      but   i said   you are a french canadian       breton   he replied   but i haf live in canada since sixteen   then he  told me that his sister had gone to new brunswick to teach french  seven years ago  and that he had followed  that  when he was old  enough  he had taken out his naturalization papers  and become a  british subject in order to take up government land  that he had a  wheat farm in northern canada  one hundred and sixty acres  all  under cultivation  that he was twenty when the war broke out  and  that he had enlisted at once  that he had been wounded on the  somme  and came out of the hospital just in season to go through  the hard days at verdun     as we talked  part of his accent wore away  before the interview was  over he was speaking english really fluently  you see he had been  tongue tied at his own temerity at first  when he was at ease  though  he was very modest and scrupulously well mannered  he talked well     the incident was interesting to me because i had heard that the  french canadians had not been quick to volunteer  and i could not  resist asking him how it happened that he  a british subject  was in  the french army     he reddened  stammered a bit  and finally said   after all i am french  at heart  had england fought any other nation but france in a war in  which france was not concerned it would have been different  but  since england and france are fighting together what difference can it  make if my heart turned to the land where i was born      isn t the naturalization question delicate     i could not help asking myself how england looked at the matter  i  don t know  she has winked at a lot of things  and a great many more  have happened of late about which no one has ever thought  there  are any number of officers in the english army today  enrolled as  englishmen  who are american citizens  and who either had no idea  of abandoning their country  or were in too much of a hurry to wait for  formalities  i am afraid all this matter will take on another color after   this cruel war is over      this boy looked prosperous  and in no need of anything but kind  words in english  he did not even need cigarettes  but i saw him turn  his eyes frequently towards the library  and it occurred to me that he  might want something to read  i asked him if he did  and you should  have seen his eyes shine   and he wanted english at that  and  beamed all over his face at a heap of illustrated magazines  so i was  able to send him away happy     the result was  early the next morning two more of them arrived  a  tall six footer  and a smaller chap  it was sunday morning  and they  had real  smiling sunday faces on  the smaller one addressed me in  very good english  and told me that the sergeant had said that there  was an american lady who was willing to lend the soldiers books  so i  let them loose in the library  and they bubbled  one in english  and the  other in french  while they revelled in the books     of course i am always curious about the civil lives of these lads  and  it is the privilege of my age to put such questions to them  the one  who spoke english told me that his home was in london  that he was  the head clerk in the correspondence department of an importing  house  i asked him how old he was  and he told me twenty two  that  he was in france doing his military service when the war broke out   that he had been very successful in england  and that his employer  had opposed his returning to france  and begged him to take out  naturalization papers  he said he could not make up his mind to jump  his military service  and had promised his employer to return when his  time was up   then the war came     i asked him if he was going back when it was over     he looked at me a moment  shook his head and said   i don t think  so  i had never thought of such a thing as a war  no  i am too french   after this war  if i can get a little capital  i am going into business  here  i am only one  but i am afraid france needs us all      you see there again is that naturalization question  this war has set  the world thinking  and it was high time     one funny thing about this conversation was that every few minutes  he turned to his tall companion and explained to him in french what  we were talking about  and i thought it so sweet     finally i asked the tall boy  he was a corporal and had been watching  his english speaking chum with such admiration  what he did in civil  life     he turned his big brown eyes  on me  and replied   i  madame  i  never had any civil life      i looked puzzled  and he added   i come of a military family  i am an  orphan  and i am an enfant de troupe      now did you know that there were such things today as  children of  the regiment   i own i did not  yet there he stood before me  a  smiling twenty year old corporal  who had been brought up by the  regiment  been a soldier boy from his babyhood     in the meantime they had decided what they wanted for books  the  english speaking french lad wanted either shakespeare or milton   and as i laid the books on the table for him  he told his comrade who  the two authors were  and promised to explain it all to him  and there  wasn t a sign of show off in it either  as for the child of the regiment   he wanted a balzac  and when i showed him where they were  he  picked out  eugenie grandet   and they both went away happy     i don t need to tell you that when the news spread that there were  books in the house on the hilltop that could be borrowed for the  asking  i had a stream of visitors  and one of these visits was a very  different matter     one afternoon i was sitting before the fire  it was getting towards  dusk  there was a knock at the door  i opened it  there stood a  handsome soldier  with a corporal s stripes on his sleeve  he saluted  me with a smile  as he told me that his comrades had told him that  there was an american lady here who did not seem to be bored if the  soldiers called on her      alors   he added   i have come to make you a visit      i asked him in     he accepted the invitation  he thrust his fatigue cap into his pocket   took off his topcoat  threw it on the back of a chair  which he drew up  to the fire  beside mine  and at a gesture from me he sat down      hmmm   i thought   this is a new proposition      the other soldiers never sit down even when invited  they prefer to  keep on their feet     ever since i began to see so much of the army  i have asked myself  more than once   where are the fils de famille   they can t all be  officers  or all in the heavy artillery  or all in the cavalry  but i had  never seen one  to know him  in the infantry  this man was in every  way a new experience  even among the noncommissioned officers i  had seen  he was more at his ease  he stayed nearly two hours  we  talked politics  art  literature  even religion  he was a good catholic    just as one talks at a tea party when one finds a man who is  cultivated  and can talk  and he was evidently cultivated  and he  talked awfully well     he examined the library  borrowed a volume of flaubert  and finally   after he had asked me all sorts of questions  where i came from  how  i happened to be here  and even to  explain mr  wilson   i responded  by asking him what he did in civil life     he was leaning against the high mantel  saying a wood fire was  delicious  he smiled down on me and replied   nothing       enfin   i said to myself   here he is  the  fils de famille  for whom i  have been looking   so i smiled back and asked him  in that case  if it  were not too indiscreet  what he did to kill time      well   he said   i have a very pretty  altogether charming wife  and i  have three little children  i live part of the time in paris  and part of  the time at cannes  and i manage to keep busy      it seemed becoming for me to say  beg pardon and thank you   and  he bowed and smiled an  il n y a pas de quoi   thanked me for a  pleasant afternoon  an  unusual kind of pleasure   he added   for a  soldier in these times   and went away     it was only when i saw him going that it occurred to me that i ought to  have offered him tea  but you know the worth of  esprit d escalier      naturally i was curious about him  so the next time i saw the  canadian i asked him who he was   oh   he replied   he is a nice  chap  he is a noble  a vicomte  a millionaire      so you see i have found the type  not quite in the infantry ranks  but  almost  and if i found one there must be plenty more  it consoled me  in these days when one hears so often cries against  les  embusques      i began to think there was every type in the world in this famous     th  and i was not far from wrong     the very next day i got the most delicious type of all  the french   american  very french to look at  but with new york stamped all over  him  especially his speech  of all these boys  this is the one i wish  you could see     like all the rest of the english speaking frenchmen  the canadian  excepted  he brought a comrade to hear him talk to the lady in  english  i really must try to give you a graphic idea of that  conversation     when i opened the door for him  he stared at me  and then he threw  up both hands and simply shouted   my god  it is true  my god  it is  an american       then he thrust out his hand and gave me a hearty shake  simply  yelling   my god  lady  i m glad to see you  my god  lady  the sight is  good for sore eyes      then he turned to his comrade and explained   j ai dit a la dame    mon dieu  madame    etc   and in the same breath he turned back to  me and continued      my god  lady  when i saw them stars and stripes floating out there  i  said to my comrade   if there is an american man or an american  lady here  my god  i am going to look at them   and my god  lady  i m  glad i did  well  how do you do  anyway      i told him that i was very well  and asked him if he wouldn t like to  come in      my god  lady  you bet your life i do   and he shook my hand again   and came in  remarking   i m an american myself  from new york    great city  new york  can t be beat  i wish all my comrades could see  broadway  that would amaze them   and then he turned to his  companion to explain   j ai dit a madame que je voudrais bien que  tous les copains pouvaient voir broadway  c est la plus belle rue de  new york  ils seront epates  tous   and he turned to me to ask   n est ce pas  madame      i laughed  i had to  i had a vivid picture of his comrades seeing new  york for the first time  you know it takes time to get used to the great  white way  and i remembered the last distinguished frenchman  whom the propaganda took on to the great thoroughfare  and who  at  the first sight and sound and feel of it  wanted to lay his head up  against times square and sob like a baby with fright and  amazement  this was one of those flash thoughts  my caller did not  give me time for more than that  for he began to cross examine me    he wanted to know where i lived in america     it did not seem worth while to tell him i did not live there  so i said   boston   and he declared it a  nice  pretty slow town   he knew it   and  of course  he added   but my god  lady  give me new york  every time  i ve lived there sixteen years  got a nice little wife there    here s her picture  and see here  this is my name   and he laid an  envelope before me with a new york postmark      well   i said   if you are an american citizen  what are you doing  here  in a french uniform  the states are not in the war      his eyes simply snapped      my god  lady  i m a frenchman just the same  my god  lady  you  don t think i d see france attacked by germany and not take a hand  in the fight  do you  not on your life      here is your naturalization business again     i could not help laughing  but i ventured to ask   well  my lad  what  would you have done if it had been france and the states   he  curled his lip  and brushed the question aside with      my god  lady  don t be stupid  that could never be  never  on your  life      i asked him  when i got a chance to put in a word  what he did in new  york  and he told me he was a chauffeur  and that he had a sister  who lived  on riverside drive  up by   th street   but i did not ask  him in what capacity  for before i could  he launched into an  enthusiastic description of riverside drive  and immediately put it all  into french for the benefit of his copain  who stood by with his mouth  open in amazement at the spirited english of his friend     when he went away  he shook me again violently by the hand   exclaiming   well  lady  of course you ll soon be going back to the  states  so shall i  i can t live away from new york  no one ever could  who had lived there  great country the states  i m a voter  i m a  democrat  always vote the democratic ticket  voted for wilson  well   goodbye  lady      as he shook me by the hand again  it seemed suddenly to occur to  him that he had forgotten something  he struck a blow on his  forehead with his fist  and cried   my god  lady  did i understand that  you have been here ever since the war began  then you were here  during the battle out there  my god  lady  i  m an american  too  and  my god  lady  i  m proud of you  i am indeed   and he went off down  the road  and i heard him explaining to his companion  j ai dit a  madame   etc     i don t think any comment is necessary on what broadway does to  the french lad of the people     last night i saw one of the most beautiful sights that i have ever  seen  for several evenings i have been hearing artillery practice of  some sort  but i paid no attention to it  we have no difficulty in  distinguishing the far off guns at soissons and rheims  which  announce an attack  from the more audible  but quite different  sound  of the tir d exercice  but last night they sounded so very near  almost  as if in the garden  that  at about nine  when i was closing up the  house  i stepped out on to the terrace to listen  it was a very dark  night  quite black  at first i thought they were in the direction of  quincy  and then i discovered  once i was listening carefully  that they  were in the direction of the river  i went round to the north side of the  house  and i saw the most wonderful display  more beautiful than any  fireworks i had ever seen  the artillery was experimenting with signal  lights  and firing colored fusees volantes  i had read about them  but  never seen one  as near as i could make out  the artillery was on top  of the hill of monthyon  where we saw the battle of the marne begin     and the line they were observing was the iles les villenoy  in the river  right at the west of us  when i first saw the exercises  there were half  a dozen lovely red and green lights hanging motionless in the sky  i  could hear the heavy detonation of the cannon or gun  or whatever  they use to throw them  and then see the long arc of light like a chain  of gold  which marked the course of the fusee  until it burst into color  at the end  i wrapped myself up  took my field glasses  and stayed  out an hour watching the scene  and trying to imagine what exactly  the same thing  so far as mere beauty went  meant to the men at the  front     in the morning i found that everyone else had heard the guns  but no  one had seen anything  because  as it happens  it was from my lawn  only that both monthyon and the iles les villenoy could be seen           xxxvii        march               such a week of excitement as we have had  but it has been uplifting  excitement  i feel as if i had never had an ache or a pain  and time  and age were not  what with the english advance  the russian  revolution  and zeppelins tumbling out of the heavens  every day  has been just a little more thrilling than the day before     i wonder now how  willie    as we used to call him in the days when  he was considered a joke   feels over his latest great success  the  democratic conversion  or i suppose i should  to be correct  say the  conversion to democracy  of all russia  it must be a queer sensation  to set out to accomplish one thing  and to achieve its exact reverse     yesterday  it was sunday  just capped the week of excitement  it was  the third beautiful day in the week   full of sunshine  air clear  sky  blue     in the morning  the soldiers began to drop in  to bring back books and  get more  to talk a little politics  for even the destruction of the  zeppelin at compiegne  and the news that the english were at  bapaume  was a bit damped by the untimely fall of briand     the boys all looked in prime condition  and they all had new uniforms   even new caps and boots  the canadian  who usually comes alone   had personally conducted three of his comrades  whom he formally  introduced  and  as i led the way into the library  i remarked   mais   comme nous sommes chic aujourd hui   and they all laughed  and  explained that it was sunday and they were dressed for a formal call   if any of them guessed that the new equipment meant anything they  made no sign  i imagine they did not suspect any more than i did  for  they all went down the hill to lunch  each with a book under his arm   yet four hours later they were preparing to advance     it was exactly four in the afternoon that news came that the french  had pierced the line at soissons  just in front of us  and that noyon  had been retaken  that the cavalry were a cheval  that means that  the   d dragoons have advanced in pursuit   and  only a quarter of  an hour after we got the news  the assemblage general was  sounded  and the    th ordered sac au dos at half past six     for half an hour there was a rush up the hill  boys bringing me back  my books  coming to shake hands and present me with little  souvenirs  and bring the news that the camions were coming  which  meant that the    th were going right into action again  when a  regiment starts in such a hurry that it must take a direct line  and  cannot bother with railroads  the boys know what that means     i know you ll ask me how they took the order  so i tell you without  waiting  i saw a few pale faces  but it was only for a moment  a group  of them stood in front of me in the library  i had just received from the  front  by post  the silk parachute of a fusee volante  on which was  written   a miss mildred aldrich ramasse sur le champ de bataille a     metres des lignes boches  souvenir de la patrouille de fevrier             and the signature of the aspirant  and that was the only way i  knew he had probably been on a dangerous mission     it was the first time that i had ever seen one any nearer than in the  air  during the exercises by night of which i wrote you  and one of the  boys was explaining it  and its action  and use  and everyone but me  was laughing at the graphic demonstration  i don t know why i didn t  laugh  usually i laugh more than anyone else     sometimes i think that i have laughed more in the last two years than  in all the rest of my life  the demonstrator looked at me  and asked  why i was so grave  i replied that i did not know  perhaps in surprise  that they were so gay     he understood at once  quite simply he said   well  my dear  madame  we must be gay  what would we do otherwise  if we  thought too often of the comrades who are gone  if we remembered  too often that we risked our skins every day  the army would be  demoralized  i rarely think of these things except just after an attack   then i draw a deep breath  look up at the sky  and i laugh  as i say to  my soul   well  it was not to be this time  perhaps it never will be   life  is dear to each of us  in his own way  and for his own reasons  luckily  it is not so dear to any of us as france or honor      i turned away and looked out of the window a moment  i could not  trust myself   and the next minute they were all shaking hands  and  were off down the road to get ready     the loaded camions began to move just after dark  no one knows  the destination  but judging by the direction  they were heading for  soissons  they were moving all night  and the first thing i heard this  morning was the bugle in the direction of quincy  and the news came  at breakfast time that the   th regiment  the last of the big fighting  regiments to go into action at verdun  and the last to leave  was  marching in  the girl from the butcher s brought the news  and  oh   madame   she added   the americans are with them       the what   i exclaimed      a big american ambulance corps  any number of ambulance  automobiles  and they have put their tents up on the common at  quincy      you can imagine how excited i was  i sent someone over to quincy at  once to see if it was true  and word came back that captain norton s  american corps sanitaire  forty men who have been with this same  division  the   st corps  for many months  had arrived from verdun  with the   th regiment  and was to follow it into action when it  advanced again     this time the cantonnement does not come up to huiry  only to the  foot of the hill at voisins     of course i have not seen our boys yet  but i probably shall in a few  days           xxxviii        march               well  all quiet on the hilltop again  all the soldiers gone  no sign of  more coming for the present  we are all nervously watching the  advance  but controlling our nerves  the german retreat and the  organized destruction which accompanies it just strikes one dumb  of  course we all know it is a move meant to break the back of the great  offensive  and though we knew  too  that the allied commanders were  prepared for it  it does make you shiver to get a letter from the front  telling you that a certain regiment advanced at a certain point thirty  kilometres  without seeing a boche     as soon as i began to read the account of the destruction  i had a  sudden illuminating realization of the meaning of something i saw  from the car window the last time i came out from paris  perhaps i did  not tell you that i was up there for a few days the first of the month     of course you don t need to be told that there has been a  tremendous amount of work done on the eastern road all through the  war  extra tracks have been laid all the way between paris and  chelles  the outer line of defenses of the city  and at the stations  between gagny and chelles the sidings extend so far on the western  side of the tracks as to almost reach out of sight  for a long time the  work was done by soldiers  but when i went up to paris  four weeks  ago  the work was being done by annamites in their saffron colored  clothes and queer turbans  and i found the same little people cleaning  the streets in paris  but the surprising thing was the work that was  accomplished in the few days that i was in paris  i came back on  march     and i was amazed to see all those miles and miles of  sidings filled with trucks piled with wood  with great posts  with planks   with steel rails  and what looked the material to build a big city or two   i did not wonder when i saw them that we could not get coal  or other  necessities of life  but it was not until i read of the very german like  idea of defending one s self on the property of other people that i  realized what all that material meant  and that the allies were  prepared for even this tragic and boche like move  i began to get little  cards and letters back from the    th on the twenty third  the first  said simply       dear madame     here we are  arrived last night just behind the line   with our eyes  strained towards the front  ready to bound forward and join in the  pursuit     of course i have seen the americans  a doctor from schenectady  and forty men  almost all youngsters in their early twenties  in fact  twenty two seems to be the popular age  there are boys from  harvard  boys from yale  new england boys  virginia boys  boys from  tennessee  from kentucky  from louisiana  and american boys from  oxford  it is a first line ambulance corps   the boys who drive their  little ford ambulances right down to the battlefields and receive the  wounded from the brancardiers  and who have seen the worst of  verdun  and endured the privations and the cold with the army     when a virginia man told me that he had not taken cold this winter   and showed me his little tent on the common  where  from choice  he  is still sleeping under canvas  because he  likes it   i could easily  believe him  do you know   it is absurd  i have not had a cold this  winter  either  i  who used to have one tonsilitis per winter  two  bronchitis  half a dozen colds in my head  and occasionally a mild  specimen of grip  this is some record when you consider that since  my coal gave out in february we have had some pretty cold weather   and that i have only had imitation fires  which cheer the imagination  by way of the eyes without warming the atmosphere  i could fill a  book with stories of  how i made fires in war time   but i spare you  because i have more interesting things to tell you     on the twenty sixth we were informed that we were to have the   th  regiment cantoned on the hill for a day and a night  they were to  move along a bit to make room for the   th for a few days  it was  going to be pretty close quarters for one night  and the adjutant who  arranged the cantonnement was rather put to it to house his men   the captain was to be in my house  and i was asked  if  for two days    perhaps less  i could have an officers  kitchen in the house and let  them have a place to eat  well   there the house was  they were  welcome to it  so that was arranged  and i put a mattress on the floor  in the atelier for the captain s cook     we had hardly got that over when the adjutant came back to look  over the ground again  and see if it were not possible to canton a  demi section in the granges  i went out with him to show him what  there was  a grange on the south side  with a loft  which has already  had to be braced up with posts  and which i believe to be dangerous   he examined it  and agreed  a grange on the north side  used for  coal  wood  and garden stuff  with a loft above in fair condition  but  only accessible by ladder from the outside  he put up the ladder   climbed it  unlocked the door  examined it  and decided that it would  do  unless they could find something better     so soldiers came in the afternoon and swept it out  and brought the  straw in which they were to sleep  and that was arranged     it was about seven the next morning when they began to arrive  i  heard the tramp of their feet in the road  as they marched  in sections   to their various cantonnements  i put a clean cap over my tousled  hair  slipped into a wadded gown and was ready just as i heard the   halte   which said that my section had arrived  i heard two growly  sounds which i took to be  a droite  marche    and by the time i got  the window open to welcome my section i looked down into an indian  file of smiling bronzed faces  as they marched along the terrace   knapsacks and guns on their backs  and began mounting the ladder     soon after  the captain s cook arrived with his market baskets and  took possession of the kitchen  and he was followed by orderlies and  the kits  and by the officer who was to be the captain s table  companion     as amelie had half a section cantoned in her courtyard she was busy  there  and i simply showed the cook where things were  gave him  table cloths and napkins  and left him to follow his own sweet will  free  to help himself to anything he needed  if you remember what i told  you about my house when i took it  you can guess how small i had to  make myself     i can tell you one thing  on the testimony of amelie  the officers eat  well  but they pay for it themselves  so that is all right  the cook was  never idle a minute while he was in the house  i heard him going up  to bed  in his felt shoes  at ten o clock  amelie said he left the kitchen  scrupulously clean  and i heard the kitchen alarm clock  which he  carried with him going off at half past five in the morning     i had asked the captain when the regiment was to advance  and he  said probably the next morning  but that the order had not come   twice while i was at dinner in the breakfast room  i heard an orderly  come in with despatches  but it was not until nine o clock that the  order  sac au dos  at half past ten the next morning  that was  yesterday  was official  and it was not until nine in the morning that  they knew that they were leaving in camions  which meant that they  were really starting in the pursuit  and the american division was to  follow them     the officers had a great breakfast just after nine  half a dozen  courses  as they did not know when  if ever  they would sit down to a  real meal at a table again they made their possibly last one a feast   as they began just after nine and had to be on the road at half past  ten i don t need to tell you that the cook had no time to clear up after  himself  he had just time  with his mouth full of food  to throw his  apron on the floor  snatch up his gun and his knapsack and buckle  himself into shape as he sprinted up the hill to overtake his company     as for me  i threw on a cape and went across the road to the field   where i could see the grande route  and the chemin madame  leading to it  all along the route nationale  as far as i could see with  my field glass  stood the grey camions  on the chemin madame the  regiment was waiting  they had stacked their guns and  in groups   with cigarettes between their lips  they chatted quietly  as they waited   here and there a bicyclist was sprinting with orders     suddenly a whistle sounded  there was a rattle of arms as the men  unstacked their guns and fell into line  then hundreds of hobnailed  boots marked time on the hard road  and the   th swung along to the  waiting camions  over the same route i had seen captain simpson  and the yorkshire boys take  just before sundown  on that hot  september day in          as i stood watching them all the stupendousness of the times rushed  over me that you and i  who have rubbed our noses on historical  monuments so often  have chased after emotions on the scenes of  past heroism  and applauded mock heroics across the footlights   should be living in days like these  days in which heroism is the  common act of every hour  i cannot help wondering what the future  generations are going to say of it all  how far off times are going to  judge us  what is going to stand out in the strong limelight of history  i  know what i think  but that does not help yet     do you know that i had a letter from paris this week which said   i  was looking over your letters written while we were tied up in london   in august        and was amused to find that in one of them you had  written  the annoying thing is  that  after this is over  germany will  console herself with the reflection that it took the world to beat her     it is coming truer than i believed in those days   and then i went  back to dishwashing     you never saw such a looking kitchen as i found  leon  the officers   cook  a pastry cook before he was a soldier  was a nice  kindly  hard   working chap  but he lacked the quality dear to all good house   keepers  he had never learned to clean up after himself as he went  along  he had used every cooking utensil in the house  and such a  pile of plates and glasses  it took amelie and me until two o clock to  clean up after him  and when it was done i felt that i never wanted to  see food again as long as i lived  of course we did not mind  but  amelie had to say  every now and then   vive l armee   just to keep  her spirits up  anyway it was consoling to know that they have more  to eat than we do     the american corps had to leave one of their boys behind in our  ambulance  very ill with neuritis  that is to say  painfully ill  as the  boys of the american corps are ranked by the french army as  officers this case is doubly interesting to the personnel of our  modest hospital  first he is an american  a tall young southerner  from tennessee  they never knew an american before  second   he is not only an honorary officer serving france  he is really a  lieutenant in the officers  reserve corps of his own state  and  our little ambulance has never sheltered an officer before     the nurses and the sisters are falling over one another to take care  of him  at least  as i always find one or two of them sitting by his bed  whenever i go to see him  i imagine they are     the amusing thing is that he says he can t understand or speak  french  and swears that the only words he knows are     oui  oui  oui   non  non  non   si  si  si   et voila   merci     which he sings  in his musical southern voice  to the delight of his  admiring nurses  all the same  whenever it is necessary for an  interpreter to explain something important to him  i find that he has  usually got the hang of it already  so i ve my doubts if he has as little  french as he pretends  one thing is sure his discharge will leave a  big void in the daily life of the ambulance     this is growing into a long letter  in the quiet that has settled on us i  seem to have plenty of time  and the mood  so  before i close  i must  say something in reply to your sad sentence in your last letter  the  reply to mine of december regarding our first big cantonnement  you  say  oh  the pity of this terrible sacrifice of the youth of the world    why aren t the middle aged sent first  the men who have partly lived  their lives  who leave children to continue the race   ah  dear old girl    you are indeed too far off to understand such a war as this  few men  of even forty can stand the life  only the young can bear the strain   they not only bear it  they thrive on it  and  such of them as survive  the actual battles  will come out of it in wonderful physical trim  of  course there are a thousand sides to the question  there are  hospitals full of the tuberculous and others with like maladies  but  those things existed before the war  only less attention was paid to  them  it is also a serious question    getting more serious the longer  the war goes on  as to how all these men will settle into civil life again    how many will stand sedentary pursuits after years in the open  and  how they will settle back into the injustices of class distinctions after  years of the equality of the same duty  fighting for their country   still if the victory is decisive  and the army is satisfied with the  peace conditions  i imagine all those things will settle themselves     well  congress meets on monday  there is no doubt in anyone s  mind of the final decision  i only hope it won t drag too long  i have  taken my flags down just to have the pleasure of putting them up  again     i had this letter closed when i got my first direct news from the front  since the advance     do you remember how amused i was when i saw the aspirant  equipped for his march in january  i was told afterward that my idea  of a light equipment for the cavalry in battle was  theoretically  beautiful   but in such a war as this absolutely impracticable  well i  hear today that when the cavalry advanced it advanced in a   theoretically beautiful  manner  it seems that the order was  unexpected  it caught the cavalry in the saddle during a manoeuvre   and  just as they were  they wheeled into line and flew off in pursuit of  the boches  they had nothing but what was on their backs  and  ammunition  of course  the result was that they had forty eight hours  of real suffering  it was harder on the officers than on the men  and  hardest of all on the horses  all the soldiers always have a bidon with  something in it to drink  and almost invariably they have a bite or so in  their sacks  no officer ever has anything on him  and none of them  carries a bidon except on a march  for forty eight hours in the chase  they suffered from hunger  and  what was worse still  from thirst  as  the weather was nasty and they were without shelters of any kind  not  even tents  they tasted all the hardships of war  this must comfort  the foot soldiers  who are eternally grumbling at the cavalry  however   the officer who brought back the news says the men bore it with  philosophical gaiety  even those who on the last day had nothing as  well as those who in forty eight hours had a quarter of a biscuit  the  horses were not so philosophical  some of them just lay down and  died  poor beasts  i assure you i shall never laugh again at a  cavalryman s  battle array            xxxix        april              the sun shines  and my heart is high  this is a great day  the stars  and stripes ace flying at my gate  and they are flying over all france   what is more they will soon be flying  if they are not already  over  westminster  for the first time in history  the mighty  unruly child  who  never could quite forgive the parent it defied  and never has been  wholly pardoned  is to come back to the family table  if only long  enough to settle the future manners of the nations about the board   put in  i suppose  a few  don ts   like  don t grab    don t take a bigger  mouthful than you can becomingly chew    don t jab your knife into  your neighbor  it is not for that purpose    don t eat out of your  neighbor s plate  you have one of your own    in fact  thou shalt not    even though thou art a kaiser  take the name of the lord thy god in  vain    thou shalt not steal    thou shalt not kill    thou shalt not  covet   and so on  trite  i know  but in thousands of years we  have not improved on it     so the stars and stripes are flying over france to greet the long  delayed and ardently awaited  long ago inevitable declaration which  puts the states shoulder to shoulder with the other great nations in  the defence of the rights of man  the sacredness of property  the  honor of humanity  and the news has been received with such  enthusiasm as has not been seen in france since war broke over it   judging by the cables the same enthusiasm which has set the air  throbbing here is mounting to the skies on your side of the ocean  we  are a strangely lucky nation  we are the first to go into the great fight  to the shouts of the populace  to be received like a star performer   with  thunders of applause      well       god s in his heaven  all s right with the world    and  we are no  longer in the war zone  as soon as a few formalities are filled  and i  can get a carte d identite  i shall be once more free to circulate  after  sixteen months of a situation but one step removed from being  interned  it will be good to be able to move about  even if i don t want  to     to give you some idea how the men at the front welcome the news   here is a letter which has just come   written before congress had  voted  but when everyone was sure of the final decision       at the front  april          dear madame       it has been a long time since i sent you my news  the neglect has  not been my fault  but due to the exceptional circumstances of the  war     at last we have advanced  and this time as real cavalry  we have  had the satisfaction of pursuing the boches  keeping on their flying  heels until we drove them into st  quentin  from the   th to the   th  of march the war became once more a battle in the open  which was  a great relief to the soldiers and permitted them to once more  demonstrate their real military qualities  i lived through a dozen days  filled to overflowing with emotions  sorrow  joy  enthusiasm  at last i  have really known what war is  with all its misery and all its beauty   what joy it was for us of the cavalry to pass over the trenches and fly  across the plains in the pursuit of the germans  the first few days  everything went off wonderfully  the boches fled before us  not  daring to turn and face us  but our advance was so rapid  our  impetuosity such  that  long before they expected us  we overtook the  main body of the enemy  they were visibly amazed at being caught  before they could cross the canal at st  quentin  as was their plan   and they were obliged to turn and attempt to check our advance  in  order to gain sufficient time to permit their artillery to cross the canal  and escape complete disaster     it was there that we fought  forcing them across the canal to entrench  themselves hastily in unprepared positions  from which  at the hour i  write  our wonderful infantry and our heavy artillery  in collaboration  with the british  are dislodging them     alas  the battles were costly  and many of our comrades paid with  their lives for our audacious advance  be sure that we avenged them   and cruel as are our losses they were not in vain  they are more than  compensated by the results of the sacrifice  the strip of our native soil  snatched from the enemy  they died like heroes  and for a noble  cause     since then we have been resting  but waiting impatiently to advance  and pursue them again  until we can finally push them over their own  frontier     today s paper brings us great and comforting news  at last  dear  madame  at last your marvellous country is going to march beside us  in this terrible war  with a full heart i present to you my heartiest  congratulations  at last wilson understands  and the american  people  so noble  and always so generous  will no longer hesitate to  support us with all their resources  how wonderfully this is going to  aid us to obtain the decisive victory we must have  and perhaps to  shorten the war     here  in the army  the joy is tremendous at the idea that we have  behind us the support of a nation so great  and all our admiration  all  our gratitude goes out to your compatriots  to the citizens of the great  republic  which is going to enter voluntarily into this holy war  and so  bravely expose itself to its known horrors     bravo  et vivent les etats unis     my greetings to amelie and papa  a caress for khaki and didine  and  a pat for dick     receive  madame  the assurance of my most respectful homage     i am feeling today as if it were no matter that the winter had been so  hard  that we have no fuel but twigs  that the winter wheat was frozen   that we have eaten part of our seed potatoes and that another part of  them was frost bitten  that butter is a dollar a pound  and none to be  had  even at that price  for days at a time   that wood alcohol is sixty   five cents a litre  and so on and so forth  i even feel that it is not  important that this war came  since it could not be escaped  and that  what alone is important is  that the major part of the peoples of the  world are standing upright on their feet  lifting their arms with a great  shout for liberty  justice  and honor  that a war of brute force for  conquest has defeated itself  and set free those who were to have  been its victims  it is not  i know  today or tomorrow that it will all  end  it is not next year  or in many years  that poor poland s three  mutilated parts can be joined and healed into harmony  and oh  how  long it is going to be before all the sorrow and hatred that germany  has brought on the world can be either comforted or forgotten  but at  least we are sure now of the course the treatment is going to take  so  the sun shines and my heart is high  and i do believe that though joy  may lead nowhere  sorrow is never in vain                              list of steel engravings     the castle of chaiiibord

xxviii     francis i  and charles v     the closer the study and the wider the contemplation a frenchman bestows  upon his country s history  the deeper will be his feelings of patriotic  pride  dashed with a tinge of sadness   france  in respect of her  national unity  is the most ancient amongst the states of christian  europe   during her long existence she has passed through very different  regimens  the chaos of barbarism  the feudal system  absolute monarchy   constitutional monarchy  and republicanism   under all these regimens she  has had no lack of greatness and glory  material power and intellectual  lustre  moral virtues and the charms of social life   her barbarism had  its charlemagne  her feudal system st  louis  joan of arc  and bayard   her absolute monarchy henry iv  and louis xiv   of our own times we say  nothing   france has shone in war and in peace  through the sword and  through the intellect  she has by turns conquered and beguiled   enlightened and troubled europe  she has always offered to the foreigner  a spectacle or an abode full of the curious and the attractive  of noble  pleasures and of mundane amusements   and still  after so many centuries  of such a grand and brilliant career  france has not yet attained the end  to which she ever aspired  to which all civilized communities aspire  and  that is  order in the midst of movement  security and liberty united and  lasting   she has had shortcomings which have prevented her from reaping  the full advantage of her merits  she has committed faults which have  involved her in reverses   two things  essential to political prosperity  amongst communities of men  have hitherto been to seek in her   predominance of public spirit over the spirit of caste or of profession   and moderation and fixity in respect of national ambition both at home  and abroad   france has been a victim to the personal passions of her  chiefs and to her own reckless changeability     we are entering upon the history of a period and a reign during which  this intermixture of merits and demerits  of virtues and vices  of  progress and backsliding  was powerfully and attractively exhibited  amongst the french   francis i   his government and his times commence  the era of modern france  and bring clearly to view the causes of her  greatnesses and her weaknesses     francis i  had received from god all the gifts that can adorn a man  he  was handsome and tall and strong  his armor  preserved in the louvre  is  that of a man six feet high  his eyes were brilliant and soft  his smile  was gracious  his manners were winning   from his very childhood he  showed that he had wits  enterprise  skill  and boldness   he was but  seven years old when   on the day of the conversion of st  paul  january            about two p  m   my king  my lord  my caesar  and my son  was  run away with  near amboise  by a hackney which had been given him by  marshal de gye  and so great was the danger that those who were present  thought it was all over  howbeit god  the protector of widowed women and  the defender of orphans  foreseeing things to come  was pleased not to  forsake me  knowing that  if accident had so suddenly deprived me of my  love  i should have been too utter a wretch    such is the account given  of this little incident by his mother  louise of savoy  who was at that  time habitually kept  by anne of brittany s jealousy  at a distance from  paris and the court     journal de louise de savoie  in the petitot  collection of  memoires sur l histoire de france   series i   t  xvi   p         some years later the young prince  who had become an ardent  huntsman  took the fancy into his head one day to let loose in the  courtyard of the castle of amboise a wild boar which he had just caught  in the forest   the animal came to a door  burst it open with a blow of  his snout  and walked up into the apartments   those who were there took  to their heels  but francis went after the boar  came up with him  killed  him with a swordthrust  and sent him rolling down the staircase into the  courtyard   when  in       louis xii  sent for the young duke of  angouleme and bade him go and defend picardy against the english  francis  had scarcely done anything beyond so employing his natural gifts as to  delight the little court of which he was the centre  an estimable trait   but very insufficient for the government of a people     when  two years afterwards  on the  st of january        he ascended the  throne before he had attained his one and twentieth year  it was a  brilliant and brave but spoiled child that became king   he had been  under the governance of artus gouffier  sire de boisy  a nobleman of  poitou  who had exerted himself to make his royal pupil a loyal knight   well trained in the moral code and all the graces of knighthood  but  without drawing his attention to more serious studies or preparing him  for the task of government   the young francis d angouleme lived and was  moulded under the influence of two women  his mother  louise of savoy   and his eldest sister  marguerite  who both of them loved and adored him  with passionate idolatry   it has just been shown in what terms louise of  savoy  in her daily collection of private memoranda  used to speak to  herself of her son   my king  my lord  my caesar  and my son    she was  proud  ambitious  audacious  or pliant at need  able and steadfast in  mind  violent and dissolute in her habits  greedy of pleasure and of  money as well as of power  so that she gave her son neither moral  principles nor a moral example  for him the supreme kingship  for herself  the rank  influence  and wealth of a queen mother  and  for both   greatness that might subserve the gratification of their passions  this  was all her dream and all her aim as a mother   of quite another sort  were the character and sentiments of marguerite de valois   she was born  on the   th of april        and was  therefore  only two years older than  her brother francis  but her more delicate nature was sooner and more  richly cultivated and developed   she was brought up with strictness by  a most excellent and most venerable dame  in whom all the virtues  at  rivalry one with another  existed together    madame de chatillon  whose  deceased husband had been governor to king charles viii    as she was  discovered to have rare intellectual gifts and a very keen relish for  learning  she was provided with every kind of preceptors  who made her  proficient in profane letters  as they were then called   marguerite  learned latin  greek  philosophy  and especially theology    at fifteen  years of age   says a contemporary   the spirit of god began to manifest  itself in her eyes  in her face  in her walk  in her speech  and   generally in all her actions     she had a heart   says brantome    mighty devoted to god  and she loved mightily to compose spiritual  songs            she also devoted herself to letters in her young days   and continued them as long as she lived  loving and conversing with  in  the time of her greatness  the most learned folks of her brother s  kingdom  who honored her so that they called her their maecenas    learning  however  was far from absorbing the whole of this young soul    she   says a contemporary   had an agreeable voice of touching tone   which roused the tender inclinations that there are in the heart    tenderness  a passionate tenderness  very early assumed the chief place  in marguerite s soul  and the first object of it was her brother francis   when mother  son  and sister were spoken of  they were called a trinity   and to this marguerite herself bore witness when she said  with charming  modesty                       such boon is mine  to feel the amity                 that god hath putten in our trinity                  wherein to make a third  i  all unfitted                 to be that number s shadow  am admitted      marguerite it was for whom this close communion of three persons had the  most dolorous consequences  we shall fall in with her more than once in  the course of this history  but  whether or no  she was assuredly the  best of this princely trio  and francis i   was the most spoiled by it   there is nothing more demoralizing than to be an idol     the first acts of his government were sensible and of good omen   he  confirmed or renewed the treaties or truces which louis xii   at the  close of his reign  had concluded with the venetians  the swiss  the  pope  the king of england  the archduke charles  and the emperor  maximilian  in order to restore peace to his kingdom   at home francis i   maintained at his council the principal and most tried servants of his  predecessor  amongst others the finance minister  florimond robertet  and  he raised to four the number of the marshals of france  in order to  confer that dignity on bayard s valiant friend  james of chabannes  lord  of la palice  who even under louis xii  had been entitled by the  spaniards  the great marshal of france    at the same time he exalted to  the highest offices in the state two new men  charles  duke of bourbon   who was still a mere youth  but already a warrior of renown  and anthony  duprat  the able premier president of the parliament of paris  the former  he made constable  and the latter chancellor of france   his mother   louise of savoy  was not unconcerned  it is said  in both promotions   she was supposed to feel for the young constable something more than  friendship  and she regarded the veteran magistrate  not without reason   as the man most calculated to unreservedly subserve the interests of the  kingly power and her own     these measures  together with the language and the behavior of francis  i   and the care he took to conciliate all who approached him  made a  favorable impression on france and on europe   in italy  especially   princes as well as people  and pope leo x  before all  flattered  themselves  or were pleased to appear as if they flattered themselves   that war would not come near them again  and that the young king had his  heart set only on making burgundy secure against sudden and outrageous  attacks from the swiss   the aged king of spain  ferdinand the catholic   adopting the views of his able minister  cardinal ximenes  alone showed  distrust and anxiety    go not to sleep   said he to his former allies    a single instant is enough to bring the french in the wake of their  master whithersoever he pleases to lead them  is it merely to defend  burgundy that the king of france is adding fifteen hundred lances to his  men at arms  and that a huge train of artillery is defiling into  lyonness  and little by little approaching the mountains       illustration  cardinal ximenes           ferdinand urged the pope  the emperor maximilian  the swiss  and  maximilian sforza  duke of milan  to form a league for the defence of  italy  but leo x   persisted in his desire of remaining or appearing  neutral  as the common father of the faithful   meanwhile the french  ambassador at rome  william bude   a man   says guicciardini   of  probably unique erudition amongst the men of our day   and  besides  a  man of keen and sagacious intellect  was unfolding the secret working of  italian diplomacy  and sending to paris demands for his recall  saying    withdraw me from this court full of falsehoods  this is a residence too  much out of my element    the answer was  that he should have patience   and still negotiate  for france  meeting ruse by ruse  was willing to be  considered hoodwinked  whilst the eyes of the pope  diverted by a hollow  negotiation  were prevented from seeing the peril which was gathering  round the italian league and its declared or secret champions    gaillard   histoire de francois  er   t  i   p           neither the king nor the pope had for long to take the trouble of  practising mutual deception   it was announced at rome that francis i    having arrived at lyons in july        had just committed to his mother   louise  the regency of the kingdom  and was pushing forward towards the  alps an army of sixty thousand men and a powerful artillery   he had won  over to his service octavian fregoso  doge of genoa  and barthelemy  d alviano  the veteran general of his allies the venetians  was encamped  with his troops within hail of verona  ready to support the french in the  struggle he foresaw   francis i   on his side  was informed that twenty  thousand swiss  commanded by the roman  prosper colonna  were guarding  the passes of the alps in order to shut him out from milaness   at the  same time he received the news that the cardinal of sion  his most  zealous enemy in connection with the roman church  was devotedly  employing  with the secret support of the emperor maximilian  his  influence and his preaching for the purpose of raising in switzerland  a second army of from twenty to five and twenty thousand men  to be  launched against him  if necessary  in italy   a spanish and roman army   under the orders of don raymond of cardone  rested motionless at some  distance from the po  waiting for events and for orders prescribing the  part they were to take   it was clear that francis i   though he had been  but six months king  was resolved and impatient to resume in italy  and  first of all in milaness  the war of invasion and conquest which had been  engaged in by charles viii   and louis xii   and the league of all the  states of italy save venice and genoa  with the pope for their  half hearted patron  and the swiss for their fighting men  were  collecting their forces to repel the invader     it was the month of august  the snow was diminishing and melting away  among the alps  and the king  with the main body of the army  joined at  embrun the constable de bourbon  who commanded the advance guard   but  the two passes of mount cenis and mount ginevra were strongly guarded by  the swiss  and others were sought for a little more to the south   a  shepherd  a chamois hunter  pointed out one whereby  he said  the  mountains might be crossed  and a descent made upon the plains of the  marquisate of saluzzo   the young constable went in person to examine the  spots pointed out by the shepherd  and  the statement having been  verified  it did not seem impossible to get the whole army over  even the  heavy artillery  and they essayed this unknown road   at several points   abysses had to be filled up  temporary bridges built  and enormous rocks  pierced  the men at arms marched on foot  with great difficulty dragging  their horses  with still greater difficulty the infantry hauled the  cannon over holes incompletely stopped and fragments of yawning rock   captains and soldiers set to work together  no labor seems too hard to  eager hope  and in five days the mountain was overcome  and the army  caught sight of the plain where the enemy might be encountered   a small  body of four hundred men at arms  led by marshal de chabannes  were the  first to descend into it  and among them was bayard    marshal   said he  to chabannes   we are told that over the po yonder is sir prosper colonna   with two thousand horse  in a town called villafranca  apprehending  nought and thinking of nought but gaudies   we must wake up his wits a  little  and this moment get into the saddle with all our troops  that he  be not warned by any     sir bayard   said the marshal   it is right well  said  but how shall we cross the river po  which is so impetuous and  broad     sir   said bayard   here is my lord de morette s brother  who  knows the ford  he shall cross first  and i after him    so they mounted  their horses  crossed the po  and  were soon there  where sir prosper  colonna was at table and was dining  as likewise were all his folk    bayard  who marched first  found the archers on guard in front of the  italian leader s quarters    yield you and utter no sound   cried he    else you are dead men    some set about defending themselves  the

roman noble      francis i  and the main body of his army had also arrived at the eastern  foot of the alps  and were advancing into the plains of the country of  saluzzo and piedmont   the swiss  dumbfounded at so unexpected an  apparition  fell back to novara  the scene of that victory which two  years previously had made them so proud   a rumor spread that negotiation  was possible  and that the question of milaness might be settled without  fighting   the majority of the french captains repudiated the idea  but  the king entertained it   his first impulses were sympathetic and  generous    i would not purchase   said he to marshal de lautrec   with  the blood of my subjects  or even with that of my enemies  what i can pay  for with money    parleys were commenced  and an agreement was hit upon  with conditions on which the swiss would withdraw from italy and resume  alliance with the french   a sum of seven hundred thousand crowns  it was  said  was the chief condition  and the king and the captains of his army  gave all they had  even to their plate  for the first instalment which  lautrec was ordered to convey to bufalora  where the swiss were to  receive it   but it was suddenly announced that the second army of twenty  thousand swiss  which the cardinal of sion had succeeded in raising  had  entered italy by the valley of the ticino   they formed a junction with  their countrymen  the cardinal recommenced his zealous preaching against  the french  the newcomers rejected the stipulated arrangements  and   confident in their united strength  all the swiss made common accord   lautrec  warned in time  took with all speed his way back to the french  army  carrying away with him the money he had been charged to pay over   the venetian general  d alviano  went to the french camp to concert with  the king measures for the movements of his troops  and on both sides  nothing was thought of but the delivery of a battle     on the   th of september        about midday  the constable de bourbon  gave notice to the king  encamped at melegnano  a town about three  leagues from milan   that the swiss  sallying in large masses from milan   at the noisy summons of the bull of uri and the cow of unterwalden  were  advancing to attack    the king  who was purposing to sit down to supper   left it on the spot  and went off straight towards the enemy  who were  already engaged in skirmishing  which lasted a long while before they  were at the great game   the king had great numbers of lanzknechts  the  which would fain have done a bold deed in crossing a ditch to go after  the swiss  but these latter let seven or eight ranks cross  and then  thrust you them back in such sort that all that had crossed got hurled  into the ditch   the said lanzknechts were mighty frightened  and but for  the aid of a troop of men at arms  amongst the which was the good knight  bayard  who bore down right through the swiss  there had been a sad  disaster there  for it was now night  and night knows no shame   a band  of swiss came passing in front of the king  who charged them gallantly   there was heavy fighting there and much danger to the king s person  for  his great buffe  the top of the visor of his helmet  was pierced  so as  to let in daylight  by the thrust of a pike   it was now so late that  they could not see one another  and the swiss were  for this evening   forced to retire on the one side  and the french on the other   they  lodged as they could  but well i trow that none did rest at ease   the  king of france put as good a face on matters as the least of all his  soldiers did  for he remained all night a horseback like the rest   according to other accounts he had a little sleep  lying on a  gun carriage       illustration  all night a horseback           on the morrow at daybreak the swiss were for beginning again  and they  came straight towards the french artillery  from which they had a good  peppering   howbeit  never did men fight better  and the affair lasted  three or four good hours   at last they were broken and beaten  and there  were left on the field ten or twelve thousand of them   the remainder  in  pretty good order along a high road  withdrew to milan  whither they were  pursued sword in hand      histoire du bon chevalier sans peur et sans  reproehe   t  ii   pp              the very day after the battle francis i  wrote to his mother the regent a  long account  alternately ingenuous and eloquent  in which the details  are set forth with all the complacency of a brave young man who is

trivulzio  who  had taken part in seventeen battles  said that this was a strife of  giants  beside which all the rest were but child s play   on the very  battle field   before making and creating knights of those who had done  him good service  francis i  was pleased to have himself made knight by  the hand of bayard    sir   said bayard   the king of so noble a realm   he who has been crowned  consecrated and anointed with oil sent down from  heaven  he who is the eldest son of the church  is knight over all other  knights     bayard  my friend   said the king   make haste  we must have  no laws or canons quoted here  do my bidding     assuredly  sir   said  bayard   i will do it  since it is your pleasure   and  taking his sword    avail it as much   said he   as if i were roland or oliver  godfrey or  his brother baldwin  please god  sir  that in war you may never take  flight   and  holding up his sword in the air  he cried   assuredly  my  good sword  thou shalt be well

at the commencement of a new reign and  under the impulse communicated by a young king  an event which seemed to  be decisive and likely to remain so for a long while   of all the  sovereigns engaged in the italian league against francis i   he who was  most anxious to appear temperate and almost neutral  namely  leo x   was  precisely he who was most surprised and most troubled by it   when he  knew that a battle was on the eve of being fought between the french and  the swiss  he could not conceal his anxiety and his desire that the swiss  might be victorious   the venetian ambassador at rome  marino giorgi   whose feelings were quite the other way  took  in his diplomatic  capacity  a malicious pleasure in disquieting him    holy father   said  he   the most christian king is there

array  repaired to the pope s  and the people who saw him passing by in  such state said   the news is certainly true    on reaching the pope s  apartment the ambassador met the chamberlain  who told him that the holy  father was still asleep    wake him   said he  but the other refused    do as i tell you   insisted the ambassador   the chamberlain went in   and the pope  only half dressed  soon sallied from his room    holy  father   said the venetian   your holiness yesterday gave me some bad  news which was false  to day i have to give you some good news which is  true  the swiss are beaten    the pope read the letters brought by the  ambassador  and some other letters also    what will come of it for us  and for you   asked the pope    for us   was the answer   nothing but  good  since we are with the most christian king  and your holiness will  not have aught of evil to suffer     sir ambassador   rejoined the pope    we will see what the most christian king will do  we will place  ourselves in his hands  demanding mercy of him     holy father  your  holiness will not come to the least harm  any more than the holy see  is  not the most christian king the church s own son

not like the idea of having to give  himself much trouble       illustration  leo x            leo x  made up his mind without much trouble to accept accomplished  facts   when he had been elected pope  he had said to his brother  julian  de  medici   enjoy we the papacy  since god hath given it us    godiamoci  il papato  poiche dio ci l  ha dato     he appeared to have no further  thought than how to pluck from the event the advantages he could discover  in it   his allies all set him an example of resignation   on the   th of  september  the day after the battle  the swiss took the road back to  their mountains   francis i  entered milan in triumph   maximilian sforza  took refuge in the castle  and twenty days afterwards  on the  th of  october  surrendered  consenting to retire to france with a pension of  thirty thousand crowns  and the promise of being recommended for a  cardinal s hat  and almost consoled for his downfall  by the pleasure of  being delivered from the insolence of the swiss  the exactions of the  emperor maximilian  and the rascalities of the spaniards    fifteen years  afterwards  in june        he died in oblivion at paris   francis i   regained possession of all milaness  adding thereto  with the pope s  consent  the duchies of parma and piacenza  which had been detached from  it in        two treaties  one of november          and the other of  november           re established not only peace  but perpetual alliance   between the king of france and the thirteen swiss cantons  with  stipulated conditions in detail   whilst these negotiations were in  progress  francis i  and leo x   by a treaty published at viterbo on the    th of october  proclaimed their hearty reconciliation   the pope  guaranteed to francis i  the duchy of milan  restored to him those of  parma and piacenza  and recalled his troops which were still serving  against the venetians  being careful  however  to cover his concessions  by means of forms and pretexts which gave them the character of a  necessity submitted to rather than that of an independent and definite  engagement   francis i   on his side  guaranteed to the pope all the  possessions of the church  renounced the patronage of the petty princes  of the ecclesiastical estate  and promised to uphold the family of the  medici in the position it had held at florence since  with the king of  spain s aid  in       it had recovered the dominion there at the expense  of the party of republicans and friends of france     the king of france and the pope had to discuss together questions far  more important on both sides than those which had just been thus settled  by their accredited agents   when they signed the treaty of viterbo  it  was agreed that the two sovereigns should have a personal interview  at  which they should come to an arrangement upon points of which they had as  yet said nothing   rome seemed the place most naturally adapted for this  interview  but the pope did not wish that francis i  should go and  display his triumph there   besides  he foresaw that the king would speak  to him about the kingdom of naples  the conquest of which was evidently  premeditated by the king  and when francis i   having arrived at rome   had already done half the journey  leo x  feared that it would be more  difficult to divert him   he resolved to make to the king a show of  deference to conceal his own disquietude  and offered to go and meet him  at bologna  the town in the roman states which was nearest to milaness   francis accepted the offer   the pope arrived at bologna on the  th of  december        and the king the next day   after the public ceremonies   at which the king showed eagerness to tender to the pope acts of homage  which the pope was equally eager to curtail without repelling them  the  two sovereigns conversed about the two questions which were uppermost in  their minds   francis did not attempt to hide his design of reconquering  the kingdom of naples  which ferdinand the catholic had wrongfully  usurped  and he demanded the pope s countenance   the pope did not care  to refuse  but he pointed out to the king that everything foretold the  very near death of king ferdinand  and  your majesty   said he   will  then have a natural opportunity for claiming your rights  and as for me   free  as i shall then be  from my engagements with the king of arragon in  respect of the crown of naples  i shall find it easier to respond to your  majesty s wish    the pope merely wanted to gain time   francis  setting  aside for the moment the kingdom of naples  spoke of charles vii  s  pragmatic sanction  and the necessity of putting an end to the  difficulties which had arisen on this subject between the court of rome  and the kings of france  his predecessors    as to that   said the pope    i could not grant what your predecessors demanded  but be not uneasy   i have a compensation to propose to you which will prove to you how dear  your interests are to me    the two sovereigns had  without doubt   already come to an understanding on this point  when  after a three days   interview with leo x   francis i  returned to milan  leaving at bologna   for the purpose of treating in detail the affair of the pragmatic  sanction  his chancellor  duprat  who had accompanied him during all this  campaign as his adviser and negotiator     in him the king had  under the name and guise of premier magistrate of  the realm  a servant whose bold and complacent abilities he was not slow  to recognize and to put in use   being irritated  for that many  not  having the privilege of sportsmen  do take beasts  both red and black  as  hares  pheasants  partridges  and other game  thus frustrating us of our  diversion and pastime that we take in the chase   francis i  issued  in  march        an ordinance which decreed against poachers the most severe  penalties  and even death  and which  granted to all princes  lords  and  gentlemen possessing forests or warrens in the realm  the right of  upholding therein by equally severe punishments the exclusive privileges  of their preserves    the parliament made remonstrances against such  excessive rigor  and refused to register the ordinance   the chancellor   duprat  insisted  and even threatened    to the king alone   said he    belongs the right of regulating the administration of his state obey  or  the king will see in you only rebels  whom he will know how to chastise    for a year the parliament held out  but the chancellor persisted more  obstinately in having his way  and  on the   th of february        the  ordinance was registered under a formal order from the king  to which the  name was given of  letters of command       illustration  anthony duprat           at the commencement of the war for the conquest of milaness there was a  want of money  and francis i   hesitated to so soon impose new taxes   duprat gave a scandalous extension to a practice which had been for a  long while in use  but had always been reprobated and sometimes formally  prohibited  namely  the sale of public appointments or offices  not only  did he create a multitude of financial and administrative offices  the  sale of which brought considerable sums into the treasury  but he  introduced the abuse into the very heart of the judicial body  the  tribunals were encumbered by newly created magistrates   the estates of  languedoc complained in vain   the parliament of paris was in its turn  attacked   in       three councillors  recently nominated  were convicted  of having paid  one three thousand eight hundred livres  and the two  others six thousand livres   the parliament refused to admit them   duprat protested   the necessities of the state  he said  made borrowing  obligatory  and the king was free to prefer in his selections those of  his subjects who showed most zeal for his service   parliament persisted  in its refusal   duprat resolved to strike a great blow   an edict of  january           created within the parliament a fourth chamber   composed of eighteen councillors and two presidents  all of fresh  and   no doubt  venal appointment  though the edict dared not avow as much   two great personages  the archbishop of aix and marshal de montmorenci   were charged to present the edict to parliament and require its  registration   the parliament demanded time for deliberation   it kept an  absolute silence for six weeks  and at last presented an address to the  queen mother  trying to make her comprehend the harm such acts did to the  importance of the magistracy and to her son s government   louise  appeared touched by these representations  and promised to represent  their full weight to the king   if the parliament will consent to point  out to me of itself any other means of readily raising the sum of one  hundred and twenty thousand livres  which the king absolutely cannot do  without    the struggle was prolonged until the parliament declared  that  it could not  without offending god and betraying its own conscience   proceed to the registration  but that if it were the king s pleasure to  be obeyed at any price  he had only to depute his chancellor or some  other great personage  in whose presence and on whose requirement the  registration should take place    chancellor duprat did not care to  undertake this commission in person   count de st  pol  governor of  paris  was charged with it  and the court caused to be written at the  bottom of the letters of command   read and published in presence of  count de st  pol  specially deputed for this purpose  who ordered viva  voce  in the king s name  that they be executed      thus began to be implanted in that which should be the most respected and  the most independent amongst the functions of government  namely  the  administration of justice  not only the practice  but the fundamental  maxim  of absolute government    i am going to the court  and i will  speak the truth  after which the king will have to be obeyed   was said  in the middle of the seventeenth century by the premier president mold to  cardinal de retz   chancellor duprat  if we are not mistaken  was  in the  sixteenth century  the first chief of the french magistracy to make use  of language despotic not only in fact  but also in principle   president  mole was but the head of a body invested  so far as the king was  concerned  with the right of remonstrance and resistance  when once that  right was exercised  he might  without servility  give himself up to  resignation   chancellor duprat was the delegate  the organ  the  representative of the king  it was in the name of the king himself that  he affirmed the absolute power of the kingship and the absolute duty of  submission   francis i  could not have committed the negotiation with leo  x  in respect of charles vii  s pragmatic sanction to a man with more  inclination and better adapted for the work to be accomplished     the pragmatic sanction had three principal objects                to uphold the liberties and the influence of the faithful in the       government of the church  by sanctioning their right to elect       ministers of the christian faith  especially parish priests and       bishops              to guarantee the liberties and rights of the church herself in       her relations with her head  the pope  by proclaiming the necessity       for the regular intervention of councils and their superiority in       regard to the pope              to prevent or reform abuses in the relations of the papacy with       the state and church of france in the matter of ecclesiastical       tribute  especially as to the receipt by the pope  under the name of       annates  of the first year s revenue of the different ecclesiastical       offices and benefices     in the fifteenth century it was the general opinion in france  in state  and in church  that there was in these dispositions nothing more than the  primitive and traditional liberties and rights of the christian church   there was no thought of imposing upon the papacy any new regimen  but  only of defending the old and legitimate regimen  recognized and upheld  by st  louis in the thirteenth century as well as by charles vii  in the  fifteenth     the popes  nevertheless  had all of them protested since the days of  charles vii  against the pragmatic sanction as an attack upon their  rights  and had demanded its abolition   in       louis xi   as has  already been shown  had yielded for a moment to the demand of pope pius  ii   whose countenance he desired to gain  and had abrogated the  pragmatic  but  not having obtained what he wanted thereby  and having  met with strong opposition in the parliament of paris to his concession   he had let it drop without formally retracting it  and  instead of  engaging in a conflict with parliament upon the point  he thought it no  bad plan for the magistracy to uphold in principle and enforce in fact  the regulations of the pragmatic sanction   this important edict  then   was still vigorous in       when francis i   after his victory at  melegnano and his reconciliation with the pope  left chancellor duprat  at bologna to pursue the negotiation reopened on that subject   the  compensation  of which leo x   on redemanding the abolition of the  pragmatic sanction  had given a peep to francis i   could not fail to  have charms for a prince so little scrupulous  and for his still less  scrupulous chancellor   the pope proposed that the pragmatic  once for  all abolished  should be replaced by a concordat between the two  sovereigns  and that this concordat  whilst putting a stop to the  election of the clergy by the faithful  should transfer to the king the  right of nomination to bishoprics and other great ecclesiastical offices  and benefices  reserving to the pope the right of presentation of  prelates nominated by the king   this  considering the condition of  society and government in the sixteenth century  in the absence of  political and religious liberty  was to take away from the church her own  existence  and divide her between two masters  without giving her  as  regarded either of them  any other guarantee of independence than the  mere chance of their dissensions and quarrels     egotism  even in kings  has often narrow and short sighted views   it was  calculated that there were in france at this period ten archbishoprics   eighty three bishoprics  and five hundred and twenty seven abbeys   francis i  and his chancellor saw in the proposed concordat nothing but  the great increment of influence it secured to them  by making all the  dignitaries of the church suppliants at first and then clients of the  kingship   after some difficulties as to points of detail  the concordat  was concluded and signed on the   th of august         five months  afterwards  on the  th of february        the king repaired in person to  parliament  to which he had summoned many prelates and doctors of the  university   the chancellor explained the points of the concordat  and  recapitulated all the facts which  according to him  had made it  necessary   the king ordered its registration   for the good of his  kingdom and for quittance of the promise he had given the pope    parliament on one side  and the prelates and doctors of the university  on the other  deliberated upon this demand   their first answer was that   as the matter concerned the interest of the whole gallican church  they  could not themselves decide about it  and that the church  assembled in  national council  alone had the right of pronouncing judgment    oho  so  you cannot   said the king   i will soon let you see that you can  or i  will send you all to rome to give the pope your reasons    to the  question of conscience the parliament found thenceforth added the  question of dignity   the magistrates raised difficulties in point of  form  and asked for time to discuss the matter fundamentally  and  deputies went to carry their request to the king   he admitted the  propriety of delay  but with this comment   i know that there are in my  parliament good sort of men  wise men  but i also know that there are  turbulent and rash fools  i have my eye upon them  and i am informed of  the language they dare to hold about my conduct   i am king as my  predecessors were  and i mean to be obeyed as they were   you are  constantly vaporing to me about louis xii  and his love of justice  know  ye that justice is as dear to me as it was to him  but that king  just as  he was  often drove out from the kingdom rebels  though they were members  of parliament  do not force me to imitate him in his severity    parliament entered upon a fundamental examination of the question  their  deliberations lasted from the   th to the   th of july        and the  conclusion they came to was  that parliament could not and ought not to  register the concordat  that  if the king persisted in his intention of  making it a law of the realm  he must employ the same means as charles  vii  had employed for establishing the pragmatic sanction  and that   therefore  he must summon a general council   on the   th of january         two councillors arrived at amboise  bringing to the king the  representations of the parliament   when their arrival was announced to  the king   before i receive them   said he   i will drag them about at my  heels as long as they have made me wait    he received them  however  and  handed their representations over to the chancellor  bidding him reply to  them   duprat made a learned and specious reply  but one which left  intact the question of right  and  at bottom  merely defended the  concordat on the ground of the king s good pleasure and requirements of  policy   on the last day of february        the king gave audience to the  deputies  and handed them the chancellor s reply   they asked to examine  it    you shall not examine it   said the king   this would degenerate  into an endless process   a hundred of your heads  in parliament  have  been seven months and more painfully getting up these representations   which my chancellor has blown to the winds in a few days   there is but  one king in france  i have done all i could to restore peace to my  kingdom  and i will not allow nullification here of that which i brought  about with so much difficulty in italy   my parliament would set up for a  venetian senate  let it confine its meddling to the cause of justice   which is worse administered than it has been for a hundred years  i  ought  perhaps  to drag it about at my heels  like the grand council  and  watch more closely over its conduct    the two deputies made an attempt  to prolong their stay at amboise  but   if before six to morrow morning    said the king   they be not gone  i will send some archers to take them  and cast them into a dungeon for six months  and woe to whoever dares to  speak to me for them      on returning to paris the deputies were beginning to give their fellows  an account of how harsh a reception they met with  when louis de la  tremoille  the most respected amongst the chiefs of the army  entered the  hall   he came by order of the king to affirm to the parliament that to  dismiss the concordat was to renew the war  and that it must obey on the  instant or profess open rebellion   parliament upheld its decision of  july           against the concordat  at the same time begging la  tremoille to write to the king to persuade him  if he insisted upon  registration  to send some person of note or to commission la tremoille  himself to be present at the act  and to see indorsed upon the concordat    read  published  and registered at the king s most express command  several times repeated  in presence of            specially deputed by  him for that purpose    tremoille hesitated to write  and exhibited the  letters whereby the king urged him to execute the strict orders laid upon  him    what are those orders  then   asked the premier president    that  is the king s secret   answered la tremoille   i may not reveal it  all  that i can tell you is  that i should never have peace of mind if you  forced me to carry them out    the parliament in its excitement begged la  tremoille to withdraw  and sent for him back almost immediately    choose   said the premier president to him   between saturday or monday  next to be present at the registration    la tremoille chose monday   wishing to allow himself time for an answer even yet from the king   but  no new instructions came to him  and on the   d of march         parliament proceeded to registration of the concordat  with the forms and  reservations which they had announced  and which were evidence of  compulsion   the other parliaments of france followed with more or less  zeal  according to their own particular dispositions  the example shown  by that of paris   the university was heartily disposed to push  resistance farther than had been done by parliament  its rector caused to  be placarded on the   th of march        in the streets of paris  an  order forbidding all printers and booksellers to print the concordat on  pain of losing their connection with the university   the king commanded  informations to be filed against the authors and placarders of the order   and  on the   th of april  sent to the parliament an edict  which forbade  the university to meddle in any matter of public police  or to hold any  assembly touching such matters  under pain  as to the whole body  of  having its privileges revoked  and  as to individuals  of banishment and  confiscation   the king s party demanded of parliament registration of  this edict   parliament confined itself to writing to the king  agreeing  that the university had no right to meddle in affairs of government  but  adding that there were strong reasons  of which it would give an account  whenever the king should please to order  why it  the parliament  should  refuse registration of the edict   it does not appear that the king ever  asked for such account  or that his wrath against the university was more  obstinately manifested   the concordat was registered  and francis i    after having achieved an official victory over the magistrates  had small  stomach for pursuing extreme measures against the men of letters     we have seen that in the course of the fifteenth century  there were made  in france two able and patriotic attempts  the pragmatic sanction  in        under charles vii   and the states general of       under charles  viii   we do not care to discuss here all the dispositions of those acts   some of them were  indeed  questionable  but they both of them  one in  respect of the church and the other of the state  aimed at causing france  to make a great stride towards a national  free and legalized regimen  to  which french feudal society had never known how or been willing to adjust  itself   these two attempts failed   it would be unjust to lay the blame  on the contemporary governments   charles vii  was in earnest about the  pragmatic sanction which he submitted to the deliberations and votes of a  national council  and louis xi   after having for a while given it up to  the pope  retraced his steps and left it in force   as to the states  general of       neither the regent  anne de beaujeu  nor charles viii    offered the slightest hinderance to their deliberations and their votes   and if louis xii  did not convoke the states afresh  he constantly strove  in the government of his kingdom to render them homage and give them  satisfaction   we may feel convinced that  considering the social and  intellectual condition of france at this time  these two patriotic  attempts were premature  but a good policy  being premature  is not on  that account alone condemned to failure  what it wants is time to get  itself comprehended  appreciated  and practised gradually and  consistently   if the successors of louis xii   had acted in the same  spirit and with the same view as their predecessor  france would probably  have made progress in this salutary path   but exactly the contrary took  place   instead of continuing a more and more free and legal regimen   francis i  and his chancellor  duprat  loudly proclaimed and practised  the maxims of absolute power  in the church  the pragmatic sanction was  abolished  and in the state  francis i   during a reign of thirty two  years  did not once convoke the states general  and labored only to set  up the sovereign right of his own sole will   the church was despoiled  of her electoral autonomy  and the magistracy  treated with haughty and  silly impertinence  was vanquished and humiliated in the exercise of its  right of remonstrance   the concordat of      was not the only  but it  was the gravest pact of alliance concluded between the papacy and the  french kingship for the promotion mutually of absolute power     whilst this question formed the subject of disputes in france between the  great public authorities  there was springing up  outside of france   between the great european powers another not more grave in regard to a  distant future  but more threatening in regard to the present peace of  nations   king ferdinand the catholic had died on the   d of january         and his grandson and successor  archduke charles  anxious to go and  take possession of the throne of spain  had hastily concluded with  francis i   on the   th of august        at noyon  a treaty intended to  settle differences between the two crowns as to the kingdoms of naples  and navarre   the french and spanish plenipotentiaries  sires de boisy  and de chievres  were still holding meetings at montpellier  trying to  come to an understanding about the execution of this treaty  when the  death of emperor maximilian at wels  in austria  on the   th of january         occurred to add the vacant throne of a great power to the two  second rate thrones already in dispute between two powerful princes   three claimants  charles of austria  who was the new king of spain   francis i   and henry viii   king of england  aspired to this splendid  heritage   in       maximilian himself  in one of his fits of temper and  impecuniosity  had offered to abdicate and give up the imperial dignity  to henry viii  for a good round sum  but the king of england s envoy  dr   cuthbert tunstall  a stanch and clearsighted servant  who had been sent  to germany to deal with this singular proposal  opened his master s eyes  to its hollowness and falsehood  and henry viii  held himself aloof   francis i  remained the only rival of charles of austria  maximilian  labored eagerly to pave the way for his grandson s success  and at his  death the struggle between the two claimants had already become so keen  that francis i   on hearing the news  exclaimed   i will spend three  millions to be elected emperor  and i swear that  three years after the  election  i will be either at constantinople or dead      the turks  who had been since      settled at constantinople  were the  terror of christian europe  and germany especially had need of a puissant  and valiant defender against them   francis i  calculated that the  christians of germany and hungary would see in him  the king of france  and the victor of melegnano  their most imposing and most effectual  champion     having a superficial mind and being full of vain confidence  francis i   was mistaken about the forces and chances on his side  as well as about  the real and natural interests of france  and also his own   there was no  call for him to compromise himself in this electoral struggle of kings   and in a distant war against triumphant islamry   he miscalculated the  strong position and personal valor of the rival with whom he would have  to measure swords   charles of austria was but nineteen  and francis i   was twenty three  when they entered  as antagonists  into the arena of  european politics   charles had as yet gained no battle and won no  renown  while francis i  was already a victorious king and a famous  knight   but the young archduke s able governor  william de croy  lord of  chievres   had early trained him   says m  mignet   to the understanding  and management of his various interests  from the time that he was  fifteen  charles presided every day at his council  there he himself read  out the contents of despatches which were delivered to him the moment  they arrived  were it even in the dead of night  his council had become  his school  and business served him for books            being naturally  endowed with superior parts  a penetrating intellect and rare firmness of  character  he schooled himself to look fortune in the face without being  intoxicated by her smiles or troubled at her frowns  to be astonished by  nothing that happened  and to make up his mind in any danger   he had  even now the will of an emperor and an overawing manner   his dignity and  loftiness of soul are such   says a contemporary writer   that he seems  to hold the universe under his feet     charles s position in germany was  as strong as the man himself  he was a german  a duke of austria  of the  imperial line  as natural a successor of his grandfather maximilian at  frankfort as of his grandfather ferdinand at madrid   such was the  adversary  with such advantages of nationality and of person  against  whom francis i   without any political necessity  and for the sole  purpose of indulging an ambitious vision and his own kingly self esteem   was about to engage in a struggle which was to entail a heavy burden on  his whole life  and bring him not in triumph to constantinople  but in  captivity to madrid     before the death of maximilian  and when neither party had done more than  foresee the struggle and get ready for it  francis i  was for some time  able to hope for some success   seven german princes  three  ecclesiastical and four laic  the archbishops of mayence  cologne  and  troves  and the duke of saxony  the margrave of brandenburg  the count  palatine of the rhine  and the king of bohemia  had the sole power of  electing the emperor   four of them  the archbishops of troves and of  cologne  the count palatine of the rhine and the margrave of brandenburg   had favorably received the overtures of francis i   and had promised him  their suffrages   his devoted servant  robert de la marck  lord of  fleuranges  had brought to him at amboise a german gentleman from the  palatinate  franz von sickingen   of very petty family  but a very gentle  companion   says fleuranges   the most beautiful talker that i think i  ever saw in my life  and in so much that there was no gentleman in  germany  prince or man of war  who would not have been glad to do him  pleasure    francis i  had received him with very chivalrous grace  and  had given him a pension of three thousand livres and handsome presents  for his comrades in adventure  and sickingen was so charmed that he said  to fleuranges on leaving amboise   the king did not open his heart to me  on the subject of the empire  however  i know all about it  and i beg you  to tell him that i will do his service and keep the oath i gave him    a more important personage than sickingen  leo x   would have been very  glad to have for emperor in germany neither the king of france nor the  king of spain  both of them being far too powerful in europe and far too  emulous in italy not to be dangerous enemies or inconvenient allies for  him  and he tried to dissuade francis i  from making any claim to the  empire  and to induce him to employ his influence in bringing about the  election of a second rate german prince  frederick the wise  duke of  saxony  who was justly popular in germany  and who would never be in a  condition to do france any harm   it was judicious advice and a policy  good for france as well as for europe in general  but francis i    infatuated by his desire and his hope  did not relish it at all  and leo  x   being obliged to choose between the two great claimants  declared for  francis i   without any pleasure or confidence  but also without any  great perplexity  for he had but little faith in the success which he  made a show of desiring   francis  deceived by these appearances and  promises  on the part both of ecclesiastics and laics  held language  breathing a gallant and almost careless confidence    we are not enemies   your master and i   he said to the ambassadors of spain   we are two  lovers courting the same mistress  whichever of the two she may prefer   the other will have to submit  and harbor no resentment    but when   shortly after maximilian s death  the struggle became closer and the  issue nearer  the inequality between the forces and chances of the two  rivals became quite manifest  and francis i  could no longer affect the  same serenity   he had intrusted the management of his affairs in germany  to a favorite comrade of his early youth  admiral de bonnivet  a soldier  and a courtier  witty  rash  sumptuous  eager to display his master s  power and magnificence   charles of austria s agents  and at their head  his aunt margaret  who had the government of the low countries in his  absence  were experienced  deliberate  discreet  more eager to succeed in  their purpose than to make a brilliant appearance  and resolved to do  quietly whatever was necessary for success   and to do so they were  before long as fully authorized as they were resolved   they discovered  that francis i  had given bonnivet four hundred thousand crowns in gold  that he might endeavor to bribe the electors  it was  according to  report  double the sum charles of austria had promised for the same  object  and his agents sent him information of it  and received this  answer   we are wholly determined to spare nothing and to stake all for  all upon it  as the matter we most desire and have most at heart in this  world            the election must be secured  whatever it may cost me    the question before the seven elective princes who were to dispose of the  empire was thenceforth merely which of the two claimants would be the  higher and the safer bidder   francis i  engaged in a tussle of wealth  and liberality with charles of austria   one of his agents wrote to him    all will go well if we can fill the maw of the margrave joachim of  brandenburg  he and his brother the elector from mayence fall every day  into deeper depths of avarice  we must hasten to satisfy them with   speed  speed  speed     francis i  replied   i will have marquis joachim   gorged  at any price   and he accordingly made over to him in ready  money and bills of short dates all that was asked for by the margrave   who on the  th of april        gave a written undertaking to support the  candidature  of the most invincible and most christian prince  francis   by the grace of god king of the french  duke of milan  and lord of genoa   who  what with his vigorous age  his ability  his justice  his military  experience  the brilliant fortune of his arms  and all other qualities  required for war and the management of the commonwealth  surpasses  in  the judgment of every one  all other christian princes    but charles of  austria did not consider himself beaten because two of the seven electors  displayed avarice and venality   his aunt margaret and his principal  agent in germany  the chamberlain armerstoff  resumed financial  negotiations with the archbishop of mayence  for his brother the margrave  as well as for himself  and the archbishop  without any formal  engagement  accepted the austrian over bid    i am ashamed at his  shamelessness   wrote armerstorff to charles   alternate and antagonistic  bargaining went on thus for more than two months   the archbishop of  cologne  hermann von wied  kept wavering between the two claimants  but  he was careful to tell john d albret  francis i  s agent  that  he  sincerely hoped that his majesty would follow the doctrine of god  who  gave as much to those who went to work in his vineyard towards the middle  of the day as to those who had been at it all the morning    duke  frederick of saxony was the only one of the seven electors who absolutely  refused to make any promise  as well as to accept any offer  and  preserved his independence  as well as his dignity   the rumor of all  these traffickings and these uncertainties rekindled in henry viii   king  of england  a fancy for placing himself once more in the ranks  but his  agent  richard pace  found the negotiations too far advanced and the  prices too high for him to back up this vain whim of his master s  and  henry viii  abandoned it   the diet had been convoked for the   th of  june at frankfort   the day was drawing near  and which of the two  parties had the majority was still regarded as  uncertain   franz von  sickingen appeared in the outskirts of frankfort with more than twenty  thousand men of the german army   whereat marvellously astonished   says  fleuranges   were they who wished well to the king of france and very  mightily rejoiced they who wished well to the catholic king    the gentleman adventurer had not been less accessible than the  prince electors to bribery   the diet opened on the   th of june   the  archbishop of mayence made a great speech in favor of charles of austria   and the archbishop of troves spoke in favor of francis i   to whom he had  remained faithful   rival intrigues were kept up  sickingen and his  troops were a clog upon deliberation  the electors were embarrassed and  weary of their dissensions  and the archbishop of troves proposed by way  of compromise the election of the duke of saxony  frederick the wise   who  at this crisis so shameful for his peers  had just given fresh  proofs of his sound judgment  his honesty  and his patriotic  independence   but frederick declined the honor it was intended to do  him  and which he considered beyond his powers to support  and he voted  for archduke charles   a real german prince   said he   the choice of  whom seemed to him most natural in point of right and most suitable in  point of fact under the present circumstances of europe    the six other  electors gave in to his opinion  and that same day  june            unanimously elected the king of spain  charles  king of the romans and  emperor of germany  with the title of charles v      illustration  charles v           whatever pains were taken by francis i  to keep up a good appearance  after this heavy reverse  his mortification was profound  and he thought  of nothing but getting his revenge   he flattered himself he would find  something of the sort in a solemn interview and an appearance of alliance  with henry viii   king of england  who had  like himself  just undergone  in the election to the empire a less flagrant but an analogous reverse   it had already  in the previous year and on the occasion of a treaty  concluded between the two kings for the restitution of tournai to france   been settled that they should meet before long in token of  reconciliation   allusion had even been made  at that period  to a much  more important restitution  of calais in fact  for which francis i   at  what price we know not  had obtained the advocacy of cardinal wolsey  who  was then all powerful with henry viii    of what use to us   wolsey had  said   is this town of calais  where in time of peace as well as of war  we have to keep up such numerous garrisons  which costs us so much money   and which so often forces us to measures contrary to the real interests  of england    but this idea was vehemently scouted by the english  and  the coming interview between the two kings remained the sole accessory of  the treaty of        after charles v  s election to the empire  francis  i  was eager to claim this interview  which was sure to cause in europe  the impression of a close understanding between the two kings before the  very eyes of their common rival   a convention  signed on the   th of  march        regulated its details   it was stipulated that the two kings  should meet in picardy between guines  an english possession in the  neighborhood of calais  and ardres  which belonged to france   but  so  soon as charles v   at that time in spain  was informed of this design   he used all his efforts to make it abortive   henry  however  stood firm   not that he had resolved to knit himself closely with francis i  against  the new emperor  whom  a few months previously  he had shown alacrity in  felicitating upon his accession to the empire  but he was unwilling to  fail in his promise to the king of france  and he liked to assume in  respect of the two rivals the part of an arbiter equally courted by both   charles v   still actively working against the interview  entered into  secret negotiation with cardinal wolsey to obtain for himself also an  interview with henry viii   which would destroy the effect of that in  course of arrangement between the kings of france and england   in  writing to wolsey he called him his  very dear friend   and guaranteed  him a pension of seven thousand ducats  secured upon two spanish  bishoprics  and on the   th of may        henry viii  received at  canterbury  as he was passing by on his way to embark at dover for the  interview in france  the as it were unexpected information that charles  v  had just arrived with his fleet at the port of hythe   the king  immediately sent wolsey to meet the emperor  who disembarked at dover   whither henry went to visit him  and the two sovereigns repaired together  to canterbury  where they went in state to the cathedral   resplendent    says erasmus   with all the precious gifts it had received for so many  centuries  especially with the most precious of all  the chest containing  the remains of thomas a becket  so magnificent that gold was the least of  its ornaments    there they passed three days  treating of their affairs  in the midst of galas  during which charles v  completely won over wolsey  by promising to help him to become pope   on the   st of may         charles  quite easy about the interview in france  embarked at sandwich  for his flemish possessions  and henry viii  made sail for calais  his  point of departure to the place agreed upon for francis to meet him  and  where they had made up their minds  both of them  to display all the  splendors of their two courts     this meeting has remained celebrated in history far more for its royal  pomp  and for the personal incidents which were connected with it  than  for its political results   it was called  the field of cloth of gold    and the courtiers who attended the two sovereigns felt bound to almost  rival them in sumptuousness   insomuch   says the contemporary martin du  bellay   that many bore thither their mills  their forests  and their  meadows on their backs    henry viii  had employed eleven hundred  workmen  the most skilful of flanders and holland  in building a  quadrangular palace of wood  one hundred and twenty eight feet long every  way  on one side of the entrance gate was a fountain  covered with  gilding  and surmounted by a statue of bacchus  round which there flowed  through subterranean pipes all sorts of wines  and which bore in letters  of gold the inscription   make good cheer  who will   and on the other  side a column  supported by four lions  was surmounted by a statue of  cupid armed with bow and arrows   opposite the palace was erected a huge  figure of a savage wearing the arms of his race  with this inscription   chosen by henry viii    he whom i back wins    the frontage was covered  outside with canvas painted to represent freestone  and the inside was  hung with rich tapestries   francis i   emulous of equalling his royal  neighbor in magnificence  had ordered to be erected close to ardres an  immense tent  upheld in the middle by a colossal pole firmly fixed in the  ground and with pegs and cordage all around it   outside  the tent  in  the shape of a dome  was covered with cloth of gold  and  inside  it  represented a sphere with a ground of blue velvet and studded with stars   like the firmament   at each angle of the large tent there was a small  one equally richly decorated   but before the two sovereigns exchanged  visits  in the midst of all these magnificent preparations  there arose  a violent hurricane  which tore up the pegs and split the cordage of the  french tent  scattered them over the ground  and forced francis i  to  take up his quarters in an old castle near ardres   when the two kings   two chief councillors  cardinal wolsey on one side and admiral bonnivet  on the other  had regulated the formalities  on the  th of june         francis i  and henry viii  set out on their way  at the same hour and the  same pace  for their meeting in the valley of ardres  where a tent had  been prepared for them   as they drew near  some slight anxiety was  manifested by the escort of the king of england  amongst whom a belief  prevailed that that of the king of france was more numerous  but it was  soon perceived to be nothing of the sort   the two kings  mounted upon  fine horses and superbly dressed  advanced towards one another  and henry  viii  s horse stumbled  which his servants did not like   the two kings  saluted each other with easy grace  exchanged embraces without getting  off their horses  dismounted  and proceeded arm in arm to the tent where  wolsey and de bonnivet were awaiting them    my dear brother and cousin    immediately said francis with his easy grace   i am come a long way  and  not without trouble  to see you in person   i hope that you hold me for  such as i am  ready to give you aid with the kingdoms and lordships that  are in my power    henry  with a somewhat cold reserve  replied   it is  not your kingdoms or your divers possessions that i regard  but the  soundness and loyal observance of the promises set down in the treaties  between you and me   my eyes never beheld a prince who could be dearer to  my heart  and i have crossed the seas at the extreme boundary of my  kingdom to come and see you    the two kings entered the tent and signed  a treaty whereby the dauphin of france was to marry princess mary  only  daughter at that time of henry viii   to whom francis i  undertook to pay  annually a sum of one hundred thousand livres  two million eight hundred  thousand francs  or one hundred and twelve thousand pounds in the money  of our day   until the marriage was celebrated  which would not be for  some time yet  as the english princess was only four years old   the two  kings took wine together  according to custom  and reciprocally presented  the members of their courts    king francis   says henry viii  s favorite  chronicler  edward hall  who was there   is an amiable prince  proud in  bearing and gay in manner  with a brown complexion  large eyes  long  nose  thick lips  broad chest and shoulders  short legs  and big feet    titian s portrait gives a loftier and more agreeable idea of francis i     when the two kings proceeded to sign  in their tent  the treaty they had  just concluded   the king of england   according to fleuranges    memoires    himself took up the articles and began to read them   when  he had read those relating to the king of france  who was to have the  priority  and came to speak of himself  he got as far as   i  henry   king            he would have said of  france and england    but he left  out the title as far as france was concerned  and said to king francis    i will not put it in as you are here  for i should lie   and he said  only   i henry  king of  england      but  as m  mignet very properly  says   if he omitted the title in his reading  he left it in the treaty  itself  and  shortly afterwards  was ambitious to render it a reality   when he invaded france and wished to reign over it      after the diplomatic stipulations were concluded  the royal meeting was  prolonged for sixteen days  which were employed in tourneys  jousts  and  all manner of festivals   the personal communication of the two kings was  regulated with all the precautions of official mistrust and restraint   and when the king of england went to ardres to see the queen of france   the king of france had to go to guines to see the queen of england  for  the two kings were hostages for one another    the king of france  who  was not a suspicious man   says fleuranges   was mighty vexed at there  being so little confidence in one another   he got up one morning very  early  which is not his habit  took two gentlemen and a page  the first  three he could find  mounted his horse  and went to visit the king of  england at the castle of guines   when he came on to the castle bridge   all the english were mighty astonished   as he rode amongst them  the  king gayly called upon them to surrender to him  and asked them the way  to the chamber of the king his brother  the which was pointed out to him  by the governor of guines  who said to him   sir  he is not awake    but  king francis passed on all the same  went up to the said chamber  knocked  at the door  awoke the king of england  and walked in      illustration  francis i  surprises henry viii            never was man more dumbfounded than king henry  who said to king francis    brother  you have done me a better turn than ever man did to another   and you show me the great trust i ought to have in you   i yield myself  your prisoner from this moment  and i proffer you my parole    he undid  from his neck a collar worth fifteen thousand angels  and begged the king  of france to take it and wear it that very day for his prisoner s sake   and  lo  the king  who wished to do him the same turn  had brought with  him a bracelet which was worth more than thirty thousand angels  and  begged him to wear it for his sake  which thing he did  and the king of  france put what had been given him on his neck   thereupon the king of  england was minded to get up  and the king of france said that he should  have no other chamber attendant but himself  and he warmed his shirt and  handed it to him when he was up   the king of france made up his mind to  go back  notwithstanding that the king of england would have kept him to  dinner  but  inasmuch as there was to be jousting after dinner  he  mounted his horse and went back to ardres   he met a many good folk who  were coming to meet him  amongst the rest l aventureux  a name given to  fleuranges himself   who said to him   my dear master  you are mad to  have done what you have done  i am very glad to see you back here  and  devil take him who counselled you    whereupon the king said that never a  soul had counselled him  and that he knew well that there was not a soul  in his kingdom who would have so counselled him  and then he began to  tell what he had done at the said guines  and so returned  conversing  to  ardres  for it was not far       then began the jousts  which lasted a week  and were wondrous fine  both  a foot and a horseback   after all these pastimes the king of france and  the king of england retired to a pavilion  where they drank together   and there the king of england took the king of france by the collar  and  said to him   brother  i should like to wrestle with you   and gave him a  feint or two  and the king of france  who is a mighty good wrestler  gave  him a turn and threw him on the ground   and the king of england would  have had yet another trial  but all that was broken off  and it was time  to go to supper   after this they had yet three or four jousts and  banquets  and then they took leave of one another  on the   th of june          with the greatest possible peace between the princes and  princesses   that done  the king of england returned to guines  and the  king of france to france  and it was not without giving great gifts at  parting  one to another      memoires de fleuranges   pp                 illustration  the field of the cloth of gold           having left the field of cloth of gold for amboise  his favorite  residence  francis i  discovered that henry viii   instead of returning  direct to england  had gone  on the   th of july  to gravelines  in  flanders  to pay a visit to charles v   who had afterwards accompanied  him to calais   the two sovereigns had spent three days there  and  charles v   on separating from the king of england  had commissioned him  to regulate  as arbiter  all difficulties that might arise between  himself and the king of france   assuredly nothing was less calculated to  inspire francis i  with confidence in the results of his meeting with  henry viii  and of their mutual courtesies   though he desired to avoid  the appearance of taking the initiative in war  he sought every occasion  and pretext for recommencing it  and it was not long before he found them  in the low countries  in navarre  and in italy   a trial was made of  henry viii  s mediation and of a conference at calais  and a discussion  was raised touching the legitimate nature of the protection afforded by  the two rival sovereigns to their petty allies   but the real fact was   that francis i  had a reverse to make up for and a passion to gratify   and the struggle recommenced in april        in the low countries   charles v   when he heard that the french had crossed his frontier   exclaimed   god be praised that i am not the first to commence the war   and that the king of france is pleased to make me greater than i am  for   in a little while  either i shall be a very poor emperor or he will be a  poor king of france    the campaign opened in the north  to the advantage  of france  by the capture of hesdin  admiral bonnivet  who had the  command on the frontier of spain  reduced some small forts of biscay and  the fortress of fontarabia  and marshal de lautrec  governor of milaness   had orders to set out at once to go and defend it against the spaniards  and imperialists  who were concentrating for its invasion     lautrec was but little adapted for this important commission   he had  been made governor of milaness in august        to replace the constable  de bourbon  whose recall to france the queen mother  louise of savoy  had  desired and stimulated   lautrec had succeeded ill in his government   he  was active and brave  but he was harsh  haughty  jealous  imperious  and  grasping  and he had embroiled himself with most of the milanese lords   amongst others with the veteran j  j  trivulzio  who  under charles viii   and louis xii   had done france such great service in italy   trivulzio   offensively treated at milan  and subjected to accusations at paris   went  at eighty two years of age  to france to justify himself before the  king  but francis i  gave him a cold reception  barely spoke to him  and  declined his explanations   one day  at arpajon  trivulzio heard that the  king was to pass on horseback through the town  and  being unable to  walk  had himself carried  ill as he was  in his chair to the middle of  the street   the king passed with averted head  and without replying to  trivulzio  who cried   sir  ah  sir  just one moment s audience    trivulzio  on reaching home  took to his bed  and died there a month  afterwards  on the  th of december        having himself dictated this

  francis i   when informed that trivulzio was near his end  regretted  it  is said  his harsh indifference  and sent to express to him his regret   but   it is too late   answered the dying man   in the king s harshness  there was something more than ungrateful forgetfulness of a veteran s  ancient services   while francis was bringing about a renewal of war in  italy  in the low countries  and on the frontier of spain  he was  abandoning himself at paris  tours  amboise  and wherever he resided  to  all the diversions and all the enticements of the brilliant court which  was gathered around him   extravagance and pleasure were a passion with  him    there has been talk   says brantome   of the great outlay   magnificence  sumptuousness and halls of lucullus  but in nought of that  kind did he ever come near our king          and what is most rare is   that in a village  in the forest  at the meet  there was the same service  as there would have been in paris            one day  when the king was  expecting the emperor charles to dinner  word came that he had slipped  away  and had gone to give a sudden surprise to the constable  just as he  was sitting down to table  and to dine with him and all his comrades  comradewise   he found this table as well furnished and supplied  and  laden with victuals as well cooked and flavored  as if they had been in  paris or some other good city of france  whereat the emperor was so  mightily astonished that he said that there was no such grandeur in the  world as that of such a king of france            in respect of ladies   of a surety it must be confessed that before the time of king francis  they set foot in and frequented the court but little and in but small  numbers   it is true that queen anne  of brittany  began to make her  ladies  court larger than it had been under former queens  and  without  her  the king her husband  louis xii   would have taken no trouble about  it   but francis i   coming to reign  and considering that the whole  grace of the court was the ladies  was pleased to fill it up with them  more than had been the ancient custom   since  in truth  a court without  ladies is a garden without any pretty flowers  and more resembles a  satrap s or a turk s court than that of a great christian king            as for me  i hold that there was never anything better introduced than  the ladies  court   full often have i seen our kings go to camp  or town   or elsewhither  remain there and divert themselves for some days  and yet  take thither no ladies   but we were so bewildered  so lost  so moped   that for the week we spent away from them and their pretty eyes it  appeared to us a year  and always a wishing   when shall we be at the  court    not  full often  calling that the court where the king was  but  that where the queen and ladies were      oeuvres de brantome  edition of  the societe de l histoire de france   t  iii   pp               now  when so many fair ladies are met together in a life of sumptuousness  and gayety  a king is pretty sure to find favorites  and royal favorites  rarely content themselves with pleasing the king  they desire to make  their favor serviceable their family and their friends   francis i   had  made choice one  frances de foix  countess of chateaubriant  beautiful  ambitious  dexterous  haughty  readily venturing upon rivalry with even  the powerful queen mother   she had three brothers  lautrec was one of  the three  and she supported him in all his pretensions and all his  trials of fortune   when he set out to go and take the command in italy   he found himself at the head of an army numerous indeed  but badly  equipped  badly paid  and at grips with prosper colonna  the most able  amongst the chiefs of the coalition formed at this juncture between  charles v  and pope leo x  against the french   lautrec did not succeed  in preventing milan from falling into the hands of the imperialists  and   after an uncertain campaign of some months  duration  he lost at la  bicocca  near monza  on the   th of april        a battle  which left in  the power of francis i   in lombardy  only the citadels of milan   cremona  and novara   at the news of these reverses  francis i  repaired  to lyons  to consult as to the means of applying a remedy   lautrec also  arrived there    the king   says martin du bellay   gave him a bad  reception  as the man by whose fault he considered he had lost his duchy  of milan  and would not speak to him    lautrec found an occasion for  addressing the king  and complained vehemently of  the black looks he  gave him     and good reason   said the king   when you have lost me such  a heritage as the duchy of milan      twas not i who lost it   answered  lautrec    twas your majesty yourself  i several times warned you that   if i were not helped with money  there was no means of retaining the  men at arms  who had served for eighteen months without a penny  and  likewise the swiss  who forced me to fight at a disadvantage  which they  would never have done if they had received their pay     i sent you four  hundred thousand crowns when you asked for them     i received the  letters in which your majesty notified me of this money  but the money  never    the king sent at once for the superintendent general of finance   james de beaune  baron of semblancay  who acknowledged having received  orders on the subject from the king  but added that at the very moment  when he was about to send this sum to the army  the queen mother had come  and asked him for it  and had received it from him  whereof he was ready  to make oath   francis i  entered his mother s room in a rage   reproaching her with having been the cause of losing him his duchy of  milan    i should never have believed it of you   he said   that you would  have kept money ordered for the service of my army    the queen mother   somewhat confused at first  excused herself by saying  that  those were  moneys proceeding from the savings which she had made out of her  revenues  and had given to the superintendent to take care of    semblancay stuck to what he had said   the question became a personal one  between the queen mother and the minister  and commissioners were  appointed to decide the difference   chancellor duprat was the docile  servant of louise of savoy and the enemy of semblancay  whose authority  in financial matters he envied  and he chose the commissioners from  amongst the mushroom councillors he had lately brought into parliament   the question between the queen mother and the superintendent led to  nothing less than the trial of semblancay   the trial lasted five years   and  on the  th of april        a decree of parliament condemned  semblancay to the punishment of death and confiscation of all his  property  not for the particular matter which had been the origin of the  quarrel  but  as attained and convicted of larcenies  falsifications   abuses  malversations  and maladministration of the king s finances   without prejudice as to the debt claimed by the said my lady  the mother  of the king    semblancay  accordingly  was hanged on the gibbet of  montfaucon  on the   th of august   in spite of certain ambiguities which  arose touching some acts of his administration and some details of his  trial  public feeling was generally and very strongly in his favor   he  was an old and faithful servant of the crown  and francis i  had for a  long time called him  his father    he was evidently the victim of the  queen mother s greed and vengeance   the firmness of his behavior  at the  time of his execution  became a popular theme in the verses of clement  marot                 when maillart  officer of hell  escorted            to montfaucon semblancay  doomed to die             which  to your thinking  of the twain supported            the better havior   i will make reply             maillart was like the man to death proceeding             and semblancay so stout an ancient looked             it seemed  forsooth  as if himself were leading            lieutenant maillard  to the gallows booked     it is said that  at the very moment of execution  semblancay  waiting on  the scaffold for at least a commutation of the penalty  said   had i  served god as i have served the king  he would not have made me wait so  long    nearly two centuries later  in       a more celebrated minister  than semblancay  colbert  in fact  as he was dying tranquilly in his bed   after having for twenty years served louis xiv   and in that service made  the fortune of his family as well as his own  said also   had i done for  god what i have done for yonder man  i had been twice saved  and now i  know not what will become of me    a striking similarity in language and  sentiment  in spite of such different ends  between two great councillors  of kings  both devoted during their lives to the affairs of the world   and both passing  at their last hour  this severe judgment  as  christians  upon the masters of the world and upon themselves     about the same time the government of francis i  was involved  through  his mother s evil passions  not in an act more morally shameful  but in  an event more politically serious  than the execution of semblancay   there remained in france one puissant prince  the last of the feudal  semi sovereigns  and the head of that only one of the provincial  dynasties sprung from the dynasty of the capetians which still held its  own against the kingly house   there were no more dukes of burgundy   dukes of anjou  counts of provence  and dukes of brittany  by good  fortune or by dexterous management the french kingship had absorbed all  those kindred and rival states   charles ii   duke of bourbon  alone was  invested with such power and independence as could lead to rivalry   he  was in possession of bourbonness  of auvergne  of le forez  of la marche   of beaujolais  and a large number of domains and castles in different  parts of france   throughout all these possessions he levied taxes and  troops  convoked the local estates  appointed the officers of justice   and regulated almost the whole social organism   he was born on the   th  of february        four years before francis i   he was the head of the  younger branch of the bourbons montpensier  and he had married  in        his cousin  suzanne of bourbon  only daughter of peter ii   head of the  elder branch  and anne of france  the able and for a long while puissant  daughter of louis xi   louis xii  had taken great interest in this  marriage  and it had been stipulated in the contract  that the pair  should make a mutual and general settlement of all their possessions in  favor of the survivor    thus the young duke  charles  had united all the  possessions of the house of bourbon  and he held at moulins a brilliant  princely court  of which he was himself the most brilliant ornament   having been trained from his boyhood in all chivalrous qualities  he was  an accomplished knight before becoming a tried warrior  and he no sooner  appeared upon the field of battle than he won renown not only as a  valiant prince  but as an eminent soldier   in       at the battle of  agnadello  under the eye of louis xii  himself  he showed that he was a  worthy pupil of la tremoille  of la palice  and of bayard  and in        at that of ravenna  his reputation was already so well established in the  army that  when gaston de foix was killed  they clamored for duke charles  of bourbon  then twenty two years old  as his successor   louis xii   gave him full credit for his bravery and his warlike abilities  but the  young prince s unexpansive character  haughty independence  and momentary  flashes of audacity  caused the veteran king some disquietude    i wish    said he   he had a more open  more gay  less taciturn spirit  stagnant  water affrights me    in       the year after louis xii  s death  andrew  trevisani  venetian ambassador at milan  wrote to the venetian council    this duke of bourbon handles a sword most gallantly and successfully  he  fears god  he is devout  humane  and very generous  he has a revenue of  one hundred and twenty thousand crowns  twenty thousand from his  mother in law  anne of france  and two thousand a month as constable of  france  and  according to what is said by m  de longueville  governor of  paris  he might dispose of half the king s army for any enterprise he  pleased  even if the king did not please      scarcely had francis i  ascended the throne  on the   th of january         when he made the duke of bourbon s great position still greater by  creating him constable of france   was it solely to attach to himself the  greatest lord and one of the most distinguished soldiers of the kingdom   or had  perhaps  as has already been hinted  the favor of the  queen mother something to do with the duke s speedy elevation   the whole  history of charles of bourbon tends to a belief that the feelings of  louise of savoy towards him  her love or her hate  had great influence  upon the decisive incidents of his life   however that may be  the young  constable  from the moment of entering upon his office  fully justified  the king s choice      illustration  the constable de bourbon           he it was who  during the first campaign in italy  examined in person   with the shepherd who had pointed it out  an unknown passage across the  alps  and  on the   th and   th of september  he contributed greatly to  the victory of melegnano    i can assure you   wrote francis i  to his  mother  the regent   that my brother the constable and m  de st  pol  splintered as many lances as any gentlemen of the company whosoever  and  i speak of this as one who saw  they spared themselves as little as if  they had been wild boars at bay    on returning to france the king  appointed the constable governor of conquered milaness  and to give him a  further mark of favor   he granted him the noble privilege of founding  trades in all the towns of the kingdom   this  when the parliament  enregistered the king s letters patent  was expressly stated to be in  consideration of bourbon s extraordinary worth  combined with his quality  as a prince of the blood  and not because of his office of constable      histoire de la maison de bourbon   by m  desormeaux  t  ii   p         the constable showed that he was as capable of governing as of  conquering   he foiled all emperor maximilian s attempts to recover  milaness  and  not receiving from the king money for the maintenance and  pay of his troops  he himself advanced one hundred thousand livres   opened a loan account in his own name  raised an army working corps of  six thousand men to repair the fortifications of milan  and obtained from  the swiss cantons permission to enlist twelve thousand recruits amongst  them   his exercise of authority over the lombard population was  sometimes harsh  but always judicious and efficient   nevertheless  in  the spring of       eight months after the victory of melegnano and but  two months after he had driven emperor maximilian from milaness  the duke  of bourbon was suddenly recalled  and marshal de lautrec was appointed  governor in his place   when the constable arrived at lyons  where the  court then happened to be   the king   says fleuranges in his memoires    gave him marvellously good welcome   but kings are too ready to imagine  that their gracious words suffice to hide or make up for their acts of  real disfavor  and the duke of bourbon was too proud to delude himself   if he had any desire to do so  the way in which the king s government  treated him soon revealed to him his real position  the advances he had  made and the debts he had contracted for the service of the crown in  milaness  nay  his salary as constable and his personal pensions  were  unpaid   was this the effect of secret wrath on the part of the  queen mother  hurt because he seemed to disdain her good graces  or an  act arising may be from mistrust and may be from carelessness on the  king s part  or merely a result of the financial disorder into which the  affairs of francis i  were always falling   these questions cannot be  solved with certainty   anyhow the constable  though thus maltreated   did not cry out  but his royal patroness and mother in law  anne of  france  daughter of louis xi   dowager duchess of the house of bourbon   complained of these proceedings to the king s mother  and uttered the  word ingratitude  the dispute between the two princesses grew rancorous   the king intervened to reconcile them  speedy payment was promised of  all that was due to the constable  but the promise was not kept   the  constable did not consider it seemly to wait about  so he quitted the  court and withdrew into his own duchy  to moulins  not openly disgraced   but resolved to set himself  by his proud independence  above the reach  of ill will  whether on the king s part or his mother s     moulins was an almost kingly residence    the dukes   said the venetian  traveller andrew navagero  in        have built there fortress wise a  magnificent palace  with beautiful gardens  groves  fountains  and all  the sumptuous appliances of a prince s dwelling    no sooner did the  constable go to reside there than numbers of the nobility flocked thither  around him   the feudal splendor of this abode was shortly afterwards  enhanced by an auspicious domestic incident   in      the duchess of  bourbon was confined there of a son  a blessing for some time past  unhoped for   the delighted constable determined to make of the child s  baptism a great and striking event  and he begged the king to come and be  godfather  with the dowager duchess of bourbon as godmother   francis i   consented and repaired to moulins with his mother and nearly all his  court   the constable s magnificence astonished even the magnificent king   five hundred gentlemen  all clad in velvet  and all wearing a chain of  gold going three times round the neck   were in habitual attendance upon  the duke   the throng of the invited was so great that neither the castle  of moulins nor the town itself sufficed to lodge them  tents had to be  pitched in the public places  in the streets  in the park    francis i   could not refrain from saying that a king of france would have much  difficulty in making such a show  the queen mother did not hide her  jealousy  regal temper came into collision with feudal pride   admiral  bonnivet  a vassal of the constable and a favorite of the king  was  having built  hard by chatellerault  a castle so vast and so magnificent    that he seemed   says brantome   to be minded to ride the high horse  over the house of m  de bourbon  in such wise that it should appear only  a nest beside his own    francis i   during a royal promenade  took the  constable one day to see the edifice the admiral was building  and asked  him what he thought of it    i think   said bourbon   that the cage is  too big and too fine for the bird     ah   said the king   do you not  speak with somewhat of envy     i   cried the constable   i feel envy of  a gentleman whose ancestors thought themselves right happy to be squires  to mine    in their casual and familiar conversations the least pretext  would lead to sharp words between the duke of bourbon and his kingly  guest   the king was rallying him one day on the attachment he was  suspected of having felt for a lady of the court    sir   said the  constable   what you have just said has no point for me  but a good deal  for those who were not so forward as i was in the lady s good graces     at this period princes of the blood  when speaking to the king  said  monsieur  when they wrote to him  they called him monseigneur    francis  i   to whom this scarcely veiled allusion referred  was content to reply    ah  my dear cousin  you fly out at everything  and you are mighty  short tempered    the nickname of short tempered stuck to the constable  from that day  and not without reason   with anybody but the king the  constable was a good deal more than short tempered the chancellor   duprat  who happened to be at moulins  and who had a wish to become  possessed of two estates belonging to the constable  tried to worm  himself into his good graces  but bourbon gave him sternly to understand  with what contempt he regarded him  and duprat  who had hitherto been  merely the instrument of louise of savoy s passions  so far as the duke  was concerned  became henceforth his personal enemy  and did not wait  long for an opportunity of making the full weight of his enmity felt   the king s visit to moulins came to an end without any settlement of  the debts due from the royal treasury to the constable   three years  afterwards  in       he appeared with not a whit the less magnificence  at the field of cloth of gold  where he was one of the two great lords  chosen by francis i  to accompany him at his interview with henry viii    but the constable had to put up with the disagreeableness of having for  his associate upon that state occasion admiral bonnivet  whom he had but  lately treated with so much hauteur  and his relations towards the court  were by no means improved by the honor which the king conferred upon him  in summoning him to his side that day   henry viii   who was struck by  this vassal s haughty bearing and looks  said to francis i    if i had a  subject like that in my kingdom  i would not leave his head very long on  his shoulders      more serious causes of resentment came to aggravate a situation already  so uncomfortable   the war  which had been a hatching ever since the  imperial election at frankfort  burst out in       between francis i   and charles v   francis raised four armies in order to face it on all his  frontiers  in guienne  in burgundy  in champagne  and in picardy   where  there was no army   says du bellai   however small    none of these great  commands was given to the duke of bourbon  and when the king summoned him  to the army of picardy  whither he repaired in all haste with six  thousand foot and three hundred men at arms raised in his own states   the command of the advance guard  which belonged to him by right of his  constableship  was given to the duke of alencon  who had nothing to  recommend him beyond the fact that he was the husband of marguerite de  valois and brother in law of the king   bourbon deeply resented this  slight  and it was remarked that he frequently quoted with peculiar  meaning a reply made by a gascon gentleman to king charles vii   who had  asked him if anything could shake his fidelity   nothing  sir  nothing   not even an offer of three such kingdoms as yours  but an affront might    the constable did not serve a whit the less valiantly and brilliantly in  this campaign of picardy  he surprised and carried the town of hesdin   which was defended by a strong garrison  but after the victory he treated  with a generosity which was not perhaps free from calculation the  imperialist nobility shut up in the castle  he set all his prisoners at  large  and paid particular attention to the countess de roeux  of the  house of croy  whom he knew to have influence with charles v   he was  certainly not preparing just then to abandon the king of france and go  over to the camp of the emperor  but he was sufficiently irritated  against francis i  to gladly seize an opportunity of making new friends  on the rival side     meanwhile there occurred the event which was to decide his conduct and  his destiny   his wife  suzanne of bourbon  died at chatellerault  in  april        after having lost the son whose birth had been celebrated  with such brilliancy at moulins  and having confirmed by her will the  settlement upon her husband of all her possessions  which had already  been conferred upon him by their marriage contract   from whom came the  first idea of the proposal to which this death was ere long to lead   was  it the chancellor  duprat  who told the mother of francis i  that the  will and the settlement might be disputed at law  and that she would then  enter into possession of a great part of what belonged to the house of  bourbon   was it louise of savoy herself who conceived the hope of  satisfying at one and the same time her cupidity and the passion she felt  for the constable  by having an offer made to him of her hand  with the  retention secured to him of those great possessions which  otherwise   would be disputed  and which a decree of parliament might take away from  him   between these two explanations of what occurred at that time  there  is no certain choice afforded by historical documents  but the more  reasonable conviction is  that the passion of louise of savoy was the  first and the decisive cause of the proposal made to the constable   he  was then thirty years old  louise of savoy was forty five  but she was  still beautiful  attractive  and puissant  she had given the constable  unmistakable proofs of her inclination for him and of the influence which  his inclinations exercised over her  she might well flatter herself that  he would be attracted by the prospect of becoming the king s step father  and almost a sharer in the kingly power  whilst retaining that of the  great feudal lord   the chancellor  duprat  full of ability and  servility  put all his knowledge  all his subtlety in argument  and all  his influence in the parliament at the disposal of madame louise  who  as  a nearer relative than the constable  claimed the possessions left by his  wife  suzanne of bourbon   francis i   in the name of the crown  and in  respect of the constable s other possessions  joined his claims to those  of his mother   thus the lawsuit with which the duke was threatened  affected him in every part of his fortune   it was in vain that more or  less direct overtures  on behalf of madame louise and of the king  himself  were made to induce him to accept the bargain offered  his  refusal was expressed and given with an open contempt that verged upon  coarseness    i will never   said he   marry a woman devoid of modesty      the lawsuit was begun and prosecuted with all the hatred of a great lady  treated with contempt  and with all the knowingness of an unscrupulous  lawyer eager to serve  in point of fact  his patroness  and to  demonstrate  in point of law  the thesis he had advanced   francis i    volatile  reckless  and ever helpless as he was against the passions of  his mother  who whilst she adored  beguiled him  readily lent himself to  the humiliation of a vassal who was almost his rival in puissance  and  certainly was in glory   three lawyers of renown entered upon the  struggle   poyet maintained the pretensions of the queen mother  lizet  developed duprat s argument in favor of the king s claims  montholon  defended the constable   the parliament granted several adjournments   and the question was in suspense for eleven months   at last  in august         the court interest was triumphant  parliament  to get rid of direct  responsibility  referred the parties  as to the basis of the question  to  the king s council  but it placed all the constable s possessions under  sequestration  withdrawing the enjoyment of them wholly from him   a few  years afterwards poyet became chancellor  and lizet premier president of  parliament    worth alone   say the historians   carved out for montholon  at a later period the road to the office of keeper of the seals      the constable s fall and ruin were complete   he at an early stage had a  presentiment that such would be the issue of his lawsuit  and sought for  safeguards away from france   the affair was causing great stir in  europe   was it  however  charles v  who made the first overtures as the  most efficient supporter the constable could have   or was it the  constable himself who  profiting by the relations he had established  after the capture of hesdin with the croys  persons of influence with the  emperor  made use of them for getting into direct communication with  charles v   and made offer of his services in exchange for protection  against his own king and his own country   in such circumstances and in  the case of such men the sources of crime are always surrounded with  obscurity   one is inclined to believe that charles v   vigilant and  active as he was  put out the first feelers   as soon as he heard that  bourbon was a widower  he gave instructions to philibert naturelli  his  ambassador in france  who said   sir  you are now in a position to marry   and the emperor  my master  who is very fond of you  has a sister  touching whom i have orders to speak to you if you will be pleased to  hearken    it was to charles v  s eldest sister  eleanor  widow of manuel  the fortunate  king of portugal  that allusion was made   this overture  led to nothing at the time  but the next year  in       war was declared  between francis i  and charles v   the rupture between francis i  and the  duke of bourbon took place  the bourbon lawsuit was begun  and the duke s  mother in law  anne of france  daughter of louis xi   more concerned for  the fate of her house than for that of her country  and feeling herself  near her end  said one day to her son in law   my son  reflect that the  house of bourbon made alliance with the house of burgundy  and that  during that alliance it always prospered   you see at the present moment  what is the state of our affairs  and the lawsuit in which you are  involved is proceeded with only for want of alliances   i do beg and  command you to accept the emperor s alliance   promise me to use thereto  all the diligence you can  and i shall die more easy    she died on the    th of november        bequeathing all her possessions to the constable   who was day by day more disposed to follow her counsels   in the summer  of       he had  through the agency of adrian de croy  lord of beaurain   entered into negotiations not only with charles v   but also with henry  viii   king of england  deploring the ill behavior of francis i  and the  enormity of existing abuses  and proposing to set on foot in his own  possessions a powerful movement for the reformation of the kingdom and  the relief of the poor people  if the two sovereigns would send  persons  of trust and authority into the vicinity of his principality of dombes   to bourg en bresse  whither he on his side would send his chancellor to  come to an agreement with them and act in common    in the month of  march        whilst the foreign negotiations thus commenced and the  home process against the constable were pursuing a parallel course   bourbon one day paid a visit to queen claude of france at the hour when  she was dining alone   she was favorably disposed towards him  and would  have liked to get him married to her sister renee  who subsequently  became duchess of ferrara   she made him sit down   francis i   who was  at dinner in an adjacent room  came in   bourbon rose to take leave    nay  keep your seat   said the king   and so it is true that you are  going to be married     not at all  sir     o  but i know it  i am sure  of it  i know of your dealings with the emperor   and bear well in mind  what i have to say to you on the subject     sir  is this a threat  pray   i have not deserved such treatment    after dinner he departed and went  back to his hotel hard by the louvre  and many gentlemen who happened to  be at court accompanied him by way of escort   he was as yet a powerful  vassal  who was considered to be unjustly persecuted     charles v  accepted eagerly the overtures made to him by bourbon in  response to his own  but  before engaging in action  he wished to be  certified about the disposition of henry viii   king of england  and he  sent beaurain to england to take accurate soundings   henry at first  showed hesitation  when  beaurain set before him all the advantages that  would accrue to their coalition from the duke of bourbon s alliance   and  i   said the king  brusquely   what  pray  shall i get    sir   answered  beaurain   you will be king of france     ah   rejoined henry   it will  take a great deal to make m  de bourbon obey me    henry remembered the  cold and proud bearing which the constable had maintained towards him at  the field of cloth of gold   he  nevertheless  engaged to supply half the  expenses and a body of troops for the projected invasion of france   charles v   immediately despatched beaurain to the duke of bourbon  who  had removed to montbrison  in the most mountainous part of his domains   on pretext of a pilgrimage to notre dame du puy   beaurain was conducted  thither  in great secrecy  on the   th july        by two of the duke s  gentlemen  and passed two days there shut up in a room adjoining the  constable s apartment  never emerging save at night to transact business  with him   on the   th of july  in the evening  he put into bourbon s  hands his letters of credit  running thus   my dear cousin  i send to you  sieur de beaurain  my second chamberlain   i pray you to consider him as  myself  and  so doing  you will find me ever your good cousin and  friend    the negotiation was speedy   many historians have said that it  was confined to verbal conventions  and that there was nothing in writing  between the two contracting parties   that is a mistake   a treaty was  drawn up in brief terms by beaurain s secretary  and two copies were  made  of which one was to be taken to charles v   and the other to be  left with the duke of bourbon   it stipulated the mutual obligations of  the three contracting parties in their offensive and defensive league   bourbon engaged to attack francis i  but he would not promise to  acknowledge henry viii  as king of france    i am quite willing to be his  ally   he said   but his subject  his vassal  no   all i can do is to  leave myself  as to my relations towards him  in the emperor s hands    a strange and noble relic of patriotism in that violent and haughty soul   more concerned for its rights than its duties  and driven to extremity by  the acts of ungrateful and unthoughtful injustice  to which the great  lord and the valiant warrior had been subjected   the treaty having been  signed with this reservation  bourbon sent  about midnight  for  saint bonnet  lord of branon  whom he intended to despatch to charles  v   and  after having sworn him   i send you   said he   to the emperor   to whom you will say that i commend myself humbly to his good graces   that i beg him to give me his sister in marriage  and that  doing me  this honor  he will find me his servant  his good brother  and friend      the fatal step was taken   bourbon was now engaged in revolt against his  king and his country  as well as in falsehood and treason  preliminary  conditions of such a course   he needed tools and accomplices  and though  he had a numerous and devoted following  he could not feel sure of them  all for such a purpose   the very day after the conclusion of his treaty  with charles v   one of his most intimate and important confidants  john  of poitiers  lord of st  vallier  who was present at montbrison during  the negotiation of the treaty  said to him in the morning   sir  it was  your wish  i heard all  and i spent the whole night thinking about it   tell me  i pray you  do you feel sure of your friend     i was not more  fond of the brother i lost at melegnano   said the constable   i should  not have felt more sure of him     well  then   rejoined st   vallier    fancy that it is that brother who is speaking to you  and take in good  part what he is about to say to you   this alliance which is offered to  you will bring upon france the germans  the spaniards  and the english   think of the great mischief which will ensue  human bloodshed   destruction of towns  of good families and of churches  violation of  women  and other calamities that come of war   reflect also on the great  treason you are committing  when the king has started for italy and left  you in france  putting his trust in you  you will go and stab him in the  back  and destroy him as well as his kingdom   you belong to the house of  france  and are one of the chief princes of the country  so beloved and  esteemed by all that everybody is gladdened at the very sight of you   if  you should come to be the cause of so great ruin  you will be the most  accursed creature that ever was  accursed for a thousand years after your  death   for the love of god consider all this  and if you have no regard  for the king and madame his mother  who  you say  are treating you  wrongfully  at least have some regard for the queen and the princes her  children  and do not wilfully cause the perdition of this kingdom  whose  enemies  when you have let them into it  will drive you out of it  yourself     but  cousin   said the constable  quite overcome   what  would you have me to do   the king and madame mean to destroy me  they  have already taken away a part of my possessions     sir   replied  saint vallier   give up  i pray you  all these wicked enterprises  commend  yourself to god  and speak frankly to the king    if we are to believe  saint vallier s deposition  when  six months afterwards  he was put on  his trial and convicted for his participation in the plot and treason   the constable was sufficiently affected by his representations to promise  that he would abandon his design and make his peace with the king  but  facts refute this assertion   in the latter months of       the  stipulations of the treaty concluded at montbrison on the   th of july  were put into execution by all the contracting parties  letters of  exchange from henry viii  were sent to bale for the german lanzknechts he  was to pay  the lanzknechts crossed the rhine on the   th of august  and  marched through franche comte in spite of its neutrality  the english  landed at calais between the   d and   th of august  to co operate with  the flemings  the spaniards began the campaign  on the  th of september   in the direction of the pyrenees  and the duke  of bourbon on his side  took all the necessary measures for forming a junction with his allies   and playing that part in the coalition which had been assigned to him     according to what appears  he had harbored a design of commencing his  enterprise with a very bold stroke   being informed that francis i  was  preparing to go in person and wage war upon italy  he had resolved to  carry him off on the road to lyons  and  when once he had the king in his  hands  he flattered himself he would do as he pleased with the kingdom   if his attempt were unsuccessful  be would bide his time until francis i   was engaged in milaness  charles v  had entered guienne  and henry viii   was in picardy  he would then assemble a thousand men at arms  six  thousand foot and twelve thousand lanzknechts  and would make for the  alps to cut the king off from any communication with france   this plan  rested upon the assumption that the king would  as he had announced   leave the constable in france with an honorable title and an apparent  share in the government of the kingdom  though really isolated and  debarred from action   but francis had full cognizance of the details of  the conspiracy through two norman gentlemen whom the constable had  imprudently tried to get to join in it  and who  not content with  refusing  had revealed the matter at confession to the bishop of lisieux   who had lost no time in giving information to sire de breze  grand  seneschal of normandy   breze at once reported it to the king  and his  letter ran   sir  there is need also to take care of yourself  for there  has been talk of an attempt to carry you off between here and lyons  and  conduct you to a strong place in the bourbon district or on the borders  of auvergne    being at last seriously disquieted for the consequences of  his behavior towards the constable  francis took two resolutions  one  was  not to leave him in france during his own absence  the other was   to go and see him at moulins  at the same time taking all necessary  precautions for his own safety  and win him over once more by announcing  an intention of taking him off to italy and sharing with him the command  of the army   on approaching moulins the king recalled the lanzknechts  who had already passed the town  entered it himself surrounded by his  guards  and took up his quarters in the castle  of which he seized the  keys   at his first interview with the constable  who was slightly  indisposed and pretended to be very much so   i know   said he   that you  are keeping up a connection with the emperor  and that he is trying to  turn your discontent to advantage  so as to beguile you  but i have faith  in you  you are of the house of france and of the line of bourbon  which  has never produced a traitor     it is true  sir   said the constable   without any confusion   the emperor  informed by public rumor of the  position to which i am reduced  sent beaurain to offer me an asylum in  his dominions and a fortune suitable to my birth and my rank  but i know  the value of empty compliments   hearing that your majesty was to pass by  moulins  i thought it my duty to wait and disclose this secret to you  myself rather than intrust it to a letter    the king showed signs of  being touched    i have an idea of taking you away with me to italy    said he   would you come with me willingly     not only to italy   was  the answer   but to the end of the world   the doctors assure me that i  shall soon be in a condition to bear the motion of a litter  i already  feel better  your majesty s kindnesses will soon complete my cure    francis testified his satisfaction   some of his advisers  with more  distrust and more prevision  pressed him to order the arrest of so  dangerous a man  notwithstanding his protestations  but francis refused   according to what some historians say  if he had taken off the  sequestration laid upon the constable s possessions  actually restored  them to him  as well as discharged the debts due to him and paid his  pensions  and carried him off to italy  if  in a word  he had shown a  bold confidence and given back to him at once and forever the whole of  his position  he would  perhaps  have weaned him from his plot  and would  have won back to himself and to france that brave and powerful servant   but francis wavered between distrust and hope  he confined himself to  promising the constable restitution of his possessions if the decree of  parliament was unfavorable to him  he demanded of him a written  engagement to remain always faithful to him and to join him in italy as  soon as his illness would allow him  and  on taking leave of him  left  with him one of his own gentlemen  peter de brentonniere  lord of warthy   with orders to report to the king as to his health   in this officer  bourbon saw nothing more or less than a spy  and in the king s promises  nothing but vain words dependent as they were upon the issue of a lawsuit  which still remained an incubus upon him   he had no answer for words but  words  he undertook the engagements demanded of him by the king without  considering them binding  and he remained ill at moulins  waiting till  events should summon him to take action with his foreign allies     this state of things lasted far nearly three weeks   the king remained  stationary at lyons waiting for the constable to join him  and the  constable  saying he was ready to set out and going so far as to actually  begin his march  was doing his three leagues a day by litter  being  always worse one day than he was the day before   peter de warthy  the  officer whom the king had left with him  kept going and coming from lyons  to moulins and from moulins to lyons  conveying to the constable the  king s complaints and to the king the constable s excuses  without  bringing the constable to decide upon joining the king at lyons and  accompanying him into italy  or the king upon setting out for italy  without the constable    i would give a hundred thousand crowns   the  king sent word to bourbon   to be in lombardy     the king will do well    answered bourbon   to get there as soon as possible  for despatch is  needful beyond everything    when warthy insisted strongly  the constable  had him called up to his bedside  and  i feel myself   said he   the  most unlucky man in the world not to be able to serve the king  but if i  were to be obstinate  the doctors who are attending me would not answer  for my life  and i am even worse than the doctors think   i shall never  be in a condition to do the king service any more   i am going back to my  native air  and  if i recover a day s health  i will go to the king     the king will be terribly put out   said warthy  and he returned to  lyons to report these remarks of the real or pretended invalid   while he  was away  the constable received from england and spain news which made  him enter actively upon his preparations  he heard at the same time that  the king was having troops marched towards bourbonness so as to lay  violent hands on him if he did not obey  he  therefore  decided to go and  place himself in security in his strong castle of chantelle  where he  could await the movements of his allies  he mounted his horse  did six  leagues at one stretch  and did not draw bridle until he had entered  chantelle   warthy speedily came and rejoined him   he found the  constable sitting on his bed  dressed like an invalid and with his head  enveloped in a night cap    m  de warthy   said bourbon   you bring your  spurs pretty close after mine     my lord   was the reply   you have  better ones than i thought     think you   said bourbon   that i did not  well  having but a finger s breadth of life  to put it as far out of the  way as i could to avoid the king s fury     the king   said warthy   was  never furious towards any man  far less would he be so in your case     nay  nay   rejoined the constable   i know that the grand master and  marshal de chabannes set out from lyons with the archers of the guard and  four or five thousand lanzknechts to seize me  and that is what made me  come to this house whilst biding my time until the king shall be pleased  to hear me    he demanded that the troops sent against him should be  ordered to halt till the morrow  promising not to stir from chantelle  without a vindication of himself    whither would you go  my lord   said  warthy   if you wished to leave the kingdom  you could not  the king has  provided against that everywhere       nay   said bourbon   i have no wish to leave the kingdom  i have  friends and servants there    warthy went away from chantelle in company  with the bishop of autun  chiverny  who was one of the constable s most  trusted friends  and who was bearer to the king of a letter which ran  thus   provided it please the king to restore to him his possessions  my  lord of bourbon promises to serve him well and heartily  in all places  and at all times at which it shall seem good to him   in witness whereof   he has signed these presents  and begs the king to be pleased to pardon  those towards whom he is ill disposed on account of this business   charles    in writing this letter the constable had no other object than  to gain a little time  for  on bidding good by to the bishop of autun   he said to him   farewell  my dear bishop  i am off to carlat  and from  carlat i shall slip away with five or six horses on my road to spain    on the next day but one  indeed  the  th of september        whilst the  bishop of autun was kept prisoner by the troops sent forward to  chantelle  the constable sallied from it about one in the morning  taking  with him five and twenty or thirty thousand crowns of gold sewn up in  from twelve to fifteen jackets  each of which was intrusted to a man in  his train   for a month he wandered about bourbonness  auvergne   burgundy  beaujolais  vienness  languedoc  and dauphiny  incessantly  changing his road  his comrades  his costume  and his asylum   occasionally falling in with soldiers of the king who were repairing to  italy  and seeking for some place whence he might safely concert with and  act with his allies   at last  in the beginning of october  he arrived at  saint claude  in franche comte  imperial territory  and on the  th of  october he made his entry into besancon  where there came to join him  some of his partisans who from necessity or accident had got separated  from him  without his having been able anywhere in his progress to excite  any popular movement  form any collection of troops  or intrench himself  strongly in his own states   to judge from appearances  he was now but a  fugitive conspirator  without domains and without an army     such  however  were his fame and importance as a great lord and great  warrior  that francis i   as soon as he knew him to be beyond his reach  and in a fair way to co operate actively with his enemies  put off his  departure for italy  and  offered the redoubtable fugitive immediate  restitution of his possessions  reimbursement from the royal treasury of  what was due to him  renewal of his pensions and security that they would  be paid him with punctuality    bourbon refused everything    it is too  late   he replied   francis i  s envoy then asked him to give up the  sword of constable and the collar of the order of st   michael    you  will tell the king   rejoined bourbon   that he took from me the sword  of constable on the day that he took from me the command of the  advance guard to give it to m  d alencon   as for the collar of his  order  you will find it at chantelle under the pillow of my bed    francis i   in order to win back bourbon  had recourse to his sister  the  duchess of lorraine  renee de bourbon  who had married  in       antony   called the good  duke of lorraine  son of duke rend ii  and his second  wife  philippine of gueldres   but she was not more successful   after  sounding him  she wrote to francis i  that the duke her brother  was  determined to go through with his enterprise  and that he proposed to  draw off towards flanders by way of lorraine with eighteen hundred horse  and ten thousand foot  and form a junction with the king of england     m  mignet   etude sur le connetable de bourbon  in the revue des deux  mondes  of january           and march    and april              under such grave and urgent circumstances  francis i  behaved on the one  hand with more prudence and efficiency than he had yet displayed  and on  the other with his usual levity and indulgence towards his favorites   abandoning his expedition in person into italy  he first concerned  himself for that internal security of his kingdom  which was threatened  on the east and north by the imperialists and the english  and on the  south by the spaniards  all united in considerable force and already in  motion   francis opposed to them in the east and north the young count  claude of guise  the first celebrity amongst his celebrated race  the  veteran louis de la tremoille  the most tried of all his warriors  and  the duke of vendome  head of the younger branch of the house of bourbon   into the south he sent marshal de lautrec  who was more brave than  successful  but of proved fidelity   all these captains acquitted  themselves honorably   claude of guise defeated a body of twelve thousand  lanzknechts who had already penetrated into champagne  he hurled them  back into lorraine  and dispersed them beneath the walls of the little  town of neufchateau  where the princesses and ladies of lorraine  showing  themselves at the windows  looked on and applauded their discomfiture   la tremoille s only forces were very inferior to the thirty five thousand  imperialists or english who had entered picardy  but he managed to make  of his small garrisons such prompt and skilful use that the invaders were  unable to get hold of a single place  and advanced somewhat heedlessly to  the very banks of the oise  whence the alarm spread rapidly to paris   the duke of vendome  whom the king at once despatched thither with a  small body of men at arms  marched night and day to the assistance of the  parisians  harangued the parliament and hotel de ville vehemently on the  conspiracy of the constable de bourbon  and succeeded so well in  reassuring them that companies of the city militia eagerly joined his  troops  and the foreigners  in dread of finding themselves hemmed in   judged it prudent to fall back  leaving picardy in a state of equal  irritation and devastation   in the south  lautrec  after having made  head for three days and three nights against the attacks of a spanish  army which had crossed the pyrenees under the orders of the constable of  castille  forced it to raise the siege and beat a retreat   everywhere   in the provinces as well as at the court  the feudal nobility  chieftains  and simple gentlemen  remained faithful to the king  the magistrates and  the people supported the military  it was the whole nation that rose  against the great lord  who  for his own purposes  was making alliance  with foreigners against the king and the country     in respect of italy  francis i  was less wise and less successful   not  only did he persist in the stereotyped madness of the conquest of  milaness and the kingdom of naples  but abandoning for the moment the  prosecution of it in person  he intrusted it to his favorite  admiral  bonnivet  a brave soldier  alternately rash and backward  presumptuous  and irresolute  who had already lost credit by the mistakes he had  committed and the reverses he had experienced in that arena   at the very  juncture when francis i  confided this difficult charge to bonnivet  the  constable de bourbon  having at last got out of france  crossed germany   repaired to italy  and halted at mantua  piacenza  and genoa  and  whilst  waiting for a reply from charles v   whom he had informed of his arrival   he associated with the leaders of the imperial armies  lived amongst the  troops  inoculated them with his own ardor as well as warlike views  and  by his natural superiority regained  amongst the european coalition  the  consideration and authority which had been somewhat diminished by his  ill success in his own country and his flight from it   charles v  was  some time about sending an answer  for  in his eyes also  bourbon had  fallen somewhat    was it prudent   says the historian of bourbon  himself   to trust a prince who  though born near the throne  had  betrayed his own blood and forsworn his own country   charles v  might no  doubt have insured his fidelity  had he given him in marriage eleanor of  austria  who was already affianced to him  but he could not make up his  mind to unite the destiny of a princess  his own sister  with that of a  prince whose position was equally pitiable and criminal   at last   however  he decided to name him his lieutenant general in italy  but he  surrounded him with so many colleagues and so much surveillance that he  had nothing to fear from his remorse and repentance      histoire de la  maison de bourbon   t  ii   p        bourbon  however  though thus placed  in a position of perplexity and difficulty  was none the less an  adversary with whom bonnivet was not in a condition to cope     it was not long before this was proved by facts   the campaign of      in  italy  brilliant as was its beginning  what with the number and the fine  appearance of the troops under bonnivet s orders  was  as it went on   nothing but a series of hesitations  contradictory movements  blunders   and checks  which the army itself set down to its general s account   bonnivet  during his investment of milan  had posted bayard with a small  corps in the village of rebec    the good knight  who was never wont to  murmur at any commission given him  said   sir admiral  you would send me  to a village hard by the enemy  the which is without any fortress  and  would need four times so many men as i have  for to be in safety and to  hold it     sir bayard   said the admiral   go in peace  on my faith i  promise you that within three days i will send you plenty of men with you  for to hold rebec  since i well know that it is not to be held with so  few men  but never you mind  there shall not a mouse get out of milan  without you have notice of it    and so much did he say of one sort and  another that the good knight  with great disgust  went away with the men  told off to him to his post in rebec   he wrote many times to the admiral  that he was in very dangerous plight  and that  if he would have them  hold out long  he should send him aid  but he got no answer   the enemies  who were inside milan were warned that the good knight was in rebec with  very little company  so they decided on a night to go and surprise and  defeat him   and the good knight  who was ever on his guard  set nearly  every night half his men to watch and to listen  and himself passed two  or three nights at it  in such sort that he fell ill  as much from  melancholy as from cold  and far more than he let it appear  howbeit he  was forced to keep his room that day   when it came on towards night  he  ordered some captains who were with him to go on the watch   they went   or made show of going  but  because it rained a little  back went all  those who were on the watch  save three or four poor archers  the which   when the spaniards approached within bow shot of the village  made no  resistance  but took to flight  shouting   alarm alarm    the good  knight  who in such jeopardy never slept but with his clothes on  rose at  once  had the bridle put on a charger that was already saddled  and went  off with five or six men at arms of his  straight to the barrier whither  incontinently came up captain lorges and a certain number of his foot   who bore themselves mighty well   the uproar was great and the alarm was  hot   then said the good knight to captain lorges   lorges  my friend   this is an unequal sort of game  if they pass this barrier we are cooked   i pray you  retire your men  keep the best order you can  and march  straight to the camp at abbiate grasso  i  with the horse i have  will  remain in the rear   we must leave our baggage to the enemy  there is no  help for it   save we the lives if possible            the enemy sought  on all sides for the good knight  but he had already arrived at  abbiate grasso  where he had some unpleasant words with the admiral   howbeit  i will not make any mention of them  but if they had both lived  longer than they did live  they would probably have gone a little  farther   the good knight was like to die of grief at the mishap that  had befallen him  even though it was not his fault  but in war there is  hap and mishap more than in all other things      histoire du bon  chevalier sans peur et sans reproche   t  ii   pp            les gestes  et la vie du chevalier bayard   by champier  pp               the situation of the french army before milan was now becoming more and  more  not insecure only  but critical   bonnivet considered it his duty  to abandon it and fall back towards piedmont  where he reckoned upon  finding a corps of five thousand swiss who were coming to support their  compatriots engaged in the service of france   near romagnano  on the  banks of the sesia  the retreat was hotly pressed by the imperial army   the command of which had been ultimately given by charles v  to the  constable de bourbon  with whom were associated the viceroy of naples   charles de lannoy  and ferdinand d avalos  marquis of pescara  the most  able amongst the neapolitan officers   on the   th of april        some  disorder took place in the retreat of the french  and bonnivet  being  severely wounded  had to give up the command to the count of st  pol and  to chevalier bayard   bayard  last as well as first in the fight   according to his custom  charged at the head of some men at arms upon the  imperialists  who were pressing the french too closely  when he was  himself struck by a shot from an arquebuse  which shattered his reins    jesus  my god   he cried   i am dead    he then took his sword by the  handle  and kissed the cross hilt of it as the sign of the cross  saying  aloud as he did so   have pity on me  o god  according to thy great  mercy   miserere mei  deus  secundum magnam misericordiam tuam    thereupon he became incontinently quite pale  and all but fell  but he  still had heart enough to grasp the pommel of the saddle  and remained in  that condition until a young gentleman  his own house steward  helped him  to dismount and set him down under a tree  with his face to the enemy   the poor gentleman burst into tears  seeing his good master so mortally  hurt that remedy there was none  but the good knight consoled him gently   saying   jacques  my friend  leave off thy mourning  it is god s will to  take me out of this world  by his grace i have lived long therein  and  have received therein blessings and honors more than my due   all the  regret i feel at dying is that i have not done my duty so well as i  ought   i pray you  jacques  my friend  let them not take me up from this  spot  for  when i move  i feel all the pains that one can feel  short of  death  which will seize me soon    the constable de bourbon  being  informed of his wound  came to him  saying   bayard  my friend  i am sore  distressed at your mishap  there is nothing for it but patience  give not  way to melancholy  i will send in quest of the best surgeons in this  country  and  by god s help  you will soon be healed     my lord    answered bayard   there is no pity for me  i die having done my duty  but  i have pity for you  to see you serving against your king  your country   and your oath    bourbon withdrew without a word   the marquis of pescara  came passing by    would to god  gentle sir bayard   said he   that it  had cost me a quart of my blood  without meeting my death  that i had  been doomed not to taste meat for two years  and that i held you safe and  sound my prisoner  for by the treatment i showed you  you should have  understanding of how much i esteemed the high prowess that was in you    he ordered his people to rig up a tent over bayard  and to forbid any  noise near him  so that he might die in peace   bayard s own gentlemen  would not  at any price  leave him    i do beseech you   he said to them    to get you gone  else you might fall into the enemy s hands  and that  would profit me nothing  for all is over with me   to god i commend ye   my good friends  and i recommend to you my poor soul  and salute  i pray  you  the king our master  and tell him that i am distressed at being no  longer able to do him service  for i had good will thereto   and to my  lords the princes of france  and all my lords my comrades  and generally

the country and the greater part of all the  burgesses  townsfolk  and villagers came half a league to meet the body   then into the church of notre dame  in the aforesaid grenoble  where a  solemn service was done for him  then to a house of  minimes   which had  been founded aforetime by his good uncle the bishop of grenoble  laurens  alment  and there he was honorably interred   then every one withdrew to  his own house  but for a month there was a stop put to festivals dances   banquets  and all other pastimes    las  they had good reason  for  greater loss could not have come upon the country      histoire du bon  chevalier sans peur et sans reproche   t  ii   pp               it is a duty and an honor for history to give to such lives and such  deaths  as remarkable for modesty as for manly worth  the full place  which they ought to occupy in the memory of mankind     the french army continued its retreat under the orders of the count of  st  pol  and re entered france by way of suza and briancon   it was  francis i  s third time of losing milaness   charles v   enchanted at the  news  wrote on the   th of may to henry viii    i keep you advertised of  the good opportunity it has pleased god to offer us of giving a full  account of our common enemy   i pray you to carry into effect on your  side that which you and i have for a long while desired  wherein i for my  part will exert myself with all my might    bourbon proposed to the two  sovereigns a plan well calculated to allure them   he made them an offer  to enter france by way of provence with his victorious army  to  concentrate there all the re enforcements promised him  to advance up the  rhone  making himself master as he went of the only two strong places   monaco and marseilles  he would have to encounter  to march on lyons from  the side on which that city was defenceless  and be in four months at  paris  whether or no he had a great battle to deliver on the march    if  the king wishes to enter france without delay   said he to henry viii  s  ambassador   i give his grace leave to pluck out my two eyes if i am not  master of paris before all saints   paris taken  all the kingdom of  france is in my power   paris in france is like milan in lombardy  if  milan is taken  the duchy is lost  in the same way  paris taken  the  whole of france is lost    by this plan bourbon calculated on arriving  victorious at the centre of france  in his own domains  and there  obtaining  from both nobles and people  the co operation that had failed  him at the outset of his enterprise   the two sovereigns were eager to  close with the proposal of the frenchman  who was for thus handing over  to them his country  a new treaty was concluded between them on the   th  of may        regulating the conditions and means of carrying out this  grand campaign  and it was further agreed that provence and dauphiny  should be added to the constable s old possessions  and should form a  state  which charles v  promised to raise to a kingdom   there was yet a  difficulty looming ahead   bourbon still hesitated to formally  acknowledge henry viii  as king of france  and promise him allegiance   but at last his resistance was overcome   at the moment of crossing the  frontier into france  and after having taken the communion  he said to  the english ambassador  sir richard pace  in the presence of four of his  gentlemen   i promise you  on my faith  to place the crown  with the help  of my friends  on the head of our common master    but  employing a ruse  of the old feudal times  the last gasp of a troubled conscience  bourbon   whilst promising allegiance to henry viii   persisted in refusing to do  him homage   sir richard pace none the less regarded the question as  decided  and  whilst urging cardinal wolsey to act swiftly and resolutely  in the interests of their master  he added   if you do not pay regard to  these matters  i shall set down to your grace s account the loss of the  crown of france      bourbon entered provence on the  th of july        with an army of  eighteen thousand men  which was to be joined before long by six or seven  thousand more   he had no difficulty in occupying antibes  frejus   draguignan  brignoles  and even aix  and he already began to assume the  title of count of provence  whilst preparing for a rapid march along by  the rhone and a rush upon lyons  the chief aim of the campaign  but the  spanish generals whom charles v  had associated with him  and amongst  others the most eminent of them  the marquis of pescara  peremptorily  insisted that  according to their master s order  he should besiege and  take marseilles   charles v  cared more for the coasts of the  mediterranean than for those of the channel  he flattered himself that he  would make of marseilles a southern calais  which should connect germany  with spain  and secure their communications  political and commercial   bourbon objected and resisted  it was the abandonment of his general plan  for this war and a painful proof how powerless he was against the wishes  of the two sovereigns  of whom he was only the tool  although they called  him their ally   being forced to yield  he began the siege of marseilles  on the   th of august   the place  though but slightly fortified and ill  supplied  made an energetic resistance  the name and the presence of  bourbon at the head of the besiegers excited patriotism  the burgesses  turned soldiers  the cannon of the besiegers laid open their walls  but  they threw up a second line  an earthen rampart  called the ladies   rampart  because all the women in the city had worked at it   the siege  was protracted  the re enforcements expected by bourbon did not arrive  a  shot from marseilles penetrated into pescara s tent  and killed his  almoner and two of his gentlemen   bourbon rushed up    don t you see    said pescara to him  ironically   here are the keys sent to you by the  timid consuls of marseilles    bourbon resolved to attempt an assault   the lanzknechts and the italians refused  bourbon asked pescara for his  spaniards  but pescara would only consent on condition that the breach  was reconnoitered afresh   seven soldiers were told off for this duty   four were killed and the other three returned wounded  reporting that  between the open breach and the intrenchment extended a large ditch  filled with fireworks and defended by several batteries   the assembled  general officers looked at one another in silence    well  gentlemen    said pescara   you see that the folks of marseilles keep a table well  spread for our reception  if you like to go and sup in paradise  you are  your own masters so far  as for me  who have no desire to go thither just  yet  i am off   but believe me   he added seriously   we had best return  to milaness  we have left that country without a soldier  we might  possibly find our return cut off    whereupon pescara got up and went  out  and the majority of the officers followed him   bourbon remained  almost alone  divided between anger and shame   almost as he quitted this  scene he heard that francis i  was advancing towards provence with an  army   the king had suddenly decided to go to the succor of marseilles   which was making so good a defence   nothing could be a bitterer pill for  bourbon than to retire before francis i   whom he had but lately promised  to dethrone  but his position condemned him to suffer everything  without  allowing him the least hesitation  and on the   th of september        he  raised the siege of marseilles and resumed the road to italy  harassed  even beyond toulon by the french advance guard  eager in its pursuit of  the traitor even more than of the enemy     in the course of this year        whilst bourbon was wandering as a  fugitive  trying to escape from his country  then returning to it  after  a few months  as a conqueror  and then leaving it again at the end of a  few weeks of prospective triumph  pursued by the king he had betrayed   his case and that of his accomplices had been inquired into and disposed  of by the parliament of paris  dispassionately and almost coldly   probably because of the small esteem in which the magistrates held the  court of francis i   and of the wrong which they found had been done to  the constable   the parliament was not excited by a feeling of any great  danger to the king and the country  it was clear that  at the core  the  conspiracy and rebellion were very circumscribed and impotent  and the  accusations brought by the court party or their servants against the  conspirators were laughable from their very outrageousness and  unlikelihood  according to them  the accomplices of the constable meant  not only to dethrone  and  if need were  kill the king  but  to make pies  of the children of france    parliament saw no occasion to proceed  against more than a half score of persons in confinement  and  except  nineteen defaulters who were condemned to death together with  confiscation of their property  only one capital sentence was pronounced   against john of poitiers  lord of saint vallier  the same who had exerted  himself to divert the constable from his plot  but who had nevertheless  not refrained from joining it  and was the most guilty of all the  accomplices in consequence of the confidential post he occupied near the  king s person   the decree was not executed  however  saint vallier  received his reprieve on the scaffold itself   francis i  was neither  rancorous nor cruel  and the entreaties  or  according to some  evil speakers of the day  the kind favors  of the lady de brew   saint vallier s daughter and subsequently the celebrated diana of  poitiers  obtained from the king her father s life     francis i   greatly vexed  it is said  at the lenity of the parliament of  paris  summoned commissions chosen amongst the parliaments of rouen   dijon  toulouse  and bordeaux  and made them reconsider the case   the  provincial parliaments decided as that of paris had   the procedure  against the principal culprit was several times suspended and resumed  according to the course of events  and the decree was not pronounced so  long as the duke of bourbon lived   it was abroad and in his alliance  with foreign sovereigns that all his importance lay     after bourbon s precipitate retreat  the position of francis i  was a  good one   he had triumphed over conspiracy and invasion  the conspiracy  had not been catching  and the invasion had failed on all the frontiers   if the king  in security within his kingdom  had confined himself to it   whilst applying himself to the task of governing it well  he would have  obtained all the strength he required to make himself feared and deferred  to abroad   for a while he seemed to have entertained this design  on the    th of september        he published an important ordinance for the  repression of disorderliness and outrages on the part of the soldiery in  france itself  and  on the   th of december following  a regulation as to  the administration of finances established a control over the various  exchequer officers  and announced the king s intention of putting some  limits to his personal expenses   not including  however   said he   the  ordinary run of our little necessities and pleasures    this singular  reservation was the faithful exponent of his character  he was licentious  at home and adventurous abroad  being swayed by his coarse passions and  his warlike fancies   even far away from paris  in the heart of the  provinces  the king s irregularities were known and dreaded   in        some few weeks after the death  at blois  july           of his wife   queen claude  daughter of louis xii   a virtuous and modest princess more  regretted by the people than by her husband  francis made his entry into  manosque  in provence   the burgesses had the keys of their town  presented to him by the most beautiful creature they could find within  their walls  it was the daughter of antony voland  one of themselves   the virtuous young girl was so frightened at the king s glances and the  signs he made to his gentry  evidently alluding to her  that  on  returning home  she got some burning sulphur and placed herself for a  long while under the influence of its vapor  in order to destroy the  beauty which made her run the risk of being only too pleasing to the  king   francis  who was no great or able captain  could not resist the  temptations of war any more than those of the flesh   when bourbon and  the imperial army had evacuated provence  the king loudly proclaimed his  purpose of pursuing them into italy  and of once more going forth to the  conquest of milaness  and perhaps also of the kingdom of naples  that  incurable craze of french kings in the sixteenth century   in vain did  his most experienced warriors  la tremoille and chabannes  exert  themselves to divert him from such a campaign  for which he was not  prepared  in vain did his mother herself write to him  begging him to  wait and see her  for that she had important matters to impart to him   he answered by sending her the ordinance which conferred upon her the  regency during his absence  and  at the end of october        he had  crossed the alps  anxious to go and risk in milaness the stake he had  just won in provence against charles v     arriving speedily in front of milan  he there found the imperial army  which had retired before him  there was a fight in one of the outskirts   but bourbon recognized the impossibility of maintaining a siege in a town  of which the fortifications were in ruins  and with disheartened troops   on the line of march which they had pursued  from lodi to milan  there  was nothing to be seen but cuirasses  arquebuses tossed hither and  thither  dead horses  and men dying of fatigue and scarcely able to drag  themselves along   bourbon evacuated milan  and  taking a resolution as  bold as it was singular  abruptly abandoned  so far as he was personally  concerned  that defeated and disorganized army  to go and seek for and  reorganize another at a distance   being informed that charles iii   duke  of savoy  hitherto favorable to france  was secretly inclining towards  the emperor  he went to turin  made a great impression by his confidence  and his grand spirit in the midst of misfortune upon both the duke and  his wife  beatrix of portugal  and obtained from them not only a  flattering reception  but a secret gift of their money and their jewelry   and  equipped with these resources  he passed into germany to recruit  soldiers there   the lanzknechts  who had formerly served under him in  france  rushed to him in shoals  he had received from nature the gifts  most calculated to gain the hearts of campaigners  kind  accessible   affable and even familiar with the common soldier  he entered into the  details of his wants and alleviated them   his famous bravery  his  frankness  and his generosity gained over those adventurers who were  weary of remaining idle  their affection consoled bourbon and stood him  in stead of all  his army became his family and his camp his country   proscribed and condemned in france  without any position secured to him  in the dominions of charles v   envied and crossed by that prince s  generals  he had found full need of all the strong tempering of his  character and of his warlike genius to keep him from giving way under so  many trials   he was beginning to feel himself near recovery  he had an  army  an army of his own  he had chosen for it men inured to labor and  fatigue  accustomed to strict discipline  and thereto he added five  hundred horsemen from franche comte for whose devotion and courage he  could answer  and he gave the second command in this army to george of  freundsberg  an old captain of lanzknechts and commandant of the  emperor s guard  the same who  three years before  on seeing luther  boldly enter worms  said to him  with a slap on the shoulder   little  monk  this is a daring step thou art going to take   nor i  nor any  captain of us  ever did the like   if thy cause is good  and if thou have  faith in thy cause  forward  little monk  in god s name forward    with  such comrades about him  bourbon re entered milaness at the head of  twelve or thirteen thousand fighting men  three months after having left  it  alone and moneyless   his rivals about the person of charles v    lannoy  viceroy of naples  and the marquis of pescara  could not help  admiring him  and he regained in the imperial camp an ascendency which  had but lately been very much shaken     he found the fresh campaign begun in earnest   francis i  s veteran  generals  marshals la tremoille and chabannes  had advised him to pursue  without pause the beaten and disorganized imperial army  which was in  such plight that there was placarded on the statue of pasquin at rome    lost  an army  in the mountains of genoa  if anybody knows what has  become of it  let him come forward and say  he shall be well rewarded    if the king of france  it was said  drove back northward and forced into  the venetian dominions the remnants of this army  the spaniards would not  be able to hold their own in milaness  and would have to retire within  the kingdom of naples   but admiral bonnivet   whose counsel the king  made use of more than of any other   says du bellay  pressed francis i   to make himself master  before everything  of the principal strong places  in lombardy  especially of pavia  the second city in the duchy of milan   francis followed this counsel  and on the   th of august        twenty  days after setting out from aix in provence  he appeared with his army in  front of pavia   on learning this resolution  pescara joyously exclaimed    we were vanquished  a little while and we shall be vanquishers    pavia  had for governor a spanish veteran  antony de leyva  who had  distinguished himself at the battle of ravenna  in       by his vigilance  and indomitable tenacity  and he held out for nearly four months  first  against assaults  and then against investment by the french army   francis i  and his generals occasionally proceeded during this siege to  severities condemned by the laws and usages of war   a small spanish  garrison had obstinately defended a tower situated at the entrance of a  stone bridge which led from an island on the ticino into pavia   marshal  de montmorency at last carried the tower  and had all the defenders  hanged  for having dared   he said   to offer resistance to an army of  the king s in such a pigeon hole    antony de leyva had the bridge  forthwith broken down  and de montmorency was stopped on the borders of  the ticino   in spite of the losses of its garrison in assaults and  sorties  and in spite of the sufferings of the inhabitants from famine  and from lack of resources of all sorts  pavia continued to hold out   there was a want of wood as well as of bread  and they knocked the houses  to pieces for fuel   antony de leyva caused to be melted down the vessels  of the churches and the silvern chandeliers of the university  and even a  magnificent chain of gold which he habitually wore round his neck   he  feared he would have to give in at last  for want of victuals and  ammunition  when  towards the end of january        he saw appearing  on  the northern side  the flags of the imperial army  it was bourbon   lannoy  and pescara  who were coming up with twenty thousand foot  seven  hundred men at arms  a troop of spanish arquebusiers  and several pieces  of cannon   bourbon  whilst on the march  had written  on the  th of  january  to henry viii   and  after telling him what he meant to do  had  added   i know through one of my servants that the french have said that  i retired from provence shamefully   i remained there a space of three  months and eight days  waiting for battle   i hope to give the world to  know that i have no fear of king francis  for  please god  we shall place  ourselves so close together that we shall have great trouble to get  disentangled without battle  and i shall so do that neither he nor they  who have held such talk about me shall say that i was afraid of being  there    the situation was from that moment changed   the french army  found themselves squeezed between the fortress which would not surrender  and the imperial army which was coming to relieve it   things  however   remained stationary for three weeks   francis i  intrenched himself  strongly in his camp  which the imperialists could not attack without  great risk of unsuccess    pavia is doomed to fall   wrote francis to his  mother the regent on the  d of february   if they do not reenforce it  somehow  and they are beating about to make it hold on to the last gasp   which  i think  will not be long now  for it is more than a month since  those inside have had no wine to drink and neither meat nor cheese to  eat  they are short of powder even    antony de leyva gave notice to the  imperialists that the town was not in a condition for further resistance   on the other hand  if the imperial army put off fighting  they could not  help breaking up  they had exhausted their victuals  and the leaders  their money  they were keeping the field without receiving pay  and were  subsisting  so to speak  without resources   the prudent marquis of  pescara himself was for bringing on a battle  which was indispensable    a hundred years in the field   said he  in the words of an old italian  proverb   are better than one day of fighting  for one may lose in a  doubtful melley what one was certain of winning by skilful manoeuvres   but when one can no longer keep the field  one must risk a battle  so as  not to give the enemy the victory without a fight    the same question  was being discussed in the french camp   the veteran captains  la  tremoille and chabannes  were of opinion that by remaining in the strong  position in which they were encamped they would conquer without fighting   bonnivet and de montmorency were of the contrary opinion    we french    said bonnivet   have not been wont to make war by means of military  artifices  but handsomely and openly  especially when we have at our head  a valiant king  who is enough to make the veriest dastards fight   our  kings bring victory with them  as our little king charles viii  did at  the taro  our king louis xii  at agnadello  and our king who is here  present at melegnano    francis i  was not the man to hold out against  such sentiments and such precedents  and he decided to accept battle as  soon as it should be offered him   the imperial leaders  at a council  held on the   d of february  determined to offer it next day   bourbon  vigorously supported the opinion of pescara     antony de leyva was notified the same evening of their decision  and was  invited to make  as soon as he heard two cannon shots  a sortie which  would place the french army between two fires   pescara  according to his  custom  mustered the spaniards  and   my lads   said he   fortune has  brought you to such extremity that on the soil of italy you have for your  own only that which is under your feet   all the emperor s might could  not procure for you to morrow morning one morsel of bread   we know not  where to get it  save in the frenchman s camp  which is before your eyes   there they have abundance of everything  bread  meat  trout and carp from  the lake of garda   and so  my lads  if you are set upon having anything  to eat tomorrow  march we down on the frenchmen s camp    freundsberg  spoke in the same style to the german lanzknechts   and both were  responded to with cheers   eloquence is mighty powerful when it speaks in  the name of necessity     the two armies were of pretty equal strength  they had each from twenty  to five and twenty thousand infantry  french  germans  spaniards   lanzknechts  and swiss   francis i  had the advantage in artillery and in  heavy cavalry  called at that time the gendarmerie  that is to say  the  corps of men at arms in heavy armor with their servants  but his troops  were inferior in effectives to the imperialists  and charles v  s two  generals  bourbon and pescara  were  as men of war  far superior to  francis i  and his favorite bonnivet   in the night between the   d and    th of february they opened a breach of forty or fifty fathoms in the  wall around the park of mirabello  where the french camp was situated  a  corps immediately passed through it  marching on pavia to re enforce the  garrison  and the main body of the imperial army entered the park to  offer the french battle on that ground   the king at once set his army in  motion  and his well posted artillery mowed down the corps of germans and  spaniards who had entered the park    you could see nothing   says a  witness of the battle   but heads and arms flying about    the action  seemed to be going ill for the imperialists  pescara urged the duke of  bourbon and lannoy  the viceroy of naples  to make haste and come up   lannoy made the sign of the cross  and said to his men   there is no hope  but in god  follow me and do every one as i do    francis i   on his  side  advanced with the pick of his men at arms  burst on the  advance guard of the enemy  broke it  killed with his own hand the  marquis of civita san angelo  and dispersed the various corps he found in  his way   in the confidence of his joy he thought the victory decided   and  turning to marshal de foix  who was with him   m  de lescun   said  he   now am i fain to call myself duke of milan    but bourbon and  pescara were not the men to accept a defeat so soon  they united all  their forces  and resumed the offensive at all points  the french  batteries  masked by an ill considered movement on the part of their own  troops  who threw themselves between them and the enemy  lost all  serviceability  and pescara launched upon the french gendarmerie fifteen  hundred basque arquebusiers  whom he had exercised and drilled to  penetrate into the midst of the horses  shoot both horses and riders  and  fall back rapidly after having discharged their pieces   being attacked  by the german lanzknechts of bourbon and freundsberg  the swiss in the  french service did not maintain their renown  and began to give way    my  god  what is all this   cried francis i   seeing them waver  and he  dashed towards them to lead them back into action  but neither his  efforts  nor those of john of diesbach and the lord of fleuranges  who  were their commanders  were attended with success   the king was only  the more eager for the fray  and  rallying around him all those of his  men at arms who would neither recoil nor surrender  he charged the  imperialists furiously  throwing himself into the thickest of the melley   and seeking in excess of peril some chance of victory  but pescara   though wounded in three places  was none the less stubbornly fighting on   and antony de leyva  governor of pavia  came with the greater part of the  garrison to his aid   at this very moment francis i   heard that the  first prince of the blood  his brother in law the duke of alencon  who  commanded the rear guard  had precipitately left the field of battle   the oldest and most glorious warriors of france  la tremoille  marshal de  chabannes  marshal de foix  the grand equerry san severino  the duke of  suffolk  francis of lorraine  chaumont  bussy d amboise  and francis de  duras fell  here and there  mortally wounded   at this sight admiral  bonnivet in despair exclaimed   i can never survive this fearful havoc    and raising the visor of his helmet  he rushed to meet the shots which  were aimed at him  and in his turn fell beside his comrades in arms   bourbon had expressly charged his men to search everywhere in the melley  for the admiral  and bring him in a prisoner   when  as he passed along  that part of the battle field  he recognized the corpse   ah  wretch   he  cried  as he moved away   it is thou who hast caused the ruin of france  and of me    amidst these dead and dying  francis still fought on   wounded as he was in the face  the arms  and the legs  he struck right  and left with his huge sword  and cut down the nearest of his assailants   but his horse  mortally wounded  dragged him down as it fell  he was up  again in an instant  and  standing beside his horse  he laid low two more  spaniards who were pressing him closely  the ruck of the soldiers crowded  about him  they did not know him  but his stature  his strength  his  bravery  his coat of mail studded with golden lilies  and his helmet  overshadowed by a thick plume of feathers pointed him out to all as the  finest capture to make  his danger was increasing every minute  when one  of bourbon s most intimate confidants  the lord of pomperant  who  in        had accompanied the constable in his flight through france  came up  at this critical moment  recognized the king  and  beating off the  soldiers with his sword  ranged himself at the king s side  represented  to him the necessity of yielding  and pressed him to surrender to the  duke of bourbon  who was not far off    no   said the king   rather die  than pledge my faith to a traitor where is the viceroy of naples    it  took some time to find lannoy  but at last he arrived and put one knee on  the ground before francis i   who handed his sword to him   lannoy took  it with marks of the most profound respect  and immediately gave him  another   the battle was over  and francis i  was charles v  s prisoner      illustration  capture of francis i            he had shown himself an imprudent and unskilful general  but at the same  time a hero   his conquerors  both officers and privates  could not help   whilst they secured his person  showing their admiration for him   when  he sat down to table  after having had his wounds  which were slight   attended to  bourbon approached him respectfully and presented him with a  dinner napkin  and the king took it without embarrassment and with frigid  and curt politeness   he next day granted him an interview  at which an  accommodation took place with due formalities on both sides  but nothing  more   all the king s regard was for the marquis of pescara  who came to  see him in a simple suit of black  in order  as it were  to share his  distress    he was a perfect gentleman   said francis i    both in peace  and in war    he heaped upon him marks of esteem and almost of  confidence    how do you think   he asked   the emperor will behave to  me     i think   replied pescara   i can answer for the emperor s  moderation  i am sure that he will make a generous use of his victory   if  however  he were capable of forgetting what is due to your rank  your  merits  and your misfortunes  i would never cease to remind him of it   and i would lose what little claim upon him my services may have given  me  or you should be satisfied with his behavior    the king embraced him  warmly   he asked to be excused from entering pavia  that he might not be  a gazing stock in a town that he had so nearly taken   he was   accordingly  conducted to pizzighittone  a little fortress between milan  and cremona   he wrote thence two letters  one to his mother the regent  and the other to charles v   which are here given word for word  because  they so well depict his character and the state of his mind in his hour  of calamity                 to the regent of france  madame  that you may know how stands       the rest of my misfortune  there is nothing in the world left to me       but honor and my life  which is safe   and in order that  in your       adversity  this news might bring you some little comfort  i prayed       for permission to write you this letter  which was readily granted       me  entreating you  in the exercise of your accustomed prudence  to       be pleased not to do anything rash  for i have hope  after all  that       god will not forsake me   commending to you my children your       grandchildren  and entreating you to give the bearer a free passage        going and returning  to spain  for he is going to the emperor to       learn how it is his pleasure that i should be treated                to the emperor charles v   if liberty had been sooner granted       me by my cousin the viceroy  i should not have delayed so long to do       my duty towards you  according as the time and the circumstances in       which i am placed require  having no other comfort under my       misfortune than a reliance on your goodness  which  if it so please        shall employ the results of victory with honorableness towards me        having steadfast hope that your virtue would not willingly constrain       me to anything that was not honorable  entreating you to consult       your own heart as to what you shall be pleased to do with me        feeling sure that the will of a prince such as you are cannot be       coupled with aught but honor and magnanimity   wherefore  if it       please you to have so much honorable pity as to answer for the       safety which a captive king of france deserves to find  whom there       is a desire to render friendly and not desperate  you may be sure of       obtaining an acquisition instead of a useless prisoner  and of       making a king of france your slave forever      the former of these two letters has had its native hue somewhat altered  in the majority of histories  in which it has been compressed into those  eloquent words   all is lost save honor    the second needs no comment to  make apparent what it lacks of kingly pride and personal dignity   beneath the warrior s heroism there was in the qualities of francis i   more of what is outwardly brilliant and winning than of real strength and  solidity     but the warrior s heroism  in conjunction with what is outwardly  brilliant and winning in the man  exercises a great influence over  people   the viceroy of naples perceived and grew anxious at the  popularity of which francis i  was the object at pizzighittone   the  lanzknechts took an open interest in him and his fortunes  the italians  fixed their eyes on him  and bourbon  being reconciled to him  might  meditate carrying him off   lannoy resolved to send him to naples  where  there would be more certainty of guarding him securely   francis made no  objection to this design   on the   th of may        he wrote to his  mother   madame  the bearer has assured me that he will bring you this  letter safely  and  as i have but little time  i will tell you nothing  more than i shall be off to naples on monday    and so keep a lookout at  sea  for we shall have only fourteen galleys to take us and eighteen  hundred spaniards to man them  but those will be all their arquebusiers   above all  haste  for  if that is made  i am in hopes that you may soon  see your most humble and most obedient son    there was no opportunity  for even attempting to carry off the king as he went by sea to naples   instead of taking him to naples  lannoy transported him straight to  spain  with the full assent of the king and the regent themselves  for it  was in french galleys manned by spanish troops that the voyage was made   instead of awaiting the result of such doubtful chances of deliverance as  might occur in italy  francis i   his mother  and his sister margaret   entertained the idea that what was of the utmost importance for him was  to confer and treat in person with charles v   which could not be done  save in spain itself   in vain did bourbon and pescara  whose whole  influence and ambitious hopes lay in italy  and who  on that stage   regarded francis i  as their own prisoner rather than charles v  s  exert  themselves to combat this proposal  the viceroy of naples  in concert  no  doubt  with charles v   himself as well as with francis i  and his  mother  took no heed of their opposition  and francis i   disembarking at  the end of june at barcelona first and then at valentia  sent  on the  d  of july  to charles v  the duke de montmorency  with orders to say that  he had desired to approach the emperor   not only to obtain peace and  deliverance in his own person  but also to establish and confirm italy in  the state and fact of devotion to the emperor  before that the potentates  and lords of italy should have leisure to rally together in opposition    the regent  his mother  and his sister margaret congratulated him  heartily on his arrival in spain  and charles v   himself wrote to him    it was a pleasure to me to hear of your arrival over here  because that   just now  it will be the cause of a happy general peace for the great  good of christendom  which is what i most desire      it is difficult to understand how francis i  and charles v  could rely  upon personal interviews and negotiations for putting an end to their  contentions and establishing a general peace   each knew the other s  pretensions  and they knew how little disposed they were  either of them   to abandon them   on the   th of march        a month after the battle of  pavia  charles v  had given his ambassadors instructions as to treating  for the ransom and liberation of the king of france   his chief  requirements were  that francis i  should renounce all attempts at  conquest in italy  that he should give up the suzerainty of the  countships of flanders and artois  that he should surrender to charles v   the duchy of burgundy with all its dependencies  as derived from mary of  burgundy  daughter of the last duke  charles the rash  that the duke of  bourbon should be reinstated in possession of all his domains  with the  addition thereto of provence and dauphiny  which should form an  independent state  and  lastly  that france should pay england all the  sums of money which austria owed her   francis i   on hearing  at  pizzighittone  these proposals read out  suddenly drew his sword as if to  stab himself  saying   it were better for a king to end thus    his  custodian  alancon  seized his arm  whilst recalling him to his senses   francis recovered calmness  but without changing his resolution  he would  rather  he said  bury himself in a prison forever than subscribe to  conditions destructive of his kingdom  and such as the states general of  france would never accept   when francis i  was removed to spain he had  made only secondary concessions as to these requirements of charles v    and charles v  had not abandoned any one of his original requirements   marshal de montmorency  when sent by the king to the emperor on the  d of  july        did not enter at all into the actual kernel of the  negotiation  after some conventional protestations of a pacific kind  he  confined himself to demanding  a safe conduct for madame marguerite of  france  the king s only sister  duchess of alencon and berry  who would  bring with her such and so full powers of treating for peace  the  liberation of the king  and friendly alliance to secure the said peace   that the emperor would clearly see that the king s intentions were pure  and genuine  and that he would be glad to conclude and decide in a month  what might otherwise drag on for a long while to the great detriment of  their subjects    the marshal was at the same time to propose the  conclusion of a truce during the course of the negotiations     amongst the letters at that time addressed to francis i   a prisoner of  war  is the following  dated march        when he was still in italy             my lord  the joy we are still feeling at the kind letters which you       were pleased to write yesterday to me and to your mother  makes us       so happy with the assurance of your health  on which our life       depends  that it seems to me that we ought to think of nothing but       of praising god and desiring a continuance of your good news  which       is the best meat we can have to live on   and inasmuch as the       creator bath given us grace that our trinity should be always       united  the other two do entreat you that this letter  presented to       you  who are the third  may be accepted with the same affection with       which it is cordially offered you by your most humble and most       obedient servants  your mother and sister         louise  marguerite      this close and tender union of the three continued through all  separations and all trials  the confidence of the captive king was  responsive to the devotion of his mother the regent and of his sister who  had become his negotiatrix   when the news came of the king s captivity   the regency threatened for a moment to become difficult and stormy  all  the ambition and the hatred that lay dormant in the court awoke  an  attempt was made to excite in the duke of vendome  the head of the  younger branch of the house of bourbon  a desire to take the regent s  place  the parliament of paris attacked the chancellor  duprat  whom they  hated  not without a cause  but the duke of vendome was proof against the  attempts which were made upon him  and frankly supported the regent   who made him the chief of her council  and the regent supported the  chancellor  she displayed  in these court contentions  an ability  partaking both of firmness and pliancy   the difficulties of foreign  policy found her equally active and prudent   the greatest peril which  france could at that time incur arose from the maintenance of the union  between the king of england and charles v   at the first news of the  battle of pavia  henry viii  dreamed for a moment of the partition of  france between charles and himself  with the crown of france for his own  share  demonstrations of joy took place at the court of london  and  attempts were made to levy  without the concurrence of parliament   imposts capable of sufficing for such an enterprise   but the english  nation felt no inclination to put up with this burden and the king s  arbitrary power in order to begin over again the hundred years  war   the primate  warham  archbishop of canterbury  wrote to cardinal wolsey    it is reported to me that when the people had orders to make bonfires  for the capture of the king of france  many folks said that it was more  reason for weeping than for rejoicing   others openly expressed their  desire that the king of france might be set at liberty  that a happy  peace might be concluded  and that the king might not attempt to conquer  france again  a conquest more burdensome than profitable  and more  difficult to keep than to make    wolsey himself was cooled towards  charles v   who  instead of writing to him as of old  and signing with  his own hand   your son and cousin   now merely put his name  charles   the regent  louise of savoy  profited ably by these feelings and  circumstances in england  a negotiation was opened between the two  courts  henry viii  gained by it two millions of crowns payable by annual  instalments of fifty thousand crowns each  and wolsey received a pension  of a hundred thousand crowns   at first a truce for four months  and then  an alliance  offensive and defensive  were concluded on the   th of  august        between france and england  and the regent  louise of  savoy  had no longer to trouble herself about anything except the  captivity of the king her son and the departure of her daughter margaret  to go and negotiate for the liberation of the prisoner     the negotiation had been commenced  as early as the   th of july  at  toledo  between the ambassadors of francis i  and the advisers of charles  v   but without any symptom of progress   francis i   since his arrival  in spain  had been taken from strong castle to strong castle  and then  removed to madrid  everywhere strictly guarded  and leading a sad life   without charles v  s coming to visit him or appointing him any  meeting place   in vain did the emperor s confessor  the bishop of osma   advise him to treat francis i  generously  and so lay upon him either the  obligation of thankfulness or the burden of ingratitude  the majority of  his servants gave him contrary counsel    i know not what you mean to  do   wrote his brother  the archduke ferdinand   but  if i were wise  enough to know how to give you good counsel  it seems to me that such an  opportunity should not be lost  but that you should follow up your good  fortune and act in such wise that neither the king of france nor his  successors should have power hereafter to do harm to you or yours    that  too  was charles v  s own way of thinking  but  slow and patient  as he was by nature  he relied upon the discomforts and the wearisomeness  of prolonged captivity and indecision for tiring out francis i  and  overcoming his resistance to the harsh conditions he would impose upon  him   the regent  louise  made him an offer to go herself and treat with  him  at perpignan  for the king s liberation  but he did not accept that  overture   the duke of alencon  son in law of louise  had died at lyons   unable to survive the shame of his flight at the battle of pavia  and the  regent hinted that her daughter marguerite  three months a widow   would  be happy if she could be agreeable to his imperial majesty   but charles  let the hint drop without a reply   however  at the end of august         he heard that francis i  was ill   from great melancholy he had fallen  into a violent fever    the population of madrid was in commotion   francis i  had become popular there  many people went to pray for him in  the churches  the doctors told the emperor that there was fear for the  invalid s life  and that he alone could alleviate the malady by  administering some hope   charles v  at once granted the safe conduct  which had been demanded of him for marguerite of france  and on the   th  of september he himself went to madrid to pay a visit to the captive   francis  on seeing him enter the chamber  said   so your majesty has come  to see your prisoner die     you are not my prisoner   answered charles    but my brother and my friend  i have no other purpose than to give you  your liberty and every satisfaction you can desire    next day marguerite  arrived  her mother  the regent  had accompanied her as far as  pont saint esprit  she had embarked  on the   th of august  at  aigues mortes  and  disembarking at barcelona  had gone to madrid by  litter  in order to somewhat assuage her impatience she had given  expression to it in the following tender stanzas                     for the bliss that awaits me so strong                 is my yearning that yearning is pain                  one hour is a hundred years long                  my litter  it bears me in vain                  it moves not  or seems to recede                  such speed would i make if i might                  o  the road  it is weary indeed                  where lies  at the end  my delight                     i gaze all around me all day                 for some one with tidings to bring                  not ceasing  ne er doubt me  to pray                 unto god for the health of my king                 i gaze  and when none is descried                  then i weep  and  what else  if you ask                  to my paper my grief i confide                 this  this is my sorrowful task                     o  welcome be he who at length                 shall tap at my door and shall cry                   the king to new health and new strength                 is returning  the king will not die                   then she  who were now better dead                  will run  the news bearer to see                  and kiss him for what he hath said                  that her brother from danger is free        francis was not  free from danger  when his sister arrived  she took her  post at his side  on the   th of september a serious crisis came on  and  he remained for some time  without speaking  or hearing  or seeing    marguerite had an altar set up in her chamber  and all the french  of the  household  great lords and domestics  knelt beside the sick man s sister   and received the communion from the  hands of the archbishop of embrun   who  drawing near the bed  entreated the king to turn his eyes to the  holy sacrament   francis came out of his lethargy  and asked to  communicate likewise  saying   god will cure me  soul and body    he  became convalescent  and on the   th of october he was sufficiently  recovered for marguerite to leave madrid  and go and resume negotiations  at toledo  whither charles v  had returned     the day but one after her arrival she wrote to the king   the emperor  gave me courteous and kind reception  and  after coming to meet me at the  entrance of this house  he used very kind and courteous language to me   he desired that he and i should be alone in the same room  and one of my  women to keep the door   this evening i will send you word of what has  been done  entreating you  my lord  to put on before sieur alancon  the  king s custodian  an air of weakness and weariness  for your debility  will strengthen me and will hasten my despatch  which seems to me slower  than i can tell you  as well for the sake of seeing you liberated  which  you will be by god s help  as of returning and trying whether your dear  hand can be of any use to you    marguerite was impressed by the  good will she discovered at the court of toledo in respect of the king of  france  his liberation  and the establishment of peace  she received from  the people in the streets  as well as from the great lords in their  houses  the most significant proofs of favor   charles v  took umbrage at  it  and had the duke of infantado  amongst others  informed that  if he  wished to please the emperor  neither he nor his sons must speak to  madame d alencon    but   said she   i am not tabooed to the ladies  to  whom i will speak double    she contracted a real intimacy with even the  sister of charles v   eleanor  widow of the king of portugal  whom  charles had promised to the duke of bourbon  and between whom and her  brother  king francis  marguerite set brewing a marriage  which was not  long deferred   but  in spite of her successes at the court  and even in  the family of the emperor  marguerite had no illusions touching the small  chance of bringing her grand object of negotiation to a happy issue    every one tells me   she wrote   that he loves the king  but there is  small experience of it            if i had to do with good sort of  people  who understand what honor is  i would not care  but the contrary  is the case    she did not lose courage  however   she spoke to the  emperor so bravely and courteously   says brantome   that he was quite  astounded  and she said still worse to those of his council  at which  she had audience  there she had full triumph of her good speaking and  haranguing  with an easy grace in which she was not deficient  and she  did so well with her fine speaking that she made herself rather agreeable  than hateful or tiresome  that her reasons were found good and pertinent   and that she remained in high esteem with the emperor  his council  and  his court      but neither good and pertinent reasons  nor the charm of eloquence in the  mouth of a pleasing and able woman  are sufficient to make head against  the passions and interests of the actors who are at a given moment in  possession of the political arena  it needs time  a great deal of time   before the unjust or unreasonable requirements and determinations of a  people  a generation  and the chief of a state become acknowledged as  such and abandoned   at the negotiations entered upon  in       between  francis i  and charles v   francis i  was prompt in making large and  unpalatable concessions  he renounced his pretensions  so far as italy  was concerned  to the duchy of milan  to genoa  and to the kingdom of  naples  his suzerainty over the countships of flanders and artois  and  possession of hesdin and tournay  he consented to reinstate duke charles  of bourbon in all his hereditary property and rights  and to pay three  millions of crowns in gold for his own ransom  but he refused to cede  provence and dauphiny to the duke of bourbon as an independent state   and to hand over the duchy of burgundy to charles v   as heir of his  grandmother  mary of burgundy  only daughter of charles the rash   charles v   after somewhat lukewarmly persisting  gave up the demand he  had made on behalf of the duke of bourbon  for having provence and  dauphiny erected into an independent state  but he insisted absolutely   on his own behalf  in his claim to the duchy of burgundy as a right and a  condition  sine qua non  of peace   the question at the bottom of the  negotiations between the two sovereigns lay thus  the acquisition of  burgundy was for charles v  the crowning point of his victory and of his  predominance in europe  the giving up of burgundy was for francis i  a  lasting proof of his defeat and a dismemberment of his kingdom  one would  not let his prisoner go at any price but this  the other would not  purchase at this price even his liberty and his restoration to his  friends   in this extremity francis i  took an honorable and noble  resolution  in october        he wrote to charles v    sir  my brother   i have heard from the archbishop of embrun and my premier president at  paris of the decision you have expressed to them as to my liberation  and  i am sorry that what you demand of me is not in my power   but feeling  that you could not take a better way of telling me that you mean to keep  me prisoner forever than by demanding of me what is impossible on my  part  i have made up my mind to put up with imprisonment  being sure that  god  who knows that i have not deserved a long one  being a prisoner of  fair war  will give me strength to bear it patiently   and i can only  regret that your courteous words  which you were pleased to address to me  in my illness  should have come to nothing      documents inedits sur  l histoire de france   captivite du roi francois i    p           the resolution announced in this letter led before long to the official  act which was certain to be the consequence of it   in november        by  formal letters patent  francis i   abdicating the kingship which he could  not exercise  ordered that his eldest son  the dauphin francis  then  eight years old  should be declared  crowned  anointed  and consecrated  most christian king of france  and that his grandmother  louise of savoy   duchess of angouleme  or  in default of her  his aunt marguerite  duchess  of alencon  should be regent of the kingdom   if it should please god  that we should recover our personal liberty  and be able to proceed to  the government and conduct of our kingdom  in that case our most dear and  most beloved son shall quit and give up to us the name and place of king   all things re becoming just as they were before our capture and  captivity    the letters patent ordered the regent  to get together a  number of good and notable personages from the three estates in all the  districts  countries  and good towns of france  to whom  either in a body  or separately  one after another  she should communicate the said will of  the king  as above  in order to have their opinion  counsel  and  consent    thus  during the real king s very captivity  and so  long as  it lasted  france was again about to have a king whom the states general  of france would be called upon to support with their counsels and  adhesion      illustration  louise of savoy and marguerite de valois            this resolution was taken and these letters patent prepared just at the  expiry of the safe conduct granted to the princess marguerite  and   consequently  just when she would have to return to france   charles v   was somewhat troubled at the very different position in which he was  about to find himself  when he would have to treat no longer at madrid  with a captive king  but at paris with a young king out of his power and  with his own people about him   marguerite fully perceived his  embarrassment   from toledo  where she was  she wrote to her brother    after having been four days without seeing the emperor  when i went to  take leave i found him so gracious that i think he is very much afraid of  my going  those gentry yonder are in a great fix  and  if you will be  pleased to hold firm  i can see them coming round to your wishes   but  they would very much like to keep me here doing nothing  in order to  promote their own affairs  as you will be pleased to understand    charles v   in fact  signified to the king his desire that the  negotiations should be proceeded with at madrid or toledo  never ceasing  to make protestations of his pacific intentions   francis i  replied  that  for his part   he would not lay any countermand on the duchess   that he would willingly hear what the emperor s ambassadors had to say   but that  if they did not come to any conclusion as to a peace and his  own liberation  he would not keep his own ambassadors any longer  and  would send them away    marguerite set out at the end of november  she at  first travelled slowly  waiting for good news to reach her and stop her  on the road  but  suddenly  she received notice from madrid to quicken  her steps  according to some historians  it was the duke of bourbon who   either under the influence of an old flame or in order to do a service to  the king he had betrayed  sent word to the princess that charles v    uneasy about what she was taking with her to france  had an idea of  having her arrested the moment her safe conduct had expired   according  to a more probable version  it was francis i  himself who  learning that  three days after marguerite s departure charles v  had received a copy of  the royal act of abdication  at once informed his sister  begging her to  make all haste   and she did so to such purpose that   making four days   journey in one   she arrived at salces  in the eastern pyrenees  an hour  before the expiry of her safe conduct   she no doubt took to her mother   the regent  the details of the king s resolutions and instructions  but  the act itself containing them  the letters patent of francis i   had not  been intrusted to her  it was marshal de montmorency who  at the end of  december         was the first bearer of them to france     did francis i  flatter himself that his order to have his son the dauphin  declared and crowned king  and the departure of his sister marguerite   who was going  if not to carry the actual text of the resolution  at any  rate to announce it to the regent and to france  would embarrass charles  v  so far as to make him relax in his pretensions to the duchy of  burgundy and its dependencies   there is nothing to show that he was  allured by such a hope  any how  if it may have for a moment arisen in  his mind  it soon vanished   charles v  insisted peremptorily upon his  requirements  and francis i  at once gave up his attitude of firmness   and granted  instead  the concession demanded of him  that is  the  relinquishment of burgundy and its dependencies to charles v    to hold  and enjoy with every right of supremacy until it hath been judged   decided  and determined  by arbiters elected on the emperor s part and  our own  to whom the said duchy  countships  and other territories  belong            and for guarantee of this concession  the dauphin  the  king s eldest son  and his second son  henry  duke of orleans  or other  great personages  to the number of twelve  should be sent to him and  remain in his keeping as hostages    the regent  louise  was not without  a hand in this determination of the king  her maternal affection took  alarm at the idea of her son s being for an indefinite period a prisoner  in the hands of his enemy   besides  in that case  war seemed to her  inevitable  and she dreaded the responsibility which would be thrown upon  her   charles v   on his side  was essentially a prudent man  he disliked  remaining  unless it were absolutely necessary  for a long while in a  difficult position   his chancellor  gattinera  refused to seal a treaty  extorted by force and violated  in advance  by lack of good faith    bring the king of france so low   he said   that he can do you no harm   or treat him so well that he can wish you no harm  or keep him a  prisoner  the worst thing you can do is to let him go half satisfied    charles v  persisted in his pacific resolution   there is no knowing  whether he was tempted to believe in the reality of francis i  s  concession  and to regard the guarantees as seriously meant  but it is  evident that francis i  himself considered them a mere sham  for four  months previously  on the   d of august        at the negotiations  entered into on this subject  he had taken care to deposit in the hands  of his negotiators a nullifying protest  against all pacts  conventions   renunciations  quittances  revocations  derogations  and oaths that he  might have to make contrary to his honor and the good of his crown  to  the profit of the said emperor or any other whosoever    and on the   th  of january        four weeks after having given his ambassadors orders  to sign the treaty of madrid containing the relinquishment of burgundy  and its dependencies  the very evening before the day on which that  treaty was signed  francis i  renewed  at madrid itself  and again placed  in the hands of his ambassadors  his protest of the   d of august  preceding against this act  declaring  that it was through force and  constraint  confinement and length of imprisonment  that he had signed  it  and that all that was contained in it was and should remain null and  of no effect    we may not have unlimited belief in the scrupulosity of  modern diplomats  but assuredly they would consider such a policy so  fundamentally worthless that they would be ashamed to practise it   we  may not hold sheer force in honor  but open force is better than  mendacious weakness  and less debasing for a government as well as for a  people      as soon as the treaty of madrid was signed  the emperor came to madrid to  see the king  then they went  both in one litter  to see queen eleanor   the emperor s sister and the king of portugal s widow  whom  by the said  treaty  the king was to espouse before he left spain  which he did      memoires de martin du bellay   t  ii   p        after which francis was  escorted by lannoy to fontarabia  whilst  on the other hand  the regent  louise  and the king s two sons who were to go as hostages to spain  were  on their way to bayonne   a large bark was anchored in the middle of the  bidassoa  the boundary of the two kingdoms  between irun and andaye   lannoy put the king on board  and received in exchange  from the hands of  marshal lautrec  the little princes francis and henry   the king gave his  children his blessing  and reached the french side whilst they were being  removed to the spanish  and as soon as he set foot on shore  he leaped  upon a fine turkish horse  exclaiming  as he started at a gallop for  bayonne  where his mother and his sister awaited him   so now i am king  again      on becoming king again  he fell under the dominion of three personal  sentiments  which exercised a decisive influence upon his conduct  and   consequently  upon the destiny of france joy at his liberation  a  thirsting for revenge  we will not say for vengeance  to be wreaked on  charles v   and the burden of the engagement he had contracted at madrid  in order to recover his liberty  alternately swayed him   from bayonne he  repaired to bordeaux  where he reassembled his court  and thence to  cognac  in saintonge  where he passed nearly three months  almost  entirely abandoning himself to field sports  galas  diversions  and  pleasures of every kind  as if to indemnify himself for the wearisomeness  and gloom in which he had lived at madrid    age subdues the blood   adversity the mind  risks the nerve  and the despairing monarch has no  hope but in pleasures   says tavannes in his memoires   such was francis  i   smitten of women both in body and mind   it is the little circle of  madame d etampes that governs    one of the regent s maids of honor  anne  d heilly  whom frances i  made duchess of etampes  took the place of the  countess of chateaubriant as his favorite   with strange indelicacy  francis demanded back from madame de chateaubriant the beautiful jewels  of gold which he had given her  and which bore tender mottoes of his  sister marguerite s composition   the countess took time enough to have  the jewels melted down  and said to the king s envoy   take that to the  king  and tell him that  as he has been pleased to recall what he gave  me  i send it back to him in metal   as for the mottoes  i cannot suffer  any one but myself to enjoy them  dispose of them  and have the pleasure  of them    the king sent back the metal to madame de chateaubriant  it  was the mottoes that he wished to see again  but he did not get them     at last it was absolutely necessary to pass from pleasure to business   the envoys of charles v   with lannoy  the viceroy of naples  at their  head  went to cognac to demand execution of the treaty of madrid   francis waited  ere he gave them an answer  for the arrival of the  delegates from the estates of burgundy  whom he had summoned to have  their opinion as to the cession of the duchy   these delegates  meeting  at cognac in june        formally repudiated the cession  being opposed   they said  to the laws of the kingdom  to the rights of the king  who  could not by his sole authority alienate any portion of his dominions   and to his coronation oath  which superseded his oaths made at madrid   francis invited the envoys of charles v  to a solemn meeting of his court  and council present at cognac  at which the delegates from burgundy  repeated their protest   whilst availing himself of this declaration as  an insurmountable obstacle to the complete execution of the treaty of  madrid  francis offered to give two million crowns for the redemption of  burgundy  and to observe the other arrangements of the treaty  including  the relinquishment of italy and his marriage with the sister of charles  v   charles formally rejected this proposal    the king of france   he  said   promised and swore  on the faith of an honest king and prince   that  if he did not carry out the said restitution of burgundy  he would  incontinently come and surrender himself prisoner to h  m  the emperor   wherever he might be  to undergo imprisonment in the place where the said  lord the emperor might be pleased to order him  up to and until the time  when this present treaty should be completely fulfilled and accomplished   let the king of france keep his oath      traite de madrid     th of  january        art  vi      however determined he was  at bottom  to elude the strict execution of  the treaty of madrid  francis was anxious to rebut the charge of perjury  by shifting the responsibility on to the shoulders of the people  themselves and their representatives   he did not like to summon the  states general of the kingdom  and recognize their right as well as their  power  but  after the meeting at cognac  he went to paris  and  on the    th of december        the parliament met in state with the adjunct of  the princes of the blood  a great number of cardinals  bishops  noblemen   deputies from the parliaments of toulouse  bordeaux  rouen  dijon   grenoble  and aix  and the municipal body of paris   in presence of this  assembly the king went over the history of his reign  his expeditions in  italy  his alternate successes and reverses  and his captivity    if my  subjects have suffered   he said   i have suffered with them    he then  caused to be read the letters patent whereby he had abdicated and  transferred the crown to his son the dauphin  devoting himself to  captivity forever   he explained the present condition of the finances   and what he could furnish for the ransom of his sons detained as  hostages  and he ended by offering to return as a prisoner to spain if no  other way could be found out of a difficult position  for he acknowledged  having given his word  adding  however  that he had thought it pledged  him to nothing  since it had not been given freely     this last argument was of no value morally or diplomatically  but in his  bearing and his language francis i   displayed grandeur and emotion   the  assembly also showed emotion  they were four days deliberating  with some  slight diversity of form the various bodies present came to the same  conclusion  and  on the   th of december        the parliament decided  that the king was not bound either to return to spain or to execute  as  to that matter  the treaty of madrid  and that he might with full  sanction and justice levy on his subjects two millions of crowns for the  ransom of his sons and the other requirements of the state     before inviting such manifestations francis i  had taken measures to  prevent them from being in vain   since the battle of pavia and his  captivity at madrid the condition and disposition of europe  and  especially of italy  had changed   from      to       three popes  leo  x   adrian vi   and clement vii  had occupied the holy see   adrian vi   alone embraced the cause of charles v   whose preceptor he had been  but  he reigned only one year  eight months  and five days  and even during  that short time he made only a timid use of his power on his patron s  behalf   his successor  clement vii   was a florentine and a medici  and   consequently  but little inclined to favor the emperor s policy   the  success of charles v  at pavia and the captivity of francis i  inspired  the pope and all italy with great dread of the imperial pretensions and  predominance   a league was formed between rome  florence  venice  and  milan for the maintenance of italian independence  and  as the pope was  at its head  it was called the holy league   secret messages and  communications were interchanged between these italian states  the regent  louise of savoy at paris  and king henry viii  in london  to win them  over to this coalition  not less important  it was urged  for the  security of europe than of italy   the regent of france and the king of  england received these overtures favorably  promises were made on either  side and a commencement was even made of preparations  which were hastily  disavowed both at paris and in london  when charles v  testified some  surprise at them   but when francis i  was restored to freedom and  returned to his kingdom  fully determined in his own mind not to execute  the treaty of madrid  the negotiations with italy became more full of  meaning and reality   as early as the   d of may        whilst he was  still deliberating with his court and parliament as to how he should  behave towards charles v  touching the treaty of madrid  francis i   entered into the holy league with the pope  the venetians  and the duke  of milan for the independence of italy  and on the  th of august  following francis i  and henry viii  undertook  by a special treaty  to  give no assistance one against the other to charles v   and henry viii   promised to exert all his efforts to get francis i  s two sons  left as  hostages in spain  set at liberty   thus the war between francis i  and  charles v   after fifteen months  suspension  resumed its course     it lasted three years in italy  from      to       without interruption   but also without result  it was one of those wars which are prolonged  from a difficulty of living in peace rather than from any serious  intention  on either side  of pursuing a clear and definite object   bourbon and lannoy commanded the imperial armies  lautrec the french  army   only two events  one for its singularity and the other for its  tragic importance  deserve to have the memory of them perpetuated in  history     after the battle of pavia and whilst francis i  was a captive in spain   bourbon  who had hitherto remained in italy  arrived at madrid on the    th of november        almost at the same time at which marguerite de  valois was leaving it for france   charles v  received the hero of pavia  with the strongest marks of consideration and favor  and the spanish army  were enthusiastic in their attachment to him   amongst the great spanish  lords there were several who despised him as a traitor to his king and  country   charles v  asked the marquis de villena to give him quarters in  his palace    i can refuse the king nothing   said the marquis   but as  soon as the traitor is out of the house  i will fire it with my own hand   no man of honor could live in it any more    holding this great and at  the same time doubtful position  bourbon remained in spain up to the  moment when the war was renewed between francis i  and charles v   the  latter could not at that time dispense with his services in italy for the  only soldier who could have taken his place there  the marquis of  pescara  had died at milan on the   th of november        aged  thirty six   charles v   at once sent bourbon to take the command of the  imperial armies in italy   on arriving at milan in july        bourbon  found not only that town  but all the emperor s party in italy  in such a  state of disorder  alarm  and exhaustion as to render them incapable of  any great effort   in view of this general disturbance  bourbon  who was  as ambitious as able  and had become the chief of the great adventurers  of his day  conceived the most audacious hopes   charles v  had promised  him the duchy of milan  why should he not have the kingdom of naples  also  and make himself independent of charles v    he had immense  influence over his spanish army  and he had recruited it in germany with  from fourteen to fifteen thousand lanzknechts  the greater part of them  lutherans  and right glad to serve charles v   then at war with the pope   their commander  freundsberg  a friend of bourbon s  had got made a  handsome gold chain   expressly   he said   to hang and strangle the pope  with his own hand  because  honor to whom honor is due   and since the  pope called himself premier in christendom  he must be deferred to  somewhat more than others     brantome  t  i   p         on the   th of  january        at piacenza  bourbon  late constable of france  put  himself at the head of this ruck of bold and greedy adventurers    i am  now   said he to them   nothing but a poor gentleman  who hasn t a penny  to call his own any more than you have  but  if you will have a little  patience  i will make you all rich or die in the attempt   and  so  saying  he distributed amongst them all he had left of money  rings  and  jewels  keeping for himself nothing but his clothes and a jacket of  silver tissue to put on over his armor    we will follow you everywhere   to the devil himself   shouted the soldiers   no more of julius caesar   hannibal  and scipio   hurrah  for the fame of bourbon    bourbon led  this multitude through italy  halting before most of the towns  bologna  and florence even  which he felt a momentary inclination to attack  but   after all  continuing his march until  having arrived in sight of rome on  the  th of march        in the evening  he had pitched his camp  visited  his guards  and ordered the assault for the morrow    the great chances  of our destiny   said he to his troops   have brought us hither to the  place where we desired to be  after traversing so many bad roads  in  midwinter  with snows and frosts so great  with rain  and mud  and  encounters of the enemy  in hunger and thirst  and without a halfpenny   now is the time to show courage  manliness  and the strength of your  bodies   if this bout you are victorious  you will be rich lords and  mighty well off  if not  you will be quite the contrary   yonder is the  city whereof  in time past  a wise astrologer prophesied concerning me   telling me that i should die there  but i swear to you that i care but  little for dying there  if  when i die  my corpse be left with endless  glory and renown throughout the world    afterwards he gave the word for  retiring  some to rest  and some on guard  and for every one to be ready  to assault on the morrow early             after that the stars became  obscured by the greater resplendency of the sun and the flashing arms of  the soldiers who were preparing for the assault  bourbon  clad all in  white that he might be better known and seen  which was not the sign of a  coward   and armor in hand  marched in front close up to the wall  and   when he had mounted two rungs of his ladder  just as he had said the  night before  so did it happen to him  that envious  or  to more properly  speak  traitorous fortune would have an arquebuse shot to hit him full in  the left side and wound him mortally   and albeit she took from him his  being and his life  yet could she not in one single respect take away his  magnanimity and his vigor so long as his body had sense  as he well  showed out of his own mouth  for  having fallen when he was hit  he told  certain of his most faithful friends who were nigh him  and especially  the gascon captain  jonas  to cover him with a cloak and take him away   that his death might not give occasion to the others to leave an  enterprise so well begun            just then  as m  de bourbon had  recommended   to cover and hide his body   so did his men  in such sort  that the escalade and assault went on so furiously that the town  after a  little resistance  was carried  and the soldiers  having by this time got  wind of his death  fought the more furiously that it might be avenged   the which it certainly was right well  for they set up a shout of   slay   slay  blood  blood   bourbon  bourbon     brantome  t  i   pp               the celebrated artist in gold  benvenuto cellini  says  in his life  written by himself  that it was he who  from the top of the wall of the  campo santo at rome  aiming his arquebuse at the midst of a group of  besiegers  amongst whom he saw one man mounted higher than the rest  hit  him  and that he then saw an extraordinary commotion around this man  who  was bourbon  as he found out afterwards     vita di benvenuto cellini    ch  xvii   pp              i have heard say at rome   says brantome on  the contrary   that it was held that he who fired that wretched  arquebuse shot was a priest     brantome  t   ii   p            whatever hand it was that shot down bourbon  rome  after his death  was  plundered  devastated and ravaged by a brutal  greedy  licentious  and  fanatical soldiery   europe was moved at the story of the sack of rome  and the position of the pope  who had taken refuge in the castle of st   angelo   francis i  and henry viii  renewed their alliance  and a french  army under the command of lautrec advanced into italy   charles v    fearing lest it should make a rapid march to rome and get possession of  the pope whilst delivering him from captivity  entered into negotiations  with him  and  in consideration of certain concessions to the emperor   it was arranged that the pope should be set at liberty without delay   clement vii  was so anxious to get out of his position  lately so  perilous and even now so precarious  that he slank out of the castle of  st  angelo in the disguise of a tradesman the very night before the day  fixed by the emperor for his liberation  and he retired to orvieto  on  the territory occupied by the french army   during this confusion of  things in italy  charles v  gave orders for arresting in spain the  ambassadors of francis i  and of henry viii   who were in alliance  against him  and who  on their side  sent him two heralds at arms to  declare war against him   charles v  received them in open audience at  burgos  on the   d of january          i am very much astonished   said  he to the french envoy   to find the king of france declaring against me  a war which he has been carrying on for seven years  he is not in a  position to address to me such a declaration  he is my prisoner   why has  he taken no notice of what i said to his ambassador immediately after his  refusal to execute the treaty of madrid    charles v  now repeated  in  the very terms addressed to the french ambassador  the communication to  which he alluded   the king your master acted like a bastard and a  scoundrel in not keeping his word that he gave me touching the treaty of  madrid  if he likes to say to the contrary  i will maintain it against  him with my body to his    when these words were reported to francis i    he summoned  on the   th of march        the princes of the blood  the  cardinals  the prelates  the grandees of the kingdom  and the ministers  from foreign courts  and  after having given a vivid account of his  relations with charles v    i am not the prisoner of charles   he said    i have not given him my word  we have never met with arms in our hands    he then handed his herald  guyenne  a cartel written with his own hand   and ending with these words addressed to charles v    we give you to  understand that  if you have intended or do intend to charge us with  anything that a gentleman loving his honor ought not to do  we say that  you have lied in your throat  and that  as often as you say so  you will  lie   wherefore for the future write us nothing at all  but appoint us  the time and place of meeting  and we will bring our sword for you to  cross  protesting that the shame of any delay in fighting shall be yours   seeing that  when it comes to an encounter  there is an end of all  writing    charles v  did not receive francis i  s challenge till the  th  of june  when he  in his turn  consulted the grandees of his kingdom   amongst others the duke of infantado  one of the most considerable in  rank and character  who answered him in writing   the jurisdiction of  arms extends exclusively to obscure and foggy matters in which the  ordinary rules of justice are at a discount  but  when one can appeal to  oaths and authentic acts  i do not think that it is allowable to come to  blows before having previously tried the ordinary ways of justice         it seems to me that this law of honor applies to princes  however great  they may be  as well as to knights   it would be truly strange  my lord   that a debt so serious  so universally recognized  as that contracted by  the king of france  should be discharged by means of a personal  challenge    charles v  thereupon sent off his herald  burgundy  with  orders to carry to francis i   an appointment for a place of meeting  between fontarabia and andaye  in such a spot as by common consent should  be considered most safe and most convenient by gentlemen chosen on each  side   and this offer was accompanied by a long reply which the herald  was at the same time to deliver to the king of france  whilst calling on  him to declare his intention within forty days after the delivery of that  letter  dated the   th of june   in default whereof   said charles   the  delay in fighting will be yours       illustration  francis i             on arriving at the frontier of france the spanish herald demanded a  safe conduct   he was made to wait seven weeks  from the   th of june to  the   th of august  without the king s cognizance  it is said   at last   on the   th of september        burgundy entered paris  and was  conducted to the palace   francis i  received him in the midst of his  court  and  as soon as he observed the entrance of the herald  who made  obeisance preliminary to addressing him   herald   cried the king   all  thy letters declare that thou bringest appointment of time and place   dost thou bring it     sir   answered the spaniard   permit me to do my  office  and say what the emperor has charged me to say     nay  i will  not listen to thee   said francis   if thou do not first give me a  patent signed by thy master  containing an appointment of time and  place     sir  i have orders to read you the cartel  and give it you  afterwards     how  pray   cried the king  rising up angrily   doth thy  master pretend to introduce new fashions in my kingdom  and give me laws  in my own court    burgundy  without being put out  began again   sir                nay   said francis   i will not suffer him to speak to me  before he has given me appointment of time and place   give it me  or  return as thou hast come    sir  i cannot  without your permission  do  my office  if you will not deign to grant it to me  let me have your  refusal handed me  and your ratification i of my safe conduct for my  return     i am quite willing   said the king   let him have it    burgundy set off again for madrid  and the incident was differently  reported by the two courts  but there was no further question of a duel  between the two kings     one would not think of attempting to decide  touching this question of  single combat  how far sincerity was on the side of francis or of  charles   no doubt they were both brave  the former with more brilliancy  than his rival  the latter  at need  with quite as much firmness   but in  sending challenges one to the other  as they did on this occasion  they  were obeying a dying out code  and rather attempting to keep up  chivalrous appearances than to put seriously in practice the precedents  of their ancestors   it was no longer a time when the fate of a people  could be placed in the hands of a few valiant warriors  such as the three  horatii and the three curiatii  or the thirty bretons and thirty english   the era of great nations and great contests was beginning  and one is  inclined to believe that francis i  and charles v  were themselves aware  that their mutual challenges would not come to any personal encounter   the war which continued between them in italy was not much more serious  or decisive  both sides were weary of it  and neither one nor the other  of the two sovereigns espied any great chances of success   the french  army was wasting itself  in the kingdom of naples  upon petty   inconclusive engagements  its commander  lautrec  died of the plague on  the   th of august        a desire for peace became day by day stronger   it was made  first of all  at barcelona  on the   th of june         between charles v  and pope clement vii   and then a conference was  opened at cambrai for the purpose of bringing it about between charles v   and francis i  likewise   two women  francis i  s mother and charles v  s  aunt  louise of savoy and margaret of austria  had the real negotiation  of it  they had both of them acquired the good sense and the moderation  which come from experience of affairs and from difficulties in life  they  did not seek to give one another mutual surprises and to play off one  another reciprocally  they resided in two contiguous houses  between  which they had caused a communication to be made on the inside  and they  conducted the negotiation with so much discretion  that the petty italian  princes who were interested in it did not know the results of it until  peace was concluded on the  th of august         francis i  yielded on  all the italian and flemish questions  and charles v  gave up burgundy   and restored to liberty the king of france s two sons  prisoners at  madrid  in consideration of a ransom put at two millions of crowns and of  having the marriage completed between his sister eleanor and francis i   king henry viii  complained that not much account had been made of him   either during the negotiations or in the treaty  but his discontent was  short lived  and he none the less came to the assistance of francis i   in the money questions to which the treaty gave rise   of the italian  states  venice was most sacrificed in this accommodation between the  kings    the city of cambrai   said the doge  andrew gritti   is the  purgatory of the venetians  it is the place where emperors and kings of  france make the republic expiate the sin of having ever entered into  alliance with them    francis went to bordeaux to meet his sons and his  new wife   at bordeaux  cognac  amboise  blois  and paris  galas  both at  court and amongst the people  succeeded one another for six months  and  europe might consider itself at peace     the peace of cambrai was called the ladies  peace  in honor of the two  princesses who had negotiated it   though morally different and of very  unequal worth  they both had minds of a rare order  and trained to  recognize political necessities  and not to attempt any but possible  successes   they did not long survive their work  margaret of austria  died on the  st of december        and louise of savoy on the   d of  september         all the great political actors seemed hurrying away  from the stage  as if the drama were approaching its end   pope clement  vii  died on the   th of september         he was a man of sense and  moderation  he tried to restore to italy her independence  but he forgot  that a moderate policy is  above all  that which requires most energy and  perseverance   these two qualities he lacked totally  he oscillated from  one camp to the other without ever having any real influence anywhere   a  little before his death he made france a fatal present  for  on the   th  of october        he married his niece catherine de  medici to francis  i  s second son  prince henry of valois  who by the death of his elder  brother  the dauphin francis  soon afterwards became heir to the throne   the chancellor  anthony duprat  too  the most considerable up to that  time amongst the advisers of francis i   died on the  th of july         according to some historians  when he heard  in the preceding year  of  pope clement vii  s death  he had conceived a hope  being already  archbishop of sens  and a cardinal  of succeeding him  and he spoke to  the king about it    such an election would cost too dear   said francis  i    the appetite of cardinals is insatiable  i could not satisfy it     sir   replied duprat   france will not have to bear the expense  i will  provide for it  there are four hundred thousand crowns ready for that  purpose     where did you get all that money  pray   asked francis   turning his back upon him  and next day he caused a seizure to be made  of a portion of the chancellor cardinal s property    this  then    exclaimed duprat   is the king s gratitude towards the minister who has  served him body and soul     what has the cardinal to complain of   said  the king   i am only doing to him what he has so often advised me to do  to others      trois magestrats francais du seizieme siecle   by edouard  faye de brys        pp           the last of the chancellor s  biographers  the marquis duprat  one of his descendants  has disputed  this story     vie d antoine duprat         p         however that may  be  it is certain that chancellor duprat  at his death  left a very large  fortune  which the king caused to be seized  and which he partly  appropriated   we read in the contemporary  journal d un bourgeois de  paris   published by ludovic lalanne        p         when the chancellor  was at the point of death  the king sent m  de bryon  admiral of france   who had orders to have everything seized and all his property placed in  the king s hands            they found in his place at nantouillet eight  hundred thousand crowns  and all his gold and silver plate          and  in his hercules house  close to the augustins   at paris  where he used  to stay during his life time  the sum of three hundred thousand livres   which were in coffers bound with iron  and which were carried off by the  king for and to his own profit    in the civil as well as in the military  class  for his government as well as for his armies  francis i  had  at  this time  to look out for new servants     he did not find such as have deserved a place in history   after the  deaths of louise of savoy  of chancellor duprat  of la tremoille  of la  palice  and of all the great warriors who fell at the battle of pavia  it  was still one more friend of francis i  s boyhood  anne de montmorency   who remained  in council as well as army  the most considerable and the  most devoted amongst his servants   in those days of war and discord   fraught with violence  there was no man who was more personally rough and  violent than montmorency   from      to       as often as circumstances  became pressing  he showed himself ready for anything and capable of  anything in defence of the crown and the re establishment of order    go  hang me such a one   he would say  according to brantome    tie you  fellow to this tree  give yonder one the pike or arquebuse  and all  before my eyes  cut me in pieces all those rascals who chose to hold such  a clock case as this against the king  burn me this village  set me  everything a blaze  for a quarter of a league all round    in        a violent outbreak took place at bordeaux on account of the gabel or  salt tax  and the king s lieutenant was massacred in it   anne de  montmorency  whom the king had made constable in       the fifth of his  family invested with that dignity  repaired thither at once    aware of  his coming   says brantome   mm  de bordeaux went two days  journey to  meet him and carry him the keys of their city   away  away   said he    with your keys  i will have nothing to do with them  i have others which  i am bringing with me  and which will make other sort of opening than  yours  meaning his cannon   i will have you all hanged  i will teach you  to rebel against your king  and kill his governor and lieutenant    which  he did not fail to do   adds brantome   and inflicted exemplary  punishment  but not so severe assuredly as the case required    the  narrator  it will be seen  was not more merciful than the constable   nor was the constable less stern or less thorough in battles than in  outbreaks   in       at the battle of dreux  he was aged and so ill that  none expected to see him on horseback    but in the morning   says  brantome   knowing that the enemy was getting ready  he  brimful of  courage  gets out of bed  mounts his horse  and appears at the moment the  march began  whereof i do remember me  for i saw him and heard him  when  m  de guise came forward to meet him to give him good day  and ask how he  was   he  fully armed  save only his head  answered him   right well   sir  this is the real medicine that hath cured me for the battle which is  toward and a preparing for the honor of god and our king     in spite of  this indomitable aptness for rendering the king everywhere the most  difficult  nay  the most pitiless services  the constable de montmorency  none the less incurred  in       the disfavor of francis i   private  dissensions in the royal family  the intrigues of rivals at court  and  the enmity of the king s mistress  the duchess of etampes  effaced the  remembrance of all he had done and might still do   he did accept his  disgrace  he retired first to chantilly  and then to ecouen  and there he  waited for the dauphin  when he became king henry ii   to recall him to  his side and restore to him the power which francis i   on his very  death bed  had dissuaded his son from giving back   the ungratefulnesses  of kings are sometimes as capricious as their favors     the ladies  peace  concluded at cambrai in       lasted up to        incessantly troubled  however  by far from pacific symptoms  proceedings   and preparations   in october        francis i  had  at calais  an  interview with henry viii   at which they contracted a private alliance   and undertook  to raise between them an army of eighty thousand men to  resist the turk  as true zealots for the good of christendom    the  turks  in fact  under their great sultan  soliman ii   were constantly  threatening and invading eastern europe   charles v   as emperor of  germany  was far more exposed to their attacks and far more seriously  disquieted by them than francis i  and henry viii  were  but the peril  that hung over him in the east urged him on at the same time to a further  development of ambition and strength  in order to defend eastern europe  against the turks he required to be dominant in western europe  and in  that very part of europe a large portion of the population were disposed  to wish for his success  for they required it for their own security    to read all that was spread abroad hither and thither   says william du  bellay   it seemed that the said lord the emperor was born into this  world to have fortune at his beck and call    two brothers  mussulman  pirates  known under the name of barbarossa  had become masters  one of  algiers and the other of tunis  and were destroying  in the  mediterranean  the commerce and navigation of christian states   it was  charles v  who tackled them   in      he took tunis  set at liberty  twenty thousand christian slaves  and remained master of the regency   at the news of this expedition  francis i   who  in concert with henry  viii   was but lately levying an army to  offer resistance   he said   to  the turk   entered into negotiations with soliman ii   and concluded a  friendly treaty with him against what was called the common enemy   francis had been for some time preparing to resume his projects of  conquest in italy  he had effected an interview at marseilles  in  october        with pope clement vii   who was almost at the point of  death  and it was there that the marriage of prince henry of france with  catherine de  medici was settled   astonishment was expressed that the  pope s niece had but a very moderate dowry    you don t see  then   said  clement vii  s ambassador   that she brings france three jewels of great  price  genoa  milan  and naples    when this language was reported at the  court of charles v   it caused great irritation there   in      all  these combustibles of war exploded  in the month of february  a french  army entered piedmont  and occupied turin  and  in the month of july   charles v  in person entered provence at the head of fifty thousand men   anne de montmorency having received orders to defend southern france   began by laying it waste in order that the enemy might not be able to  live in it  officers had orders to go everywhere and  break up the  bake houses and mills  burn the wheat and forage  pierce the wine casks   and ruin the wells by throwing the wheat into them to spoil the water    in certain places the inhabitants resisted the soldiers charged with this  duty  elsewhere  from patriotism  they themselves set fire to their  corn ricks and pierced their casks   montmorency made up his mind to  defend  on the whole coast of provence  only marseilles and arles  he  pulled down the ramparts of the other towns  which were left exposed to  the enemy   for two months charles v  prosecuted this campaign without a  fight  marching through the whole of provence an army which fatigue   shortness of provisions  sickness  and ambuscades were decimating  ingloriously   at last he decided upon retreating    from aix to frejus   where the emperor at his arrival had pitched his camp  all the roads were  strewn with the sick and the dead pell mell  with harness  lances  pikes   arquebuses  and other armor of men and horses gathered in a heap   i say  what i saw   adds martin du bellay   considering the toil i had with my  company in this pursuit    at the village of mery  near frejus  some  peasants had shut themselves up in a tower situated on the line of march   charles v  ordered one of his captains to carry it by assault  from his  splendid uniform the peasants  it is said  took this officer for the  emperor himself  and directed their fire upon him  the officer  mortally  wounded  was removed to nice  where he died at the end of a few days   it  was garcilaso de la vega  the prince of spanish poesy  the spanish  petrarch  according to his fellow countrymen   the tower was taken  and  charles v  avenged his poet s death by hanging twenty five of these  patriot peasants  being all that survived of the fifty who had maintained  the defence     on returning from his sorry expedition  charles v  learned that those of  his lieutenants whom he had charged with the conduct of a similar  invasion in the north of france  in picardy  had met with no greater  success than he himself in provence   queen mary of hungary  his sister  and deputy in the government of the low countries  advised a local truce   his other sister  eleanor  the queen of france  was of the same opinion   francis i  adopted it  and the truce in the north was signed for a period  of three months   montmorency signed a similar one for piedmont   it was  agreed that negotiations for a peace should be opened at locate in  roussillon  and that  to pursue them  francis should go and take up his  quarters at montpellier  and charles v  at barcelona   pope paul iii    alexander farnese   who  on the   th of october        had succeeded  clement vii   came forward as mediator   he was a man of capacity  who  had the gift of resolutely continuing a moderate course of policy  well  calculated to gain time  but insufficient for the settlement of great and  difficult questions   the two sovereigns refused to see one another  officially  they did not like the idea of discussing together their  mutual pretensions  and they were so different in character that  as  marguerite de valois used to say   to bring them to accord  god would have  had to re make one in the other s image    they would only consent to  treat by agents  and on the   th of june        they signed a truce for  ten years  rather from weariness of a fruitless war than from any real  desire of peace  they  both of them  wanted time to bring them unforeseen  opportunities for getting out of their embarrassments   but for all their  refusal to take part in set negotiations  they were both desirous of  being personally on good terms again  and to converse together without  entering into any engagement   charles v  being forced by contrary winds  to touch at the island of sainte marie  made a proposal to francis i   for an interview at aigues mortes  francis repaired thither on the   th  of july        and went  the very same day  in a small galley  to pay a  visit to the emperor  who stepped eagerly forward  and held out a hand to  him to help him on to the other vessel   next day  the   th of july   charles v   embarking on board one of the king s frigates  went and  returned the visit at aigues mortes  where francis  with his whole court   was awaiting him  after disembarkation at the port they embraced  and  queen eleanor  glad to see them together   embraced them both   says an  eyewitness   a round the waist    they entered the town amidst the roar  of artillery and the cheers of the multitude  shouting   hurrah  for the  emperor and the king    the dauphin  henry  and his brother charles  duke  of orleans  arriving boot and spur from provence  came up at this moment   shouting likewise   hurrah  for the emperor and the king     charles v   dropped on his knees   says the narrator  and embraced the two young  princes affectionately   they all repaired together to the house prepared  for their reception  and  after dinner  the emperor  being tired  lay  down to rest on a couch   queen eleanor  before long  went and tapped at  his door  and sent word to the king that the emperor was awake   francis   with the cardinal de lorraine and the constable de montmorency  soon  arrived   on entering the chamber  he found the emperor still lying down  and chatting with his sister the queen  who was seated beside him on a  chair   at sight of the king charles v  sprang from the couch and went  towards him without any shoes on    well  brother   said the king   how  do you feel   have you rested well     yes   said charles   i had made  such cheer that i was obliged to sleep it off     i wish you   said  francis   to have the same power in france as you have in flanders and in  spain   whereupon he gave him  as a mark of affection  a diamond valued  at thirty thousand crowns  and having on the ring in which it was set  this inscription   a token and proof of affection   dilectionis testis  et exemplum    charles put the ring on his finger  and  taking from his  neck the collar of the order  the golden fleece  he was wearing  he put  it upon the king s neck   francis did the converse with his own collar   only seven of the attendants remained in the emperor s chamber  and there  the two sovereigns conversed for an hour  after which they moved to the  hall  where a splendid supper awaited them   after supper the queen went  in person to see if the emperor s room was ready  she came back to tell  him when it was  and charles v  retired   next morning  july     francis  went to see him again in his room  they heard mass together  charles  re embarked the same day for spain  francis i  went and slept  on the    th  at nimes  and thus ended this friendly meeting  which left  if not  the principal actors  at any rate the people all around  brimful of  satisfaction  and feeling sure that the truce concluded in the previous  month would really at last be peace   the people are easily deceived  and  whenever they are pleased with appearances they readily take them for  realities     an unexpected event occurred to give this friendly meeting at  aigues mortes a value which otherwise it would probably never have  attained   a year afterwards  in august        a violent insurrection  burst out at ghent   the fair deputy of the low countries had obtained  from the estates of flanders a gratuitous grant of twelve hundred  thousand florins for the assistance of her brother the emperor  whom his  unfortunate expedition in provence had reduced to great straits for want  of money  and the city of ghent had been taxed  for its share  to the  extent of four hundred thousand florins   the ghentese pleaded their  privilege of not being liable to be taxed without their own consent   to  their plea charles v  responded by citing the vote of the estates of  flanders and giving orders to have it obeyed   the ghentese drove out the  officers of the emperor  entered upon open rebellion  incited the other  cities of flanders  ypres and bruges amongst the rest  to join them  and   taking even more decisive action  sent a deputation to francis i   as  their own lord s suzerain  demanding his support  and offering to make  him master of the low countries if he would be pleased to give them  effectual assistance   the temptation was great  but whether it were from  prudence or from feudal loyalty  or in consequence of the meeting at  aigues mortes  and of the prospects set before him by charles of an  arrangement touching milaness  francis rejected the offer of the  ghentese  and informed charles v  of it   the emperor determined  resolutely upon the course of going in person and putting down the  ghentese  but how to get to ghent   the sea was not safe  the rebels had  made themselves masters of all the ports on their coasts  the passage by  way of germany was very slow work  and might be difficult by reason of  ill will on the part of the protestant states which would have to be  traversed   france was the only direct and quick route   charles v  sent  to ask francis i   for a passage  whilst thanking him for the loyalty  with which he had rejected the offers of the ghentese  and repeating to  him the fair words that had been used as to milaness   francis announced  to his council his intention of granting the emperor s request   some of  his councillors pressed him to annex some conditions  such  at the least   as a formal and written engagement instead of the vague and verbal  promises at aigues mortes    no   said the king  with the impulsiveness  of his nature   when you do a generous thing  you must do it completely  and boldly    on leaving the council he met his court fool triboulet   whom he found writing in his tablets  called fools  diary  the name of  charles v    a bigger fool than i   said he   if he comes passing  through france     what wilt thou say  if i let him pass   said the king    i will rub out his name and put yours in its place    francis i  was not  content with letting charles v   pass  he sent his two sons  the dauphin  and the duke of orleans  as far as bayonne to meet him  went in person to  receive him at chatellerault  and gave him entertainments at amboise  at  blois  at chambord  at orleans  and fontainebleau  and lastly at paris   which they entered together on the  st of january         orders had been  sent everywhere to receive him  as kings of france are received on their  joyous accession     the king gave his guest   says du bellay   all the  pleasures that can be invented  as royal hunts  tourneys  skirmishes   fights a foot and a horseback  and in all other sorts of pastimes    some  petty incidents  of a less reassuring kind  were intermingled with these  entertainments   one day the duke of orleans  a young prince full of  reckless gayety  jumped suddenly on to the crupper of the emperor s  horse  and threw his arms round charles  shouting   your imperial majesty  is my prisoner    charles set off at a gallop  without turning his head      illustration  the duke of orleans and charles v             another day the king s favorite  the duchess of etampes  was present with  the two monarchs    brother   said francis   you see yonder a fair dame  who is of opinion that i should not let you out of paris without your  having revoked the treaty of madrid     ah  well   said charles   if the  opinion is a good one  it must be followed    such freedom of thought and  speech is honorable to both sovereigns   charles v   impressed with the  wealth and cheerful industry that met his eye  said  according to  brantome   there is not in the world any greatness such as that of a king  of france    after having passed a week at paris he started for the low  countries  halted at chantilly  at the constable de montmorency s  who   as well as the king s two sons  the dauphin and the duke of orleans  was  in attendance upon him  and did not separate from his escort of french  royalty until he arrived at valenciennes  the first town in his flemish  dominions   according to some historians there had been at chantilly   amongst the two young princes and their servants  some idea of seizing  the emperor and detaining him until he had consented to the concessions  demanded of him  others merely say that the constable  before leaving  him  was very urgent with him that he should enter into some positive  engagement as to milaness    no   said charles   i must not bind myself  any more than i have done by my words as long as i am in your power  when  i have chastised my rebellious subjects i will content your king      he did chastise  severely  his flemish subjects  but he did not content  the king of france   francis i  was not willing to positively renounce  his italian conquests  and charles v  was not willing to really give them  up to him   milaness was still  in italy  the principal object of their  mutual ambition   navarre  in the south east of france  and the low  countries in the north  gave occasion for incessantly renewed disputes  between them   the two sovereigns sought for combinations which would  allow them to make  one to the other  the desired concessions  whilst  still preserving pretexts for and chances of recovering them   divers  projects of marriage between their children or near relatives were  advanced with that object  but nothing came of them  and  after two years  and a half of abortive negotiations  another great war  the fourth  broke  out between francis i  and charles v   for the same causes and with the  same by ends as ever   it lasted two years  from      to       with  alternations of success and reverse on either side  and several  diplomatic attempts to embroil in it the different european powers   francis i  concluded an alliance in      with sultan soliman ii   and  in  concert with french vessels  the vessels of the pirate barbarossa cruised  about and made attacks upon the shores of the mediterranean   an outcry  was raised against such a scandal as this    sir ambassador   said  francis i  to marino giustiniano  ambassador from venice   i cannot deny  that i eagerly desire to see the turk very powerful and ready for war   not on his own account  for he is an infidel and all we are christians   but in order to cripple the power of the emperor  to force him into great  expense  and to give all other governments security against so great an  enemy     as for me   says the contemporary montluc in his memoires   if  i could summon all the spirits of hell to break the head of my enemy who  would fain break mine  i would do it with all my heart  god forgive me    on the other hand  on the   th of february        charles v  and henry  viii   king of england  concluded an alliance against francis i  and the  turks   the unsuccess which had attended the grand expedition conducted  by charles v  personally in       with the view of attacking barbarossa  and the mussulmans in algiers itself  had opened his eyes to all the  difficulty of such enterprises  and he wished to secure the co operation  of a great maritime power before engaging therein afresh   he at the same  time convoked a german diet at spires in order to make a strong  demonstration against the alliance between francis i  and the turks  and  to claim the support of germany in the name of christendom   ambassadors  from the duke of savoy and the king of denmark appeared in support of the  propositions and demands of charles v   the diet did not separate until  it had voted twenty four thousand foot and four thousand horse to be  employed against france  and had forbidden germans  under severe  penalties  to take service with francis i   in      the war thus became  almost european  and in the early days of april two armies were  concentrated in piedmont  near the little town of ceresole  the spanish  twenty thousand strong and the french nineteen thousand  the former under  the orders of the marquis del guasto  the latter under those of the count  d enghien  both ready to deliver a battle which was  according to one  side  to preserve europe from the despotic sway of a single master  and   according to the other  to protect europe against a fresh invasion of  mussulmans     francis of bourbon  count d enghien  had received from the king a  prohibition to give battle   he was believed to be weaker than the  marquis del guasto  who showed eagerness to deliver it   convinced that  such a position was as demoralizing as it was disagreeable for him  the  young count d enghien sent a valiant and intelligent gentleman  blaise de  montluc  who had already had experience in the great wars of the reign   to carry his representations to the king   francis i  summoned the  messenger to a meeting of the council  at which the dauphin  henry  stood  behind his father s chair    montluc   said the king   i wish you to  return and report my deliberation and the opinion of my council to m   d enghien  and to listen here to the difficulty that stands in the way of  our being able to grant him leave to give battle  as he demands    the  count de st  pol spoke and set forth the reasons the king had for not  desiring battle  and the end of them all was that there was a chance of  losing  which would be a matter for regret beyond all comparison with the  advantage to be gained from winning    i stamped with impatience to  speak   says montluc   and would have broken in  but m  de st  pol made  me a sign with his hand  saying   quiet  quiet   which made me hold my  tongue  and i saw that the king set on a laughing   then he told me that  he wished me to say freely what i thought about it    i consider myself  most happy  sir   said i   for when you were dauphin  and before you were  called to this great charge which god hath given you  you tried the  fortune of war as much as any king that ever hath been in france  without  sparing your own person any more than the meanest gentleman   well  a  soldier king is the only one i can address    the dauphin  who was facing  me   continued montluc   made me a sign with his head  which caused me to  think that he wished me to speak boldly   then said i   sir  i count that  there will be forty five hundred or forty six hundred of us gascons  all  told  and all of us  captains and soldiers  will give you our names and  the places whence we come  and will stake our heads that we will fight on  the day of battle  if it should please you to grant it   it is a matter  that we have been awaiting and desiring this long while  without much  taking of counsel  be assured  sir  there are not more resolute soldiers  than yonder   there are  besides  thirteen companies of swiss  who will  give you the same pledge as we who are your subjects  and we will hand in  to you the names of them all for to be sent to their cantons in order  that  if there be any who shall not do his duty  he may die   you have  thus nine thousand men and more of whom you may be certain that they will  fight to the last gasp of their lives   as for the italians and  provencals  i will not answer to you for them  but perhaps they will all  do as well as we  when they see us getting to work   and then i raised my  arm up  as if to strike  whereat the king smiled  sir   said i   i have  heard from wise captains that it is not the great number that wins  but  the stout heart  on a day of battle  a moiety doth not fight at all   we desire no more  leave it to us   the king  who had very favorably  listened to me  and who took pleasure in seeing my impatience  turned his  eyes towards m  de st  pol  who said   sir  would you change your opinion  at the words of this madcap  who has no thought for the calamity it would  be if we were to lose the battle   it is a matter too important to be  left for settlement to the brains of a young gascon   i answered him    sir  let me assure you that i am no braggart  nor so hare brained as you  consider me   all we have to do is not to go and attack the enemy in a  stronghold  as we did at la bicocca  but m  d enghien has too many good  and veteran captains about him to commit such an error   the only  question will be to find means of coming at them in open country  where  there is neither hedge nor ditch to keep us from setting to work  and  then  sir  you shall hear talk of the most furious fights that ever were   i do entreat you most humbly  sir  to admit no thought of anything but a  victory    the dauphin   continues montluc   went on more and more  smiling  and making signs to me  which gave me still greater boldness in  speaking   all the rest spoke and said that the king must not place any  reliance upon my words   admiral d annebaut said not a syllable  but  smiled  i suppose he had seen the signs the dauphin was making to me   m  de st  pol turns to speak to the king  and says   how  sir   you seem  disposed to change your opinion  and listen to the words of this rabid  madman    to whom the king replied   on my honor as a gentleman  cousin   he has given me such great and clear reasons  and has represented to me  so well the good courage of my men  that i know not what to do     i see  quite well   said the lord of st  pol   that you have already turned  round    whereupon the king  addressing the admiral  asked him what he  thought about it    sir   answered the admiral   you have a great mind to  give them leave to fight   i will not be surety to you  if they fight   for gain or loss  since god alone can know about that  but i will  certainly pledge you my life and my honor that all they whom he has  mentioned to you will fight  and like good men and true  for i know what  they are worth from having commanded them   only do one thing  we know  well that you are half brought round and inclined rather to fighting than  the contrary  make  then  your prayer to god  and entreat him to be  pleased this once to aid you and counsel you as to what you ought to do    then the king lifted his eyes towards heaven  and  clasping his hands and  throwing his cap upon the table  said   o god  i entreat thee that it may  please thee to this day give me counsel as to what i ought to do for the  preservation of my kingdom  and that all may be to thy honor and glory    whereupon the admiral asked him   sir  what opinion occurs to you now    the king  after pausing a little  turned towards me  saying  with a sort  of shout   let them fight  let them fight     well  then  there is no  more to be said   replied the admiral   if you lose  you alone will be  the cause of the loss  and  if you win  in like manner  and you  all  alone  will have the satisfaction of it  you alone having given the  leave    then the king and every one rose up  and  as for me  i tingled  with joy   his majesty began talking with the admiral about my despatch  and about giving orders for the pay which was in arrears   and m  de st   pol accosted me  saying with a laugh   rabid madman  thou wilt be cause  of the greatest weal that could happen to the king  or of the greatest  woe       montluc s boldness and francis i  s confidence in yielding to it were not  unrewarded   the battle was delivered at ceresole on the   th of april         it was bravely disputed and for some time indecisive  even in the  opinion of the anxious count d enghien  who was for a while in an awkward  predicament  but the ardor of the gascons and the firmness of the swiss  prevailed  and the french army was victorious   montluc was eagerly  desirous of being commissioned to go and carry to the king the news of  the victory which he had predicted and to which he had contributed  but  another messenger had the preference  and he does not  in his memoires   conceal his profound discontent  but he was of those whom their  discontent does not dishearten  and he continued serving his king and his  country with such rigorous and stubborn zeal as was destined hereafter   in the reign of henry iii   to make him marshal of france at last   he  had to suffer a disappointment more serious than that which was personal  to himself  the victory of ceresole had not the results that might have  been expected   the war continued  charles v  transferred his principal  efforts therein to the north  on the frontiers of the low countries and  france  having concluded an alliance with henry viii  for acting in  concert and on the offensive   champagne and picardy were simultaneously  invaded by the germans and the english  henry viii  took boulogne   charles v  advanced as far as chateau thierry and threatened paris   great was the consternation there  francis i  hurried up from  fontainebleau and rode about the streets  accompanied by the duke of  guise  and everywhere saying   if i cannot keep you from fear  i will  keep you from harm     my god   he had exclaimed  as he started from  fontainebleau   how dear thou sellest me my kingdom    the people  recovered courage and confidence  they rose in a body  forty thousand  armed militiamen defiled  it is said  before the king   the army arrived  by forced marches  and took post between paris and chateau thierry      illustration  claude de lorraine  duke of guise            charles v  was not rash  he fell back to crespy in laonness  some few  leagues from his low countries   negotiations were opened  and francis  i   fearing least henry viii   being master of boulogne  should come and  join charles v   ordered his negotiator  admiral d annebaut  to accept  the emperor s offers   for fear lest he should rise higher in his demands  when he knew that boulogne was in the hands of the king of england    the  demands were hard  but a little less so than those made in       charles  v  yielded on some special points  being possessed beyond everything with  the desire of securing francis i  s co operation in the two great  contests he was maintaining  against the turks in eastern europe and  against the protestants in germany   francis i  conceded everything in  respect of the european policy in order to retain his rights over  milaness and to recover the french towns on the somme   peace was signed  at crespy on the   th of september        and it was considered so bad an  one that the dauphin thought himself bound to protest  first of all  secretly before notaries and afterwards at fontainebleau  on the   th of  december  in the presence of three princes of the royal house   this  feeling was so general that several great bodies  amongst others the  parliament of toulouse  on the   d of january         followed the  dauphin s example     francis i  was ill  saddened  discouraged  and still he thought of  nothing but preparing for a fifth great campaign against charles v   since his glorious victory at melegnano in the beginning of his reign   fortune had almost invariably forsaken his policy and all his  enterprises  whether of war or of diplomacy  but  falling at one time a  victim to the defects of his mind and character  and being at another  hurried away by his better qualities and his people s sympathy  he took  no serious note of the true causes or the inevitable consequences of his  reverses  and realized nothing but their outward and visible signs   whilst still persisting in the same hopeful illusions and the same ways  of government   happily for the lustre of his reign and the honor of his  name  he had desires and tastes independent of the vain and reckless  policy practised by him with such alternations of rashness and feebleness  as were more injurious to the success of his designs than to his personal  renown  which was constantly recovering itself through the brilliancy of  his courage  the generous though superficial instincts of his soul  and  the charm of a mind animated by a sincere though ill regulated sympathy  for all the beautiful works of mankind in literature  science  and art   and for all that does honor and gives embellishment to the life of human  beings           chapter xxix     francis i  and the renaissance      illustration  francis i             francis i   in his life as a king and a soldier  had two rare pieces of  good fortune  two great victories  melegnano and ceresole  stand out at  the beginning and the end of his reign  and in his direst defeat  at  pavia  he was personally a hero   in all else  as regards his government   his policy was neither an able nor a successful one  for two and thirty  years he was engaged in plans  attempts  wars  and negotiations  he  failed in all his designs  he undertook innumerable campaigns or  expeditions that came to nothing  he concluded forty treaties of war   peace  or truce  incessantly changing aim  and cause  and allies  and   for all this incoherent activity  he could not manage to conquer either  the empire or italy  he brought neither aggrandizement nor peace to  france     outside of the political arena  in quite a different field of ideas and  facts  that is  in the intellectual field  francis i  did better and  succeeded better   in this region he exhibited an instinct and a taste  for the grand and the beautiful  he had a sincere love for literature   science  and art  he honored and protected  and effectually too  their  works and their representatives   and therein it is that more than one  sovereign and more than one age have found their purest glory to consist   virgil  horace  and livy contributed quite as much as the foundation of  the empire to shed lustre on the reign of augustus   bossuet  pascal  and  fenelon  corneille  racine  boileau  moliere  and la fontaine  count for  quite as much as his great warriors and his able administrators in regard  to the splendor of the age of louis xiv   people are quite right to set  this estimate upon the heroes of the human mind and upon their works   their portion in the history of mankind is certainly not the most  difficult  but it is that which provides both those who give and those  who take with the purest delights  and which is the least dear in respect  of what it costs the nation     the reign of francis i  occupies the first half of the century  the  sixteenth   which has been called the age of renaissance   taken  absolutely  and as implying a renaissance  following upon a decay of  science  literature  and art  the expression is exaggerated  and goes  beyond the truth  it is not true that the five centuries which rolled by  between the establishment of the capetians and the accession of francis  i   from     to        were a period of intellectual barrenness and  decay  the middle ages  amidst the anarchy  violence  and calamities of  their social condition  had  in philosophy  literature  and art  works of  their own and a glory of their own  which lacked not originality  or  brilliancy  or influence over subsequent ages   there is no idea of  telling their history here  we only desire to point out  with some sort  of precision  their special character and their intellectual worth     at such a period  what one would scarcely expect to find is intellectual  ambition on a very extensive scale and great variety in the branches of  knowledge and in the scope of ideas   and yet it is in the thirteenth  century that we meet for the first time in europe and in france with the  conception and the execution of a vast repertory of different scientific  and literary works produced by the brain of man  in fact with a veritable  encyclopaedia   it was a monk  a preaching friar  a simple dominican  reader  lector qualiscumque   whose life was passed  as he himself says   by the side and under the eye of the superior general of his order  who  undertook and accomplished this great labor   vincent of beauvais  born  at beauvais between      and       who died at his native place in        an insatiable glutton for books  librorum helluo   say his  contemporaries  collected and edited what he called  bibliotheca mundi   speculum majus   library of the world  an enlarged mirror   an immense  compilation  the first edition of which  published at strasbourg in        comprises ten volumes folio  and would comprise fifty or sixty volumes  octavo   the work contains three  and  according to some manuscripts   four parts  entitled  speculum naturale   mirror of natural science     speculum historiale   mirror of historical science    speculum  doctrinale   mirror of metaphysical science   and  speculum morale    mirror of moral science    m  daunou  in the notice he has given to it   in the xviiith volume of the  histoire litteraire de la france   begun  by the benedictines and continued by the  academie des inscriptions et  belleslettres de l institut   pp            disputes  not without reason   the authenticity of this last part   each of these specula contains a  summary  extracted from the various writings which have reference to the  subject of it  and the authors of which vincent of beauvais takes care to  name   m  daunou  at the end of his learned notice  has described the  nature  the merit  and the interest of the work in the following terms    the writings and documents which we have to thank vincent of beauvais  for having preserved to us are such as pertain to veritable studies  to  doctrines  to traditions  and even to errors which obtained a certain  amount of credit or exercised a certain amount of influence in the course  of ages            whenever it is desirable to know what were in france   about       the tendency and the subjects of the most elevated studies   what sciences were cultivated  what books  whether ancient  or  for the  time  modern  were or might have been read  what questions were in  agitation  what doctrines were prevalent in schools  monasteries   churches  and the world  it will be to vincent of beauvais  above all   that recourse must be had    there is nothing to be added to this  judicious estimate  there is no intention of entering here into any sort  of detail about the work of vincent of beauvais  only it is desirable to  bring some light to bear upon the intellectual aspirations and activity  of the middle ages in france previously to the new impulse which was to  be communicated to them by the glorious renaissance of greek and roman  antiquity   a scientific  historical  and philosophical encyclopaedia of  the thirteenth century surely deserves to find a place in the preface to  the sixteenth     after the encyclopaedist of the middle ages come  naturally  their  philosophers   they were numerous  and some of them have remained  illustrious   several of them  at the date of their lives and labors   have already been met with and remarked upon in this history  such as  gerbert of aurillac  who became pope sylvester ii   st  anselm  abelard   st  bernard  robert of sorbon  founder of the sorbonne  and st  thomas  aquinas      illustration  st  thomas aquinas and abelard            to these names  known to every enlightened man  might be added many  others less familiar to the public  but belonging to men who held a high  place in the philosophical contests of their times  such as john scot  erigena  berenger  roscelin  william of champeaux  gilbert of la poree    c   the questions which always have taken and always will take a  passionate hold of men s minds in respect of god  the universe  and man   in respect of our origin  our nature  and our destiny  were raised and  discussed  from the eleventh to the fifteenth century  if not with so  much brilliancy  at any rate with as much boldness and earnest thought   as at any other period   the middle ages had  in france  their  spiritualists  their materialists  their pantheists  their rationalists   their mystics  and their sceptics  not very clear or refined in their  notions  but such as lacked neither profundity in their general view of  the questions  nor ingenious subtilty in their argumentative process   we  do not care to give in this place any exposition or estimate of their  doctrines  we shall simply point out what there was original and  characteristic in their fashion of philosophizing  and wherein their  mental condition differed essentially from that which was engendered and  propagated  in the sixteenth century  by the resuscitation of greek and  roman antiquity     it is the constant idea of the philosophers and theologians of that  period to affirm and to demonstrate the agreement between christian faith  and reason   they consider themselves placed between two fixed points   faith in the christian truths inculcated from the very first or formally  revealed by god to man  and reason  which is the faculty given to man to  enable him to recognize the truth    faith   wrote hildebert  archbishop  of tours  in the eleventh century   is not contrary to reason  but it is  above reason   if  like the philosophers  one willeth not to believe  anything but what reason comprehends  faith  in this case  hath no merit   the merit is in believing that which  without being contrary to reason   is above it            faith is certainty in respect of things which fall  not under the perceptions of the body  it is below knowledge  for to  believe is less than to know  and it is above opinion  for to believe is  more than to imagine     i do not seek to understand in order to  believe   says st  anselm   i believe in order to understand            authority requires faith in order to prepare man for reason    but   authority   said st  columban  in the sixth century   proceeds from  right reason  not at all reason from authority   every authority whereof  the decrees are not approved of by right reason appears mighty weak    minds so liberal in the face of authority  and at the same time attached  to revealed and traditional faith  could not but be sometimes painfully  perplexed    my wounded spirit   said adam of the premontre order  le  premontre   in the twelfth century   calls to her aid that which is the  source of all grace and all life   but where is it   what is it   in her  trouble the spirit hath love abiding  but she knows no longer what it is  she loves  what she ought to love   she addresseth herself to the stones  and to the rocks  and saith to them   what are ye    and the stones and  the rocks make answer   we are creatures of the same even as thou art    to the like question the sun  the moon  and the stars make the like  answer   the spirit doth interrogate the sand of the sea  the dust of the  earth  the drops of rain  the days of the years  the hours of the days   the moments of the hours  the turf of the fields  the branches of the  trees  the leaves of the branches  the scales of fish  the wings of  birds  the utterances of men  the voices of animals  the movements of  bodies  the thoughts of minds  and these things declare  all with one  consent  unto the spirit   we are not that which thou demandest  search  up above us  and thou wilt find our creator     in the tenth century   remigius the theologian had gone still farther   i have resolved   said  he   to make an investigation as to my god  for it doth not suffice me to  believe in him  i wish further to see somewhat of him   i feel that there  is somewhat beyond my spirit   if my spirit should abide within herself  without rising above herself  she would see only herself  it must be  above herself that my spirit will reach god      god  creator  lawgiver  and preserver of the universe and of man   everywhere and always present and potent  in permanent connection  nay   communication  with man  at one time by natural and at another by  supernatural means  at one time by the channel of authority and at  another by that of free agency  this is the point of departure  this the  fixed idea of the philosopho theologians of the middle ages   there are  great gaps  great diversities  and great inconsistencies in their  doctrines  they frequently made unfair use of the subtile dialectics  called scholastics  la scolastique   and they frequently assigned too  much to the master s authority  l autorite du maitre   but christian  faith  more or less properly understood and explained  and adhesion to  the facts  to the religious and moral precepts  and to the primitive and  essential testimonies of christianity  are always to be found at the  bottom of their systems and their disputes   whether they be pantheists  even or sceptics  it is in an atmosphere of christianity that they live  and that their thoughts are developed     a breath from the grand old pagan life of greece and rome heaved forth  again and spread  in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries  throughout  this christian atmosphere of the middle ages   greek and roman antiquity   with its ideas and its works  had never been completely forgotten  therein   aristotle and plato  seneca  epictetus  boetius  and other  ancients had taken their place amongst the studies and philosophical  notions of that period  but their influence had been limited to  professional scholars  and had remained without any social influence   in spite of the stateliness of its ceremonies and the charm of its  traditions  paganism had never been  in plain truth  a religion  faith  and piety had held but a paltry place in it  instead of a god  the  creator and acting sovereign of the world  its gods were of human  invention and human nature  their adventures and the parts they played  were pleasing to the imagination  but gave no sort of satisfaction to the  deep instincts and higher aspirations of the soul   christianity is god  hovering over  watching over  and descending to earth  paganism is earth   its children and the stories of their lives transported  with their vices  rather than their virtues  to heaven   olympus was peopled with nothing  but personages belonging to popular tradition  mythology  or allegory   and in the fifteenth century this mythology was in full course of decay   all that it might have commanded of credence or influence had vanished   there remained of it nothing but barren memories or a contemptuous  incredulity   speaking from the religious point of view  the renaissance  was but a resurrection of paganism dying out before the presence of the  christian world  which was troubled and perplexed  but full of life and  futurity     the religious question thus set on one side  the renaissance was a great  and happy thing  which restored to light and honor the works and glories  of the greek and roman communities  those two communities which  in  history anterior to the sixteenth century  had reached the greatest  prosperity and splendor under a civil regimen  in the midst of a more or  less stormy but real and strong political freedom  and had attained by  the mere development of human thought and human energy the highest degree  of civilization yet known in europe  and  one would be inclined to say   in the world   the memorials and monuments of this civilization  which  were suddenly removed  at the fall of the greek empire  to italy first  and then from italy to france  and throughout the whole of western  europe  impressed with just admiration people as well as princes  and  inspired them with the desire of marching forward in their turn in this  attractive and glorious career   this kind of progress  arrived at by the  road of imitation  often costs dear in the interruption it causes to the  natural course of the peculiar and original genius of nations  but this  is the price at which the destinies of diverse communities get linked  together and interpenetrate  and the general progress of humanity is  accomplished     it was not only in religious questions and by their philosopho   theologians that the middle ages  before the renaissance  displayed their  activity and fecundity   in literature and in art  in history and in  poesy  in architecture and in sculpture  they had produced great and  beautiful works  which were quite worthy of surviving  and have  in fact   survived the period of their creation   here  too  the renaissance of  greek and roman antiquity came in  and altered the originality of the  earliest productions of the middle ages  and gave to literature and to  art in france a new direction   it will be made a point here to note with  some exactness the peculiar and native character of french literature at  its origin   it is a far cry from the middle ages to the time of louis  xiv   but the splendors of the most lovely days do not efface the charm  belonging to the glimmerings of dawn     the first amongst the literary creations of the middle ages is that of  the french language itself   when we pass from the ninth to the  thirteenth century  from the oath of charles the bald and louis the  germanic at strasbourg  in      to the account of the conquest of  constantinople in       given by geoffrey de villehardouin  seneschal of  champagne  what a space has been traversed  what progress accomplished in  the language of france   it was  at first  nothing but a coarse and  irregular mixture of german and latin  the former still in a barbarous  and the latter already in a corrupted state  and amidst this mixture  appear some fragments of the celtic idioms of gaul  without any literary  tradition to regulate this mass of incoherence and confusion   as for  following the development  regulation  and transformation of the french  national language during these three centuries  and marking how it issued  from this formless and vulgar chaos  there are not facts and documents  enough for our guidance throughout that long travail  but when the  thirteenth century begins  when villehardouin tells the tale of the  crusade  which put  for seventy years  constantinople and the greek  empire of the east in the hands of the latin and german warriors of the  west  the french language  though still rude and somewhat fluctuating   appears already rich  varied  and capable of depicting with fidelity and  energy events  ideas  characters  and the passions of men   there we have  french prose and french poesy in their simple and lusty youth  the   conquest of constantinople  by geoffrey de villehardouin  and the  song  of roland  by the unknown poet who collected and put together in the form  of an epopee the most heroic amongst the legends of the reign of  charlemagne  are the first great and beautiful monuments of french  literature in the middle ages     the words are french literature  and of that alone is there any intention  of speaking here   the middle ages had  up to the sixteenth century  a  latin literature  philosophers  theologians  and chroniclers all wrote in  latin   the philosophers and theologians have already been spoken of   amongst the chroniclers some deserve the name of historians  not only do  they alone make us acquainted with the history of their times  but they  sometimes narrate it with real talent as observers and writers   gregory  of tours  eginhard  william of tyre  guibert of nogent  william of  jumieges  and orderic vital are worthy of every attention from those  whose hearts are set upon thoroughly understanding the history of the  periods and the provinces of which those laborers of the middle ages  have  in latin  preserved the memorials   the chief of those works have  been gathered together and translated in a special collection bearing the  name of guizot   but it is with the reign of francis i  that  to bid a  truce to further interruption  we commence the era of the real grand  literature of france  that which has constituted and still constitutes  the pride and the noble pleasure of the french public   of that alone we  would here denote the master works and the glorious names  putting them  carefully at the proper dates and places in the general course of events   a condition necessary for making them properly understood and their  influence properly appreciated   as to the reign of francis i   however   it must be premised as follows  several of the most illustrious of french  writers  in poesy and prose  ronsard  montaigne  bodin  and stephen  pasquier  were born during that king s lifetime and during the first half  of the sixteenth century  but it is to the second half of that century  and to the first of the seventeenth that they belong by the glory of  their works and of their influence  their place in history will be  assigned to them when we enter upon the precise epoch at which they  performed and shone   we will at present confine ourselves to the great  survivors of the middle ages  whether in prose or poesy  and to the men  who shed lustre on the reign of francis i  himself  and led french  literature in its first steps along the road on which it entered at that  period     the middle ages bequeathed to french literature four prose writers whom  we cannot hesitate to call great historians  villehardouin  joinville   froissart  and commynes   geoffrey de villehardouin  after having taken  part  as negotiator and soldier  in the crusade which terminated in the  capture of constantinople  and having settled in thessaly  at  messinopolis  as holder of considerable fiefs  with the title of marshal  of romania  roumelia   employed his leisure in writing a history of this  great exploit   he wrote with a dignified simplicity  epic and at the  same time practical  speaking but little of himself  narrating facts with  the precision of one who took part in them  and yet without useless  detail or personal vanity  finding pleasure in doing justice to his  comrades  amongst others the veteran doge of venice  henry dandolo  and  sometimes intermingling with his story the reflections of a judicious and  sincere christian  without any pious fanaticism and without ostentation   joinville wrote his history of st  louis at the request of joan of  navarre  wife of philip the handsome  and five years after that queen s  death  his manuscripts have it thus   the things which i personally saw  and heard were written in the year of grace       in the month of  october    he was then eighty five  and he dedicated his book to louis le  hutin  the quarreller   great grandson of st  louis   more lively and  more familiar in style than villehardouin  he combines the vivid and  natural impressions of youth with an old man s fond clinging to the  memories of his long life  he likes to bring himself upon the scene   especially as regards his relations towards and his conversations with  st  louis  for whom he has a tender regard and admiration  at the same  time that he maintains towards him a considerable independence of ideas   conduct  and language  he is a valiant and faithful knight  who forms a  very sensible opinion as to the crusade in which he takes part  and who  will not enter upon it a second time even to follow the king to whom he  is devoted  but whose pious fanaticism and warlike illusions he does not  share  his narrative is at one and the same time very full of himself  without any pretension  and very spirited without any show of passion   and fraught with a graceful and easy carelessness which charms the reader  and all the while inspires confidence in the author s veracity   froissart is an insatiable fry  who revels in all the sights of his day   events and personages  wars and galas  adventures of heroism or  gallantry  and who is incessantly gadding about through all the dominions  and all the courts of europe  everywhere seeking his own special  amusement in the satisfaction of his curiosity   he has himself given an  account of the manner in which he collected and wrote his chronicles    ponder   says he   amongst yourselves  such of ye as read me  or will  read me  or have read me  or shall hear me read  how i managed to get and  put together so many facts whereof i treat in so many parts   and  for to  inform you of the truth  i began young  at the age of twenty years  and i  came into the world amidst the deeds and adventures  and i did always  take great delight in them  more than in aught else   and god gave me  such grace that i was well with all parties  and with the households of  the kings  and  especially  the household of king edward of england  and  the noble queen his wife  madame philippa of hainault  unto whom  in my  youth  i was clerk  and i did minister unto her with beautiful ditties  and amorous treatises   and for love of the service of the noble and  valiant dame with whom i was  all the other lords  kings  dukes  counts   barons  and knights  of whatsoever nation they might be  did love me and  hear me and see me gladly  and brought me great profit            thus   wherever i went  i made inquiry of the old knights and squires who had  been at deeds of arms  and who were specially fit to speak thereof  and  also of certain heralds in good credit for to verify and justify all  matters   thus have i gotten together this lofty and noble history    this picture of froissart and his work by his own hand would be  incomplete without the addition of a characteristic anecdote   in one of  his excursions in search of adventures and stories   he fell in at  pamiers with a good knight  messire espaing of lyons  who had been in all  the wars of the time  and managed the great affairs of princes   they set  out to travel together  messire espaing telling his comrade what he knew  about the history of the places whereby they passed  and froissart taking  great care to ride close to him for to hear his words   every evening  they halted at hostels where they drained flagons full of white wine as  good as the good canon had ever drunk in his life  then  after drinking   so soon as the knight was weary of relating  the chronicler wrote down  just the substance of his stories  so as to better leave remembrance of  them for time to come  as there is no way of retaining so certain as  writing down      there is no occasion to add to these quotations  they give the most  correct idea that can be formed of froissart s chronicles and their  literary merit as well as their historical value     philip de commynes is quite another affair  and far more than froissart   nay  than joinville and villehardouin   he is a politician proficient in  the understanding and handling of the great concerns and great personages  of his time   he served charles the rash and louis xi   and  after so  trying an experience  he depicted them and passed judgment upon them with  imperturbable clearsightedness and freedom of thought   with the recital  of events  as well as the portrayal of character  he mingles here and  there the reflections  expressed in precise  firm  and temperate  language  of a profound moralist  who sets before himself no other aim  but that of giving his thoughts full utterance   he has already been  spoken of in the second volume of this history  in connection with his  leaving the duke of burgundy s service for that of louis xi   and with  his remarks upon the virtues as well as the vices of that able but  unprincipled despot   we will not go again over that ground   as a king s  adviser  commynes would have been as much in place at the side of louis  xiv  as at that of louis xi   as a writer  he  in the fifteenth century   often made history and politics speak a language which the seventeenth  century would not have disowned     let us pass from the prose writers of the middle ages to their poets     the grand name of poesy is here given only to poetical works which have  lived beyond their cradles and have taken rank amongst the treasures of  the national literature   thanks to sociability of manners  vivacity of  intellect  and fickleness of taste  light and ephemeral poesy has  obtained more success and occupied more space in france than in any other  country  but there are successes which give no title to enter into a  people s history  quality and endurance of renown are even more requisite  in literature than in politics  and many a man whose verses have been  very much relished and cried up in his lifetime has neither deserved nor  kept in his native land the beautiful name of poet   setting aside  of  course  the language and poems of the troubadours of southern france  we  shall find  in french poesy previous to the renaissance  only three works  which  through their popularity in their own time  still live in the  memory of the erudite  and one only which  by its grand character and its  superior beauties  attests the poetical genius of the middle ages and can  claim national rights in the history of france    the romance of the  rose  in the erotic and allegorical style  the  romances of renart  in  the satirical  and the  farce of patelin   a happy attempt in the line of  comedy  though but little known nowadays to the public  are still and  will remain subjects of literary study    the song of roland  alone is an  admirable sample of epic poesy in france  and the only monument of  poetical genius in the middle ages which can have a claim to national  appreciation in the nineteenth century   it is almost a pity not to  reproduce here the whole of that glorious epopee  as impressive from the  forcible and pathetic simplicity of its sentiments and language as from  the grandeur of the scene and the pious heroism of the actors in it   it  is impossible  however  to resist the pleasure of quoting some fragments  of it   the best version to refer to is that which has been given almost  word for word  from the original text  by m  leon gaultier  in his  beautiful work  so justly crowned by the  academie des inscriptions et  belles lettres  on lee epopees francaises      in     charlemagne was returning from a great expedition in spain  during  which  after having taken pampeluna  he had failed before saragossa  and  had not considered himself called upon to prolong his struggle with the  arab mussulmans   he with the main body of his army had crossed the  pyrenees  leaving as rearguard a small division under his nephew roland   prefect of the marches of brittany  anselm  count of the palace  oliver   roland s comrade  archbishop turpin  and several other warriors of  renown   when they arrived at the little valley of roncesvalles  between  the defiles of sizer and val carlos  this rearguard was unexpectedly  attacked by thousands of basque mountaineers  who were joined by  thousands of arabs eager to massacre and plunder the christians and  franks  who  indeed  perished to a man in this ambuscade    the news of  this disaster   says eginhard  in his annales   obscured the glory of the  successes the king had but lately obtained in spain    this fact  with  large amplifications  became the source of popular legends and songs   which  probably towards the end of the eleventh century  became embodied  in the  song of roland   attributed  in two manuscripts  but without any  certainty  to a certain thuroulde  turold   abbot of malmesbury and  peterborough under william the conqueror   it must suffice to reproduce  here only the most beautiful and most characteristic passages of this  little national epopee  a truly homeric picture of the quasi barbarous  times and manners of knightly christendom     the eighty second strophe of the poem commences thus       of paynim yonder  saw i more    quoth oliver   than e er before  the eye of man hath seen  an hundred

but prays for roland s life   till they have joined him in the strife   but ah  what prayer can alter fate   the time is past  too late  too late   as roland scans both plain and height   and sees how many frenchmen lie  stretched in their mortal agony   he mourns them like a noble knight    comrades  god give ye grace to day   and grant ye paradise  i pray   no lieges ever fought as they   what a

    see roland riding in a swound   and oliver with mortal wound   with loss of blood so dazed is he  he neither near nor far can see  what manner of man a man may be   and  meeting with sir roland so   he dealeth him a fearful blow  that splits the gilded helm in two  down to the very nasal  though   by luck  the skull it cleaves not through   with blank amaze doth roland gaze   and gently  very gently  says    dear comrade  smit st thou with intent   methinks no challenge hath been sent  i m roland  who doth love thee so    quoth oliver   thy voice i know   but see thee not  god save thee

 in love  leave one another       oliver dies  roland and archbishop turpin continue the fight       then roland takes his horn once more   his blast is feebler than before   but still it reaches the emperor  he hears it  and he halts to shout    let clarions  one and all  ring out    then sixty thousand clarions ring   and rocks and dales set echoing   and they  too  hear  the pagan pack   they force the rising laughter back    charles  charles   they cry   is on our track    they fly  and roland stands alone    alone  afoot  his steed is gone    brave veillantif is gone  and so   he  willy nilly  afoot must go   archbishop turpin needs his aid   the golden helm is soon unlaced   the light  white hauberk soon unbraced   and gently  gently down he laid  on the green turf the bishop s head   and then beseechingly he said       ah  noble sir  your leave i crave  the men we love  our comrades brave   all  all are dead  they must not lie  here thus neglected  wherefore i  will seek for them  each where he lies   and lay them out before your eyes     go   said the bishop   and speed be thine  thank god  the field is thine and mine       sir roland searched the plain  and found  his comrade s body on the ground   unto his heart he strained it tight   and bore it off  as best he might   upon a shield he lays his friend  beside the rest  and  for an end   the bishop gives them  all and one   absolvement and a benison   as roland marks them lying there   his peers all dead  and oliver   his mighty grief he cannot stay   and  willy nilly  swoons away      the bishop feeleth grief profound  to see sir roland in a swound   through roncesvalles  well he knows   a stream of running water flows   and fain would he a journey make  to fetch thereof for roland s sake   he totters forth  he makes essay   but all  his feeble limbs give way   breaks his great heart  he falls and lies   face downward  in death s agonies   so charles s soldier priest is dead  he who with mighty lance and sword  and preacher s craft incessant warred  against the scorners of the lord   god s benediction on his head   count roland laid him to his rest  between his shoulders  on his breast   he crossed the hands so fine and fair   and  as his country s customs were   he made oration o er him there   ah  noble knight  of noble race   i do commend thee to god s grace  sure never man of mortal birth  served him so heartily on earth   thou hadst no peer in any clime  to stoutly guard the christian cause  and turn bad men to christian laws   since erst the great apostles  time   now rest thy soul from dolor free   and paradise be oped to thee        a last encounter takes place  a saracen left wounded on the  battle field  seeing roland in a swoon  gets up  and approaches him   saying   vanquished   he is vanquished  the nephew of charles  there is  his sword  which i will carry off to arabia        and as he makes to draw the steel   a something doth sir roland feel   he opes his eyes  says nought but this    thou art not one of us  i wis    raises the horn he would not quit   and cracks the pagan s skull with it       and then the touch of death that steals  down  down from head to heart he feels  under yon pine he hastes away  on the green turf his head to lay  placing beneath him horn and sword   he turns towards the paynim horde   and  there  beneath the pine  he sees  a vision of old memories  a thought of realms he helped to win   of his sweet france  of kith and kin   and charles  his lord  who nurtured him   he sighs  and tears his eyes bedim   then  not unmindful of his case   once more he sues to god for grace   o thou  true father of us all   who hatest lies  who erst did call  the buried lazarus from the grave   and daniel from the lions save   from all the perils i deserve  for sinful life my soul preserve    then to his god outstretcheth he  the glove from his right hand  and  see   st  gabriel taketh it instantly   god sends a cherub angel bright   and michael  saint of peril hight   and gabriel comes  up  up they rise   and bear the count to paradise        it is useless to carry these quotations any further  they are sufficient  to give an idea of the grand character of the poem in which so many  traits of really touching affection and so many bursts of patriotic  devotion and pious resignation are mingled with the merest brute courage   such  in its chief works  philosophical  historical  and poetical  was  the literature which the middle ages bequeathed to the reign of  francis i   in history only  and in spite of the new character assumed  afterwards by the french language  this literature has had the honor of  preserving its nationality and its glory   villehardouin  joinville   froissart  and commynes have remained great writers   in philosophy and  in poesy a profound revolution was approaching  the religious reform and  the fine literary genius as well as the grand french language of the  seventeenth century were preparing to rise above the intellectual  horizon   but between the moment when such advances dawn and that when  they burst forth there is nearly always a period of uncertain and  unfruitful transition  and such was the first half of the sixteenth  century  that is to say  the actual reign of francis i   it is often  called the reign of the renaissance  which certainly originated in his  reign  but it did not grow and make any display until after him  the  religious  philosophical  and poetical revolution  calvin  montaigne  and  ronsard  born in the earlier half of the seventeenth century  did not do  anything that exercised any power until the later   one single poet  a  third rate one  clement marot  attained lustre under francis i   rabelais  is the only great prose writer who belongs strictly to that period   the  scholars  the learned critics of what had been left by antiquity in  general and by greek and roman antiquity in particular  bude  budaeus    j  c  scaliger  muretus  danes  danesius   arnyot  ramus  peter la  ramee   robert estienne  stephanus   vatable  watebled   cujas  and  turnebius make up the tale of literature specially belonging to and  originating in the reign of francis i   just as the foundation of the  college royal  which became the college de france  is his chief personal  claim to renown in the service of science and letters     let us return to the poets of the actual reign of francis i   the first  we encounter speaks thus of himself        i am not rich  that  certes  i confess   but  natheless  well born and nobly bred   i m read by both the people and noblesse   throughout the world   that s clement   it is said   men live their span  but i shall ne er be dead   and thou  thou hast thy meadow  well  and spring   wood  field  and castle  all that wealth can bring   there s just that difference  twixt thee and me   but what i am thou couldst not be  the thing  thou art  why  anybody else might be      now who was this who  with perfect confidence  indulged in such proud  language   was it a homer  a dante  a corneille  one of those great  poetical geniuses whose works can move a whole people  are addressed to  all the world  and  will live forever    no  it was a poet of the court  and of the fashionable world of paris  of blois  and of amboise  in the  sixteenth century  a groom of the chamber to marguerite de valois  and  one of francis i  s favorites  who had written elegies  eclogues   epistles  complaints  roundelays  and epigrams on the incidents and for  his masters and mistresses of the hour  france owed to him none of those  great poetical works consecrated to description of the grand destinies  and grand passions of man  and to the future as well as to the writer s  own time      illustration  clement marot            clemont marot  the son of a petty burgess of cahors  named john marot   himself a poet in a small way  who had lived some time at the court of  louis xii   under the patronage of queen anne of bretagne  had a right to  style himself   well born and nobly bred   many of the petty burgesses of  cahors were of noble origin  and derived therefrom certain privileges   john marot  by a frugal and regular life  had acquired and left to his  son two estates in the neighborhood of cahors  where  no doubt  clement  resided but little  for he lived almost constantly at the court  or  wandering about europe  in every place where at one time the fortunes of  the king his protector and at another the storm of the nascent religious  reform left him stranded willy nilly   he was present in      at the  battle of pavia  where he was wounded and taken prisoner with his king   but soon released  since the imperialists let go on easy terms gentlemen  of whom it was impossible to make a rich booty   from that time we do not  meet any more with clement marot in war or politics  to marguerite de  valois  to adventures of gallantry  and to success in his mundane line of  poesy his life was thenceforth devoted   the scandal of history has often  been directed against his relations with his royal patroness  but there  seems to be no real foundation for such a suspicion  the manners of the  sixteenth century admitted of intimacies in language  and sometimes even  of familiarities in procedure  contrasting strangely with demonstrations  of the greatest respect  nay  humility   clement marot was the king of  poesy and set the fashion of wit in his time  marguerite had a generous  and a lively sympathy with wit  talent  success  renown  the princess and  the poet were mutually pleased with and flattered one another  and the  liberties allowed to sympathy and flattery were great at that time  but  far less significant than they would be in our day     what were the cause  the degree  and the real value of this success and  this renown of which clement marot made so much parade  and for which his  contemporaries gave him credit   what change  what progress effected by  him  during his lifetime  in french literature and the french language  won for him the place he obtained and still holds in the opinion of the  learned     a poet who no more than clement marot produced any great poetical work   and was very different from him in their small way  francis villon  in  fact  preceded him by about three quarters of a century   the most  distinguished amongst the literary critics of our time have discussed the  question as to which of the two  villon or marot  should be regarded as  the last poet of the middle ages and the first of modern france   m  sainte beuve  without attempting to precisely solve that little  problem  has distinguished and characterized the two poets with so much  of truth and tact that there can be no hesitation about borrowing his  words   was villon   is the question he puts to himself   an originator   did he create a style of poesy   had he any idea of a literary reaction   as we should say nowadays   what is quite certain is  that he possessed  original talent  that amidst all the execrable tricks wherein he  delighted and wherein he was a master  he possessed the sacred spark            a licentious scamp of a student  bred at some shop in the cite  or the place maubert  he has a tone which  at least as much as that of  regnier  has a savor of the places the author frequented   the beauties  whom he celebrates  and i blush for him  are none else than  la blanche  savetiere   the fair cobbleress   or  la gente saul cissiere  du coin    the pretty sausage girl at the corner    but he has invented for some of  those natural regrets which incessantly recur in respect of vanished  beauty and the flight of years a form of expression  truthful  charming   and airy  which goes on singing forever in the heart and ear of whosoever  has once heard it   he has flashes  nothing more than flashes  of  melancholy            it is in reading the verses of clement marot that  we have  for the first time as it seems to me  a very clear and distinct  feeling of having got out from the circumbendibus of the old language   from the gallic tangle   we are now in france  in the land and amidst the  language of france  in the region of genuine french wit  no longer that  of the boor  or of the student  or of the burgess  but of the court and  good society   good society  in poesy  was born with marot  with francis  i   and his sister marguerite  with the renaissance  much will still have  to be done to bring it to perfection  but it exists and will never cease  again            marot  a poet of wits rather than of genius or of great  talent  but full of grace and breeding  who has no passion  but is not  devoid of sensibility  has a way of his own of telling and saying things   he has a turn of his own  he is  in a word  the agreeable man  the  gentleman like man  who is bound to be pleasant and amusing  and who  discharges his duty with an easy air and unexceptionable gallantry      there we have exactly the new character which marot  coming between  villon and ronsard  gave in the sixteenth century to french poesy   we  may be more exacting than m  sainte beuve  we may regret that marot   whilst rescuing it from the streets  confined it too much to the court   the natural and national range of poesy is higher and more extensive than  that  the hundred years  war and joan of arc had higher claims   but it  is something to have delivered poesy from coarse vulgarity  and  introduced refinement into it   clement marot rendered to the french  language  then in labor of progression  and  one might say  of formation   eminent service  he gave it a naturalness  a clearness  an easy swing   and  for the most part  a correctness which it had hitherto lacked   it  was reserved for other writers  in verse and prose  to give it boldness   the richness that comes of precision  elevation  and grandeur     in       amidst the first violent tempest of reform in france  clement  marot  accused of heresy  prudently withdrew and went to seek an asylum  at ferrara  under the protection of the duchess  renee of france   daughter of louis xii   he there met calvin  who already held a high  position amongst the reformers  and who was then engaged on a translation  of the psalms in verse   the reformer talked to the poet about this grand  hebrew poesy  which  according to m  villemain s impression   has  defrayed in sublime coin the demands of human imagination    marot  on  returning to france  found the college royal recently instituted there   and the learned vatable  francis watebled  born at gamaches  in picardy   died at paris in       teaching hebrew with a great attendance of pupils  and of the curious   the professor engaged the poet to translate the  psalms  he himself expounding them to him word by word   marot translated  thirty of them  and dedicated them to francis i   who not only accepted  the dedication  but recommended the work and the author to charles v    who was at that time making a friendly passage through france on his way  to put down the insurrection at ghent    charles v  accepted the said  translation graciously   as appears by a letter in      to catherine de   medici from villemadon  one of marguerite of navarre s confidential  servants    commended it both by words and by a present of two hundred  doubloons  which he made to marot  thus giving him courage to translate  the rest of the psalms  and praying him to send him as soon as possible  the psalm  confitemini domino  quoniam bonus   trust in the lord  for he  is good   so fond was he of it    singular fellow feeling between charles  v  and his great adversary luther  who said of that same psalm   it is  my friend  it has saved me in many a strait from which emperor  kings   sages  nor saints could have delivered me    clement marot  thus aided  and encouraged in this work which gave pleasure to francis i  and charles  v   and must have been still more interesting to calvin and luther   prosecuted his work and published in      the first thirty psalms  three  years afterwards  in       he added twenty others  and dedicated the  collection  to the ladies of france   in an epistle wherein the following  verses occur        happy the man whose favored ear  in golden days to come shall hear  the ploughman  as he tills the ground   the tarter  as he drives his round   the shopman  as his task he plies   with psalms or sacred melodies  whiling the hours of toil away   o  happy he who hears the lay  of shepherd and of shepherdess   as in the woods they sing and bless   and make the rocks and pools proclaim  with them their great creator s name   o  can ye brook that god invite  them before you to such delight   begin  ladies  begin                 a century after marot s time  in       a pious and learned catholic   godeau  bishop of grasse and member of the nascent french academy  was in  his turn translating the psalms  and rendered full justice to the labors  of the poet  his predecessor  and to the piety of the reformers  in the  following terms  those whose separation from the church we deplore have  rendered the version they make use of famous by the pleasing airs that  learned musicians set them to when they were composed   to know them by  heart is  amongst them  a sign of the communion to which they belong  and  in the towns in which they are most numerous the airs may be heard coming  from the mouths of artisans  and in the country from those of tillers      in       eight years after the death of francis i   estienne pasquier  wrote to ronsard   in good faith  there was never seen in france such a  glut of poets   i fear that in the long run people will weary of them   but it is a vice peculiar to us that as soon as we see anything  succeeding prosperously for any one  everybody wants to join in    estienne pasquier s fear was much better grounded after the death of  francis i   and when ronsard had become the head of the poet world  than  it would have been in the first half of the sixteenth century   during  the reign of francis i  and after the date of clement marot  there is no  poet of any celebrity to speak of  unless we except francis i  himself  and his sister marguerite  and it is only in compliment to royalty s name  that they need be spoken of   they  both of them  had evidently a mania  for versifying  even in their most confidential communications  for many  of their letters to one another  those during the captivity of francis i   at madrid amongst the rest  are written in verse  but their verses are  devoid of poesy  they are prose  often long winded and frigid  and  sometimes painfully labored   there is  however  a distinction to be made  between the two correspondents   in the letters and verses of marguerite  there is seen gleaming forth here and there a sentiment of truth and  tenderness  a free and graceful play of fancy   we have three collections  of her writings     her  heptameron  ou les sept journees de la reine de  navarre   a collection of sixty eight tales more or less gallant   published for the first time in       without any author s name      her   oeuvres poetiques   which appeared at lyons in      and       in  consequence of her being alive  under the title of  les marguerites de la  marguerite des princesses   the pearls of the pearl of princesses   and  of which one of her grooms of the chamber was editor  in addition to  which there is a volume of  poesies inedites   collected by order of  marguerite herself  but written by the hand of her secretary john frotte   and preserved at paris amongst the manuscripts of the bibliotheque  nationale      the collection of her letters  published in       by m  f   genin   this last collection is  morally as well as historically  the  most interesting of the three   as for francis i  himself  there is  little  if anything  known of his posies beyond those which have been  inserted in the  documents relatifs a sa captivite a madrid   published  in      by m  champollion figeac  some have an historical value  either  as regards public events or francis i  s relations towards his mother   his sister  and his mistresses  the most important is a long account of  his campaign  in       in italy  and of the battle of pavia  but the  king s verses have even less poetical merit than his sister s     francis i  s good will did more for learned and classical literature than  for poesy   attention has already been drawn to the names of the  principal masters in the great learned and critical school which devoted  itself  in this reign  to the historical  chronological  philological   biographical  and literary study of greek and roman antiquity  both pagan  and christian   it is to the labors of this school and to their results  that the word renaissance is justly applied  and that the honor is  especially to be referred of the great intellectual progress made in the  sixteenth century   francis i  contributed to this progress  first by the  intelligent sympathy he testified towards learned men of letters  and  afterwards by the foundation of the  college royal   an establishment of  a special  an elevated  and an independent sort  where professors found a  liberty protected against the routine  jealousy  and sometimes  intolerance of the university of paris and the sorbonne   the king and  his sister marguerite often went to pay a visit  at his printing place in  st  jean de beauvais street  to robert estienne  stephanus   the most  celebrated amongst that family of printer publishers who had so much to  do with the resurrection of ancient literature   it is said that one day  the king waited a while in the work room  so as not to disturb robert  estienne in the correction of a proof      illustration  francis i  waits for robert estienne            when the violence bred of religious quarrels finally forced the learned  and courageous printer to expatriate himself  his first care was to say   at the head of his apology   when i take account of the war i have  carried on with the sorbonne for a space of twenty years or thereabouts   i cannot sufficiently marvel how so small and broken down a creature as i  am had strength to maintain it   when i was seen being harried on all  sides  how often have i been the talk on street and at banquets  whilst  people said   it is all over with him  he is caught  he cannot escape   even if the king would  he could not save him            i wish to  justify myself against the reproach of having left my country  to the  hurt of the public weal  and of not having acknowledged the great  liberality displayed towards me by the king  since it was a high honor  for me that the king  having deigned to make me his printer  always kept  me under his protection  in the face of all who envied me and wished me  ill  and never ceased to aid me graciously in all sorts of ways      the  college royal   no less than robert estienne  met with obstacles and  ill wishers  it was william bude  budeaus  who first suggested the idea  of the college to the king  primarily with the limited purpose of  securing instruction in greek and hebrew  after the fashion of the  college of young grecians and the college of the three languages  the  trilingual  hebrew  greek  and latin   of which the former was founded at  rome by leo x   the latter at louvain by canon jerome busleyden   francis  i  readily surrendered himself to more magnificent projects  he was  anxious to erect a splendid building on the site of the hotel de nesle   and to put erasmus at the head of the college royal   war incessantly  renewed and the nascent religious troubles interfered with his  resolutions  but william bude never ceased to urge upon the king an  extension of the branches of learning in the establishment  and after the  peace of cambrai in       chairs of mathematics  oriental languages   latin oratory  greek and latin philosophy  and medicine were successively  added to the chairs of hebrew and greek which had been the original  nucleus of instruction in the college royal   it continued to be an  object of suspicion to the sorbonne and of hesitation in the parliament   to which royalty had recourse against the attacks of its adversaries   but it had no lack of protectors  nevertheless  the cardinal of lorraine   charles ix   and catherine de  medici herself supported it in its trials   and francis i  had the honor of founding a great school of the higher  sort of education  a school  which  throughout all the religious  dissensions and all the political revolutions of france  has kept its  position and independence  whatever may have been elsewhere  in the  matter of public instruction  the system and the regimen of state  establishments     a few words have already been said about the development of the arts   especially architecture and sculpture  in the middle ages  and of the  characteristics  original and national  gallic and christian  which  belonged to them at this period  particularly in respect of their  innumerable churches  great and small   a foreglance has been given of  the alteration which was brought about in those characteristics  at the  date of the sixteenth century  by the renaissance  at the same time that  the arts were made to shine with fresh and vivid lustre   francis i  was  their zealous and lavish patron  he revelled in building and embellishing  palaces  castles  and hunting boxes  st  germain  chenonceaux   fontainebleau  and chambord  his chief councillors  chancellor duprat and  admiral bonnivet  shared his taste and followed his example  several  provinces  and the banks of the loire especially  became covered with  splendid buildings  bearing the marks of a complicated character which  smacked of imitations from abroad   italy  which  from the time of  charles viii  and louis xii   had been the object of french kings   ambition and the scene of french wars  became also the school of french  art  national and solemn christian traditions were blended  whilst taking  an altered form  with the italian resuscitation of greek and roman  antiquity   italian artists  such as rosso of florence  primatice of  bologna  niccolo dell  abbate of modena  and benvenuto cellini of  florence  came and settled in france  and there inspired and carried out  the king s projects and works   leonardo da vinci  full of years and  discontented with his italian patrons  accompanied francis i  to france   and died in his arms at the castle of clou  near amboise  where he had  fixed his residence   some great french artists  such as the painter john  cousin and the sculptor john goujon  strove ably to uphold the original  character and merits of french art  but they could not keep themselves  entirely aloof from the influence of this brilliant italian art  for  which francis i  s successors  even more than he  showed a zealous and  refined attachment  but of which he was  in france  the first patron     we will not quit the first half of the sixteenth century and the literary  and philosophical renaissance which characterizes that period  without  assigning a place therein at its proper date and in his proper rank to  the name  the life  and the works of the man who was not only its most  original and most eminent writer  but its truest and most vivid  representative  rabelais      illustration  rabelais            francis rabelais  who was born at chinon in       and died at paris in        wandered during those fifty eight years about france and europe  from town to town  from profession to profession  from good to bad and  from bad to good estate  first a monk of the cordeliers  then  with pope  clement vii  s authority  a benedictine  then putting off the monk s  habit and assuming that of a secular priest in order to roam the world    incurring   as he himself says   in this vagabond life  the double  stigma of suspension from orders and apostasy   then studying medicine at  montpellier  then medical officer of the great hospital at lyons  but   before long  superseded in that office  for having been twice absent  without leave   then staying at lyons as a corrector of proofs  a  compiler of almanacs  an editor of divers books for learned patrons  and  commencing the publication of his  vie tres horrifique du grand  gargantua  pere de pantagruel   most horrifying life of the great  gargantua  father of pantagruel   which was immediately proceeded against  by the sorbonne  as an obscene tale    on grounds of prudence or  necessity rabelais then quitted lyons and set out for rome as physician  attached to the household of cardinal john du bellay  bishop of paris and  envoy from france to the holy see  the which bishop  having relished the  profound learning and competence of rabelais  and having  besides   discovered in him fine humor and a conversation capable of diverting the  blackest melancholy  retained him near his person in the capacity of  physician in ordinary to himself and all his family  and held him ever  afterwards in high esteem    after two years passed at rome  and after  rendering all sorts of service in his patron s household  rabelais    feeling that the uproarious life he was leading and his licentious deeds  were unworthy of a man of religion and a priest   asked pope paul iii   for absolution  and at the same time permission to resume the habit of  st  benedict  and to practise  for piety s sake  without hope of gain and  in any and every place   the art of medicine  wherein he had taken  he  said  the degrees of bachelor  licentiate  and doctor   a brief of pope  paul iii  s  dated january           granted his request   seventeen  months afterwards  on the   d of may        rabelais reappears at  montpellier  and there receives  it is said  the degree of doctor  which  he had already taken upon himself to assume   he pursues his life of  mingled science and adventure  gives lessons  and gads about so much that   his doctor s gown and cap are preserved at montpellier  according to  tradition  all dirty and torn  but objects of respectful reminiscence    in      rabelais leaves montpellier  and goes to practise medicine at  narbonne  castres  and lyons   in      he tires of it  resumes  as he had  authority to do  the habit of a canon of st  maur  and settles in that  residence   a paradise   as he himself says   of salubrity  amenity   serenity  convenience  and all the chaste pleasures of agriculture and  country life    between      and      he is  nevertheless  found once  more wandering  far away from this paradise  in france  italy  and   perhaps  england  he completes and publishes  under his own name  the   faits et dicts heroiques de pantagruel   and obtains from francis i  a  faculty for the publication of  these two volumes not less useful than  delightful  which the printers had corrupted and perverted in many  passages  to the great displeasure and detriment of the author  and to  the prejudice of readers    the work made a great noise  the sorbonne  resolved to attack it  in spite of the king s approbation  but francis i   died on the   st of march         rabelais relapsed into his life of  embarrassment and vagabondage  on leaving france he had recourse  first  at metz and afterwards in italy  to the assistance of his old and ever  well disposed patron  cardinal john du bellay   on returning to france he  obtained from the new king  henry ii   a fresh faculty for the printing  of his books  in greek  latin  and tuscan   and  almost at the same time   on the   th of january        cardinal du bellay  bishop of paris   conferred upon him the cure of st  martin at meudon   which he  discharged   says his biographer colletet   with all the sincerity  all  the uprightness  and all the charity that can be expected of a man who  wishes to do his duty  and to the satisfaction of his flock    nevertheless  when the new holder of the cure at meudon  shortly after  his installation  made up his mind to publish the fourth book of the   faits et dicts heroiques du bon pantagruel   the work was censured by  the sorbonne and interdicted by decree of parliament  and authority to  offer it for sale was not granted until  on the  th of february         rabelais had given in his resignation of his cure at meudon  and of  another cure which he possessed  under the title of benefice  in the  diocese of le mans   he retired in bad health to paris  where he died  shortly afterwards  in        in rue des jardins  parish of st  paul  in  the cemetery whereof he was interred   says colletet   close to a large  tree which was still to be seen a few years ago      such a life  this constant change of position  profession  career  taste   patron  and residence  bore a strong resemblance to what we should  nowadays call a bohemian life  and everything shows that rabelais   habits  without being scandalous  were not more regular or more dignified  than his condition in the world   had we no precise and personal  information about him in this respect  still his literary work    gargantua and pantagruel   would not leave us in any doubt  there is no  printed book  sketch  conversation  or story  which is more coarse and  cynical  and which testifies  whether as regards the author or the public  for whom the work is intended  to a more complete and habitual  dissoluteness in thought  morals  and language   there is certainly no  ground for wondering that the sorbonne  in proceeding against the  vie  tres horrifique du grand gargantua  pere de pantagruel   should have  described it as  an obscene tale   and the whole part of panurge  the  brilliant talker of the tale           take him for all in all the best boy in the world      fully justifies the sorbonne   but  by way of striking contrast  at the  same time that the works of rabelais attest the irregularity of men s  lives and minds  they also reveal the great travail that is going on and  the great progress that has already been made in the intellectual  condition of his day  in the influence of natural and legitimate  feelings  and in the appreciation of men s mutual rights and duties   sixty two years ago m  guizot published  in a periodical collection  entitled  annales de l education   a study of rabelais  ideas compared  with the practice and routine of his day in respect of education  an  important question in the sixteenth as it is in the nineteenth century   it will be well to quote here from that study certain fragments which  will give some notion of what new ideas and tendencies were making their  way into the social life of france  and were coincident with that great  religious and political ferment which was destined to reach  bursting point in the reign of francis i   and to influence for nearly  a century the fortunes of france      it was no easy matter   were the words used by m  guizot in        to  speak reasonably about education at the time when rabelais wrote   there  was then no idea of home education and the means of rendering it  practicable   as to public education  there was no extensive range and  nothing really useful to the community in the instruction received by  children at college  no justice and no humanity in the treatment they  experienced  a fruitless and ridiculously prolonged study of words  succeeded by a no less fruitless study of interminable subtilties  and  all this fruitless knowledge driven into the brains of children by help  of chastisements  blows  and that barbarous severity which seems to  regard the  compelle intrare  as the principal law and object of  instruction   how proceed  in such a state of things  to conceive a plan  of liberal  gentle  and reasonable education   rabelais  in his book   had begun by avoiding the danger of directly shocking received ideas   by transporting both himself and his heroes to the regions of imagination  and extravagance he had set himself at liberty to bring them up in quite  a different fashion than that of his times  the rectors of colleges could  not pretend that pantagruel  who was hardly born before he sucked down at  every meal the milk of four thousand six hundred cows  and for whose  first shirt there had been cut nine hundred ells of chatellerault linen   was a portrait of any of the little boys who trembled at their ferules          pantagruel is in his cradle  he is bound and swathed in it like  all children at that time  but  ere long  gargantua  his father   perceives that these bands are constraining his movements  and that he is  making efforts to burst there  he immediately  by advice of the princes  and lords present  orders the said shackles to be undone  and lo   pantagruel is no longer uneasy            and thus became he big and  strong full early            there came  however  the time when his  instruction must begin    my will   said gargantua   is to hand him over  to some learned man for to indoctrinate him according to his capacity   and to spare nothing to that end    he  accordingly  put pantagruel under  a great teacher  who began by bringing him up after the fashion of those  times   he taught him his charte  alphabet  to such purpose that he could  say it by heart backwards  and he was five years and three months about  it   then he read with him donotus and facetus  old elementary works on  latin grammar   and he was thirteen years  six months  and two weeks over  that   then he read with him the de modis significandi  with the  commentaries of hurtebisius  fasquin  and a heap of others  and he was  more than eighteen years and eleven months over them  and knew them so  well that he proved on his fingers to his mother that  de modis  signifieandi non erat scientia    after so much labor and so many years   what did pantagruel know   gargantua was no bigot  he did not shut his  eyes that he might not see  and he believed what his eyes told him   he  saw that pantagruel worked very hard and spent all his time at it  and  yet he got no good by it   and what was worse  he was becoming daft   silly  dreamy  and besotted through it   so pantagruel was taken away  from his former masters and handed over to ponocrates  a teacher of quite  a different sort  who was bidden to take him to paris to make a new  creature of him and complete his education there   ponocrates was very  careful not to send him to any college   rabelais  as it appears  had a  special aversion for montaigu college    tempeste   says he   was a great  boy flogger at montaigu college   if for flogging poor little children   unoffending school boys  pedagogues are damned  he  upon my word of  honor  is now on ixion s wheel  flogging the dock tailed cur that turns  it    pantagruel s education was now humane and gentle   accordingly he  soon took pleasure in the work which ponocrates was at the pains of  rendering interesting to him by the very nature and the variety of the  subjects of it            is it not a very remarkable phenomenon that at  such a time and in such a condition of public instruction a man should  have had sufficient sagacity not only to regard the natural sciences as  one of the principal subjects of study which ought to be included in a  course of education  but further to make the observation of nature the  basis of that study  to fix the pupil s attention upon examination of  facts  and to impress upon him the necessity of applying his knowledge by  studying those practical arts and industries which profit by such  applications   that  however  rabelais did  probably by dint of sheer  good sense  and without having any notion himself about the wide bearing  of his ideas   ponocrates took pantagruel through a course of what we  should nowadays call practical study of the exact and natural sciences as  they were understood in the sixteenth century  but  at the same time  far  from forgetting the moral sciences  he assigns to them  for each day  a  definite place and an equally practical character    as soon as  pantagruel was up   he says   some page or other of the sacred scripture  was read with him aloud and distinctly  with pronunciation suited to the  subject            in accordance with the design and purport of this  lesson  he at frequent intervals devoted himself to doing reverence and  saying prayers to the good god  whose majesty and marvellous judgments  were shown forth in what was read            when evening came  he and  his teacher briefly recapitulated together  after the manner of the  pythagoreans  all that he had read  seen  learned  and heard in the  course of the whole day   they prayed to god the creator  worshipping  him  glorifying him for his boundless goodness  giving him thanks for all  the time that was past  and commending themselves to his divine mercy for  all that was to come   this done  they went to their rest    and at the  end of this course of education  so complete both from the worldly and  the religious point of view  rabelais shows us young pantagruel living in  affectionate and respectful intimacy with his father gargantua  who  as  he sees him off on his travels  gives him these last words of advice   science without conscience is nought but ruin to the soul  it behooves  thee to serve  love  and fear god   have thou in suspicion the abuses of  the world  set not thine heart on vanity  for this life is transitory   but the word of god abideth forever  reverence thy teachers  flee the  company of those whom thou wouldest not resemble            and when thou  feelest sure that thou hast acquired all that is to be learned yonder   return to me that i may see thee and give thee my blessing ere i die       after what was said above about the personal habits and the works of  rabelais  these are certainly not the ideas  sentiments  and language one  would expect to find at the end and as the conclusion of his life and his  book   and it is precisely on account of this contrast that more space  has been accorded in this history to the man and his book than would in  the natural course of things have been due to them   at bottom and   beyond their mere appearances the life and the book of rabelais are a  true and vivid reflection of the moral and social ferment characteristic  of his time   a time of innovation and of obstruction  of corruption and  of regeneration  of decay and of renaissance  all at once   a deeply  serious crisis in a strong and complicated social system  which had been  hitherto exposed to the buffets and the risks of brute force  but was  intellectually full of life and aspiration  was in travail of a double  yearning for reforming itself and setting itself in order  and did  indeed  in the sixteenth century  attempt at one and the same time a  religious and a political reformation  the object whereof  missed as it  was at that period  is still at the bottom of all true frenchmen s trials  and struggles   this great movement of the sixteenth century we are now  about to approach  and will attempt to fix its character with precision  and mark the imprint of its earliest steps             chapter xxx     francis i  and the reformation     nearly half a century before the reformation made any noise in france it  had burst out with great force and had established its footing in  germany  switzerland  and england   john huss and jerome of prague  both  born in bohemia  one in      and the other in       had been condemned as  heretics and burned at constance  one in      and the other in       by  decree and in the presence of the council which had been there assembled   but  at the commencement of the sixteenth century  luther in germany and  zwingle in switzerland had taken in hand the work of the reformation  and  before half that century had rolled by they had made the foundations of  their new church so strong that their powerful adversaries  with charles  v  at their head  felt obliged to treat with them and recognize their  position in the european world  though all the while disputing their  right   in england  henry viii   under the influence of an unbridled  passion  as all his passions were  for anna boleyn  had  in       broken  with the church of rome  whose pope  clement vii   refused very properly  to pronounce him divorced from his wife catherine of aragon  and the king  had proclaimed himself the spiritual head of the english church without  meeting either amongst his clergy or in his kingdom with any effectual  opposition   thus in these three important states of western europe the  reformers had succeeded  and the religious revolution was in process of  accomplishment      illustration  the first protestants            in france it was quite otherwise   not that  there too  there were not  amongst christians profound dissensions and ardent desires for religious  reform   we will dwell directly upon its explosion  its vicissitudes  and  its characteristics   but france did not contain  as germany did  several  distinct states  independent and pretty strong  though by no means  equally so  which could offer to the different creeds a secure asylum   and could form one with another coalitions capable of resisting the head  of that incohesive coalition which was called the empire of germany   in  the sixteenth century  on the contrary  the unity of the french monarchy  was established  and it was all  throughout its whole extent  subject to  the same laws and the same master  as regarded the religious bodies as  well as the body politic   in this monarchy  however  there did not  happen to be  at the date of the sixteenth century  a sovereign audacious  enough and powerful enough to gratify his personal passions at the cost  of embroiling himself  like henry viii   with the spiritual head of  christendom  and  from the mere desire for a change of wife  to change  the regimen of the church in his dominions   francis i   on the contrary   had scarcely ascended the throne when  by abolishing the pragmatic  sanction and signing the concordat of       he attached himself more  closely to the papacy   the nascent reformation  then  did not meet in  france with either of the two important circumstances  politically  considered  which in germany and in england rendered its first steps more  easy and more secure   it was in the cause of religious creeds alone  and  by means of moral force alone  that she had to maintain the struggles in  which she engaged     at the beginning of the sixteenth century  there lived  at a small castle  near gap in dauphiny  in the bosom of a noble and unostentatiously pious  family  a young man of ardent imagination  fiery temperament  and  energetic character  who shared his relatives  creeds and joined in their  devotions  but grew weary of the monotony of his thoughts and of his  life   william farel heard talk of another young man  his contemporary  and neighbor  peter du terrail  even now almost famous under the name of  bayard    such sons   was said in his hearing   are as arrows in the hand  of a giant  blessed is he who has his quiver full of them    young farel  pressed his father to let him go too and make himself a man in the world   the old gentleman would willingly have permitted his son to take up such  a life as bayard s  but it was towards the university of paris   that  mother of all the sciences  that pure and shining mirror of the faith    that the young man s aspirations were directed   the father at first  opposed  but afterwards yielded to his wishes  and  about       william  farel quitted gap and arrived at paris   the questions raised by the  councils of bale and florence  and by the semi political   semi ecclesiastical assembly at tours  which had been convoked by louis  xii   the instruction at the parisian university  and the attacks of the  sorbonne on the study of greek and hebrew  branded as heresy  were  producing a lively agitation in the public mind   a doctor of theology   already advanced in years  of small stature  of mean appearance  and of  low origin  jacques lefevre by name  born at etaples in picardy  had for  seventeen years filled with great success a professorship in the  university    amongst many thousands of men   said erasmus   you will not  find any of higher integrity and more versed in polite letters     he is  very fond of me   wrote zwingle about him   he is perfectly open and  good  he argues  he sings  he plays  and be laughs with me at the follies  of the world    some circumstance or other brought the young student and  the old scholar together  they liked one another  and soon became  friends   farel was impressed by his master s devotion as well as  learning  he saw him on his knees at church praying fervently  and    never   said he   had i seen a chanter of mass who chanted it with  deeper reverence    but this old fashioned piety did not interfere at all  with the freedom of the professor s ideas and conversations touching  either the abuses or the doctrines of the church    how shameful it is    he would say   to see a bishop soliciting people to drink with him   caring for nought but gaming  constantly handling the dice and the  dice box  constantly hunting  hallooing after birds and game  frequenting  bad houses            religion has but one foundation  but one end  but  one head  jesus christ blessed forever  he alone trod the wine press   let us not  then  call ourselves by the name of st  paul  or apollos  or  st  peter    these free conversations worked  not all at once  but none  the less effectually  upon those who heard them    the end was   says  farel   that little by little the papacy slipped from its place in my  heart  it did not come down at the first shock    at the same time that  he thus talked with his pupils  lefevre of etaples published a commentary  on the epistles of st  paul  and then a commentary on the gospels    christians   said he   are those only who love jesus christ and his word   may everything be illumined with his light   through it may there be a  return of times like those of that primitive church which devoted to  jesus christ so many martyrs   may the lord of the harvest  foreseeing a  new harvest  send new and diligent laborers            my dear william    he added  turning to farel and taking his hand   god will renew the  world  and you will see it      it was not only professors and pupils  scholars grown old in meditation  and young folks eager for truth  liberty  action  and renown  who  welcomed passionately those boundless and undefined hopes  those  yearnings towards a brilliant and at the same time a vague future  at  which they looked forward  according to the expression used by lefevre  of etaples to farel  to a  renewal of the world    men holding a social  position very different from that of the philosophers  men with minds  formed on an acquaintance with facts and in the practice of affairs   took part in this intellectual and religious ferment  and protected and  encouraged its fervent adherents   william briconnet  bishop of meaux  a  prelate who had been louis xii  s ambassador to pope julius ii   and one  amongst the negotiators of francis i  s concordat with leo x   opened his  diocese to the preachers and writers recommended to him by his friend  lefevre of staples  and supported them in their labors for the  translation and propagation  amongst the people  of the holy scriptures   they had at court  and near the king s own person  the avowed support of  his sister  princess marguerite  who was beautiful  sprightly  affable   kind  disposed towards all lofty and humane sentiments as well as all  intellectual pleasures  and an object of the sometimes rash attentions of  the most eminent and most different men of her time  charles v   the  constable de bourbon  admiral bonnivet  and clement marot   marguerite   who was married to the duke d alencon  widowed in       and married a  second time  in       to henry d albret  king of navarre  was all her  life at pau and at nerac  as well as at paris  a centre  a focus of  social  literary  religious  and political movement    the king her  brother loved her dearly   says brantome   and always called her his  darling         very often  when he had important business  he left it to  her  waiting for her definitive and conclusive decision      illustration  the castle of pau            the ambassadors who talked with her were enchanted by her  and always  went to see her after having paid their first ambassadorial visit   she  had so great a regard and affection for the king  that when she heard of  his dangerous illness she said   whosoever shall come to my door  and  announce to me the recovery of the king my brother  such courier  should  he be tired  and worn out  and muddy  and dirty  i will go and kiss and  embrace as if he were the sprucest prince and gentleman of france  and   should he be in want of a bed and unable to find one whereon to rid him  of his weariness  i would give him mine  and i would rather lie on the  hard  for the good news he brought me            she was suspected of  inclining to the religion of luther  but she never made any profession or  sign thereof  and  if she believed it  she kept it in her heart very  secret  inasmuch as the king did hate it sorely              the heresy  was seen glimmering here and there   says another contemporary witness   florimond de raimond in his  histoire de l heresie     but it appeared  and disappeared like a nightly meteor which has but a flickering  brightness    at bottom this reserve was quite in conformity with the  mental condition of that class  or as one might he inclined to say  that  circle of reformers at court   luther and zwingle had distinctly declared  war on the papacy  henry viii  had with a flourish separated england from  the romish church  marguerite de valois and bishop briconnet neither  wished nor demanded so much  they aspired no further than to reform the  abuses of the romish church by the authority of that church itself  in  concert with its heads and according to its traditional regimen  they had  no idea of more than dealing kindly  and even sympathetically  with the  liberties and the progress of science and human intelligence   confined  within these limits  the idea was legitimate and honest enough  but it  showed want of foresight  and was utterly vain   when  whether in state  or church  the vices and defects of government have lasted for ages and  become habits not only inveterate but closely connected with powerful  personal interests  a day at last comes when the deplorable result is  seen in pig headedness and weakness   then there is an explosion of  deep seated and violent shocks  from which infinitely more is expected  than they can accomplish  and which  even when they are successful  cost  the people very dear  for their success is sullied and incomplete   a  certain amount of good government and general good sense is a necessary  preface and preparation for any good sort of reform   happy the nations  who are spared by their wisdom or their good fortune the cruel trial of  only obtaining such reforms as they need when they have been reduced to  prosecute them beneath the slings and arrows of outrageous revolution   christian france in the sixteenth century was not so favorably situated     during the first years of francis i  s reign  from      to       young  and ardent reformers  such as william farel and his friends  were but  isolated individuals  eager after new ideas and studies  very favorable  towards all that came to them from germany  but without any consistency  yet as a party  and without having committed any striking act of  aggression against the roman church   nevertheless they were even then   so far as the heads and the devoted adherents of that church were  concerned  objects of serious disquietude and jealous supervision      illustration  william farel            the sorbonne  in particular  pronounced vehemently against them   luther  and his progress were beginning to make a great noise in france   after  his discussion with dr  eck at leipzig in      he had consented to take  for judges the universities of erfurt and paris  on the   th of january         the quoestor of the nation of france bought twenty copies of  luther s conference with dr  eck to distribute amongst the members of his  committee  the university gave more than a year to its examination    all  europe   says crevier   was waiting for the decision of the university of  paris    whenever an incident occurred or a question arose   we shall  see   said they of the sorbonne   what sort of folks hold to luther   why  that fellow is worse than luther    in april        the university  solemnly condemned luther s writings  ordering that they should be  publicly burned  and that the author should be compelled to retract   the  syndic of the sorbonne  noel bedier  who  to give his name a classical  twang  was called  beda   had been the principal and the most eager actor  in this procedure  he was a theologian full of subtlety  obstinacy   harshness  and hatred    in a single beda there are three thousand  monks   erasmus used to say of him   the syndic had at court two powerful  patrons  the king s mother  louise of savoy  and the chancellor  duprat   both decided enemies of the reformers   louise of savoy  in consequence  of her licentious morals and her thirst for

ceased  between the reformers and their adversaries  a jacobin monk  de roma by  name  was conversing one day at meaux with farel and his friends  the  reformers expressed the hopes they had in the propagation of the gospel   de roma all at once stood up  shouting   then i and all the rest of the  brotherhood will preach a crusade we will stir up the people  and if the  king permits the preaching of your gospel  we will have him expelled by  his own subjects from his own kingdom    fanatical passions were already  at work  though the parties were too unequal as yet to come to actual  force     against such passions the reformers found francis i  a very indecisive  and very inefficient protector    i wish   said he   to give men of  letters special marks of my favor    when deputies from the sorbonne came  and requested him to put down the publication of learned works taxed with  heresy   i do not wish   he replied   to have those folks meddled with   to persecute those who instruct us would be to keep men of ability from  coming to our country    but in spite of his language  orders were given  to the bishops to furnish the necessary funds for the prosecution of  heretics  and  when the charge of heresy became frequent  francis i  no  longer repudiated it    those people   he said   do nothing but bring  trouble into the state    troubles  indeed  in otherwise tranquil  provinces  where the catholic faith was in great force  often accompanied  the expression of those wishes for reform to which the local clergy  themselves considered it necessary to make important concessions   a  serious fire took place at troyes in         it was put down   says m   boutiot  a learned and careful historian of that town   to the account of  the new religious notions  as well as to that of the emperor charles v  s  friends and the constable de bourbon s partisans   as early as      there  had begun to be felt at troyes the first symptoms of repressive measures  directed against the reformation  in             and       provincial  councils were held at meaux  lyons  rouen  bourges  and paris  to oppose  the lutherans   these councils drew up regulations tending to reformation  of morals and of religious ceremonies  they decided that the  administration of the sacraments should take place without any demand for  money  and that preachers  in their sermons  should confine themselves to  the sacred books  and not quote poets or profane authors  they closed the  churches to profane assemblies and burlesques  fetes des fous   they  ordered the parish priests  in their addresses  au prone   to explain the  gospel of the day  they ruled that a stop should be put to the abuses of  excommunication  they interdicted the publication of any book on  religious subjects without the permission of the bishop of the diocese            troyes at that time contained some enlightened men  william bude   budaeus  was in uninterrupted communication

     histoire de la ville de troyes et de la  champagne meridionale   by t   boutiot        t  iii   p         and thus  was going on throughout almost the whole of france  partly in the path of  liberty  partly in that of concessions  partly in that of hardships  the  work of the reformation  too weak as yet and too disconnected to engage  to any purpose in a struggle  but even now sufficiently wide spread and  strong to render abortive any attempt to strangle it     the defeat at pavia and the captivity of francis i  at madrid placed the  governing power for thirteen months in the hands of the most powerful  foes of the reformation  the regent louise of savoy and the chancellor  duprat   they used it unsparingly  with the harsh indifference of  politicians who will have  at any price  peace within their dominions and  submission to authority   it was under their regimen that there took  place the first martyrdom decreed and executed in france upon a partisan  of the reformation for an act of aggression and offence against the  catholic church   john leclerc  a wool carder at meaux  seeing a bull  of indulgences affixed to the door of meaux cathedral  had torn it down   and substituted for it a placard in which the pope was described as  antichrist   having been arrested on the spot  he was  by decree of the  parliament of paris  whipped publicly  three days consecutively  and  branded on the forehead by the hangman in the presence of his mother  who  cried   jesus christ forever    he was banished  and retired in july         to metz  and there he was working at his trade when he heard that a  solemn procession was to take place  next day  in the environs of the  town   in his blind zeal he went and broke down the images at the feet of  which the catholics were to have burned incense   being arrested on his  return to the town  he  far from disavowing the deed  acknowledged it and  gloried in it   he was sentenced to a horrible punishment  his right hand  was cut off  his nose was torn out  pincers were applied to his arms  his  nipples were plucked out  his head was confined in two circlets of  red hot iron  and  whilst he was still chanting  in a loud voice  this  versicle from the cxvth psalm                       their idols are silver and gold                  the work of men s hands      his bleeding and mutilated body was thrown upon the blazing fagots   he  had a younger brother  peter leclerc  a simple wool carder like himself   who remained at meaux  devoted to the same faith and the same cause    great  clerc    says a contemporary chronicler  playing upon his name    who knew no language but that which he had learned from his nurse  but  who  being thoroughly grounded in the holy writings  besides the  integrity of his life  was chosen by the weavers and became the first  minister of the gospel seen in france    an old man of meaux  named  stephen mangin  offered his house  situated near the market place  for  holding regular meetings   forty or fifty of the faithful formed the  nucleus of the little church which grew up   peter leclerc preached and  administered the sacraments in stephen mangin s house so regularly that   twenty years after his brother john s martyrdom  the meetings  composed  partly of believers who flocked in from the neighboring villages  were  from three to four hundred in number   one day when they had celebrated  the lord s supper  the  th of september        the house was surrounded   and nearly sixty persons  men  women  and children  who allowed  themselves to be arrested without making any resistance  were taken   they were all sent before the parliament of paris  fourteen of the men  were sentenced to be burned alive in the great marketplace at meaux  on  the spot nearest to the house in which the crime of heresy had been  committed  and their wives  together with their nearest relatives  were  sentenced to be present at the execution   the men bare headed and the  women ranged beside them individually  in such sort that they might be  distinguished amongst the rest    the decree was strictly carried out      illustration  burning of reformers at meaux            it costs a pang to recur to these hideous exhibitions  but it must be  done  for history not only has a right  but is bound to do justice upon  the errors and crimes of the past  especially when the past had no idea  of guilt in the commission of them   a wit of the last century   champfort  used to say   there is nothing more dangerous than an honest  man engaged in a rascally calling    there is nothing more dangerous than  errors and crimes of which the perpetrators do not see the absurd and  odious character   the contemporary historian  sleidan  says  expressly    the common people in france hold that there are no people more wicked  and criminal that heretics  generally  as long as they are a prey to the  blazing fagots  the people around them are excited to frenzy and curse  them in the midst of their torments    the sixteenth century is that  period of french history at which this intellectual and moral blindness  cost france  their idols are silver and gold  the work of men s hands      most dear  it supplied the bad passions of men with a means  of which  they amply availed themselves  of gratifying then without scruple and  without remorse  if  in the early part of this century  the reformation  was as yet without great leaders  it was not  nevertheless  amongst only  the laborers  the humble and the poor  that it found confessors and  martyrs   the provincial nobility  the burgesses of the towns  the  magistracy  the bar  the industrial classes as well as the learned  even  then furnished their quota of devoted and faithful friends   a nobleman   a picard by birth  born about      at passy  near paris  where he  generally lived  louis de berquin by name  was one of the most  distinguished of them by his social position  his elevated ideas   his learning  the purity of his morals  and the dignity of his life   possessed of a patrimonial estate  near abbeville  which brought him in a  modest income of six hundred crowns a year  and a bachelor  he devoted  himself to study and to religious matters with independence of mind and  with a pious heart    most faithfully observant   says erasmus   of the  ordinances and rites of the church  to wit  prescribed fasts  holy days   forbidden meats  masses  sermons  and  in a word  all  that tends to  piety  he strongly reprobated the doctrines of luther    he was none the  less  in       denounced to the parliament of paris as being on the side  of the reformers   he had books  it was said  he even composed them  himself on questions of faith  and he had been engaged in some sort of  dispute with the theologian william de coutance  head of harcourt  college      illustration  erasmus            the attorney general of the parliament ordered one of his officers to go  and make an examination of berquin s books as well as papers  and to  seize what appeared to him to savor of heresy   the officer brought away  divers works of luther  melancthon  and carlostadt  and some original  treatises of berquin himself  which were deposited in the keeping of the  court   the theological faculty claimed to examine them as being within  their competence   on being summoned by the attorney general  berquin  demanded to be present when an inventory was made of his books or  manuscripts  and to give such explanations as he should deem necessary   and his request was granted without question   on the   th of june         the commissioners of the sorbonne made their report   on the  th of july   peter lizet  king s advocate  read it out to the court   the matter came  on again for hearing on the  st of august   berquin was summoned and  interrogated  and  as the result of this interrogatory  was arrested and  carried off to imprisonment at the conciergerie in the square tower   on  the  th of august sentence was pronounced  and louis de berquin was  remanded to appear before the bishop of paris  as being charged with  heresy   in which case   says the journal d un bourgeois de paris   he  would have been in great danger of being put to death according to law   as he had well deserved    the public were as ready as the accusers to  believe in the crime and to impatiently await its punishment     it was not without surprise or without displeasure that  on the  th of  august  just as they had  made over to the bishop of paris  present and  accepting  the prisoner confined in the conciergerie  the members of the  council chamber observed the arrival of captain frederic  belonging to  the archers of the king s guard  and bringing a letter from the king  who  changed the venue in berquin s case so as to decide it himself at his  grand council  in consequence of which the prisoner would have to be  handed over  not to the bishop  but to the king   the chamber  remonstrated  berquin was no longer their prisoner  the matter had been  decided  it was the bishop to whom application must be made   but these  remonstrances had been foreseen  the captain had verbal instructions to  carry off louis de berquin by force in case of a refusal to give him up   the chamber decided upon handing over the bishop s prisoner to the king   contenting themselves with causing the seized books and manuscripts to be  burned that very day in the space in front of notre dame   it was whilst  repairing to the scene of war in italy  and when he was just entering  melun  where he merely passed through  that the king had given this  unexpected order  on the very day  august    on which the parliament  pronounced the decree which sent berquin to appear before the bishop of  paris   there is no clear trace of the vigilant protect  or who had so  closely watched the proceedings against berquin  and so opportunely  appealed for the king s interference   in any incident of this sort there  is a temptation to presume that the influence was that of princess  marguerite  but it is not certain that she was at this time anywhere near  the king  perhaps john du bellay  bishop of bayonne  acted for her   francis i  was  moreover  disposed to extend protection  of his own  accord  to gentlemen and scholars against furious theologians  when the  latter were not too formidable for him   however that may be  berquin  on  becoming the king s prisoner  was summoned before the chancellor  duprat   who  politely reproaching him with having disquieted the church  confined  himself to requesting that he would testify some regret for it   berquin  submitted with a good grace  and  being immediately set at liberty  left  paris and repaired to his estate in picardy     whilst he there resumed his life of peaceful study  the parliament  continued to maintain in principle and openly proclaim its right of  repression against heretics   on the   th of august        it caused  notice to be given  by sound of trumpet  throughout the whole of paris   that clergy and laymen were to deposit in the keeping of the palace all  luther s books that they possessed   laymen who did not comply with this  order would have their property confiscated  clergymen would be deprived  of their temporalities and banished   toleration  in a case of suspected  heresy  was an act of the king s which itself required toleration   proceedings against heresy remained the law of the land  constantly  hanging over every head     eighteen months later  in may        there seemed to be no further  thought about berquin  but the battle of pavia was lost  francis i  was a  prisoner at madrid  louise of savoy and the chancellor  duprat  wielded  the power   the question of heretics again came to the front    the queen  must be told   said peter lizet  king s advocate   as st  gregory told  brunehaut  queen of the franks  that the best way of driving away the  enemies of the kingdom is to drive away from it the enemies of god and  his spouse  the church    on the   th of april        on occasion of  giving the regent some counsel as to her government  the parliament  strongly recommended her to take proceedings against the heretics    the  court   they said to her   has before now passed several provisional  decrees against the guilty  which have not been executed because of the  evil disposition of the times and the hinderances effected by the  delinquents  who have found means of suspending and delaying the  judgments given against them  as well by transference of the venue to the  grand council as by seizure and removal of certain of them  prisoners at  the time  whom they have had withdrawn from their prisons by exercise of  sovereign and absolute power  which has given the rest occasion and  boldness to follow the evil doctrine    it was impossible to reproach the  king more broadly with having set berquin at liberty   the parliament  further advised the regent to ask the pope to send over to france  pontifical delegates invested with his own powers to watch and to try in  his name  even archbishops  bishops  and abbots  who by their deeds   writings  or discourses  should render themselves suspected of a leaning  towards heresy    louise of savoy  without any appearance of being hurt  by the attack made by the parliament on the acts of the king her son   eagerly followed the advice given her  and on the   th of may         clement vii   in his turn  eagerly appointed four delegates commissioned  to try all those suspected of heresy  who  in case of condemnation  were  to be left to the secular arm   on the very day on which the pope  appointed his delegates  the faculty of theology at paris passed censure  upon divers writings of erasmus  translated and spread abroad in france  by berquin  and on the  th of january        the bishop of amiens  demanded of the parliament authority  to order the body to be seized of  louis de berquin  who resided in his diocese and was scandalizing it by  his behavior    the parliament authorized his arrest  and  on the   th of  january  berquin was once more a prisoner in the conciergerie  at the  same time that orders were given to seize all his books and papers   whether at his own house or at that of his friend the lord of rambure at  abbeville   the great trial of berquin for heresy was recommenced  and in  it the great name of erasmus was compromised     when the question was thus solemnly reopened  berquin s defenders were  much excited   defenders  we have said  but  in truth  history names but  one  the princess marguerite  who alone showed any activity  and alone  did anything to the purpose   she wrote at once to the king  who was  still at madrid  my desire to obey your commands was sufficiently strong  without having it redoubled by the charity you have been pleased to show  to poor berquin according to your promise  i feel sure that he for whom i  believe him to have suffered will approve of the mercy which  for his  honor  you have had upon his servant and yours    francis i  had  in  fact  written to suspend until his return the proceedings against  berquin  as well as those against lefevre  roussel  and all the other  doctors suspected of heresy   the regent transmitted the king s orders to  the pope s delegates  who presented themselves on the   th of february  before the parliament to ask its advice    the king is as badly advised  as he himself is good   said the dean of the faculty of theology   the  parliament answered that  for a simple letter missive  it could not  adjourn  it must have a letter patent  and it went on with the trial   berquin presented several demands for delay  evidently in order to wait  for the king s return and personal intervention   the court refused them   and  on the  th of march        the judgment was read to him in his  prison at the conciergerie   it was to the effect that his books should  be again burned before his eyes  that he should declare his approval of  so just a sentence  and that he should earn the compassion of the church  by not refusing her any satisfaction she might demand  else he should  himself go to the stake     whilst berquin s trial was thus coming to an end  francis i  was entering  france once more in freedom  crying   so i am king again    during the  latter days of march  amongst the numerous personages who came to  congratulate him was john de selve  premier president of the parliament  of paris   the king gave him a very cold reception    my lords   wrote  the premier president to his court   i heard  through m  de selve  my  nephew  about some displeasure that was felt as regards our body  and i  also perceived it myself   i have already begun to speak of it to madame   the king s mother    i will do  as i am bound to  my duty towards the  court  with god s help    on the  st of april the king  who intended to  return by none but slow stages to paris  wrote from mont de marsan  to  the judges holding his court of parliament at paris        we have presently been notified how that  notwithstanding that  through  our dear and much loved lady and mother  regent in france during our  absence  it was written unto you and ordered that you would be pleased  not to proceed in any way whatever with the matter of sieur berquin   lately detained a prisoner  until we should have been enabled to return  to this our kingdom  you have  nevertheless  at the request and pursuance  of his ill wishers  so far proceeded with his business that you have come  to a definitive judgment on it   whereat we cannot be too much astounded            for this cause we do will and command and enjoin upon you       that you are not to proceed to execution of the said judgment  which  as  the report is  you have pronounced against the said berquin  but shall  put him  himself and the depositions and the proceedings in his said  trial  in such safe keeping that you may be able to answer to us for  them            and take care that you make no default therein  for we do  warn you that  if default there be  we shall look to such of you as shall  seem good to us to answer to us for it      here was not only a letter patent  but a letter minatory   as to the  execution of their judgment  the parliament obeyed the king s injunction   maintaining  however  the principle as well as the legality of berquin s  sentence  and declaring that they awaited the king s orders to execute  it    according to the teaching of the two testaments   they said   god  ever rageth  in his just wrath  against the nations who fail to enforce  respect for the laws prescribed by himself   it is important  moreover   to hasten the event in order as soon as possible to satisfy   independently of god  the people who murmur and whose impatience is  becoming verily troublesome    francis i  did not reply   he would not  have dared  even in thought  to attack the question of principle as to  the chastisement of heresy  and he was afraid of weakening his own  authority too much if he humiliated his parliament too much  it was  sufficient for him that he might consider berquin s life to be safe   kings are protectors who are easily satisfied when their protection  to  be worth anything  might entail upon them the necessity of an energetic  struggle and of self compromise    trust not in princes nor their  children   said lord strafford  after the psalmist   nolite confidere  principibus et filiis eorum  quia non est sales in illis   ps  cxlvi     when  in the seventeenth century  he found that charles i  was abandoning  him to the english parliament and the executioner   louis de berquin  might have felt similar distrust as to francis i   but his nature was  confident and hopeful  when he knew of the king s letter to the  parliament  he considered himself safe  and he testified as much to  erasmus in a long letter  in which he told him the story of his trial   and alluded to  the fresh outbreak of anger on the part of those hornets  who accuse me of heresy   said he   simply because i have translated into  the vulgar tongue some of your little works  wherein they pretend that  they have discovered the most monstrous pieces of impiety    he  transmitted to erasmus a list of the paragraphs which the pope s  delegates had condemned  pressing him to reply   as you well know how   the king esteems you much  and will esteem you still more when  you have heaped confusion on this brood of benighted theologians whose  ineptitude is no excuse for their violence    by a strange coincidence   berquin s most determined foe  noel beda  provost of the sorbonne  sent  at the same time to erasmus a copy of more than two hundred propositions  which had been extracted from his works  and against which he  beda  also  came forward as accuser   erasmus was a prudent man  and did not seek  strife  but when he was personally and offensively attacked by enemies  against whom he was conscious of his strength  he exhibited it proudly  and ably  and he replied to beda by denouncing him  on the  th of june   to the parliament of paris itself  as an impudent and ignorant  calumniator   his letter  read at the session of parliament on the  th of  july        was there listened to with profound deference  and produced a  sensation which did not remain without effect  in vain did beda persist  in accusing erasmus of heresy and in maintaining that he was of the  brotherhood of luther  parliament considered him in the wrong   provisionally prohibited the booksellers from vending his libels against  erasmus  and required previous authorization to be obtained for all books  destined for the press by the rectors of the sorbonne     the success of erasmus was also a success for berquin  but he was still  in prison  ill and maltreated   the king wrote on the   th of july to  parliament to demand that he should enjoy at least all the liberties that  the prison would admit of  that he should no longer be detained in an  unhealthy cell  and that he should be placed in that building of the  conciergerie where the court yard was    that   was the answer   would be  a bad precedent  they never put in the court yard convicts who had  incurred the penalty of death    an offer was made to berquin of the  chamber reserved for the greatest personages  for princes of the blood   and of permission to walk in the court yard for two hours a day  one in  the morning and the other in the evening  in the absence of the other  prisoners   neither the king nor berquin was inclined to be content with  these concessions   the king in his irritation sent from beaugency  on  the  th of october  two archers of his guard with a letter to this  effect   it is marvellously strange that what we ordered has not yet been  done   we do command and most expressly enjoin upon you  this once for  all  that you are incontinently to put and deliver the said berquin into  the hands of the said texier and charles do broc  whom we have ordered to  conduct him to our castle of the louvre    the court still objected  a  prisoner favored by so high a personage  it was said  would soon be out  of such a prison   the objection resulted in a formal refusal to obey   the provost of paris  john de la barre  the king s premier gentleman  was  requested to repair to the palace and pay berquin a visit  to ascertain  from himself what could be done for him   berquin  for all that appears   asked for nothing but liberty to read and write    it is not possible    was the reply   such liberty is never granted to those who are condemned  to death    as a great favor  berquin was offered a copy of the letters  of st  jerome and some volumes of history  and the provost had orders not  to omit that fact in his report   the king must be fully assured that the  court do all they can to please him       illustration  berquin released by john de la barre            but it was to no purpose   on the   th of november        the provost of  paris returned to the palace with a letter from the king  formally  commanding him to remove berquin and transfer him to the louvre   the  court again protested that they would not deliver over the said berquin  to the said provost  but  they said   seeing what the times are  the said  provost will be able to find free access to the conciergerie  for to do  there what he hath a mind to    the same day  about six in the evening   john de la barre repaired to the conciergerie  and removed from it louis  de berquin  whom he handed over to the captain of the guard and four  archers  who took him away to the louvre   two months afterwards  in  january        princess marguerite married henry d albret  king of  navarre  and about the same time  though it is difficult to discover the  exact day  louis de berquin issued forth a free man from the louvre  and  the new queen  on taking him at once into her service  wrote to the  constable anne de montmorency  whom the king had charged with the duty of  getting berquin set at liberty   i thank you for the pleasure you have  done me in the matter of poor berquin  whom i esteem as much as if he  were myself  and so you may say that you have delivered me from prison   since i consider in that light the pleasure done to me      marguerite s sympathetic joy was as natural as touching  she must have  thought berquin safe  he was free and in the service of one who was  fundamentally a sovereign prince  though living in france and in  dependence upon the king of france  whose sister he had just married   in france  berquin was under the stigma of having been condemned to death  as a heretic  and was confronted by determined enemies   in so perilous a  position his safety depended upon his courting oblivion   but instead of  that  and consulting only the dictates of his generous and blind  confidence in the goodness of his cause  he resolved to assume the  offensive and to cry for justice against his enemies    beneath the cloak  of religion   he wrote to erasmus   the priests conceal the vilest  passions  the most corrupt morals  and the most scandalous infidelity   it is necessary to rend the veil which covers them  and boldly bring an  accusation of impiety against the sorbonne  rome  and all their  flunkies    erasmus  justly alarmed  used all his influence to deter him   but  the more confidence he showed   says he   the more i feared for him   i wrote to him frequently  begging him to get quit of the case by some  expedient  or even to withdraw himself on the pretext of a royal  ambassadorship obtained by the influence of his friends   i told him that  the theologians would probably  as time went on  let his affair drop  but  that they would never admit themselves to be guilty of impiety   i told  him to always bear in mind what a hydra was that beda  and at how many  mouths he belched forth venom  i told him to reflect well that he was  about to commit himself with a foe that was immortal  for a faculty never  dies  and to rest assured that after having brought three monks to bay   he would have to defend himself against numerous legions  not only  opulent and powerful  but  besides  very dishonest and very experienced  in the practice of every kind of cheatery  who would never rest until  they had effected his ruin  were his cause as just as christ s   i told  him not to trust too much to the king s protection  the favor of princes  being unstable and their affections easily alienated by the artifices of  informers            and if all this could not move him  i told him not  to involve me in his business  for  with his permission  i was not at all  inclined to get into any tangle with legions of monks and a whole faculty  of theology   but i did not succeed in convincing him  whilst i argued in  so many ways to deter him from his design  i did nothing but excite his  courage      not only did berquin turn a deaf ear to the wise counsels of erasmus  but  his protectress  marguerite  being moved by his courage  and herself also  as imprudent as she was generous  persuaded herself that he was in the  right  and supported him in his undertaking   she wrote to the king her  brother   poor berquin  who  through your goodness  holds that god has  twice preserved his life  throws himself upon you  having no longer any  one to whom he can have recourse  for to give you to understand his  innocence  and whereas  monseigneur  i know the esteem in which you hold  him and the desire he hath always had to do you service  i do not fear to  entreat you  by letter instead of speech  to be pleased to have pity on  him   and if it please you to show signs of taking his matter to heart  i  hope that the truth  which he will make to appear  will convict the  forgers of heretics of being slanderers and disobedient towards you  rather than zealots for the faith      in his complaisance and indifference francis i  attended to his sister s  wishes  and appeared to support berquin in his appeal for a fresh and  definite investigation of his case   on the other hand  parliament  to  whom the matter was referred  showed a disposition to take into account  the king s good will towards berquin  lately convicted  but now become in  his turn plaintiff and accuser    we have no wish to dispute your power    said the president  charles de guillard  to the king at a bed of justice  held on the   th of july         it would be a species of sacrilege  and  we know well that you are above the laws  and that neither laws nor  ordinances can constrain you   your most humble and most obedient court  is comforted and rejoiced at your presence and advent  just as the  apostles were when they saw their god after the resurrection   we are  assured that your will is to be the peculiar protector and defender of  religion  and not to permit or suffer in your kingdom any errors   heresies  or false doctrines      the matter thus reopened pursued its course slowly  twelve judges were  appointed to give a definite decision  and the king himself nominated  six  amongst whom he placed berquin s friend  william bude   various  incidents unconnected with religious disputes supervened

louis xii   with duke hercules  of ferrara  was concluded  and the preparations for its celebration were  going on at fontainebleau  when  on monday  june          the day after  the feast of pentecost   some heretics came by night   says the journal  d un bourgeois de paris   to an image of notre dame de pierre  which is  at a corner of the street behind the church of petit st  antoine  to the  which image they gave several blows with their weapons  and cut off her  head and that of her little child  our lord   but it was never known who  the image breakers were      illustration  heretic iconoclasts            the king  being then at paris  and being advertised thereof  was so wroth  and upset that  it is said  he wept right sore   and  incontinently   during the two days following  he caused it to be proclaimed by sound of  trumpet throughout the cross roads of the city that if any persons knew  who had done it they should make their report and statement to justice  and to him  and he would give them a thousand crowns of gold   nevertheless nothing could be known about it  although the king showed  great diligence in the matter  and had officers commissioned to go from  house to house to make inquiry            on tuesday and other days  following there were special processions from the parish churches and  other churches of the city  which nearly all of them went to the said  place            and on the day of the fete dieu  which was the   th day  of the said month of june  the king went in procession  most devoutly   with the parish of st  paul and all the clergy  to the spot where was the  said image   he himself carried a lighted waxen taper  bareheaded  with  very great reverence  having with him the band and hautbois with several  clarions and trumpets  which made a glorious show  so melodiously did  they play   and with him were the cardinal of lorraine  and several  prelates and great lords  and all the gentlemen  having each a taper of  white wax in their hands  and all his archers had each a waxen taper  alight  and thus they went to the spot where was the said image  with  very great honor and reverence  which was a beautiful sight to see  and  with devotion      journal d un bourgeois de paris   pp               in the sixteenth century men were far from understanding that respect is  due to every religious creed sincerely professed and practised  the  innovators  who broke the images of the virgin mary and the infant jesus   did not consider that by thus brutally attacking that which they regarded  as a superstition  they were committing a revolting outrage upon  christian consciences   such an incident was too favorable for berquin s  enemies not to be eagerly turned to profit by them   although his  prosecution had been resumed  he had hitherto remained at large  and been  treated respectfully  he repaired without any guard over him from the  louvre to the palace of justice   but now he was arrested  and once more  confined in the tower of the conciergerie   some books of his  seized  hap hazard and sent to the syndic beda  were found covered with notes   which were immediately pronounced to be heretical   on the   th of april         he was brought before the court    louis berquin   said the  president to him   you are convicted of having belonged to the sect of  luther  and of having made wicked books against the majesty of god and of  his glorious mother   in consequence  we do sentence you to make  honorable amends  bareheaded and with a waxen taper alight in your hand   in the great court of the palace  crying for mercy to god  the king  and  the law  for the offence by you committed   after that  you will be  conducted bareheaded and on foot to the place de greve  where your books  will be burned before your eyes   then you will be taken in front of the  church of notre dame  where you will make honorable amends to god and to  the glorious virgin his mother   after which a hole will be pierced in  your tongue  that member wherewith you have sinned   lastly  you will be  placed in the prison of monsieur de paris  the bishop   and will be there  confined between two stone walls for the whole of your life   and we  forbid that there be ever given you book to read or pen and ink to  write    this sentence  which erasmus called atrocious  appeared to take  berquin by surprise  for a moment he remained speechless  and then he  said   i appeal to the king   whereupon he was taken back to prison   the  sentence was to be carried out the same day about three p  m  a great  crowd of more than twenty thousand persons  says a contemporary  chronicler  rushed to the bridges  the streets  the squares  where this  solemn expiation was to take place   the commissioner of police  the  officer of the chatelet  the archers  crossbowmen  and arquebusiers of  the city had repaired to the palace to form the escort  but when they  presented themselves at the prison to take berquin  he told them that he  had appealed to the king  and that he would not go with them   the escort  and the crowd retired disappointed   the president convoked the tribunal  the same evening  and repairing to the prison  he made berquin sign the  form of his appeal   william bude hurried to the scene  and vehemently  urged the prisoner to give it up    a second sentence   said he   is  ready  and it pronounces death   if you acquiesce in the first  we shall  be able to save you later on   all that is demanded of you is to ask  pardon  and have we not all need of pardon   it appears that for a moment  berquin hesitated  and was on the point of consenting  but bude remained  anxious    i know him   said he   his ingenuousness and his confidence in  the goodness of his cause will ruin him    the king was at blois  and his  sister marguerite at st  germain  on the news of this urgent peril she  wrote to her brother   i for the last time  make you a very humble  request  it is  that you will be pleased to have pity upon poor berquin   whom i know to be suffering for nothing but loving the word of god and  obeying yours   you will be pleased  monseigneur  so to act that it be  not said that separation has made you forget your most humble and most  obedient subject and sister  marguerite    we can discover no trace of  any reply whatever from francis i   according to most of the documentary  evidence  uncertainty lasted for three days   berquin persisted in his  resolution    no   he to his friend bude  who again came to the prison    i would rather endure death than give my approval  even by silence only  to condemnation of the truth    the president of the court went once more  to pay him a visit  and asked him if he held to his appeal   berquin  said   yes   court revised its original sentence  and for the penalty of  perpetual imprisonment substituted that of the stake  on the   d of  april        according to most of the documents  but on the   th   according to the  journal d un bourgeois de paris   which the details of  the last days render highly improbable  the officers of parliament  entered berquin s gloomy chamber   he rose quietly and went with them   the procession set out  and at about three arrived at the place de greve   where the stake was ready    berquin had a gown of velvet  garments of  satin and damask  and hosen of gold thread   says the bourgeois de paris     alas   said some as they saw him pass   he is of noble lineage  a  mighty great scholar  expert in science and subtile withal  and  nevertheless he hath gone out of his senses     we borrow the account of  his actual death from a letter of erasmus  written on the evidence of an  eye witness   not a symptom of agitation appeared either in his face or  the attitude of his body  he had the bearing of a man who is meditating  in his cabinet on the subject of his studies  or in a temple on the  affairs of heaven   even when the executioner  in a rough voice   proclaimed his crime and its penalty  the constant serenity of his  features was not at all altered   when the order was given him to  dismount from the tumbrel  he obeyed cheerfully without hesitating   nevertheless he had not about him any of that audacity  that arrogance   which in the case of malefactors is sometimes bred of their natural  savagery  everything about him bore evidence to the tranquillity of a  good conscience   before he died he made a speech to the people  but  none could hear him  so great was the noise which the soldiers made   according  it is said  to the orders they had received   when the cord  which bound him to the post suffocated his voice  not a soul in the crowd  ejaculated the name of jesus  whom it is customary to invoke even in  favor of parricides and the sacrilegious  to such extent was the  multitude excited against him by those folks who are to be found  everywhere  and who can do anything with the feelings of the simple and  ignorant    theodore de beze adds that the grand penitentiary of paris   merlin  who was present at the execution  said  as he withdrew from the  still smoking stake   i never saw any one die more christianly    the  impressions and expressions of the crowd  as they dispersed  were very  diverse  but the majority cried   he was a heretic    others said   god  is the only just judge  and happy is the man whom he absolves    some  said below their breath   it is only through the cross that christ will  triumph in the kingdom of the gauls    a man went up to the franciscan  monk who had placed himself at berquin s side in the procession  and had  entreated him without getting from him anything but silence  and asked  him   did berquin say that he had erred     yes  certainly   answered the  monk   and i doubt not but that his soul hath departed in peace    this  expression was reported to erasmus  but  i don t believe it   said he    it is the story that these fellows are obliged to invent after their  victim s death  to appease the wrath of the people      we have dwelt in detail upon these two martyrs  leclerc and berquin  the  wool carder and the scholarly gentleman  because they are faithful and  vivid representatives of the two classes amongst which  in the sixteenth  century  the reformation took root in france   it had a double origin   morally and socially  one amongst the people and the other amongst the  aristocratic and the learned  it was not national  nor was it embraced by  the government of the country   persecution was its first and its only  destiny in the reign of francis i   and it went through the ordeal with  admirable courage and patience  it resisted only in the form of  martyrdom   we will give no more of such painful and hideous pictures  in  connection with this subject  and as regards the latter portion of this  reign  we will dwell upon only those general facts which bear the impress  of public morals and the conduct of the government rather than of the  fortunes and the feelings of individuals   it was after francis i  s time  that the reformation  instead of confining itself to submitting with  dignity to persecution  made a spirited effort to escape from it by  becoming a political party  and taking up  in france  the task of the  opposition  a liberal and an energetic opposition  which claims its  rights and its securities   it then took its place in french history as a  great public power  organized and commanded by great leaders  and no  longer as a multitude of scattered victims falling one after another   without a struggle  beneath the blows of their persecutors     the martyrdom of berquin put a stop to the attempt at quasi tolerance in  favor of aristocratic and learned reformers which francis i  had essayed  to practise  after having twice saved berquin from a heretic s doom  he  failed to save him ultimately  and  except the horrible details of  barbarity in the execution  the scholarly gentleman received the same  measure as the wool carder  after having been  like him  true to his  faith and to his dignity as a man and a christian   persecution  thenceforward followed its course without the king putting himself to the  trouble of applying the drag for anybody  his sister marguerite alone  continued to protect  timidly and dejectedly  those of her friends  amongst the reformers whom she could help or to whom she could offer an  asylum in bearn without embroiling herself with the king  her brother   and with the parliaments   we will not attempt to enumerate the  martyrdoms which had to be undergone by the persevering reformers in  france between      and       from the death of louis de berquin to that  of francis i   the task would be too long and intermingled with too many  petty questions of dates or proper names  we will confine ourselves to  quoting some local computations and to conning over the great historic  facts which show to what extent the persecution was general and  unrelenting  though it was ineffectual  in the end  to stifle the  reformation and to prevent the bursting out of those religious wars  which  from the death of francis i  to the accession of henry iv    smothered france in disaster  blood  and crime     in the reign of francis i   from      to       eighty one death sentences  for heresy were executed   at paris only  from the   th of november to  the  d of may  a space of some six months  one hundred and two sentences  to death by fire for heresy were pronounced  twenty seven were executed   two did not take place  because those who ought to have undergone them  denounced other reformers to save themselves  and seventy three succeeded  in escaping by flight   the  journal d un bourgeois de paris   pp             does not mention sentences to lesser penalties   in a provincial  town  whose history one of its most distinguished inhabitants  m   boutiot  has lately written from authentic documents and local  traditions  at troyes in fact  in      and       two burgesses  one a  clerk and the other a publisher  were sentenced to the stake and executed  for the crime of heresy   on an appeal being made by the publisher  mace  moreau  the parliament of paris confirmed the sentence  pronounced by the  bailiff s court   and he underwent his punishment on the place st  pierre  with the greatest courage   the  decree of the parliament contains the  most rigorous enactments against books in the french language treating of  religious  matters  and it enjoins upon all citizens the duty of  denouncing those who  publicly or not  make profession of the new  doctrine   the lutheran propaganda   say the documents   is in great  force throughout the diocese  it exercises influence not only on the  class of artisans  but also amongst the burgesses   doubt has made its  way into many honest souls   the reformation has reached so far even  where the schism is not complete   catholic priests profess some of the  new doctrines  at the same time that they remain attached to their  offices   many bishops declare themselves partisans of the reformist  doctrines   the protestant worship  however  is not yet openly conducted   the mass of the clergy do not like to abandon the past  they cling to  their old traditions  and  if they have renounced certain abuses  they  yield only on a few points of little importance   the new ideas are  spreading  even in the country            statues representing the virgin  and the saints are often broken  and these deeds are imputed to those who  have adopted the doctrines of luther and of calvin   a notre dame de  pitie  situated at the hotel dieule comte  was found with its head  broken   this event excites to madness the catholic population   the  persecutions continue    many people emigrated for fear of the stake    from august        to the  th of january         says the chronicler    troyes loses in consequence of exile  probably voluntary  a certain  number of its best inhabitants   and he names thirteen families with the  style and title of  nobleman    he adds   there is scarcely a month in  the year when there are not burned two or three heretics at paris  meaux   and troyes  and sometimes more than a dozen    troyes contained  at that  time  says m  boutiot  eighteen thousand two hundred and eighty five  inhabitants  counting five persons to a household    histoire de la ville  de troyes  t  iii   pp                            many other provincial  towns offered the same spectacle     during the long truce which succeeded the peace of cambrai  from      to        it might have been thought for a while that the persecution in  france was going to be somewhat abated   policy obliged francis i  to  seek the support of the protestants of germany against charles v   he was  incessantly fluctuating between that policy and a strictly catholic and  papal policy  by marrying his son henry  on the   th of october         to catherine de  medici  niece of pope clement vii   he seemed to have  decided upon the latter course  but he had afterwards made a movement in  the contrary direction  clement vii  had died on the   th of september         paul iii  had succeeded him  and francis i  again turned towards  the protestants of germany  he entered into relations with the most  moderate amongst their theologians  with melancthon  bucer  and sturm   there was some talk of conciliation  of a re establishment of peace and  harmony in the church  nor did the king confine himself to speaking by  the mouth of diplomatists  he himself wrote to melancthon  on the   d of  june         it is some time now since i heard from william du bellay  my  chamberlain and councillor  of the zeal with which you are exerting  yourself to appease the altercations to which christian doctrine has  given rise   i now hear that you are very much disposed to come to us for  to confer with some of our most distinguished doctors as to the means of  re establishing in the church that sublime harmony which is the chief of  all my desires   come  then  either in an official capacity or in your  own private character  you will be most welcome to me  and you shall in  either case have proof of the interest i feel in the glory of your own  germany and in the peace of the world    melancthon had  indeed  shown an  inclination to repair to paris  he had written  on the  th of may         to his friend sturm   i will not let myself be stopped by domestic ties  or by fear of danger   there is no human greatness before which i do not  prefer christ s glory   one thought alone gives me pause  i doubt my  ability to do any good  i fear it is impossible to obtain from the king  that which i regard as necessary for the lord s glory and for the peace  of france   you know that kingdom   pronounce your judgment   if you  think that i shall do well to undertake the journey  i am off      melancthon had good reason to doubt whether success  such as he deemed  necessary  were possible   whilst francis i  was making all these  advances to the protestants of germany  he was continuing to proceed  against their brother christians in france more bitterly and more  flagrantly than ever   two recent events had very much envenomed party  feeling between the french catholics and reformers  and the king had been  very much compromised in this fresh crisis of the struggle   in      the  lawless insurrection of anabaptists and peasants  which had so violently  agitated germany in       began again  the insurgents seized the town of  munster  in westphalia  and there renewed their attempt to found the  kingdom of israel  with community of property and polygamy   as in        they were promptly crushed by the german princes  catholic and  protestant  of the neighborhood  but their rising had created some  reverberation in france  and the reformers had been suspected of an  inclination to take part in it    it is said   wrote the chancellor de  granvelle  in january        to the ambassador of france at the court of  charles v    that the number of the strayed from the faith in france  and  the danger of utter confusion  are very great  the enterprise of the said  strayed  about which you write to me  to set fire to the churches and  pillage the louvre  proves that they were in great force   please god the  king may be able to apply a remedy     papiers d etat du cardinal de  granvelle   t  ii   p        the accusation was devoid of all foundation   but nothing is absurd in the eyes of party hatred and suspicion  and an  incident  almost contemporaneous with the fresh insurrection of the  anabaptists  occurred to increase the king s wrath  as well as the  people s  against the reformers  and to rekindle the flames of  persecution   on the   th of october        placards against the mass   transubstantiation  and the regimen as well as the faith of the catholic  church  were posted up during the night in the thoroughfares of paris   and at blois on the very chamberdoor of francis i   whose first glance   when he got up in the morning  they caught   they had been printed at  neufchatel  in switzerland  where the influence of the refugee william  farel was strong  and their coarse violence of expression could not fail  to excite the indignation of even the most indifferent catholics   in  their fanatical blindness factions say only what satisfies their own  passions  without considering moral propriety or the effect which will be  produced by their words upon the feelings of their adversaries  who also  have creeds and passions   francis i   equally shocked and irritated   determined to give the catholic faith striking satisfaction  and  protestant audacity a bloody lesson   on the   st of january        a  solemn procession issued from the church of st   germain l auxerrois   john du bellay  bishop of paris  held in his hands the holy sacrament   surrounded by the three sons of france and the duke de vendome  who were  the dais bearers  and the king walked behind  with a taper in his hand   between the cardinals of bourbon and lorraine   at each halting place he  handed his taper to the cardinal of lorraine  folded his hands  and  humbly prostrating himself  implored divine mercy for his people   after  the procession was over  the king  who had remained to dine with john du  bellay  assembled in the great hall of the palace the heads of all the  companies  and taking his place on a sort of throne which had been  prepared for him  said   whatever progress may have already been made by  the pest  the remedy is still easy if each of you  devoured by the same  zeal as i  will forget the claims of flesh and blood to remember only  that he is a christian  and will denounce without pity all those whom he  knows to be partisans or favorers of heresy  as for me  if my arm were  gangrened  i would have it cut off though it were my right arm  and if my  sons who hear me were such wretches as to fall into such execrable and  accursed opinions  i would be willing to give them up to make a sacrifice  of them to god    on the   th of january there was published an edict  which sentenced concealers of heretics   lutheran or other   to the same  penalties as the said heretics  unless they denounced their guests to  justice  and a quarter of the property to be confiscated was secured to  the denouncers   fifteen days previously francis i  had signed a decree  still stranger for a king who was a protector of letters  he ordered the  abolition of printing  that means of propagating heresies  and  forbade  the printing of any book on pain of the halter    six weeks later   however  on the   th of february  he became ashamed of such an act  and  suspended its execution indefinitely   punishments in abundance preceded  and accompanied the edicts  from the   th of november        to the  d of  may        twenty four heretics were burned alive in paris  without  counting many who were sentenced to less cruel penalties   the procedure  had been made more rapid  the police commissioner of the chatelet dealt  with cases summarily  and the parliament confirmed   the victims had at  first been strangled before they were burned  they were now burned alive   after the fashion of the spanish inquisition   the convicts were  suspended by iron chains to beams which alternately  hoisted  and   lowered  them over the flames until the executioner cut the cord to let  the sufferer fall   the evidence was burned together with the convicts   it was undesirable that the reformers should be able to make a certified  collection of their martyrs  acts and deeds     after a detailed and almost complacent enumeration of all these  executions  we find in the  journal d un bourgeois de paris  this  paragraph   the rumor was  in june        that pope paul iii   being  advertised of the execrable and horrible justice which the king was doing  upon the lutherans in his kingdom  did send word to the king of france  that he was advertised of it  and that he was quite willing to suppose  that he did it in good part  as he still made use of the beautiful title  he had to be called the most christian king  nevertheless  god the  creator  when he was in this world  made more use of mercy than of  rigorous justice  which should never be used rigorously  and that it was  a cruel death to burn a man alive because he might have to some extent  renounced the faith and the law   wherefore the pope did pray and request  the king  by his letters  to be pleased to mitigate the fury and rigor of  his justice by granting grace and pardon   the king  wishing to follow  the pope s wishes  according as he had sent him word by his letters  patent  sent word to the court of parliament not to proceed any more with  such rigor as they had shown heretofore   for this cause were there no  more rigorous proceedings on the part of justice      journal d un  bourgeois de paris   p           search has been made to discover whether the assertion of the bourgeois  de paris has any foundation  whether pope paul iii  really did write in  june        the letter attributed to him  and whether its effect was   that the king wrote to parliament not to proceed against the reformers   with such rigor    no proof has  however  been obtained as to the  authenticity of the pope s letter  and in any case it was not very  effectual  for the same  bourgeois de paris  reports  that in september         three months after that  according to him  it was written  two  fellows  makers of silk ribbons and tissues  were burned all alive  one  in the place maubert and the other in st  john s cemetery  as lutherans   which they were   they had handed over to their host at paris some  lutheran books to take care of  saying   keep this book for us while we  go into the city  and show it to nobody    when they were gone  this host  was not able to refrain from showing this book to a certain priest  the  which  after having looked at it  said incontinently   this is a very  wicked book  and proscribed    then the said host went to the  commissioner of police to reveal that he had such and such a book of such  an one  the which sent forth with to the house of the said host to take  and carry off the said two fellows to the chatelet   being questioned   they confessed the state of the case   whereupon  by sentence of the said  commissioner  confirmed by decree   they made honorable amends in front of  the church of notre dame de paris  had their tongues cut out  and were  burned all alive and with unshaken obstinacy    proceedings and  executions  then  did not cease  even in the case of the most humble  class of reformers  and at the very moment when francis i  was exerting  himself to win over the protestants of germany with the cry of  conciliation and re establishment of harmony in the church   melancthon   bucer  and luther himself had allowed themselves to be tempted by the  prospect  but the german politicians  princes  and counsellors were more  clear sighted    we at augsburg   wrote sailer  deputy from that city    know the king of france well  he cares very little for religion  or even  for morality   he plays the hypocrite with the pope  and gives the  germans the smooth side of his tongue  thinking of nothing but how to  cheat them of the hopes he gives them   his only aim is to crush the  emperor    the attempt of francis i  thus failed  first in germany  and  then at paris also  where the sorbonne was not disposed  any more than  the german politicians were  to listen to any talk about a specious  conciliation  and the persecution resumed its course in france  paving  the way for civil war     the last and most atrocious act of persecution in the reign of francis i   was directed not against isolated individuals  but against a whole  population  harried  despoiled  and banished or exterminated on account  of heresy   about the year      small churches of reformers began to  assume organization between the alps and the jura   something was there  said about christians who belonged to the reformation without having ever  been reformed   it was said that  in certain valleys of the piedmontese  alps and dauphiny and in certain quarters of provence  there were to be  found believers who for several centuries had recognized no authority  save that of the holy scriptures   some called them vaudians   waldensians   others poor of lyons  others lutherans   the rumor of the  reformation was heard in their valleys  and created a lively emotion  amongst them   one of them determined to go and see what this reformation  was  and he returned to his valleys with good news and with pious books   regular relations were from that time established between the reformers  of switzerland  france  and germany  and the christian shepherds of these  mountains   visits were exchanged farel and saunier went amongst the  vaudians and conversed with them about their common faith  common in  spite of certain differences   rustic conferences  composed of the  principal landholders  barbas or pastors  and simple members of the  faithful  met more than once in the open air under the pines of their  mountains   the vaudians of provence had been settled there since the end  of the thirteenth century  and in the course of the fourteenth other  vaudians from dauphiny  and even from calabria  had come thither to join  them    their barbas   says a contemporary monk   histoire des guerres  excitees dans le comtat venaissin par les calvinistes du seizieme siecle   par le pere justin  capucin     used to preside at their exercises of  religion  which were performed in secret   as they were observed to be  quiet and circumspect  as they faithfully paid taxes  tithe  and  seigniorial dues  and as they were besides very laborious  they were not  troubled on the score of their habits and doctrines    their new friends  from switzerland and germany reproached them with concealment of their  faith and worship   as soon as they had overtly separated from the roman  church  persecution began  francis i  checked its first excesses  but it  soon began again  the episcopal prisons were filled with vaudians  who  bristled at the summons to abjure  and on the   th of march         thirteen of them were sentenced to be burned alive   pope paul iii   complained to francis i  of their obstinacy  the king wrote about it to  the parliament of aix  the parliament ordered the lords of the lands  occupied by the vaudians to force their vassals to abjure or leave the  country   when cited to appear before the court of aix to explain the  grounds of their refusal  several declined   the court sentenced them  in  default  to be burned alive   their friends took up arms and went to  deliver the prisoners   merindol was understood to be the principal  retreat of the sectaries  by decree of november           the parliament  ordered that  the houses should be demolished and razed to the ground   the cellars filled up  the woods cut down  the trees of the gardens torn  up  and that the lands of those who had lived in merindol should not be  able to be farmed out to anybody whatever of their family or name    in  the region of parliament itself complaints were raised against such  hardships  the premier president  barthelemy chassaneuz  was touched  and  adjourned the execution of the decree   the king commissioned william du  bellay to examine into the facts  the report of du bellay was favorable  to the vaudians  as honest  laborious  and charitable farmers   discharging all the duties of civil life  but  at the same time  he  acknowledged that they did not conform to the laws of the church  that  they did not recognize the pope or the bishops  that they prayed in the  vulgar tongue  and that they were in the habit of choosing certain  persons from amongst themselves to be their pastors   on this report   francis i   by a declaration of february           pardoned the vaudians  for all that had been irregular in their conduct  on condition that  within the space of three months they should abjure their errors  and he  ordered the parliament to send to aix deputies from their towns  burghs   and villages  to make abjuration in the name of all  at the same time  authorizing the parliament to punish  according to the ordinances  those  who should refuse to obey  and to make use  if need were  of the services  of the soldiery   thus persecuted and condemned for their mere faith   undemonstrative as it was  the vaudians confined themselves to asking  that it might be examined and its errors pointed out   those of merindol  and those of cabriere in the countship of venasque drew up their  profession of faith and sent it to the king and to two bishops of the  province  cardinal sadolet  bishop of carpentras  and john durandi   bishop of cavaillon  whose equity and moderation inspired them with some  confidence   cardinal sadolet did not belie their expectation  he  received them with kindness  discussed with them their profession of  faith  pointed out to them divers articles which might be remodelled  without disavowing the basis of their creed  and assured them that it  would always be against his sentiments to have them treated as enemies    i am astonished   he wrote to the pope   that these folks should be  persecuted when the jews are spared    the bishop of cavaillon testified  towards them a favor less unalloyed   i was quite sure   said he   that  there was not so much mischief amongst you as was supposed  however  to  calm men s minds  it is necessary that you should submit to a certain  appearance of abjuration     but what would you have us abjure  if we are  already within the truth     it is but a simple formality that i demand  of you  i do not require in your case notary or signature  if you are  unwilling to assent to this abjuration  none can argue you into it     we  are plain men  monseigneur  we are unwilling to do anything to which we  cannot assent   and they persisted in their refusal to abjure   cardinal  sadolet was summoned to rome  and the premier president chassaneuz died  suddenly   his successor  john de maynier  baron of oppede  was a violent  man  passionately bigoted  and moreover  it is said  a personal enemy of  the vaudians of cabrieres  on which his estates bordered  he recommenced  against them a persecution which was at first covert  they had found  protectors in switzerland and in germany  at the instance of calvin  the  swiss protestant cantons and the german princes assembled at smalkalden  wrote to francis i  in their favor  it was to his interest to humor the  protestants of germany  and that fact turned out to the advantage of the  vaudians of provence  on the   th of june        he issued an edict  which  suspending the proceedings commenced against them  restored to  them their privileges  and ordered such of them as were prisoners to be  set at large   and as the attorney general of provence   it goes on to  say   is related to the archbishop of aix  their sworn enemy  there will  be sent in his place a counsellor of the court for to inform me of their  innocence    but some months later the peace of crespy was made  and  francis i  felt no longer the same solicitude about humoring the  protestants of switzerland and germany   baron d oppede zealously resumed  his work against the vaudians  he accused them of intriguing  with  foreign reformers  and of designing to raise fifteen thousand men to  surprise marseilles and form provence into a republic   on the  st of  january        francis i  signed  without reading it they say  the  revocation of his edict of       and ordered execution of the decree  issued by the parliament of aix  dated november           on the subject  of the vaudians   notwithstanding all letters of grace posterior to that  epoch  and ordered the governor of the province to give  for that  purpose  the assistance of the strong hand to justice    the duty of  assisting justice was assigned to baron d oppede  and from the  th to the    th of april        two columns of troops  under the orders   respectively  of oppede himself and baron de la garde  ravaged with fire  and sword the three districts of merindol  cabrieres  and la coste  which  were peopled chiefly by vaudians      illustration  massacre of the vaudians            we shrink from describing in detail all the horrors committed against a  population without any means of self defence by troops giving free rein  to their brutal passions and gratifying the hateful passions of their  leaders   in the end three small towns and twenty two villages were  completely sacked  seven hundred and sixty three houses  eighty nine  cattle sheds  and thirty one barns burned  three thousand persons  massacred  two hundred and fifty five executed subsequently to the  massacre  after a mockery of trial  six or seven hundred sent to the  galleys  many children sold for slaves  and the victors  on retiring   left behind them a double ordinance  from the parliament of aix and the  vice legate of avignon  dated the   th of april        forbidding  that  any one  on pain of death  should dare to give asylum  aid  or succor  or  furnish money or victuals  to any vaudian or heretic      it is said that francis i   when near his end  repented of this odious  extermination of a small population  which  with his usual fickleness and  carelessness  he had at one time protected  and at another abandoned to  its enemies   amongst his last words to his son henry ii  was an  exhortation to cause an inquiry to be made into the iniquities committed  by the parliament of aix in this instance   it will be seen  at the  opening of henry ii  s reign  what was the result of this exhortation of  his father s     calvin was lately mentioned as having pleaded the cause of the vaudians   in       amongst the protestants of switzerland and germany   it was from  geneva  where he had lived and been the dominant spirit for many years   that the french reformer had exercised such influence over the chiefs of  the german reformation in favor of that small population whose creed and  morals had anticipated by several centuries the reformation in the  sixteenth century   he was born  in      at noyon in picardy  was brought  up in the bosom of the catholic church  and held a cure in      at  pont l eveque  where he preached several times   joyous and almost  proud   as he said himself   that a single dissertation had brought me  a cure    in       study  meditation on the gospels  discussion of the  religious and moral questions raised on every side  and the free  atmosphere of the new spirit that was abroad  changed his convictions and  his resolves  he abandoned the career of the law as well as that of the  established church  resigned his cure at pont l eveque  and devoted  himself entirely to the work of the nascent and much opposed reformation   having a mind that was judicious and free from illusion in the very heat  of passion  he soon saw to what an extent the success of the reformation  in france was difficult and problematical  in       impressed by the  obstacles it met with even more than by the dangers it evoked  he  resolved to leave his country and go else whither in search of security   liberty  and the possibility of defending a cause which became the dearer  to him in proportion as it was the more persecuted   he had too much  sagacity not to perceive that he was rapidly exhausting his various  places of asylum  queen marguerite of navarre was unwilling to try too  far the temper of the king her brother  canon louis du tillet was a  little fearful lest his splendid library should be somewhat endangered  through the use made of it by his guest  who went about  arguing or  preaching  in the vicinity of angouleme  the queen s almoner  gerard  roussel  considered that calvin was going too far  and grew apprehensive  lest  if the reformation should completely succeed  it might suppress the  bishopric of oleron which he desired  and which  indeed  he at a later  period obtained   lefevre of etaples  who was the most of all in sympathy  with calvin  was seventy nine years old  and had made up his mind to pass  his last days in peace   calvin quitted angouleme and nerac  and went to  pass some time at poitiers  where the friends of the reformation   assembling round him and hanging upon his words  for the first time  celebrated the lord s supper in a grotto close to the town  which still  goes by the name of calvin s grotto   being soon obliged to leave  poitiers  calvin went to orleans  then secretly to paris  then to noyon  to see his family once more  and set out at last for strasbourg  already  one of the strongholds of the reformation  where he had friends  amongst  others the learned bucer  with whom he had kept up a constant  correspondence   he arrived there at the beginning of the year       but  it was not at strasbourg that he took up his quarters  he preferred bale   where also there was a reunion of men of letters  scholars  and  celebrated printers  erasmus  simon grynee  grymeus   and the frobens   and where calvin calculated upon finding the leisure and aid he required  for executing the great work he had been for some time contemplating  his   institution de la religion chretienne   christian institutes   this  would not be the place  and we have no intention  to sum up the religious  doctrines of that book  we might challenge many of them as contrary to  the true meaning and moral tendency of christianity  but we desire to set  in a clear light their distinctive and original characteristics  which  are those of calvin himself in the midst of his age   these  characteristics are revealed in the preface and even in the dedication of  the book   it is to francis i   the persecutor of the french reformers   during one of the most cruel stages of the persecution  and at the very  moment when he had just left his own country in order that he may live in  security and speak with freedom  that calvin dedicates his work    do not  imagine   he says to the king   that i am attempting here my own special  defence in order to obtain permission to return to the country of my  birth  from which  although i feel for it such human affection as is my  bounden duty  yet  as things are now  i do not suffer any great anguish  at being cut off   but i am taking up the cause of all the faithful  and  even that of christ  which is in these days so mangled and down trodden  in your kingdom that it seems to be in a desperate plight   and this has  no doubt come to pass rather through the tyranny of certain pharisees  than of your own will    calvin was at the same time the boldest and the  least revolutionary amongst the innovators of the sixteenth century  bold  as a christian thinker  but full of deference and consideration towards  authority  even when he was flagrantly withdrawing himself from it   the  idea of his book was at first exclusively religious  and intended for the  bulk of the french reformers  but at the moment when calvin is about to  publish it  prudence and policy recur to his mind  and it is to the king  of france that he addresses himself  it is the authority of the royal  persecutor that he invokes  it is the reason of francis i  that he  attempts to convince   he acts like a respectful and faithful subject   as well as an independent and innovating christian      illustration  calvin            after having wandered for some time longer in switzerland  germany  and  italy  calvin in      arrived at geneva   it was at this time a small  independent republic  which had bravely emancipated itself from the  domination of the dukes of savoy  and in which the reformation had  acquired strength  but it had not yet got rid of that lawless and  precarious condition which is the first phase presented by revolutionary  innovations after victory  neither the political nor the religious  community at geneva had yet received any organization which could be  called regular or regarded as definitive  the two communities had not yet  understood and regulated their reciprocal positions and the terms on  which they were to live together   all was ferment and haze in this  little nascent state  as regarded the mental as well as the actual  condition  when calvin arrived there  his name was already almost famous  there  he had given proofs of devotion to the cause of the reformation   his book on the  institution de la religion chretienne  had just  appeared  a great instinct for organization was strikingly evinced in it   at the same time that the dedication to francis i  testified to a serious  regard for the principle of authority and for its rights  as well as the  part it ought to perform in human communities   calvin had many friends  in switzerland  and they urged him to settle at once at geneva  and to  labor at establishing there christian order in the reformed church  simultaneously with its independence and its religious liberties in its  relations with the civil estate   at first calvin hesitated and resisted   he was one of those who take strict account  beforehand  of the  difficulties to be encountered and the trials to be undergone in any  enterprise for the success of which they are most desirous  and who  inwardly shudder at the prospect of such a burden   but the christian s  duty  the reformer s zeal  the lively apprehension of the perils which  were being incurred by the cause of the reformation  and the nobly  ambitious hope of delivering it   these sentiments united prevailed over  the first misgivings of that great and mighty soul  and calvin devoted  himself in geneva to a work which  from      to       in a course of  violent struggles and painful vicissitudes  was to absorb and rapidly  consume his whole life     from that time forth a principle  we should rather say a passion  held  sway in calvin s heart  and was his guiding star in the permanent  organization of the church which he founded  as well as in his personal  conduct during his life   that principle is the profound distinction  between the religious and the civil community   distinction we say  and  by no means separation  calvin  on the contrary  desired alliance between  the two communities and the two powers  but each to be independent in its  own domain  combining their action  showing mutual respect and lending  mutual support   to this alliance he looked for the reformation and moral  discipline of the members of the church placed under the authority of its  own special religious officers and upheld by the indirect influence of  the civil power     in this principle and this fundamental labor of calvin s there were two  new and bold reforms attempted in the very heart of the great reformation  in europe  and over and above the work of its first promoters   henry  viii   on removing the church of england from the domination of the  papacy  had proclaimed himself its head  and the church of england had  accepted this royal supremacy   zwingle  when he provoked in german  switzerland the rupture with the church of rome  had approved of the  arrangement that the sovereign authority in matters of religion should  pass into the hands of the civil powers   luther himself  at the same  time that he reserved to the new german church a certain measure of  spontaneity and liberty  had placed it under the protection and  preponderance of laic sovereigns   in this great question as to the  relations between church and state calvin desired and did more than his  predecessors  even before he played any considerable part in the european  reformation  as soon as he heard of henry viii  s religious supremacy in  england  he had strongly declared against such a regimen  with an  equitable spirit rare in his day  and in spite of his contest with the  church of rome  he was struck with the strength and dignity conferred  upon that church by its having an existence distinct from the civil  community  and by the independence of its head   when he himself became a  great reformer  he did not wish the reformed church to lose this grand  characteristic  whilst proclaiming it evangelical  he demanded for it in  matters of faith and discipline the independence and special authority  which had been possessed by the primitive church  and in spite of the  resistance often shown to him by the civil magistrates  in spite of the  concessions he was sometimes obliged to make to them  he firmly  maintained this principle  and he secured to the reformed church  of geneva  in purely religious questions and affairs  the right of  self government  according to the faith and the law as they stand  written in the holy books     he at the same time put in force in this church a second principle of no  less importance   in the course of ages  and by a series of successive  modifications  some natural and others factitious and illegitimate  the  christian church had become  so to speak  cut in two  into the  ecclesiastical community and the religious community  the clergy and the  worshippers   in the catholic church the power was entirely in the hands  of the clergy  the ecclesiastical body completely governed the religious  body  and  whilst the latter was advancing more and more in laic ideas  and sentiments  the former remained even more and more distinct and  sovereign   the german and english reformations had already modified this  state of things  and given to the lay community a certain portion of  influence in religious questions and affairs   calvin provided for the  matter in a still more direct and effectual fashion  not only as regarded  affairs in general  but even the choice of pastors  he gave admission to  laymen  in larger number too than that of the ecclesiastics  into the  consistories and synods  the governing authorities in the reformed  church   he thus did away with the separation between the clergy and the  worshippers  he called upon them to deliberate and act together  and he  secured to the religious community  in its entirety  their share of  authority in the affairs and fortunes of the church     thus began at geneva  under the inspiration and through the influence of  calvin  that ecclesiastical organization which  developing  completing   and modifying itself according to the requirements of places and times   became  under the name of presbyterian regimen  the regimen of the  reformed churches in france  french switzerland  holland  scotland  and  amongst a considerable portion of the protestant population in england  and in the united states of america  a regimen evangelical in origin and  character  republican in some of its maxims and institutions  but no  stranger to the principle of authority  one which admitted of discipline  and was calculated for duration  and which has kept for three centuries   amongst the most civilized people  a large measure of christian faith   ecclesiastical order  and civil liberty   it was a french refugee who  instituted  in a foreign city  this regimen  and left it as a legacy to  the french reformation and to the numerous christian communities who were  eager to adopt it   it is on this ground that calvin takes a place in the  history of france  and has a fair right to be counted amongst the eminent  men who have carried to a distance the influence  the language  and the  fame of the country in the bosom of which it was not permitted them to  live and labor  in       when the death of francis i  was at hand  that  ecclesiastical organization of protestantism which calvin had instituted  at geneva was not even begun in france   the french protestants were as  yet but isolated and scattered individuals  without any bond of generally  accepted and practised faith or discipline  and without any eminent and  recognized heads   the reformation pursued its course  but a reformed  church did not exist   and this confused mass of reformers and reformed  had to face an old  a powerful  and a strongly constituted church  which  looked upon the innovators as rebels over whom it had every right as much  as against them it had every arm   in each of the two camps prevailed  errors of enormous magnitude  and fruitful of fatal consequences   catholics and protestants both believed themselves to be in exclusive  possession of the truth  of all religious truth  and to have the right of  imposing it by force upon their adversaries the moment they had the  power   both were strangers to any respect for human conscience  human  thought  and human liberty   those who had clamored for this on their own  account when they were weak had no regard for it in respect of others  when they felt themselves to be strong   on the side of the protestants  the ferment was at full heat  but as yet vague and unsettled  on the part  of the catholics the persecution was unscrupulous and unlimited  such was  the position and such the state of feeling in which francis i   at his  death on the   st of march        left the two parties that had already  been at grips during his reign   he had not succeeded either in  reconciling them or in securing the triumph of that which had his favor  and the defeat of that which he would have liked to vanquish   that was   in nearly all that he undertook  his fate  he lacked the spirit of  sequence and steady persistence  and his merits as well as his defects  almost equally urged him on to rashly attempt that which he only  incompletely executed   he was neither prudent nor persevering  and he  may be almost said to have laid himself out to please everybody rather  than to succeed in one and the same great purpose   a short time before  his death a venetian ambassador who had resided a long while at his  court  marino cavalli  drew up and forwarded to the senate of venice a  portrait of him so observantly sketched and so full of truth that it must  be placed here side by side with the more exacting and more severe  judgment already pronounced here touching this brilliant but by no means  far sighted or effective king      the king is now fifty years of age  his aspect is in every respect  kingly  insomuch that  without ever having seen his face or his portrait   any one  on merely looking at him  would say at once   that is the king    all his movements are so noble and majestic that no prince could equal  them   his constitution is robust  in spite of the excessive fatigue he  has constantly undergone and still undergoes in so many expeditions and  travels   he eats and drinks a great deal  sleeps still better  and  what  is more  dreams of nothing but leading a jolly life   he is rather fond  of being an exquisite in his dress  which is slashed and laced  and rich  with jewelry and precious stones  even his doublets are daintily worked  and of golden tissue  his shirt is very fine  and it shows through an  opening in the doublet  according to the fashion of france   this  delicate and dainty way of living contributes to his health   in  proportion as the king bears bodily fatigue well  and endures it without  bending beneath the burden  in the same proportion do mental cares weigh  heavily upon him  and he shifts them almost entirely on to cardinal de  tournon and admiral annebault   he takes no resolve  he makes no reply   without having had their advice  and if ever  which is very rare  an  answer happens to be given or a concession made without having received  the approval of these two advisers  he revokes it or modifies it   but in  what concerns the great affairs of state  peace or war  his majesty   docile as he is in everything else  will have the rest obedient to his  wishes   in that case there is nobody at court  whatever authority he may  possess  who dare gainsay his majesty   this prince has a very sound  judgment and a great deal of information  there is no sort of thing  or  study or art  about which he cannot converse very much to the point   it  is true that  when people see how  in spite of his knowledge and his fine  talk  all his warlike enterprises have turned out ill  they say that all  his wisdom lies on his lips  and not in his mind   but i think that the  calamities of this king come from lack of men capable of properly  carrying out his designs   as for him  he will never have anything to do  with the execution  or even with the superintendence of it in any way  it  seems to him quite enough to know his own part  which is to command and  to supply plans   accordingly  that which might be wished for in him is  a little more care and patience  not by any means more experience and  knowledge   his majesty readily pardons offences  and he becomes heartily  reconciled with those whom he has offended      relations des  ambassadeurs venitiens sur les affaires de france au seizieme siecle  in  the documents inedits sur l histoire de france   translated by m   tommaseo  t  i   pp               it is said that at the close of his reign francis i   in spite of all the  resources of his mind and all his easy going qualities  was much  depressed  and that he died in sadness and disquietude as to the future   one may be inclined to think that  in his egotism  he was more sad on his  own account than disquieted on that of his successors and of france   however that may be  he was assuredly far from foreseeing the terrible  civil war which began after him  and the crimes  as well as disasters   which it caused   none of his more intimate circle was any longer in a  position to excite his solicitude  his mother  louise of savoy  had died  sixteen years before him  september            his most able and most  wicked adviser  chancellor duprat  twelve years  july             his  sister marguerite survived him two years  she died december              disgusted with everything   say the historians  and  weary of life    said she herself                       no father now have i  no mother                  sister or brother                  on god alone i now rely

them all for enemies      and yet marguerite was loath to leave life   she had always been troubled  at the idea of death  when she was spoken to about eternal life  she  would shake her head sometimes  saying   all that is true  but we remain  a mighty long while dead underground before arriving there    when she  was told that her end was near  she  considered that a very bitter word    saying that  she was not so old but that she might still live some  years    she had been the most generous  the most affectionate  and the  most lovable person in a family and a court which were both corrupt  and  of which she only too often acquiesced in the weaknesses and even vices   though she always fought against their injustice and their cruelty   she  had the honor of being the grandmother of henry iv             chapter xxxi     henry ii                   illustration  gallery henry ii            henry ii  had all the defects  and  with the exception of personal  bravery  not one amongst the brilliant and amiable qualities of the king  his father   like francis i   he was rash and reckless in his resolves  and enterprises  but without having the promptness  the fertility  and  the suppleness of mind which francis i  displayed in getting out of the  awkward positions in which he had placed himself  and in stalling off or  mitigating the consequences of them   henry was as cold and ungenial as  francis had been gracious and able to please  and whilst francis i   even  if he were a bad master to himself  was at any rate his own master  henry  ii  submitted without resistance  and probably without knowing it  to the  influence of the favorite who reigned in his house as well as in his  court  and of the advisers who were predominant in his government   two  facts will suffice to set in a clear light  at the commencement of the  new reign  this regrettable analogy in the defects  and this profound  diversity in the mind  character  and conduct of the two kings     towards the close of       a grievous aggravation of the tax upon salt   called babel  caused a violent insurrection in the town of rochelle   which was exempted  it was said  by its traditional privileges from that  impost   not only was payment refused  but the commissioners were  maltreated and driven away   francis i  considered the matter grave  enough to require his presence for its repression   he repaired to  rochelle with a numerous body of lanzknechts   the terrified population  appeared to have determined upon submission  and  having assembled in a  mass at the town hall  there awaited anxiously the king s arrival   on  the  st of january        francis i  entered the town in state   surrounded by his escort   the people s advocate fell on his knees  and  appealed to the king s clemency in dealing with a revolt of which every  one repented   the king  who was seated on a wooden boarding  rose up    speak we no more of revolt   said he   i desire neither to destroy your  persons nor to seize your goods  as was lately done by the emperor  charles to the ghentese  whereby his hands are stained with blood  i long  more for the hearts of my subjects than for their lives and their riches   i will never at any time of my life think again of your offence  and i  pardon you without excepting a single thing   i desire that the keys of  your city and your arms be given back to you  and that you be completely  reinstated in your liberties and your privileges    the cheers of the  people responded to these words of the king    i think i have won your  hearts   said the king on retiring   and i assure you  on the honor of a  gentleman  that you have mine   i desire that you ring your bells  for  you are pardoned    the rochellese were let off for a fine of two hundred  thousand francs  which the king gave to his keeper of the seals  francis  de montholon  whom he wished to compensate for his good service   the  keeper of the seals in his turn made a present of them to the town of  rochelle to found a hospital   but the ordinances as to the salt tax were  maintained in principle  and their extension led  some years afterwards   to a rising of a more serious character  and very differently repressed     in       hardly a year after the accession of henry ii   and in the midst  of the rejoicings he had gone to be present at in the north of italy  he  received news at turin to the effect that in guienne  angoumois  and  saintonge a violent and pretty general insurrection had broken out  against the salt tax  which francis i   shortly before his death  had made  heavier in these provinces   the local authorities in vain attempted to  repress the rising  the insurgent peasants scoured the country in strong  bodies  giving free rein not only to their desires  but also to their  revengeful feelings  the most atrocious excesses of which a mob is  capable were committed  the director general of the gabel was massacred  cruelly  and two of his officers  at angouleme  were strapped down stark  naked on a table  beaten to death  and had their bodies cast into the  river with the insulting remark   go  wicked gabellers  and salt the fish  of the charente    the king of navarre s lieutenant  being appealed to  for aid  summoned  but to no purpose  the parliament of bordeaux  he was  forced to take refuge in chateau trompette  and was massacred by the  populace whilst he was trying to get out  the president of the  parliament  a most worthy magistrate  and very much beloved  it is said   by the people  only saved his own life by taking the oath prescribed by  the insurgents    this news   says vieilleville  in his contemporary   memoires    grievously afflicted the king  and the constable de  montmorency represented to him that it was not the first time that these  people had been capricious  rebellious  and mutinous  for that in the  reign of his lord and father  the late king  the rochellese and  surrounding districts had forgotten themselves in like manner   they  ought to be exterminated  and  in case of need  be replaced by a new  colony  that they might never return   the said sir constable offered to  take the matter in hand  and with ten companies of the old hands whom he  would raise in piedmont  and as many lanzknechts  a thousand men at arms  all told  he promised to exact a full account  and satisfy his majesty      montmorency was as good as his word   when he arrived with his troops in  guienne  the people of bordeaux  in a fit of terror  sent to langon a  large boat  most magnificently fitted up  in which were chambers and  saloons emblazoned with the arms of the said sir constable  with three or  four deputies to present it to him  and beg him to embark upon it  and  drop down to their city   he repulsed them indignantly    away  away    said he   with your boat and your keys  i will have nought to do with  them  i have others here with me which will make me other kind of opening  than yours   i will have you all hanged  i will teach you to rebel  against your king and murder his governor and his lieutenant    and he  did  in fact  enter bordeaux on the  th of october        by a breach  which he had opened in the walls  and  after having traversed the city  between two lines of soldiers and with his guns bearing on the suspected  points  he ordered the inhabitants to bring all their arms to the  citadel   executions followed immediately after this moral as well as  material victory    more than a hundred and forty persons were put to  death by various kinds of punishments   says vieilleville   and  by a  most equitable sentence  when the executioner had in his hands the three  insurgents who had beaten to death and thrown into the river the two  collectors of the babel at angouleme  he cast them all three into a fire  which was ready at the spot  and said to them aloud  in conformity with  the judgment against them   go  rabid hounds  and grill the fish of the  charente  which ye salted with the bodies of the officers of your king  and sovereign lord    as to civil death  loss of civil rights    adds  vieilleville   nearly all the inhabitants made honorable amends in open  street  on their knees  before the said my lords at the window  crying  mercy and asking pardon  and more than a hundred  because of their youth   were simply whipped   astounding fines and interdictions were laid as  well upon the body composing the court of parliament as upon the  town council and on a great number of private individuals   the very  bells were not exempt from experiencing the wrath and vengeance of the  prince  for not a single one remained throughout the whole city or in the  open country  to say nothing of the clocks  which were not spared either    which was not broken up and confiscated to the king s service for his  guns      the insurrection at bordeaux against the gabel in      was certainly more  serious than that of rochelle in       but it is also quite certain that  francis i  would not have set about repressing it as henry ii  did  he  would have appeared there himself and risked his own person instead of  leaving the matter to the harshest of his lieutenants  and he would have  more skilfully intermingled generosity with force  and kind words with  acts of severity   and that is one of the secrets of governing   in        scarcely a year after the revolt at bordeaux  henry ii   then at amiens   granted to deputies from poitou  rochelle  the district of aunis   limousin  perigord  and saintonge  almost complete abolition of the babel  in guienne  which paid the king  by way of compensation  two hundred  thousand crowns of gold for the expenses of war or the redemption of  certain alienated domains   we may admit that on the day after the revolt  the arbitrary and bloody proceedings of the constable de montmorency must  have produced upon the insurgents of bordeaux the effect of a salutary  fright  but we may doubt whether so cruel a repression was absolutely  indispensable in       when in      the concession demanded in the former  year was to be recognized as necessary     according to de thou and the majority of historians  it was on the  occasion of the insurrection in guienne against the babel that stephen  de la boetie  the young and intimate friend of montaigne  wrote his  celebrated  discours de la servitude voluntaire  ou le contre un   an  eloquent declamation against monarchy   but the testimony of montaigne  himself upsets the theory of this coincidence  written in his own hand  upon a manuscript  partly autograph  of the treatise by de la boetie  is  a statement that it was the work  of a lad of sixteen    la boetie was  born at sarlat on the  st of november        and was  therefore  sixteen  in       two years before the insurrection at bordeaux   the  contre un    besides  is a work of pure theory and general philosophy  containing no  allusion at all to the events of the day  to the sedition in guienne no  more than to any other   this little work owed to montaigne s  affectionate regard for its author a great portion of its celebrity   published for the first time  in       in the  memoires de l etat de  france   after having up to that time run its course without any author s  name  any title  or any date  it was soon afterwards so completely  forgotten that when  in the middle of the seventeenth century  cardinal  de richelieu for the first time heard it mentioned  and  sent one of his  gentlemen over the whole street of saint jacques to inquire for  la  servitude volontaire   all the publishers said   we don t know what it  is    the son of one of them recollected something about it  and said to  the cardinal s gentleman   sir  there is a book fancier who has what you  seek  but with no covers to it  and he wants five pistoles for it     very well   said the gentleman   and the cardinal do richelieu paid  fifty francs for the pleasure of reading the little political pamphlet by   a lad of sixteen   which probably made very little impression upon him   but which  thanks to the elegance and vivacity of its style  and the  affectionate admiration of the greatest independent thinker of the  sixteenth century  has found a place in the history of french literature     memoires de

thence proceeded an infinity of irregularities and  losses in the towns and in the country  wherein the people had to suffer  at the hands of an insolent soldiery the same vexatious as if it had been

felt called  upon to disavow it   it had left england in possession of calais and  boulogne  and confirmed the dominion or ascendency of charles v  in  germany  italy  and spain  on all the french

francis i  for normandy  picardy   burgundy  dauphiny  and provence united  languedoc  guienne  and  brittany  but they were not like permanent troops  drilled and always  ready  they were recruited by voluntary enlistment  they generally  remained at their own homes  receiving compensation at review time and  high pay in time of war   the constable de montmorency had no confidence  in these legions  he spoke of them contemptuously  and would much rather  have increased the number of the foreign corps  regularly paid and kept  up  swiss or lanzknechts   two systems of policy and warfare

or battles to be sought  but  victuals and all sorts of supplies to be destroyed in the provinces which  might be invaded by the enemy  so that instead of winning victories there  he might not even be able to live there   in      this system had been  found successful by the constable in causing the failure of charles v  s  invasion of provence  but in      a new generation had come into the  world

who afterwards became marshal  de vieilleville  was at this time nearly forty  but he had contributed in       to the victory of ceresole  and francis i  had made so much of it  that he had said  on presenting him to his son henry   he is no older  than you  and see what he has done already  if the wars do not swallow  him up  you will some day make him constable or marshal of france    gaspard

one and the  same time  in a high social position and in the flower of their age   could not reconcile themselves to the constable de montmorency s system   defensive solely and prudential to the verge of inertness  they thought  that  in order to repair the reverses of france and for the sake of their  own fame  there was something else to be done  and they impatiently  awaited the opportunity      illustration  henry ii             it was not long coming   at the close of       a deputation of the  protestant princes of germany came to fontainebleau to ask for the king s  support against the aggressive and persecuting despotism of charles v   the count of nassau made a speech  very long   says vieilleville in his   memoires    at the same time that it was in very elegant language   whereby all the presence received very great contentment    next day the  king put the demand before his council for consideration  and expressed  at the very outset his own opinion that  in the present state of affairs   he ought not to take up any enterprise  but leave his subjects of all  conditions to rest  for generally   said he   all have suffered and do  suffer when armies pass and repass so often through my kingdom  which  cannot be done without pitiable oppression and trampling down of the poor  people    the constable   without respect of persons   says vieilleville    following his custom of not giving way to anybody  forthwith began to  speak  saying that the king  who asked counsel of them  had very plainly  given it them himself and made them very clearly to understand his own  idea  which ought to be followed point by point without any gainsaying   he having said nothing but what was most equitable and well known to the  company    nearly all the members of the council gave in their adhesion   without comment  to the opinion of the king and the constable    but when  it came to the turn of m  de vieilleville  who had adopted the language  of the count of nassau   he unhesitatingly expressed a contrary opinion   unfolding all the reasons which the king had for being distrustful of the  emperor and for not letting this chance of enfeebling him slip by    may  it please your majesty   said he   to remember his late passage through  france  to obtain which the emperor submitted to carteblanche   nevertheless  when he was well out of the kingdom  he laughed at all his  promises  and  when he found himself inside cambrai  he said to the  prince of infantado   let not the king of france  if he be wise  put  himself at my mercy  as i have been at his  for i swear by the living god  that he shall not be quit for burgundy and champagne  but i would also  insist upon picardy and the key of the road to the bastille of paris   unless he were minded to lose his life or be confined in perpetual  imprisonment until the whole of my wish were accomplished    since thus  it is  sir  and the emperor makes war upon you covertly  it must be made  upon him overtly  without concealing one s game or dissimulating at all   no excuses must be allowed on the score of neediness  for france is  inexhaustible  if only by voluntary loans raised on the most comfortable  classes of the realm   as for me  i consider myself one of the poorest of  the company  or at any rate one of the least comfortable  but yet i have  some fifteen thousand francs  worth of plate  dinner and dessert  white  and red  silver and gold   which i hereby offer to place in the hands of  whomsoever you shall appoint  in order to contribute to the expenses of  so laudable an enterprise as this   putting off  moreover  for the  present the communication to you of a certain secret matter which one of  the chiefs of this embassy hath told me  and i am certain that when you  have discovered it  you will employ all your might and means to carry out  that which i propose to you      the king asked vieilleville what this secret matter was which he was  keeping back    if it please your majesty to withdraw apart  i will tell  it you   said vieilleville   all the council rose  and vieilleville   approaching his majesty  who called the constable only to his side  said    sir  you are well aware how the emperor got himself possessed of the  imperial cities of cambrai  utrecht  and liege  which he has incorporated  with his own countship of flanders  to the great detriment of the whole  of germany   the electoral princes of the holy empire have discovered  that he has a project in his mind of doing just the same with the  imperial cities of metz  strasbourg  toul  verdun  and such other towns  on the rhine as he shall be able to get hold of   they have secretly  adopted the idea of throwing themselves upon your resources  without  which they cannot stop this detestable design  which would be the total  ruin of the empire and a manifest loss to your kingdom   wherefore  take  possession of the said towns  since opportunity offers  which will be  about forty leagues of country gained without the loss of a single man   and an impregnable rampart for champagne and picardy  and  besides  a  fine and perfectly open road into the heart of the duchy of luxembourg  and the districts below it as far as brussels      however pacific the king s first words had been  and whatever was the  influence of the constable  the proposal of vieilleville had a great  effect upon the council   the king showed great readiness to adopt it    i think   said he to the constable   that i was inspired of god when i  created vieilleville of my council to day     i only gave the opinion i  did   replied montmorency   in order to support the king s sentiments   let your majesty give what orders you please    the king loudly  proclaimed his resolve    then let every one   he said   be ready at an  early date  with equipment according to his ability and means  to follow  me  hoping  with god s help  that all will go well for the discomfiture  of so pernicious a foe of my kingdom and nation  and one who revels and  delights in tormenting all manner of folks  without regard for any    there was a general enthusiasm  the place of meeting for the army was  appointed at chalons sur marne  march           more than a thousand  gentlemen flocked thither as volunteers  peasants and mechanics from  champagne and picardy joined them  the war was popular    the majority of  the soldiers   says rabutin  a contemporary chronicler   were young men  whose brains were on fire    francis de guise and gaspard de coligny were  their chief leaders   the king entered lorraine from champagne by  joinville  the ordinary residence of the dukes of guise   he carried  pont a mousson  toul opened its gates to him on the   th of april  he  occupied nancy on the   th  and on the   th he entered metz  not without  some hesitation amongst a portion of the inhabitants and the necessity of  a certain show of military force on the part of the leaders of the royal  army   the king would have given the command of this important place to  vieilleville  but he refused it  saying   i humbly thank your majesty   but i do not think that you should establish in metz any governor in your  own name  but leave that duty to the mayor and sheriffs of the city   under whose orders the eight captains of the old train bands who will  remain there with their companies will be     how say you   said the  king   can i leave a foreign lieutenant in a foreign country whose oath  of fidelity i have only had within the last four and twenty hours  and  with all the difficulties and disputes in the world to meet too     sir    rejoined vieilleville   to fear that this master sheriff  whose name is  tallanges  might possibly do you a bad turn  is to wrongly estimate his  own competence  who never put his nose anywhere but into a bar parlor to  drink himself drunk  and it is also to show distrust of the excellent  means you have for preventing all the ruses and artifices that might be  invented to throw your service into confusion    the king acquiesced  but  not without anxiety  in vieilleville s refusal  and  leaving at metz as  governor a relative of the constable s  whom the latter warmly  recommended to him  he set out on the   d of april        with all his  household  to go and attempt in alsace the same process that he had  already carried out in lorraine    but when we had entered upon the  territory of germany   says vieilleville   our frenchmen at once showed  their insolence in their very first quarters  which so alarmed all the  rest that we never found from that moment a single man to speak to  and   as long as the expedition lasted  there never appeared a soul with his  provisions to sell on the road  whereby the army suffered infinite  privations   this misfortune began with us at the approach to saverne   zabern   the episcopal residence of strasbourg    when the king arrived  before strasbourg he found the gates closed  and the only offer to open  them was on the condition that he should enter alone with forty persons  for his whole suite   the constable  having taken a rash fit  was of  opinion that he should enter even on this condition   this advice was  considered by his majesty to be very sound  as well as by the princes and  lords who were about him  according to the natural tendency of the  frenchman  who is always for seconding and applauding what is said by the  great   but vieilleville  on being summoned to the king s quarters   opposed it strongly    sir   said he   break this purpose  for in  carrying it out you are in danger of incurring some very evil and very  shameful fate  and  should that happen  what will become of your army  which will be left without head  prince  or captain  and in a strange  country  wherein we are already looked upon with ill will because of our  insolence and indiscretions   as for me  i am off again to my quarters to  quaff and laugh with my two hundred men at arms  in readiness to march  when your standard is a field  but not thither    nothing has a greater  effect upon weak and undecided minds than the firm language of men  resolved to do as they say   the king gave up the idea of entering  strasbourg  and retired well pleased nevertheless  for he was in  possession of metz  toul  verdun  and pont a mousson  the keys for france  into germany  and at the head of an army under young commanders who were  enterprising without being blindly rash     charles v  also had to know what necessity was  and to submit to it   without renouncing the totality of his designs   on the  d of august         he signed at passau  with the protestant princes  the celebrated  treaty known under the name of  treaty of public peace   which referred  the great questions of german pacification to a general diet to be  assembled in six months  and declared that  pending definitive  conciliation  the two religions should be on an equal footing in the  empire  that is  that the princes and free towns should have the supreme  regulation of religious matters amongst themselves   charles v  thus  recovered full liberty of action in his relations with france  and could  no longer think of anything but how to recover the important towns he had  lost in lorraine   henry ii   on the other hand  who was asked by his  protestant allies on what conditions he would accept the peace of passau   replied that at no price would he dispossess himself of the  three bishoprics of lorraine  and that he would for his part continue the  contest he had undertaken for the liberation of germany   the siege of  metz then became the great question of the day  charles v  made all his  preparations to conduct it on an immense scale  and henry ii   immediately ordered francis de guise to go and defend his new conquest at  all hazards      illustration  diana de poitiers            ambition which is really great accepts with joy great perils fraught with  great opportunities   guise wrote to henry ii  s favorite  diana de  poitiers  duchess of valentinois  to thank her for having helped to  obtain for him this favor  which was about to bring him  to the emperor s  very beard    he set out at once  first of all to toul  where the plague  prevailed  and where he wished to hurry on the repair of the ramparts   money was wanting to pay the working corps  and he himself advanced the  necessary sum   on arriving at metz on the   th of august        he found  there only twelve companies of infantry  new levies  and every evening he  drilled them himself in front of his quarters   a host of volunteers   great lords  simple gentlemen  and rich and brave burgesses  soon came to  him   eager to aid him in repelling the greatest and most powerful effort  ever made by the emperor against their country and their king    this  concourse of warriors  the majority of them well known and several of  them distinguished  redoubled the confidence and ardor of the rank and  file in the army   we find under the title of  chanson faite en      par  un souldar etant en metz en garnison  this couplet

condition the tottering fortifications of metz  and to have  the place well supplied  was the first task undertaken by its  indefatigable governor  he never ceased to meet the calls upon him either  in person or in purse  he was seen directing the workmen  taking his  meals with them  and setting them a good example by carrying the hod for  several hours   he frequently went out on horseback to reconnoitre the  country  visit the points of approach and lodgment that the enemy might  make use of around the town  and take measures of precaution at the  places whereby they might do harm as well as at those where it would be  not only advantageous for the french to make sallies or to set  ambuscades  but also to secure a retreat   charles v   naturally slow as  he was in his operations no less than in his resolves  gave the activity  of guise time to bear fruit    i mean to batter the town of metz in such  style as to knock it about the ears of m  de guise   said he at the end  of august         and i make small account of the other places that the  king may have beyond that       illustration  guise at metz            on the   th of september following  charles was still fifteen leagues  from metz  on the territory of deux ponts  and it was only on the   th  of october that the duke of alba  his captain general  arrived with  twenty four thousand men  the advance guard  within a league of the  place which  it it is said  was to be ultimately besieged by one hundred  thousand foot  twenty three thousand horse  one hundred and twenty  pieces of artillery  and seven thousand pioneers    after one and the  first encounter   says a journal of the siege   the enemy held our  soldiers in good repute  not having seen them  for any sort of danger   advance or retreat  save as men of war and of assured courage  which was  an advantage  for m  de guise knew well that at the commencement of a  war it was requisite that a leader should try  as much as ever he could   to win    it was only on the   th of november that charles v   ill of  gout at thionville  and unable to stand on his legs  perceived the  necessity of being present in person at the siege  and appeared before  metz on an arab horse  with his face pale and worn  his eyes sunk in his  head  and his beard white   at sight of him there was a most tremendous  salute of arquebuses and artillery  the noise of which brought the whole  town to arms   the emperor  whilst waiting to establish himself at the  castle of la horgne  took up his quarters near the duke of alba  in a  little wooden house built out of the ruins of the abbey of  saint clement   a beautiful palace   said he   when the keys of metz are  brought to me there    from the   th to the   th the attack was  continued with redoubled vigor  fourteen thousand cannon shots were  fired  it is said  in a single day guise had remarked that the enemy  seemed preparing to direct the principal assault against a point so  strong that nobody had thought of pulling down the houses in its  vicinity   this oversight was immediately repaired  and a stout wall   the height of a man  made out of the ruins   if they send us peas   said  guise   we will give them back beans    we will give them at least as  good as they bring      on the   th of november the old wall was  battered by a formidable artillery  and  breached in three places  it  crumbled down on the   th into the ditch   at the same time making it  difficult to climb for to come to the assault    the assailants uttered  shouts of joy  but  when the cloud of dust had cleared off  they saw a  fresh rampart eight feet in height above the breach   and they  experienced as much and even more disgust than they had felt pleasure at  seeing the wall tumble    the besieged heaped mockery and insult upon  them  but guise  imperatively put a stop to the disturbance  fearing  it  is said  lest some traitor should take advantage of it to give the  assailants some advice  and the soldiers then conceived the idea of  sticking upon the points of their pikes live cats  the cries of which  seemed to show derision of the enemy      the siege went on for a month longer without making any more impression   and the imperial troops kicked against any fresh assaults    i was wont  once upon a time to be followed to battle   charles v  would say    but i  see that i have no longer men about me  i must bid farewell to the  empire  and go and shut myself up in some monastery  before three years  are over i shall turn cordelier    whilst metz was still holding out  the  fortress of toul was summoned by the imperialists to open its gates  but  the commandant replied   when the town of metz has been taken  when i  have had the honor of being besieged in due form by the emperor  and when  i have made as long a defence as the duke of guise has  such a summons  may be addressed to me  and i will consider what i am to do    on the    th of december        the sixty fifth day since the arrival of the  imperial army and the forty fifth since the batteries had opened fire   charles v  resolved to raise the siege    i see very well   said he    that fortune resembles women  she prefers a young king to an old  emperor    his army filed off by night  in silence  leaving behind its  munitions and its tents just as they stood   driven away  almost  by the  chastisement of heaven   says the contemporary chronicler rabutin   with  but two shots by way of signal    the ditty of the soldier just quoted  ends thus        at last  so stout was her defence   from metz they moved their guns away   and  with the laugh at their expense   a tramping went their whole array   and at their tail the noble lord  of guise sent forth a goodly throng  of cavalry  with lance and sword   to teach them how to tramp along      guise was far from expecting so sudden and decisive a result    sing me  no more flattering strains in your letters about the emperor s  dislodgment hence   he wrote on the   th of december to his brother the  cardinal of lorraine   take it for certain that unless we be very much  mistaken in him  he will not  as long as he has life  brook the shame of  departing hence until he has seen it all out      irritated  and  perhaps  still more shocked  at so heavy a blow to his  power and his renown  charles v  looked everywhere for a chance of taking  his revenge   he flattered himself that he had found it in therouanne   a fortress of importance at that time between flanders and artois  which  had always been a dependency of the kingdom of france  and served as a  rampart against the repeated incursions of the english  the masters of  calais   charles knew that it was ill supplied with troops and munitions

marriage between  diana d angouleme  the king s natural daughter  and horatio farnese  duke  of castro   all on a sudden it was announced that the troops of charles  v  were besieging therouanne   the news was at first treated lightly  it  was thought sufficient to send to therouanne some re enforcements under  the orders of francis de montmorency  nephew of the constable  but the  attack was repulsed with spirit by the besiegers  and brave as was the  resistance offered by the besieged  who sustained for ten hours a  sanguinary assault  on the   th of june        francis de montmorency saw  the impossibility of holding out longer  and  on the advice of all his  officers  offered to surrender the place  but he forgot to stipulate in  the first place for a truce  the germans entered the town  thrown open  without terms of capitulation  it was given up as prey to an army itself  a prey to all the passions of soldiers as well as to their master s  vengeful feelings  and therouanne  handed over for devastation  was for a  whole month diligently demolished and razed to the ground   when charles  v   at brussels  received news of the capture   bonfires were lighted  throughout flanders  bells were rung  cannon were fired    it was but a  poor revenge for so great a sovereign after the reverse he had just met  with at metz  but the fall of therouanne was a grievous incident for  france   francis i  was in the habit of saying that therouanne in  flanders and acqs  now dax  on the frontier of guienne were  to him  like  two pillows on which he could rest tranquilly     histoire universelle    t  ii   p           whilst these events were passing in lorraine and flanders  henry ii  and  his advisers were obstinately persisting in the bad policy which had been  clung to by charles viii   louis xii   and francis i   that  in fact  of  making conquests and holding possessions in italy   war continued  from  turin to naples  between france  the emperor  the pope  and the local  princes  with all sorts of alliances and alternations  but with no  tangible result   blaise de montluc defended the fortress of sienna for  nine months against the imperialists with an intelligence and a bravery  which earned for him twenty years later the title of marshal of france   charles de brissac was carrying on the war in piedmont with such a  combination of valor and generosity that the king sent him as a present  his own sword  writing to him at the same time   the opinion i have of  your merit has become rooted even amongst foreigners   the emperor says  that he would make himself monarch of the whole world if he had a brissac  to second his plans    his men  irritated at getting no pay  one day  surrounded brissac  complaining vehemently    you will always get bread  by coming to me   said he  and he paid the debt of france by sacrificing  his daughter s dowry and borrowing a heavy sum from the swiss on the  security of his private fortune   it was by such devotion and such  sacrifices that the french nobility paid for and justified their  preponderance in the state  but they did not manage to succeed in the  conduct of public affairs  and to satisfy the interests of a nation  progressing in activity  riches  independence  and influence   disquieted  at the smallness of his success in italy  henry ii  flattered himself  that he would regain his ascendency there by sending thither the duke of  guise  the hero of metz  with an army of about twenty thousand men   french or swiss  and a staff of experienced officers  but guise was not  more successful than his predecessors had been   after several attempts  by arms and negotiation amongst the local sovereigns  he met with a  distinct failure in the kingdom of naples before the fortress of  civitella  the siege of which he was forced to raise on the   th of may          wearied out by want of success  sick in the midst of an army of  sick  regretting over  the pleasure of his field sports at joinville  and  begging his mother to have just a word or two written to him to console  him   all he sighed for was to get back to france   and it was not long  before the state of affairs recalled him thither   it was now nearly two  years ago that  on the   th of october        and the  st of january         charles v   had solemnly abdicated all his dominions  giving over  to his son philip the kingdom of spain  with the sovereignty of burgundy  and the low countries  and to his younger brother  ferdinand  the empire  together with the original heritage of the house of austria  and retiring  personally to the monastery of yuste  in estramadura  there to pass the  last years of his life  distracted with gout  at one time resting from  the world and its turmoil  at another vexing himself about what was doing  there now that he was no longer in it   before abandoning it for good  he  desired to do his son philip the service of leaving him  if not in a  state of definite peace  at any rate in a condition of truce with france   henry ii  also desired rest  and the constable de montmorency wished  above everything for the release of his son francis  who had been a  prisoner since the fall of thorouanne   a truce for five years was signed  at vaucelles on the  th of february        and coligny  quite young  still  but already admiral and in high esteem  had the conduct of the  negotiation   he found charles v  dressed in mourning  seated beside a  little table  in a modest apartment hung with black   when the admiral  handed to the emperor the king s letter  charles could not himself break  the seal  and the bishop of arras drew near to render him that service    gently  my lord of arras   said the emperor   would you rob me of the  duty i am bound to discharge towards the king my brother in law   please  god  none but i shall do it   and then turning to coligny  he said   what  will you say of me  admiral   am i not a pretty knight to run a course  and break a lance  i who can only with great difficulty open a letter    he inquired with an air of interest after henry ii  s health  and boasted  of belonging himself  also  to the house of france through his  grandmother mary of burgundy    i hold it to be an honor   said he   to  have issued  on the mother s side  from the stock which wears and upholds  the most famous crown in the world    his son philip  who was but a  novice in kingly greatness  showed less courtesy and less good taste than  his father  he received the french ambassadors in a room hung with  pictures representing the battle of pavia   there were some who concluded  from that that the truce would not be of long duration     histoire  d espagne   by m  rosseeuw saint hilaire  t  viii   p          and it was not long before their prognostication was verified   the  sending of the duke of guise into italy  and the assistance he brought to  pope paul iv   then at war with the new king of spain  philip ii   were  considered as a violation of the truce of vaucelles   henry ii  had  expected as much  and had ordered coligny  who was commanding in picardy  and flanders  to hold himself in readiness to take the field as soon as  he should be  if not forced  at any rate naturally called upon  by any  unforeseen event   it cost coligny  who was a man of scrupulous honor  a  great struggle to lightly break a truce he had just signed  nevertheless   in january        when he heard that the french were engaged in italy in  the war between the pope and the spaniards  he did not consider that he  could possibly remain inactive in flanders   he took by surprise the town  of lens  between lille and arras   philip ii   on his side  had taken  measures for promptly entering upon the campaign   by his marriage with  mary tudor  queen of england  he had secured for himself a powerful ally  in the north  the english parliament were but little disposed to  compromise themselves in a war with france  but in march        philip  went to london  the queen s influence and the distrust excited in england  by henry ii  prevailed over the pacific desires of the nation  and mary  sent a simple herald to carry to the king of france at rheims her  declaration of war   henry accepted it politely  but resolutely    i speak to you in this way   said he to the herald   because it is a  queen who sends you  had it been a king  i would speak to you in a very  different tone   and he ordered him to be gone forthwith from the  kingdom   a negotiation was commenced for accomplishing the marriage   long since agreed upon  between the young queen of scotland  mary stuart   and henry ii  s son  francis  dauphin of france   mary  who was born on  the  th of december        at falkland castle in scotland  had  since        lived and received her education at the court of france  whither  her mother  mary of lorraine  eldest sister of francis of guise and  queen dowager of scotland  had lost no time in sending her as soon as the  future union between the two children had been agreed upon between the  two courts   the dauphin of france was a year younger than the scottish

mary stuart was styled in france queen dauphiness  and her  husband  with the authorization of the scottish commissioners  took the  title of king dauphin    etiquette required at that time that the heir to  the throne should hold his court separately  and not appear at the king s  court save on grand occasions   the young couple resigned themselves  without any difficulty to this exile  and retired to villers cotterets      histoire de marie stuart   by jules gauthier  t  i   p          whilst preparations were being made at paris for the rejoicings in honor  of the union of the two royal children  war broke out in picardy and  flanders   philip ii  had landed there with an army of forty seven  thousand men  of whom seven thousand were english   never did any great  sovereign and great politician provoke and maintain for long such  important wars without conducting them in some other fashion than from  the recesses of his cabinet  and without ever having exposed his own life  on the field of battle   the spanish army was under the orders of  emmanuel philibert  duke of savoy  a young warrior of thirty  who had won  the confidence of charles v   he led it to the siege of saint quentin   a place considered as one of the bulwarks of the kingdom   philip ii   remained at some leagues  distance in the environs   henry ii  was ill  prepared for so serious an attack  his army  which was scarcely twenty  thousand strong  mustered near laon under the orders of the duke of  nevers  governor of champagne  at the end of july        it hurried into  picardy  under the command of the constable de montmorency  who was  supported by admiral de coligny  his nephew  by the duke of enghien  by  the prince of condo  and by the duke of montpensier  by nearly all the  great lords and valiant warriors of france  they soon saw that saint   quentin was in a deplorable state of defence  the fortifications were old  and badly kept up  soldiers  munitions of war  and victuals were all  equally deficient   coligny did not hesitate  however he threw himself  into the place on the  d of august  during the night  with a small corps  of seven hundred men and saint remy  a skilful engineer  who had already  distinguished himself in the defence of metz  the admiral packed off the  useless mouths  repaired the walls at the points principally threatened   and reanimated the failing courage of the inhabitants   the constable and  his army came within hail of the place  and d andelot  coligny s brother   managed with great difficulty to get four hundred and fifty men into it   on the   th of august the battle was begun between the two armies   the  constable affected to despise the duke of savoy s youth    i will soon  show him   said he   a move of an old soldier    the french army  very  inferior in numbers  was for a moment on the point of being surrounded   the prince of conde sent the constable warning    i was serving in the  field   answered montmorency   before the prince of conde came into the  world  i have good hopes of still giving him lessons in the art of war  for some years to come    the valor of the constable and his comrades in  arms could not save them from the consequences of their stubborn  recklessness and their numerical inferiority  the battalions of gascon  infantry closed their ranks  with pikes to the front  and made an heroic  resistance  but all in vain  against repeated charges of the spanish  cavalry  and the defeat was total   more than three thousand men were  killed  the number of prisoners amounted to double  and the constable   left upon the field with his thigh shattered by a cannon ball  fell into  the hands of the spaniards  as was also the case with the dukes of  longueville and montpensier  la rochefoucauld  d aubigne   c            the duke of enghien  viscount de turenne  and a multitude of others  many  great names amidst a host of obscure  fell in the fight   the duke of  nevers and the prince of

whom the duke of nevers threw into the place at a loss of  three times as many   coligny held out for a fortnight longer  behind  walls that were in ruins and were assailed by a victorious army   at  length  on the   th of august  the enemy entered saint quentin by shoals    the admiral  who was still going about the streets with a few men to  make head against them  found himself hemmed in on all sides  and did all  he could to fall into the hands of a spaniard  preferring rather to await  on the spot the common fate than to incur by flight any shame and  reproach   he who took him prisoner  after having set him to rest a while  at the foot of the ramparts  took him away to their camp  where  as he  entered  he met captain alonzo de cazieres  commandant of the old bands  of spanish infantry  when up came the duke of savoy  who ordered the said  cazieres to take the admiral to his tent      commentaire de francois de  rabutin sur les guerres entre henri ii   roi de france  et

were not long before they surrendered     philip  with anxious modesty  sent information of his victory to his  father  charles  who had been in retirement since february           at  the monastery of yuste    as i did not happen to be there myself   he  said at the end of his letter   about which i am heavy at heart as to  what your majesty will possibly think  i can only tell you from hearsay  what took place    we have not the reply of charles v  to his son  but  his close confidant  quejada  wrote   the emperor felt at this news one  of the greatest thrills of satisfaction he has ever had  but  to tell you  the truth  i perceive by his manner that he cannot reconcile himself to  the thought that his son was not there  and with good reason    after  that saint quentin had surrendered  the duke of savoy wanted to march  forward and strike affrighted france to the very heart  and the aged  emperor was of his mind    is the king my son at paris   he said  when he  heard of his victory   philip had thought differently about it instead of  hurling his army on paris  he had moved it back to saint quentin  and  kept it for the reduction of places in the neighborhood    the  spaniards   says rabutin   might have accomplished our total  extermination  and taken from us all hope of setting ourselves up again            but the supreme ruler  the god of victories  pulled them up  quite short    an unlooked for personage  queen catherine de  medici   then for the first time entered actively upon the scene   we borrow the  very words of the venetian ambassadors who lived within her sphere   the  first  lorenzo contarini  wrote in        the queen is younger than the  king  but only thirteen days  she is not pretty  but she is possessed of  extraordinary wisdom and prudence  no doubt of her being fit to govern   nevertheless she is not consulted or considered so much as she well might  be    five years later  in       after the battle and capture of  saint quentin  france was in a fit of stupor  paris believed the enemy  to be already beneath her walls  many of the burgesses were packing up  and flying  some to orleans  some to bourges  some still farther   the  king had gone to compiegne  to get together   says brantome   a fresh  army       illustration  catherine de  medici  in her young days             queen catherine was alone at paris   of her own motion  she went to the  parliament  according to the  memoires de la chatre  it was to the hotel  de ville that she went and made her address  in full state  accompanied  by the cardinals  princes  and princesses  and there  in the most  impressive language  she set forth the urgent state of affairs at the  moment   she pointed out that  in spite of the enormous expenses into  which the most christian king had found himself drawn in his late wars   he had shown the greatest care not to burden the towns   in the  continuous and extreme pressure of requirements her majesty did not think  that any further charge could be made on the people of the country  places  who in ordinary times always bear the greatest burden   with so  much sentiment and eloquence that she touched the heart of everybody  the  queen then explained to the parliament that the king had need of three  hundred thousand livres  twenty five thousand to be paid every two  months  and she added that she would retire from the place of session  so  as not to interfere with liberty of discussion  and she  accordingly   retired to an adjoining room   a resolution to comply with the wishes of  her majesty was voted  and the queen  having resumed her place  received  a promise to that effect   a hundred notables of the city offered to give  at once three thousand francs apiece   the queen thanked them in the  sweetest form of words  and thus terminated this session of parliament  with so much applause for her majesty and such lively marks of  satisfaction at her behavior that no idea can be given of them   throughout the whole city nothing was spoken of but the queen s prudence  and the happy manner in which she proceeded in this enterprise      such is the account  not of a french courtier  but of the venetian  ambassador  giacomo lorenzo  writing confidentially to his government   from that day the position of catherine de  medici was changed in france   amongst the people as well as at court    the king went more often to see  her  he added to his habits that of holding court at her apartments for  about an hour every day after supper in the midst of the lords and  ladies    it is not to be discovered anywhere in the contemporary  memoires  whether catherine had anything to do with the resolution taken  by henry ii  on returning from compiegne  but she thenceforward assumed  her place  and gave a foretaste of the part she was to play in the  government of france   unhappily for the honor of catherine and for the  welfare of france  that part soon ceased to be judicious  dignified  and  salutary  as it had been on that day of its first exhibition     on entering paris again the king at once sent orders to the duke of guise  to return in haste from italy with all the troops he could bring   every  eye and every hope were fixed upon the able and heroic defender of metz   who had forced charles v  to retreat before him   a general appeal was at  the same time addressed to  all soldiers  gentlemen and others  who had  borne or were capable of bearing arms  to muster at laon under the duke  of nevers  in order to be employed for the service of the king and for  the tuition  protection  of their country  their families  and their  property    guise arrived on the   th of october        at  saint germain en laye  where the court happened to be just then  every  mark of favor was lavished upon him  all the resources of the state were  put at his disposal  there was even some talk of appointing him viceroy   but henry ii  confined himself to proclaiming him  on the very day of  his arrival  lieutenant general of the armies throughout the whole  extent of the monarchy  both within and without the realm   his brother   the cardinal of lorraine  who was as ambitious and almost as able as he   had the chief direction in civil  financial  and diplomatic affairs   never  since the great mayors of the palace under the merovingian kings   had similar power been in the hands of a subject   like a man born to  command  guise saw that  in so complicated a situation  a brilliant  stroke must be accomplished and a great peril be met by a great success    he racked his brains for all sorts of devices for enabling him to do  some remarkable deed which might humble the pride of that haughty  spanish nation and revive the courage of his own men  and he took it  that those things which the enemy considered as the most secure would be  the least carefully guarded   some years previously it had been  suggested to the constable that an attempt might be made upon calais   negligently guarded as it was  and the place itself not being in good  order   the duke of guise put the idea of this enterprise forward once  more  and begged the king s permission to attempt it  without saying a  word about it to anybody else  which the king considered to be a very  good notion    guise took the command of the army  and made a feint of  directing its movements towards an expedition in the east of the  kingdom  but  suddenly turning westwards  he found himself on the night  of january          beneath the walls of calais   whither  with right  good will  all the princes  lords  and soldiers had marched    on the  d  of january he took the two forts of nieullay and risbank  which covered  the approaches to the place   on the  th he prepared for  and on the  th  he delivered  the assault upon the citadel itself  which was carried  he  left there his brother  the duke of aumale  with a sufficient force for  defence  the portion of the english garrison which had escaped at the  assault fell back within the town  the governor  lord wentworth   like a  man in desperation  who saw he was all but lost   made vain attempts to  recover this important post under cover of night and of the high sea   which rendered impossible the prompt arrival of any aid for the french   but  they held their own inside the castle    the english requested the  duke of aumale  to parley so as to come to some honorable and reasonable  terms   and guise assented   on the  th of january  whilst he was  conferring in his tent with the representatives of the governor   coligny s brother  d andelot  entered the town at the solicitation of  the english themselves  who were afraid of being all put to the sword   the capitulation was signed   the inhabitants  with their wives and  children  had their lives spared  and received permission to leave  calais freely and without any insult  and withdraw to england or  flanders   lord wentworth and fifty other persons  to be chosen by the  duke of guise  remained prisoners of war  with this exception  all the  soldiers were to return to england  but with empty hands   the place was  left with all the cannons  arms  munitions  utensils  engines of war   flags and standards which happened to be in it  the furniture  the gold  and silver  coined or other  the merchandise  and the horses passed over  to the disposal of the duke of guise   lastly the vanquished  when they  quitted the town  were to leave it intact  having no power to pull down  houses  unpave streets  throw up earth  displace a single stone  pull  out a single nail   the conqueror s precautions were as deliberate as  his audacity had been sudden   on the  th of january        after a  week s siege  calais  which had been in the hands of the english for two  hundred and ten years  once more became a french town  in spite of the  inscription which was engraved on one of its gates  and which may be  turned into the following distich                      a siege of calais may seem good                 when lead and iron swim like wood      the joy was so much the greater in that it was accompanied by great  surprise  save a few members of the king s council  nobody expected this  conquest    i certainly thought that you must be occupied in preparing  for some great exploit  and that you wished to wait until you could  apprise me of the execution rather than the design   wrote marshal de  brissac to the duke of guise  on the   d of january  from italy   foreigners were not less surprised than the french themselves  they had  supposed that france would remain for a long while under the effects of  the reverse experienced at saint quentin    the loss of calais   said  pope paul iv    will be the only dowry that the queen of england will  obtain from her marriage with philip   for france such a conquest is  preferable to that of half the kingdom of england    when mary tudor   already seriously ill  heard the news  she exclaimed from her deathbed   on the   th of january   if my heart is opened  there will be found  graven upon it the word calais    and when the grand prior of france  on  repairing to the court of his sister  mary of lorraine  in scotland  went  to visit queen elizabeth  who had succeeded mary tudor  she  after she  had made him dance several times with her  said to him   my dear prior  i  like you very much  but not your brother  who robbed me of my town of  calais      guise was one of those who knew that it is as necessary to follow up a  success accomplished as to proceed noiselessly in the execution of a  sudden success   when he was master of calais he moved rapidly upon the  neighboring fortresses of guines and ham  and he had them in his power  within a few days  notwithstanding a resistance more stout than he had  encountered at calais   during the same time the duke of nevers   encouraged by such examples  also took the field again  and gained  possession  in champagne and the neighborhood  of the strong castles of  herbemont  jamoigne  chigny  rossignol  and villemont   guise had no idea  of contenting himself with his successes in the west of france  his  ambition carried him into the east also  to the environs of metz  the  scene of his earliest glory   he heard that vieilleville  who had become  governor of metz  was setting about the reduction of thionville   the  best picture of a fortress i ever saw   says montluc    i have heard    wrote guise to vieilleville   that you have a fine enterprise on hand  i  pray you do not commence the execution of it  in any fashion whatever   until i be with you  having given a good account of calais and guines  as  lieutenant general of his majesty in this realm  i should be very vexed  if there should be done therein anything of honor and importance without  my presence    he arrived before thionville on the  th of june         vieilleville and his officers were much put out at his interference    the duke might surely have dispensed with coming   said d estrees  chief  officer of artillery   it will be easy for him to swallow what is all  chewed ready for him    but the bulk of the army did not share this  feeling of jealousy   when the pioneers  drawn up  caught sight of guise    come on  sir   they cried   come and let us die before thionville  we  have been expecting you this long while    the siege lasted three weeks  longer   guise had with him two comrades of distinction  the italian  peter strozzi  and the gascon blaise do montluc   on the   th of june  strozzi was mortally wounded by an arquebuse shot  at the very side of  guise  who was talking to him with a hand upon his shoulder    ah  by  god s head  sir   cried strozzi  in italian   the king to day loses a  good servant  and so does your excellency    guise  greatly moved   attempted to comfort him  and spoke to him the name of jesus christ  but  strozzi was one of those infidels so common at that time in italy     sdeath   said he   what jesus are you come hither to remind me of   i believe in no god  my game is played     you will appear to day before  his face   persisted guise  in the earnestness of his faith     sdeath    replied strozzi   i shall be where all the others are who have died in  the last six thousand years    the eyes of guise remained fixed a while  upon his comrade dying in such a frame of mind  but he soon turned all  his thoughts once more to the siege of thionville   montluc supported him  valiantly   a strong tower still held out  and montluc carried it at the  head of his men   guise rushed up and threw his arm round the warrior s  neck  saying   monseigneur  i now see clearly that the old proverb is  quite infallible   a good horse will go to the last   i am off at once to  my quarters to report the capture to the king   be assured that i shall  not conceal from him the service you have done    the reduction of  thionville was accomplished on that very day  june            that of  arlon  a rich town in the neighborhood  followed very closely   guise   thoroughly worn out  had ordered the approaches to be made next morning  at daybreak  requesting that he might be left to sleep until he awoke of  himself  when he did awake  he inquired whether the artillery had yet  opened fire  he was told that montluc had surprised the place during the  night    that is making the pace very fast   said he  as he made the sign  of the cross  but he did not care to complain about it   under the  impulse communicated by him the fortunes of france were reviving  everywhere   a check received before gravelines  on the   th of july         by a division commanded by de termes  governor of calais  did not  subdue the national elation and its effect upon the enemy themselves    it is an utter impossibility for me to keep up the war   wrote philip  ii   on the   th of february        to granvelle   on both sides there  was a desire for peace  and conferences were opened at cateau cambresis   on the  th of february        a convention was agreed upon for a truce  which was to last during the whole course of the negotiation  and for six  days after the separation of the plenipotentiaries  in case no peace took  place     it was concluded on the  d of april        between henry ii  and  elizabeth  who had become queen of england at the

whilst serving in the spanish army  was  fitting himself to become the leader of the reformers  and the liberator  of the low countries   by the treaty with england  france was to keep  calais for eight years in the first instance  and on a promise to pay  five hundred thousand gold crowns to queen elizabeth or her successors   the money was never paid  and calais was never restored  and this without  the english government s having considered that it could make the matter  a motive for renewing the war   by the treaty with spain  france was to  keep metz  toul  and verdun  and have back saint quentin  le catelet  and  ham  but she was to restore to spain or her allies a hundred and  eighty nine places in flanders  piedmont  tuscany  and corsica   the  malcontents  for the absence of political liberty does not suppress  them entirely  raised their voices energetically against this last  treaty signed by the king  with the sole desire  it was supposed  of  obtaining the liberation of his two favorites  the constable de  montmorency and marshal de saint andre  who had been prisoners in spain  since the defeat at saint quentin    their ransom   it was said   has  cost the kingdom more than that of francis i    guise himself said to  the king   a stroke of your majesty s pen costs more to france than  thirty years of war cost   ever since that time the majority of  historians  even the most enlightened  have joined in the censure that  was general in the sixteenth century  but their opinion will not be  indorsed here  the places which france had won during the war  and which  she retained by the peace   metz  toul  and verdun on her frontier in  the north east  facing the imperial or spanish possessions  and boulogne  and calais on her coasts in the north west  facing england   were  as  regarded the integrity of the state and the security of the inhabitants   of infinitely more importance than those which she gave up in flanders  and italy   the treaty of cateau cambresis  too  marked the termination  of those wars of ambition and conquest which the kings of france had  waged beyond the alps an injudicious policy  which  for four reigns  had  crippled and wasted the resources of france in adventurous expeditions   beyond the limits of her geographical position and her natural and  permanent interests     more or less happily  the treaty of cateau cambreis had regulated all  those questions of external policy which were burdensome to france  she  was once more at peace with her neighbors  and seemed to have nothing  more to do than to gather in the fruits thereof   but she had in her own  midst questions far more difficult of solution than those of her external  policy  and these perils from within were threatening her more seriously  than any from without   since the death of francis i   the religious  ferment had pursued its course  becoming more general and more fierce   the creed of the reformers had spread very much  their number had very  much increased  permanent churches  professing and submitting to a fixed  faith and discipline  had been founded  that of paris was the first  in        and the example had been followed at orleans  at chartres  at  lyons  at toulouse  at rochelle  in normandy  in touraine  in guienne  in  poitou  in dauphiny  in provence  and in all the provinces  more or less   in       it was calculated that there were twenty one hundred and fifty  reformed  or  as the expression then was  rectified  dressees   churches    and this is no fanciful figure  it is the result of a census taken at  the instigation of the deputies who represented the reformed churches at  the conference of poissy on the demand of catherine de  medici  and in  conformity with the advice of admiral de coligny      la reformation en  france pendant sa premiere periode   by henri luttheroth  pp             it is clear that the movement of the reformation in the sixteenth century  was one of those spontaneous and powerful movements which have their  source and derive their strength from the condition of men s souls and  of whole communities  and not merely from the personal ambitions and  interests which soon come and mingle with them  whether it be to promote  or to retard them   one thing has been already here stated and confirmed  by facts  it was specially in france that the reformation had this truly  religious and sincere character  very far from supporting or tolerating  it  the sovereign and public authorities opposed it from its very birth   under francis i  it had met with no real defenders but its martyrs  and  it was still the same under henry ii   during the reign of francis i    within a space of twenty three years  there had been eighty one capital  executions for heresy  during that of henry ii   twelve years  there were  ninety seven for the same cause  and at one of these executions henry ii   was present in person  on the space in front of notre dame  a spectacle  which francis i  had always refused to see   in             and        henry ii   by three royal edicts  kept up and added to all the  prohibitions and penalties in force against the reformers   in       the  massacre of the vaudians was still in such lively and odious remembrance  that a noble lady of provence  madame de cental  did not hesitate to  present a complaint  in the name of her despoiled  proscribed  and  murdered vassals  against the cardinal de tournon  the count de grignan   and the premier president maynier d oppede  as having abused  for the  purpose of getting authority for this massacre  the religious feelings of  the king  who on his death bed had testified his remorse for it    this  cause   says de thou   was pleaded with much warmth  and occupied fifty  audiences  with a large concourse of people  but the judgment took all  the world by surprise   guerin alone  advocate general in       having no  support at court  was condemned to death  and was scape goat for all the  rest   d oppede defended himself with fanatical pride  saying that he  only executed the king s orders  like saul  whom god commanded to  exterminate the amalekites   he had the duke of guise to protect him  and  he was sent back to discharge the duties of his office   such was the  prejudice of the parliament of paris against the reformers that it  interdicted the hedge schools   ecoles buissonnieres    schools which the  protestants held out in the country to escape from the jurisdiction of  the precentor of notre dame de paris  who had the sole supervision of  primary schools   hence comes the proverb  to play truant   faire l ecole  buissonniere  to go to hedge school     all the resources of french civil  jurisdiction appeared to be insufficient against the reformers   henry  ii  asked the pope for a bull  transplanting into france the spanish  inquisition  the only real means of extirpating the root of the errors    it was the characteristic of this inquisition  that it was completely in  the hands of the clergy  and that its arm was long enough to reach the  lay and the clerical indifferently   pope paul iv  readily gave the king   in april        the bull he asked for  but the parliament of paris  refused to enregister the royal edict which gave force in france to the  pontifical brief   in      the pope replied to this refusal by a bull  which comprised in one and the same anathema all heretics  though they  might be kings or emperors  and declared them to have  forfeited their  benefices  states  kingdoms  or empires  the which should devolve on the  first to seize them  without power on the part of the holy see itself to  restore them      magnum bullarium romanum  a beato leone magno ad  paulum iv    t  i   p       luxembourg         the parliament would not  consent to enregister the decree unless there were put in it a condition  to the effect that clerics alone should be liable to the inquisition  and  that the judges should be taken from amongst the clergy of france   for  all their passionate opposition to the reformation  the magistrates had  no idea of allowing either the kingship or france to fall beneath the  yoke of the papacy     amidst all these disagreements and distractions in the very heart of  catholicism  the reformation went on growing from day to day   in        lorenzo  the venetian ambassador  set down even then the number of the  reformers at four hundred thousand   in       at the death of henry ii    claude haton  a priest and contemporary chronicler on the catholic side   calculated that they were nearly a quarter of the population of france   they held at paris  in may        their first general synod  and eleven  fully established churches sent deputies to it   this synod drew up a  form of faith called the gallican confession  and likewise a form of  discipline    the burgess class  for a long while so indifferent to the  burnings that took place  were astounded at last at the constancy with  which the pile was mounted by all those men and all those women who had  nothing to do but to recant in order to save their lives   some could not  persuade themselves that people so determined were not in the right   others were moved with compassion    their very hearts   say  contemporaries   wept together with their eyes     it needed only an  opportunity to bring these feelings out   some of the faithful one day in  the month of may        on the public walk in the pre aux clercs  began  to sing the psalms of marot   their singing had been forbidden by the  parliament of bordeaux  but the practice of singing those psalms had but  lately been so general that it could not be looked upon as peculiar to  heretics   all who happened to be there  suddenly animated by one and the  same feeling  joined in with the singers  as if to protest against the  punishments which were being repeated day after day   this manifestation  was renewed on the following days   the king of navarre  anthony de  bourbon  prince louis de conde  his brother  and many lords took part in  it together with a crowd  it is said  of five or six thousand persons   it was not in the pre aux clercs only and by singing that this new state  of mind revealed itself amongst the highest classes as well as amongst  the populace   the queen of navarre  jeanne d albret  in her early youth    was as fond of a ball as of a sermon   says brantome   and she had  advised her spouse  anthony de bourbon  who inclined towards calvinism   not to perplex himself with all these opinions    in      she was  passionately devoted to the faith and the cause of the reformation   with  more levity  but still in sincerity  her brother in law  louis de conde   put his ambition and his courage at the service of the same cause   admiral de coligny s youngest brother  francis d andelot  declared  himself a reformer to henry ii  himself  who  in his wrath  threw a plate  at his head  and sent him to prison in the castle of melun   coligny  himself  who had never disguised the favorable sentiments he felt towards  the reformers  openly sided with them on the ground of his own personal  faith  as well as of the justice due to them   at last the reformation  had really great leaders  men who had power and were experienced in the  affairs of the world  it was becoming a political party as well as a  religious conviction  and the french reformers were henceforth in a  condition to make war as well as die at the stake for their faith   hitherto they had been only believers and martyrs  they became the  victors and the vanquished  alternately  in a civil war     a new position for them  and as formidable as it was grand   it was  destined to bring upon them cruel trials and the worth of them in  important successes  first  the saint bartholomew  then the accession of  henry iv  and the edict of nantes   at a later period  under louis xiii   and louis xiv   the complication of the religious question and the  political question cost them the advantages they had won  the edict of  nantes disappeared together with the power of the protestants in the  state   they were no longer anything but heretics and rebels   a day was  to come  when  by the force alone of moral ideas  and in the name alone  of conscience and justice  they would recover all the rights they had for  a time possessed  and more also  but in the sixteenth century that day  was still distant  and armed strife was for the reformers their only  means of defence and salvation   god makes no account of centuries  and a  great deal is required before the most certain and the most salutary  truths get their place and their rights in the minds and communities of  men     on the   th of june        a brilliant tournament was celebrated in lists  erected at the end of the street of saint antoine  almost at the foot of  the bastille   henry ii   the queen  and the whole court had been present  at it for three days   the entertainment was drawing to a close   the  king  who had run several tilts  like a sturdy and skilful cavalier    wished to break yet another lance  and bade the count de montgomery   captain of the guards  to run against him   montgomery excused himself   but the king insisted   the tilt took place   the two jousters  on  meeting  broke their lances skilfully  but montgomery forgot to drop at  once  according to usage  the fragment remaining in his hand  he  unintentionally struck the king s helmet and raised the visor  and a  splinter of wood entered henry s eye  who fell forward upon his horse s  neck   all the appliances of art were useless  the brain had been  injured   henry ii  languished for eleven days  and expired on the   th  of july        aged forty years and some months   an insignificant man   and a reign without splendor  though fraught with facts pregnant of grave  consequences      illustration  joust between henri ii  and count de montgomery                    chapter xxxii     francis ii    july           december             during the course  and especially at the close of henry ii  s reign  two  rival matters  on the one hand the numbers  the quality  and the zeal of  the reformers  and on the other  the anxiety  prejudice  and power of the  catholics  had been simultaneously advancing in development and growth   between the   th of may        and the   th of july        fifteen  capital sentences had been executed in dauphiny  in normandy  in poitou   and at paris   two royal edicts  one dated july           and the other  june           had renewed and aggravated the severity of penal  legislation against heretics   to secure the registration of the latter   henry ii   together with the princes and the officers of the crown  had  repaired in person to parliament  some disagreement had already appeared  in the midst of that great body  which was then composed of a hundred and  thirty magistrates  the seniors who sat in the great chamber had in  general shown themselves to be more inclined to severity  and the juniors  who formed the chamber called la tournelle more inclined to indulgence  towards accusations of heresy   the disagreement reached its climax in  the very presence of the king   two councillors  dubourg and dufaure   spoke so warmly of reforms which were  according to them  necessary and  legitimate  that their adversaries did not hesitate to tax them with  being reformers themselves   the king had them arrested  and three of  their colleagues with them   special commissioners were charged with the  preparation of the case against them   it has already been mentioned that  one of the most considerable amongst the officers of the army  francis  d andelot  brother of admiral coligny  had  for the same cause  been  subjected to a burst of anger on the part of the king   he was in prison  at meaux when henry ii  died   such were the personal feelings and the  relative positions of the two parties when francis ii   a boy of sixteen   a poor creature both in mind and body  ascended the throne      illustration  francis ii            deputies from parliament went  according to custom  to offer their  felicitations to the new king  and to ask him  to whom it was his  pleasure that they should  thenceforward  apply for to learn his will and  receive his commands    francis ii  replied   with the approbation of the  queen my mother  i have chosen the duke of guise and the cardinal of  lorraine  my uncles  to have the direction of the state  the former will  take charge of the department of war  the latter the administration of  finance and justice    such had  in fact  been his choice  and it was no  doubt with his mother s approbation that he had made it   equally  attentive to observe the proprieties and to secure her own power   catherine de  medici  when going out to drive with her son and her  daughter in law mary stuart  on the very day of henry ii  s death  said  to mary   step in  madame  it is now your turn to go first       illustration  mary stuart            during the first days of mourning she kept herself in a room entirely  hung with black  and there was no light beyond two wax candles burning on  an altar covered with black cloth   she had upon her head a black veil   which shrouded her entirely  and hid her face  and  when any one of the  household went to speak to her  she replied in so agitated and so weak  a tone of voice that it was impossible to catch her words  whatever  attention might be paid to them   but her presence of mind and her  energy  so far as the government was concerned  were by no means affected  by it  he who had been the principal personage at the court under henry  ii   the constable de montmorency  perfectly understood  at his first  interview with the queen mother  that he was dismissed  and all he asked  of her was  that he might go and enjoy his repose in freedom at his  residence of chantilly  begging her at the same time to take under her  protection the heirs of his house   henry ii  s favorite  diana de  poitiers  was dismissed more harshly    the king sent to tell madame de  valentinois   writes the venetian ambassador   that for her evil  influence   mali officii   over the king his father she would deserve  heavy chastisement  but  in his royal clemency  he did not wish to  disquiet her any further  she must  nevertheless  restore to him all the  jewels given her by the king his father     to bend catherine de  medici   diana was also obliged   says de thou   to give up her beautiful house at  chenonceaux on the cher  and she received in exchange the castle of  chaumont on the loire    the guises obtained all the favors of the court  at the same time that they were invested with all the powers of the  state     in order to give a good notion of duke francis of guise and his brother  the cardinal of lorraine  the two heads of the house  we will borrow the  very words of those two men of their age who had the best means of seeing  them close and judging them correctly  the french historian de thou and  the venetian ambassador john micheli    the cardinal of lorraine   says  de thou   was of an impetuous and violent character  the duke of guise   on the contrary  was of a gentle and moderate disposition   but as  ambition soon overleaps the confines of restraint and equity  he was  carried away by the violent counsels of the cardinal  or else surrendered  himself to them of his own accord  executing with admirable prudence and  address the plans which were always chalked out by his brother    the  venetian ambassador enters into more precise and full details    the  cardinal   he says   who is the leading man of the house  would be  by  common consent  if it were not for the defects of which i shall speak   the greatest political power in this kingdom   he has not yet completed  his thirty seventh year  he is endowed with a marvellous intellect  which  apprehends from half a word the meaning of those who converse with him   he has an astonishing memory  a fine and noble face  and a rare eloquence  which shows itself freely on any subject  but especially in matters of  politics   he is very well versed in letters  he knows greek  latin  and  italian   he is very strong in the sciences  chiefly in theology   the  externals of his life are very proper and very suitable to his dignity   which could not be said of the other cardinals and prelates  whose habits  are too scandalously irregular   but his great defect is shameful  cupidity  which would employ  to attain its ends  even criminal means   and likewise great duplicity  whence comes his habit of scarcely ever  saying that which is   there is worse behind   he is considered to be  very ready to take offence  vindictive  envious  and far too slow in  benefaction   he excited universal hatred by hurting all the world as  long as it was in his power to   as for mgr  de guise  who is the eldest  of the six brothers  he cannot be spoken of save as a man of war  a good  officer   none in this realm has delivered more battles and confronted  more dangers   everybody lauds his courage  his vigilance  his steadiness  in war  and his coolness  a quality wonderfully rare in a frenchman   his  peculiar defects are  first of all  stinginess towards soldiers  then he  makes large promises  and even when he means to keep his promise he is  infinitely slow about it      to the sketch of the cardinal of lorraine brantome adds that he was    as indeed he said  a coward by nature   a strange defect in a guise     it was a great deal  towards securing the supremacy of a great family  and its leading members  to thus possess the favor of the court and the  functions of government  but the power of the guises had a still higher  origin and a still deeper foundation    it was then   said michael de  castelnau  one of the most intelligent and most impartial amongst the  chroniclers of the sixteenth century   that schism and divisions in  religious matters began to be mixed up with affairs of state   well  all  the clergy of france  and nearly all the noblesse and the people who  belonged to the roman religion  considered that the cardinal of lorraine  and the duke of guise were  as it were  called of god to preserve the  catholic religion established in france for the last twelve hundred  years   and it seemed to them not only an act of impiety to change or  alter it in any way whatever  but also an impossibility to do so without  ruin to the state   the late king  henry  had made a decree in the month  of june        being then at ecouen  by which the judges were bound to  sentence all lutherans to death  and which was published and confirmed by  all the parliaments  without any limitation or modification whatever  and  with a warning to the judges not to mitigate the penalty  as they had  done for some years previously   different judgments were pronounced upon  the decree  those who took the most political and most zealous view of  religion considered that it was necessary  as well to preserve and  maintain the catholic religion as to keep down the seditious  who  under  the cloak of religion  were doing all they could to upset the political  condition of the kingdom   others  who cared nothing for religion  or for  the state  or for order in the body politic  also thought the decree  necessary  not at all for the purpose of exterminating the protestants     for they held that it would tend to multiply them   but because it  would offer a means of enriching themselves by the confiscations ensuing  upon condemnation  and because the king would thus be able to pay off  forty two millions of livres which he owed  and have money in hand  and   besides that  satisfy those who were demanding recompense for the  services they had rendered the crown  wherein many placed their hopes      memoires de michael de castelnau  in the petitot collection   series  i   t  xxxiii   pp             the guises were  in the sixteenth century  the representatives and the  champions of these different cliques and interests  religious or  political  sincere in their belief or shameless in their avidity  and  all united under the flag of the catholic church   and so  when they came  into power   there was nothing   says a protestant chronicler   but fear  and trembling at their name    their acts of government soon confirmed  the fears as well as the hopes they had inspired   during the last six  months of      the edict issued by henry ii  from ecouen was not only  strictly enforced  but aggravated by fresh edicts  a special chamber was  appointed and chosen amongst the parliament of paris  which was to have  sole cognizance of crimes and offences against the catholic religion   a  proclamation of the new king  francis ii   ordained that houses in which  assemblies of reformers took place should be razed and demolished   it  was death to the promoters of  unlawful assemblies for purposes of  religion or for any other cause    another royal act provided that all  persons  even relatives  who received amongst them any one condemned for  heresy should seize him and bring him to justice  in default whereof they  would suffer the same penalty as he   individual condemnations and  executions abounded after these general measures  between the  d of  august and the   st of december        eighteen persons were burned alive  for open heresy  or for having refused to communicate according to the  rites of the catholic church  or go to mass  or for having hawked about  forbidden books   finally  in december  the five councillors of the  parliament of paris  whom  six months previously  henry ii  had ordered  to be arrested and shut up in the bastille  were dragged from prison and  brought to trial   the chief of them  anne dubourg  nephew of anthony  dubourg  chancellor of france under francis i   defended himself with  pious and patriotic persistency  being determined to exhaust all points  of law and all the chances of justice he could hope for without betraying  his faith   everything shows that he had nothing to hope for from his  judges  one of them  the president minard  as he was returning from the  palace on the evening of december           was killed by a pistol shot   the assassin could not be discovered  but the crime  naturally ascribed  to some friend of dubourg  served only to make certain and to hasten the  death of the prisoner on trial   dubourg was condemned on the   d of  december  and heard unmoved the reading of his sentence    i forgive my  judges   said he   they have judged according to their own lights  not  according to the light that comes from on high   put out your fires  ye  senators  be converted  and live happily   think without ceasing of god  and on god    after these words  which were taken down by the clerk of  the court   and which i have here copied   says de thou  dubourg was  taken on the   d of december  in a tumbrel to the place de greve   as he  mounted the ladder he was heard repeating several times   forsake me not   my god  for fear lest i forsake thee    he was strangled before he was  cast into the flames  de thou  t  iii   pp            the sole favor his  friends could obtain for him     but extreme severity on the part of the powers that be is effectual only  when it falls upon a country or upon parties that are effete with age  or  already vanquished and worn out by long struggles  when  on the contrary   it is brought to bear upon parties in the flush of youth  eager to  proclaim and propagate themselves  so far from intimidating them  it  animates them  and thrusts them into the arena into which they were of  themselves quite eager to enter   as soon as the rule of the catholic   in the persons and by the actions of the guises  became sovereign and  aggressive  the threatened reformers put themselves into the attitude of  defence   they too had got for themselves great leaders  some valiant and  ardent  others prudent or even timid  but forced to declare themselves  when the common cause was greatly imperilled   the house of bourbon   issuing from st  louis  had for its representatives in the sixteenth  century anthony de bourbon  king of navarre and husband of jeanne  d albret  and his brother louis de bourbon  prince of conde   the king of  navarre  weak and irresolute though brave enough  wavered between  catholicism and the reformation  inclining rather in his heart to the  cause of the reformation  to which the queen his wife  who at first  showed indifference  had before long become passionately attached   his  brother  the prince of conde  young  fiery  and often flighty and rash   put himself openly at the head of the reformed party   the house of  bourbon held itself to be the rival perforce of the house of lorraine   it had amongst the high noblesse of france two allies  more fitted than  any others for fighting and for command  admiral de coligny and his  brother  francis d andelot  both of them nephews of the constable anne de  montmorency  both of them already experienced and famous warriors  and  both of them devoted  heart and soul  to the cause of the reformation   thus  at the accession of francis ii   whilst the catholic party  by  means of the guises  and with the support of the majority of the country   took in hand the government of france  the reforming party ranged  themselves round the king of navarre  the prince of conde  and admiral de  coligny  and became  under their direction  though in a minority  a  powerful opposition  able and ready  on the one hand  to narrowly watch  and criticise the actions of those who were in power  and on the other to  claim for their own people  not by any means freedom as a general  principle in the constitution of the state  but free manifestation of  their faith  and free exercise of their own form of worship     apart from  we do not mean to say above these two great parties  which  were arrayed in the might and appeared as the representatives of the  national ideas and feelings  the queen mother  catherine de  medici  was  quietly laboring to form another  more independent of the public  and  more docile to herself  and  above all  faithful to the crown and to the  interests of the kingly house and its servants  a party strictly  catholic  but regarding as a necessity the task of humoring the reformers  and granting them such concessions as might prevent explosions fraught  with peril to the state  a third party  tiers part   as we should say  nowadays  politic and prudent  somewhat lavish of promises without being  sure of the power to keep them  not much embarrassed at having to change  attitude and language according to the shifting phases of the moment  and  anxious above everything to maintain public peace and to put off  questions which it could not solve pacifically   in the sixteenth  century  as at every other time  worthy folks of moderate views and  nervous temperaments  ambitious persons combining greed with suppleness   old servants of the crown  and officials full of scruples and far from  bold in the practical part of government  were the essential elements of  this party   the constable de montmorency sometimes issued forth from  chantilly to go and aid the queen mother  in whom he had no confidence   but whom he preferred to the guises   a former councillor of the  parliament  for a long while chancellor under francis i  and henry ii    and again summoned  under francis ii   by catherine de  medici to the  same post  francis olivier  was an honorable executant of the party s  indecisive but moderate policy   he died on the   th of march         and catherine  in concert with the cardinal of lorraine  had the  chancellorship thus vacated conferred upon michael de l hospital  a  magistrate already celebrated  and destined to become still more so   as  soon as he entered upon this great office he made himself remarkable by  the marvellous ability he showed in restraining within bounds  the  lorraines themselves  whose servant he was   says the protestant  chronicler regnier de la planche   to those who had the public weal at  heart he gave hope that all would at last turn out well  provided that he  were let alone  and  to tell the truth  it would be impossible to  adequately describe the prudence he displayed  for  assuredly  although  if he had taken a shorter road towards manfully opposing the mischief he  would have deserved more praise  and god would perhaps have blessed his  constancy  yet  so far as one can judge  he alone  by his moderate  behavior  was the instrument made use of by god for keeping back many an  impetuous flood under which every frenchman would have been submerged   external appearances  however  seemed to the contrary   in short  when  any one represented to him some trouble that was coming  he always had  these words on his lips   patience  patience  all will go well     this  philosophical and patriotic confidence on the part of chancellor de  l hospital was fated to receive some cruel falsifications     a few months  and hardly so much  after the accession of francis ii    a serious matter brought into violent collision the three parties whose  characteristics and dispositions have just been described   the supremacy  of the guises was insupportable to the reformers  and irksome to many  lukewarm or wavering members of the catholic nobility   an edict of the  king s had revoked all the graces and alienations of domains granted by  his father   the crown refused to pay its most lawful debts  and duns  were flocking to the court   to get rid of them  the cardinal of lorraine  had a proclamation issued by the king  warning all persons  of whatever  condition  who had come to dun for payment of debts  for compensations   or for graces  to take themselves off within twenty four hours on pain of  being hanged  and  that it might appear how seriously meant the threat  was  a very conspicuous gibbet was erected at fontainebleau close to the  palace   it was a shocking affront   the malcontents at once made up to  the reformers   independently of the general oppression and perils under  which these latter labored  they were liable to meet everywhere  at the  corners of the streets  men posted on the lookout  who insulted them and  denounced them to the magistrates if they did not uncover themselves  before the madonnas set up in their way  or if they did not join in the  litanies chanted before them   a repetition of petty requisitions soon  becomes an odious tyranny   an understanding was established between very  different sorts of malcontents  they all said and spread abroad that the  guises were the authors of these oppressive and unjustifiable acts   they  made common cause in seeking for means of delivering themselves  at the  same time drawing an open distinction between the guises and the king   the latter of whom there was no idea of attacking   the inviolability of  kings and the responsibility of ministers  those two fundamental maxims  of a free monarchy  had already become fixed ideas  but how were they to  be taken advantage of and put in practice when the institutions whereby  political liberty exerts its powers and keeps itself secure were not in  force   the malcontents  whether reformers or catholics  all cried out  for the states general   those of tours  in       under charles viii    had left behind them a momentous and an honored memory   but the guises  and their partisans energetically rejected this cry    they told the king  that whoever spoke of convoking the states general was his personal enemy  and guilty of high treason  for his people would fain impose law upon him  from whom they ought to take it  in such sort that there would be left to  him nothing of a king but the bare title   the queen mother  though all  the while giving fair words to the malcontents  whether reformers or  others  was also disquieted at their demands  and she wrote to her  son in law  philip ii   king of spain   that they wanted  by means of the  said states  to reduce her to the condition of a maid of all work    whereupon philip replied  that he would willingly employ all his forces  to uphold the authority of the king his brother in law and of his  ministers  and that he had forty thousand men all ready in case anybody  should be bold enough to attempt to violate it       in their perplexity  the malcontents  amongst whom the reformers were  becoming day by day the most numerous and the most urgent  determined to  take the advice of the greatest lawyers and most celebrated theologians  of france and germany   they asked whether it would be permissible  with  a good conscience and without falling into the crime of high treason  to  take up arms for the purpose of securing the persons of the duke of guise  and the cardinal of lorraine  and forcing them to render an account of  their administration   the doctors  on being consulted  answered that it  would be allowable to oppose by force the far from legitimate supremacy  of the guises  provided that it were done under the authority of princes  of the blood  born administrators of the realm in such cases  and with  the consent of the orders composing the state  or the greatest and  soundest portion of those orders   a meeting of the princes who were  hostile to the guises were held at vendome to deliberate as to the  conduct to be adopted in this condition of opinions and parties   the king of navarre and his brother the prince of conde  coligny   d andelot  and some of their most intimate friends took part in it   and d ardres  confidential secretary to the constable de montmorency  was  present   the prince of conde was for taking up arms at once and swoop  down upon the guises  taking them by surprise   coligny formally opposed  this plan  the king  at his majority  had a right  he said  to choose his  own advisers  no doubt it was a deplorable thing to see foreigners at the  head of affairs  but the country must not  for the sake of removing them   be rashly exposed to the scourge of civil war  perhaps it would be enough  if the queen mother were made acquainted with the general discontent   the constable s secretary coincided with coligny  whose opinion was  carried   it was agreed that the prince of conde should restrain his  ardor  and let himself be vaguely regarded as the possible leader of the  enterprise if it were to take place  but without giving it  until further  notice  his name and co operation   he was called the mute captain     there was need of a less conspicuous and more pronounced leader for that  which was becoming a conspiracy   and one soon presented himself in the  person of godfrey de barri  lord of la renaudie  a nobleman of an ancient  family of perigord  well known to duke francis of guise  under whose  orders he had served valiantly at metz in       and who had for some time  protected him against the consequences of a troublesome trial  at which  la renaudie had been found guilty by the parliament of paris of forging  and uttering false titles   being forced to leave france  he retired into  switzerland  to lausanne and geneva  where it was not long before he  showed the most passionate devotion for the reformation    he was a man    says de thou   of quick and insinuating wits  ready to undertake  anything  and burning with desire to avenge himself  and wipe out   by some brilliant deed  the infamy of a sentence which he had incurred  rather through another s than his own crime   he  then  readily offered  his services to those who were looking out for a second leader  and he  undertook to scour the kingdom in order to win over the men whose names  had been given him   he got from them all a promise to meet him at nantes  in february        and he there made them a long and able speech against  the guises  ending by saying   god bids us to obey kings even when they  ordain unjust things  and there is no doubt but that they who resist the  powers that god has set up do resist his will   we have this advantage   that we  ever full of submission to the prince  are set against none but  traitors hostile to their king and their country  and so much the more  dangerous in that they nestle in the very bosom of the state  and  in the  name and clothed with the authority of a king who is a mere child  are  attacking the kingdom and the king himself   now  in order that you may  not suppose that you will be acting herein against your consciences  i am  quite willing to be the first to protest and take god to witness that i  will not think  or say  or do anything against the king  against the  queen his mother  against the princes his brothers  or against those of  his blood  and that  on the contrary  i will defend their majesty and  their dignity  and  at the same time  the authority of the laws and the  liberty of the country against the tyranny of a few foreigners     de  thou  t  iii   pp                out of so large an assemblage   adds the historian   there was not found  to be one whom so delicate an enterprise caused to recoil  or who asked  for time to deliberate   it was agreed that  before anything else  a  large number of persons  without arms and free from suspicion  should  repair to court and there present a petition to the king  beseeching him  not to put pressure upon consciences any more  and to permit the free  exercise of religion  that at almost the same time a chosen body of  horsemen should repair to blois  where the king was  that their  accomplices should admit them into the town and present a new petition  to the king against the guises  and that  if these princes would not  withdraw and give an account of their administration  they should be  attacked sword in hand  and  lastly  that the prince of conde  who had  wished his name to be kept secret up to that time  should put himself at  the head of the conspirators   the   th of june was the day fixed for the  execution of it all      but the guises were warned  one of la renaudie s friends had revealed the  conspiracy to the cardinal of lorraine s secretary  and from spain   germany  and italy they received information as to the conspiracy hatched  against them   the cardinal  impetuous and pusillanimous too  was for  calling out the troops at once  but his brother the duke   who was not  easily startled   was opposed to anything demonstrative   they removed  the king to the castle of amboise  a safer place than the town of blois   and they concerted measures with the queen mother  to whom the  conspirators were  both in their plans and their persons  almost as  objectionable as to them   she wrote  in a style of affectionate  confidence  to coligny  begging him to come to amboise and give her his  advice   he arrived in company with his brother d andelot  and urged the  queen mother to grant the reformers liberty of conscience and of worship   the only way to checkmate all the mischievous designs and to restore  peace to the kingdom   something of what he advised was done  a royal  decree was published and carried up to the parliament on the   th of  march  ordaining the abolition of every prosecution on account of  religion  in respect of the past only  and under reservations which  rendered the grace almost inappreciable   the guises  on their side   wrote to the constable de montmorency to inform him of the conspiracy    of which you will feel as great horror as we do   and they signed  your  thoroughly best friends   the prince of conde himself  though informed  about the discovery of the plot  repaired to amboise without showing any  signs of being disconcerted at the cold reception offered him by the  lorraine princes   the duke of guise  always bold  even in his  precautions   found an honorable means of making sure of him   says  castelnau   by giving him the guard at a gate of the town of amboise    where he had him under watch and ward himself   the lords and gentlemen  attached to the court made sallies all around amboise to prevent any  unexpected attack    they caught a great many troops badly led and badly  equipped   many poor folks  in utter despair and without a leader  asked  pardon as they threw down upon the ground some wretched arms they bore   and declared that they knew no more about the enterprise than that there  had been a time

the riot of amboise   tumulte d amboise    as it  was called  was an ordinance of francis ii   who  on the   th of march         appointed duke francis of guise  his lieutenant general   representing him in person absent and present in this good town of  amboise and other places of the realm  with full power  authority   commission  and special mandate to assemble all the princes  lords  and

to what appears  somewhat  troubled at all this uproar and at the language of the conspirators    i don t know how it is   said he sometimes to the guises   but i hear it  said that people are against you only   i wish you could be away from  here for a time  that we might see whether it is you or i that they are  against    but the guises set about removing this idea by telling the  king that neither he nor his brothers would live one hour after their  departure  and  that the house of bourbon were only seeking how to  exterminate the king s house    the caresses of the young queen mary  stuart were enlisted in support of these assertions of her uncles   they  made a cruel use of their easy victory  for a whole month   according to  contemporary chronicles   there was nothing but hanging or drowning  folks   the loire was covered with corpses strung  six  eight  ten  and  fifteen  to long poles              what was strange to see   says  regnier de la planche   and had never been wont under any form of  government  they were led out to execution without having any sentence  pronounced against them publicly  or having the cause of their death  declared  or having their names mentioned   they of the guises reserved  the chief of them  after dinner  to make sport for the ladies  the two  sexes were ranged at the windows of the castle  as if it were a question  of seeing some mummery played   and what is worse  the king and his young  brothers were present at these spectacles  as if the desire were to   blood  them  the sufferers were pointed out to them by the cardinal of  lorraine with all the signs of a man greatly rejoiced  and when the poor  wretches died with more than usual firmness  he would say   see  sir   what brazenness and madness  the fear of death cannot abate their pride  and felonry   what would they do  then  if they had you in their  clutches       it was too much vengeance to take and too much punishment to inflict for  a danger so short lived and so strictly personal   so hideous was the  spectacle that the duchess of guise  anne d este  daughter of renee of  france  duchess of ferrara  took her departure one day  saying  as she  did so  to catherine de  medici   ah  madame  what a whirlwind of hatred  is gathering about the heads of my poor children    there was  throughout  a considerable portion of the country  a

profiting by  the effect produced by his proud language  demanded and obtained leave  to retire from the court  which he quitted at once      all seemed to be over  but the whole of france had been strongly moved by  what had just taken place  and  though the institutions which invite a  people to interfere in its own destinies were not at the date of the  sixteenth century in regular and effective working order  there was  everywhere felt  even at court  the necessity of ascertaining the feeling  of the country   on all sides there was a demand for the convocation of  the states general   the guises and the queen mother  who dreaded this  great and independent national power  attempted to satisfy public opinion  by calling an assembly of notables  not at all numerous  and chosen by  themselves   it was summoned to meet on august           at  fontainebleau  in the apartments of the queen mother   some great lords   certain bishops  the constable de montmorency  two marshals of france   the privy councillors  the knights of the order  the secretaries of state  and finance  chancellor de l hospital and coligny  took part in it  the  king of navarre and the prince of conde did not respond to the summons  they received  the constable rode up with a following of six hundred  horse   the first day was fully taken up by a statement  presented to the  assembly by l hospital  of the evils that had fallen upon france  and by  a declaration on the part of the guises that they were ready to render an  account of their administration and of their actions   next day  just as  the bishop of valence was about to speak  coligny went up to the king   made two genuflections  stigmatized in energetic terms the amboise  conspiracy and every similar enterprise  and presented two petitions   one intended for the king himself and the other for the queen mother    they were forwarded to me in normandy   said he   by faithful  christians  who make their prayers to god in accordance with the true  rules of piety   they ask for nothing but the liberty of holding their  own creed  and that of having temples and celebrating their worship in  certain fixed places   if necessary  this petition would be signed by  fifty thousand persons     and i   said the duke of guise brusquely    would find a million to sign a contrary petition    this incident went  no further between the two speakers   a great discussion began as to the  reforms desirable in the church  and as to the convocation of a general  council  or  in default thereof  a national council   the cardinal of  lorraine spoke last  and vehemently attacked the petitions presented by  admiral de coligny    though couched in moderate and respectful terms    said he   this document is  at bottom  insolent and seditious  it is as  much as to say that those gentry would be obedient and submissive if the  king would be pleased to authorize their mischievous sentiments   for the  rest   he added   as it is merely a question of improving morals and  putting in force strict discipline  the meeting of a council  whether  general or national  appears to me quite unnecessary   i consent to the

announced that the punishment of sectaries would  for the present  be  suspended  but that the king reserved to himself and his judges the right  of severely chastising those who had armed the populace and kindled  sedition    thus it was   adds de thou   that the protestant religion   hitherto so hated  began to be tolerated  and in a manner authorized  by  consent of its enemies

most part  successfully  but in some cases vainly  the instructions they had  received   one morning in december        the duke of guise was visited  by a courier from the count de villars  governor of languedoc  he  informed the duke that the deputies of that province had just been  appointed  and that they all belonged to the new religion  and were  amongst the most devoted to the sect  there was not a moment to lose    for they were men of wits  great reputation  and circumspection   the  governor was very vexed at not having been able to prevent their election  and departure  but plurality of votes had carried the day against him    this despatch was  no sooner received than some men were got ready to go  and meet those deputies  in order to put them in a place where they would  never have been able to do good or harm    the deputies of languedoc  escaped this ambuscade  and arrived safe and sound at orleans  but they   were kept under strict watch  and their papers

assemblage of  notables at fontainebleau  and their hostility to the guises had been  openly shown during and since that absence   nothing was left untried to  attract them  not to meaux any longer

letter to the king of navarre  urging him to  bring with him his brother the prince of conde to clear himself of the  accusations brought against him  by these miserable heretics  who made  marvellous charges against him            conde would easily prove the  falsity of the assertions made by these rascals    the king of navarre  still hesitated  the king insisted haughtily    i should be sorry

thither  in order to escape any personal dispute  and  so as not to be hearers of the severe words which they had themselves  dictated to the young monarch   the king questioned conde sharply  but

lured on when urged to go to orleans   the only answer he  received was his committal to absolutely solitary confinement and the  withdrawal of his servants   the king of navarre vainly asked to have

court of parliament furnished with the proper complement of peers and  knights of the order   this latter safeguard was worth nothing in his  case  for there had been created  just lately  eighteen new knights  all  friends and creatures of the guises   his claim  however  was rejected   and he repeated it  at the same time refusing to reply to any  interrogation  and appealing  from the king

consequence to me than hearing mass    he did not  attempt to conceal his antipathy towards the guises  and the part he had  taken in the hostilities directed against them   an officer  to whom  permission had been given to converse with him in presence of his  custodians  told him  that an appointment  accommodation  with the duke  of guise would not be an impossibility for him

navarre as well  as his brother the prince of conde  but by another process   feeling  persuaded that it would be impossible to obtain against the elder brother  a sentence ever so little in accordance with justice  for his conduct had  been very reserved  they had  it is said  agreed that king francis ii   should send for the king of navarre into his closet and reproach him  severely for his secret complicity with his brother conde  and that if  the king of navarre defended himself stubbornly  he should be put to  death on the spot by men posted there for the purpose   it is even added  that francis ii  was to strike the first blow   catherine de  medici  who  was beginning to be disquieted at the arrogance and successes of the  lorraine princes  sent warning of this peril to the king of navarre by  jacqueline de longwy  duchess of montpensier  and  just as he was  proceeding to the royal audience from which he was not sure to return   anthony de bourbon  who was wanting in head rather than in heart  said to  renty  one of his gentlemen   if i die yonder  carry my blood stained  shirt to my wife and my son  and tell my wife to send it round to the  foreign princes of christendom  that they may avenge my death  as my son  is not yet of sufficient age    we may remark that the wife was jeanne  d albret  and the son was to be henry iv   according to the chroniclers   when francis ii  looked in the eyes of the man he was to strike  his  fierce resolve died away  the king of navarre retired  safe and sound   from the interview  and the duke of guise  irritated at the weakness of  the king his master  muttered between his teeth    tis the very whitest  liver that ever was      in spite of de thou s indorsement of this story  it is doubtful whether  its authenticity can be admitted  if the interview between the two kings  took place  prudence on the part of the king of navarre seems to be quite  as likely an explanation of the result as hesitation to become a murderer  on the part of francis ii     one day conde was playing cards with some officers on guard over him   when a servant of his who had been permitted to resume attendance on his  master  pretending to approach him for the purpose of picking up a card   whispered in his ear   our gentleman is  croqued     the prince   mastering his emotion  finished his game   he then found means of being  for a moment alone with his servant  and learned from him that francis  ii  was dead     histoire des princes de conde  by the duke d aumale    t  i   p        on the   th of november        as he was mounting his  horse to go hunting  he fainted suddenly   he appeared to have recovered   and was even able to be present when the final sentence was pronounced  against conde  but on the   th of november there was a fresh  fainting fit   it appears that ambrose pare  at that time the first  surgeon of his day  and a faithful reformer  informed his patron  admiral  coligny  that there would not be long to wait  and that it was all over  with the king   up to the very last moment  either by themselves or  through their niece mary stuart  the guises preserved their influence  over him  francis ii  sent for the king of navarre  to assure him that it  was quite of his own accord  and not by advice of the guises  that he had  brought conde to trial   he died on the  th of december        of an  effusion on the brain  resulting from a fistula and an abscess in the  ear      illustration  mary stuart            through a fog of brief or doubtful evidence we can see at the bedside of  this dying king his wife mary stuart  who gave him to the last her tender  ministrations  and admiral de coligny  who  when the king had heaved his  last sigh  rose up  and  with his air of pious gravity  said aloud before  the cardinal of lorraine and the others who were present   gentlemen  the  king is dead   a lesson to us to live    at the same moment the constable  de montmorency  who had been ordered some time ago to orleans  but had   according to his practice  travelled but slowly  arrived suddenly at the  city gate  threatened to hang the ill informed keepers of it  who  hesitated to let him enter  and hastened to fold in his arms his niece   the princess of conde  whom the death of francis ii   restored to hope      illustration  coligny at the death bed of francis ii                     chapter xxxiii     charles ix  and the religious wars                  we now enter upon the era of the civil wars  massacres  and  assassinations caused by religious fanaticism or committed on religious  pretexts   the latter half of the sixteenth century is the time at which  the human race saw the opening of that great drama  of which religious  liberty is the beginning and the end  and france was then the chief scene  of it   at the close of the fifteenth and at the commencement of the  sixteenth centuries  religious questions had profoundly agitated  christian europe  but towards the middle of the latter century they had  obtained in the majority of european states solutions which  however  incomplete  might be regarded as definitive   germany was divided into  catholic states and protestant states  which had established between  themselves relations of an almost pacific character   switzerland was  entering upon the same course   in england  scotland  the low countries   the scandinavian states  and the free towns their neighbors  the  reformation had prevailed or was clearly tending to prevail   in italy   spain  and portugal  on the contrary  the reformation had been stifled   and catholicism remained victorious   it was in france that   notwithstanding the inequality of forces  the struggle between  catholicism and protestantism was most obstinately maintained  and  appeared for the longest time uncertain   after half a century of civil  wars and massacres it terminated in henry iv   a protestant king  who  turned catholic  but who gave protestants the edict of nantes  a  precious  though insufficient and precarious pledge  which served france  as a point of departure towards religious liberty  and which protected it  for nearly a century  in the midst of the brilliant victory won by  catholicism    the edict of nantes  published by henry iv  in       was  revoked by louis xiv  in           for more than three centuries civilized europe has been discussing  pro  or con  the question of religious liberty  but from instinct and with  passion far more than with a serious understanding of what is at the  bottom of things   even in our own day it is not without difficulty that  a beginning is being made to understand and accept that principle in its  true sense and in all its bearings   men were wonderfully far from it in        at the accession of charles ix   a child ten years old  they were  entering  in blind confidence  upon a religious war  in order to arrive   only after four centuries of strife and misconception  at a vindication  of religious liberty    woe to thee  o country  that hast a child for  king   said  in accordance with the bible  the venetian michael suriano   ambassador to france at that time   around that royal child  and seeking  to have the mastery over france by being masters over him  were  struggling the three great parties at that time occupying the stage in  the name of religion   the catholics rejected altogether the idea of  religious liberty for the protestants  the protestants had absolute need  of it  for it was their condition of existence  but they did not wish for  it in the case of the catholics  their adversaries   the third party    tiers parti    as we call it nowadays  wished to hold the balance  continually wavering between the catholics and the protestants  conceding  to the former and the latter  alternately  that measure of liberty which  was indispensable for most imperfect maintenance of the public peace  and  reconcilable with the sovereign power of the kingship   on such  conditions was the government of charles ix  to establish its existence     the death of francis ii  put an end to a grand project of the guises   which we do not find expressly indicated elsewhere than in the  memoires   of michael de castelnau  one of the best informed and most intelligent  historians of the time    many catholics   says he   were then of opinion  that  if the authority of the duke of guise had continued to be armed  with that of the king as it had been  the protestants would have had  enough to do   for orders had been sent to all the principal lords of the  kingdom  officers of the crown and knights of the order  to show  themselves in the said city of orleans on christmas day at the opening of  the states  for that they might be all made to sign the confession of the  catholic faith in presence of the king and the chapter of the order   together with all the members of the privy council  reporting masters  of  petitions   domestic officers of the king s household  and all the  deputies of the estates   the same confession was to be published  throughout all the said kingdom  in order to have it sworn by all the  judges  magistrates  and officers  and  finally  all private persons from  parish to parish   and in default of so doing  proceedings were to be  taken by seizures  condemnations  executions  banishments  and  confiscations   and they who did repent themselves and abjured their  protestant religion were to be absolved      memoires de michel de  castelnau   book ii   chap  xii   p       in the  petitot  collection    it is not to be supposed that  even if circumstances had remained as they  were under the reign of francis ii   such a plan could have been  successful  but it is intelligible that the guises had conceived such an  idea  they were victorious  they had just procured the condemnation to  death of the most formidable amongst the protestant princes  their  adversary louis de conde  they were threatening the life of his brother  the king of navarre  and the house of bourbon seemed to be on the point  of disappearing beneath the blows of the ambitious  audacious  and by no  means scrupulous house of lorraine   not even the prospect of francis  ii  s death arrested the guises in their work and their hopes  when they  saw that he was near his end  they made a proposal to the queen mother to  unite herself completely with them  leave the prince of conde to  execution  rid herself of the king of navarre  and become regent of the  kingdom during the minority of her son charles  taking them  the lorraine  princes and their party  for necessary partners in her government   but  catherine de  medici was more prudent  more judicious  and more  egotistical in her ambition than the guises were in theirs  she was not   as they were  exclusively devoted to the catholic party  it was power  that she wanted  and she sought for it every day amongst the party or the  mixtures of parties in a condition to give it her   she considered the  catholic party to be the strongest  and it was hers  but she considered  the protestant party strong enough to be feared  and to give her a  certain amount of security and satisfaction  a security necessary   moreover  if peace at home  and not civil war  were to be the habitual  and general condition of france   catherine was  finally  a woman  and  very skilful in the strifes of court and of government  whilst  on the  field of battle  the victories  though won in her name  would be those of  the guises more than her own   without openly rejecting the proposals  they made to her under their common apprehension of francis ii  s  approaching death  she avoided making any reply   she had  no doubt   already taken her precautions and her measures in advance  her  confidante  jacqueline de longwy  duchess of montpensier and a zealous  protestant  had brought to her rooms at night antony de bourbon  king of  navarre  and catherine had come to an agreement with him about the  partition of power between herself and him at the death of the king her  son   she had written to the constable de montmorency  a rival of the  guises and their foe though a stanch catholic  to make haste to orleans   where his presence would be required   as soon as chancellor de  l hospital became aware of the proposals which were being made by the  guises to the queen mother  he flew to her and opposed them with all the  energy of his great and politic mind and sterling nature   was she going  to deliver the prince of conde to the scaffold  the house of bourbon to  ruin  france to civil war  and the independence of the crown and of that  royal authority which she was on the point of wielding herself to the  tyrannical domination of her rivals the lorraine princes and of their  party   catherine listened with great satisfaction to this judicious and  honest language   when the crown passed to her son charles she was free  from any serious anxiety as to her own position and her influence in the  government   the new king  on announcing to the parliament the death of  his brother  wrote to them that  confiding in the virtues and prudence of  the queen mother  he had begged her to take in hand the administration of  the kingdom  with the wise counsel and advice of the king of navarre and  the notables and great personages of the late king s council    a few  months afterwards the states general  assembling first at orleans and  afterwards at pontoise  ratified this declaration by recognizing the  placement

consider wicked and contemptible  him or them who caused it     so i think  sir   answered guise   and it  does not apply to me at all    whereupon they embraced  and a report was  drawn up of the ceremony  which was called their reconciliation   just as  it was ending  marshal francis de montmorency  eldest son of the  constable  and far more inclined than his father was towards the cause of

to be so closely  connected with the princes of bourbon  his son would have been to blame  if he had acted differently   the aged warrior had himself negotiated  this reconciliation  and when it was accomplished  and the duke of guise  had performed his part in it with so much complaisance  the constable  considered himself to be quits with his former allies  and free to  follow his leaning towards the catholic party   the veteran   says the  duke of autnale   did not pique himself on being a theologian  but he  was sincerely attached to the catholic faith because it was the old  religion and the king s  and he separated himself definitively from  those religious and political innovators whom he had at first seemed to  countenance  and amongst whom he reckoned his nearest relatives    in  vain did his eldest son try to hold him back  a close union was formed  between the constable de montmorency  the duke of guise  and marshal de  saint andre  and it became the

adopted as her chief means of government     before we call to mind and estimate as they deserve the actions of that  government  we must give a correct idea of the moral condition of the  people governed  of their unbridled passions  and of the share of  responsibility reverting to them in the crimes and shocking errors of  that period   it is a mistake and an injustice  only too common  to lay  all the burden of such facts  and the odium justly due to them  upon the  great actors almost exclusively whose name has remained attached to them  in history  the people themselves have very often been the prime movers  in them  they have very often preceded and urged on their masters in the  black deeds which have sullied their history  and on the masses as well  as on the leaders ought the just sentence of posterity to fall   the  moment we speak of the st  bartholomew  it seems as if charles ix    catherine de  medici  and the guises issued from their grave to receive  that sentence  and god forbid that we should wish to deliver them from  it  but it hits the nameless populace of their day as well as themselves   and the hands of the people  far more than the will of kings  began the  tale of massacres for religion s sake   this is no vague and general  assertion  and  to show it  we shall only have to enumerate  with their  dates  the principal facts of which history has preserved the memory   whilst stigmatizing them  with good reason  as massacres or murders   the  greater number  as was to be expected  are deeds done by catholics  for  they were by far the more numerous and more frequently victorious  but  protestants also have sometimes deserved a place in this tragic category   and when we meet with them  we will assuredly not blot them out     we confine the enumeration to the reign of charles ix   and in it we  place only such massacres and murders as were not the results of any  legal proceeding   we say nothing of judicial sentences and executions   however outrageous and iniquitous they may have been     the first fact which presents itself is a singular one   admiral de  coligny s eldest brother  odet de chatillon  was a catholic  bishop of  beauvais  and a cardinal  in       he had gone to rome and had  co operated in the election of pope julius iii   in       he had  published some  constitutions synodales   synodal regulations   to remedy  certain abuses which had crept into his diocese  and  in       he  proposed to make in the celebration of the lord s supper some  modifications which smacked  it is said  of the innovations of geneva   the populace of beauvais were so enraged at this that they rose up  against him  massacred a schoolmaster whom he tried to protect  and would  have massacred the bishop himself if troops sent from paris had not come  to his assistance     in the same year        the protestants had a custom of meeting at paris   for their religious exercises  in a house called the patriarch s house   very near the church of st  medard   on the   th of december  whilst the  reformed minister was preaching  the catholics had all the bells of st   medard rung in full peal   the minister sent two of his congregation to  beg the incumbent to have the bell ringing stopped for a short time   the  mob threw themselves upon the two messengers  one was killed  and the  other  after making a stout defence  returned badly wounded to the  patriarch s house  and fell dead at the preacher s feet   the provost of  tradesmen was for having the bells stopped  the riot became violent  the  house of the reformers was stormed  and the provost s archers had great  difficulty in putting a stop to the fight   more than a hundred persons   it is said  were killed or wounded      illustration  massacre of protestants           in       in the month of february  whilst the guises were travelling in  germany  with the object of concluding  in the interests of policy   alliances with some german lutheran princes  disturbances broke out at  cahors  amiens  sens  and tours  between the protestants and the  catholics   which of the two began them   it would be difficult to  determine   the passions that lead to insult  attack  defence  and  vengeance were mutually felt and equally violent on both sides   montluc  was sent to guienne by the queen mother to restore order there  but  nearly everywhere he laid the blame on the protestants   his memoires  prove that he harried them without any form of justice    at sauveterre    says he   i caught five or six  all of whom i had hanged without expense  of paper or ink  and without giving them a hearing  for those gentry are  regular chrysostoms   parlent d or       i was informed that at gironde  there were sixty or eighty huguenots belonging to them of la reole  who  had retreated thither  the which were all taken  and i had them hanged to  the pillars of the market place without further ceremony   one hanged has  more effect than a hundred slain    when montluc took monsegur   the  massacre lasted for ten hours or more   says he   because search was made  for them in the houses  the dead were counted and found to be more than  seven hundred      memoires de montluc   t  ii   pp                    almost at the very time at which montluc  who had been sent to guienne to  restore order there between the catholics and the protestants  was  treating the latter with this shocking severity  an incident  more  serious because of the rank of the persons concerned  took place at  vassy  a small town in champagne  near which the duke of guise passed on  returning from germany   hearing  as he went  the sound of bells  he  asked what it meant    it is the church of the huguenots of vassy   was  the answer    are there many of them   asked the duke   he was told that  there were  and that they were increasing more and more    then   says  the chronicler   he began to mutter and to put himself in a white heat   gnawing his beard  as he was wont to do when he was enraged or had a mind  to take vengeance    did he turn aside out of his way with his following   to pass right through vassy  or did he confine himself to sending some of  his people to bring him an account of what was happening there   when a  fact which was at the outset insignificant has become a great event  it  is hardly possible to arrive at any certain knowledge of the truth as to  the small details of its origin   whatever may have been the case in the  first instance  a quarrel  and  before long  a struggle  began between  the preacher s congregation and the prince s following   being informed  of the matter whilst he was at table  the duke of guise rose up  went to  the spot  found the combatants very warmly at work  and himself received  several blows from stones  and  when the fight was put a stop to   forty nine persons had been killed in it  nearly all on the protestant  side  more than two hundred others  it is said  came out of it severely  wounded  and  whether victors or vanquished  all were equally irritated   the protestants complained vehemently  and conde offered  in their name   fifty thousand men to resent this attack  but his brother  the king of  navarre  on the contrary  received with a very bad grace the pleading of  theodore de beze    it is true that the church of god should endure  blows and not inflict them   said de beze   but remember  i pray you   that it is an anvil which has used up a great many hammers      the massacre of vassy  the name which has remained affixed to it in  history  rapidly became contagious   from      to       in languedoc  in  provence  in dauphiny  in poitou  in orleanness  in normandy even and in  picardy  at toulouse  at gaillac  at frejus  at troyes  at sens  at  orleans  at amiens  at rouen  and in many other towns  spontaneous and  disorderly outbreaks between religiously opposed portions of the populace  took place suddenly  were repeated  and spread  sometimes with the  connivance of the local authorities  judicial or administrative  but more  often through the mere brutal explosion of the people s passions   it is  distasteful to us to drag numerous examples from oblivion  but we will  cite just two  faithful representations of those sad incidents  and  attested by authentic documents   the little town of gaillac was almost  entirely catholic  the protestants  less numerous  had met the day after  pentecost  may           to celebrate the lord s supper    the  inhabitants in the quarter of the chateau de l orme  who are all artisans  or vine dressers   says the chronicler   rush to arms  hurry along with  them all the catholics of the town  invest the place of assembly  and  take prisoners all who were present   after this capture  they separate   some remain in the meeting house  on guard over the prisoners  the rest  go into dwellings to work their will upon those of the religion who had  remained there   then they take the prisoners  to the number of sixty or  eighty  into a gallery of the abbey of st  michael  situated on a steep  rock  at the base of which flows the river tarn  and there  a field  laborer  named cabral  having donned the robe and cape of the judge s  deputy  whom he had slain with his own hand  pronounces judgment  and  sentences all the prisoners to be thrown from the gallery into the river   telling them to go and eat fish  as they had not chosen to fast during  lent  which was done forthwith   divers boatmen who were on the river  despatched with their oars those who tried to save themselves by  swimming      histoire generale du languedoc   liv   xxxviii   f  v   p          at troyes  in champagne   during the early part of august         the majority of the protestants of the town  who were returning from  esleau mont  where they had a meeting house and a pastor under  authorization from the king  were assailed in the neighborhood of  croncels by the excited populace   a certain number of individuals   accompanying a mother carrying a child which had just received baptism   were pursued with showers of stones  several were wounded

damaged or completely  destroyed   this massacre  perpetrated on st  michael s day  was called   the michaelade    the barbarities committed against the catholics in  dauphiny and in provence by

l hospital was scarcely more successful than the  hypocritical and double faced attentions paid by catherine de  medici to  both the catholic and the protestant leaders  the great maladies and the  great errors of nations require remedies more heroic than the adroitness  of a woman  the wisdom of a functionary  or the hopes of a philosopher   it was formal and open civil war between the two communions and the two  parties that  with honest and patriotic desire  l hospital and even  catherine were anxious to avoid   from      to      there were in france  eighteen or twenty massacres of protestants  four or five of catholics   and thirty or forty single murders sufficiently important to have been  kept in remembrance by history  and during that space of time formal  civil war  religious and partisan  broke out  stopped and recommenced in  four campaigns  signalized  each of them  by great battles  and four  times terminated by impotent or deceptive treaties of peace which  on the    th of august        ended  for their sole result  in the greatest  massacre of french history  the st  bartholomew     the first religious war  under charles ix   appeared on the point of  breaking out in april        some days after that the duke of guise   returning from the massacre of vassy  had entered paris  on the   th of  march  in triumph   the queen mother  in dismay  carried off the king to  melun at first  and then to fontainebleau  whilst the prince of conde   having retired to meaux  summoned to his side his relatives  his friends   and all the leaders of the reformers  and wrote to coligny   that caesar  had not only crossed the rubicon  but was already at rome  and that his  banners were beginning to wave all over the neighboring country    for  some days catherine and l hospital tried to remain out of paris with the  young king  whom guise  the constable de montmorency  and the king of  navarre  the former being members and the latter an ally of the  triumvirate  went to demand back from them   they were obliged to submit  to the pressure brought to bear upon them   the constable was the first  to enter paris  and went  on the  d of april  and burned down the two  places of worship which  by virtue of the decree of january           had  been granted to the protestants   next day the king of navarre and the  duke of guise  in their turn  entered the city in company with charles  ix  and catherine   a council was assembled at the louvre to deliberate  as to the declaration of war  which was deferred   whilst the king was on  his way back to paris  conde hurried off to take up his quarters at  orleans  whither coligny went promptly to join him   they signed  with  the gentlemen who came to them from all parts  a compact of association   for the honor of god  for the liberty of the king  his brothers and the  queen mother  and for the maintenance of decrees   and conde  in writing  to the protestant princes of germany to explain to them his conduct  took  the title of protector of the house and crown of france   negotiations  still went on for nearly three months   the chiefs of the two parties  attempted to offer one another generous and pacific solutions  they even  had two interviews  but catherine was induced by the catholic triumvirate  to expressly declare that she could not allow in france more than one  single form of worship   conde and his friends said that they could not  lay down their arms until the triumvirate was overthrown  and the  execution of decrees granting them liberty of worship  in certain places  and to a certain extent  had been secured to them   neither party liked  to acknowledge itself beaten in this way without having struck a blow   and in the early part of july        the first religious war began     we do not intend to dwell upon any but its leading facts  facts which at  the moment when they were accomplished might have been regarded as  decisive in respect of the future   in this campaign there were two  the  battle of dreux  on the   th of december        and the murder of the  duke of guise by poltrot  on the   th of february           the two armies met in the plain of dreux with pretty nearly equal forces   the royal army being superior in artillery and the protestant in cavalry   when they had arrived in front of one another  the triumvirs sent to ask  the queen mother s authority to give battle    i am astounded   said  catherine to her favorite adviser  michael de castelnau   that the  constable  the duke of guise  and saint andre  being good  prudent  and  experienced captains  should send to ask counsel of a woman and a child   both full of sorrow at seeing things in such extremity as to be reduced  to the risk of a battle between fellow countrymen     hereupon   says  castelnau   in came the king s nurse  who was a huguenot  and the queen   at the same time that she took me to see the king  who was still in bed   said to me with great agitation and jeeringly   we had better ask the  king s nurse whether to give battle or not  what think you    then the  nurse  as she followed the queen into the king s chamber according to her  custom  said several times that  as the huguenots would not listen to  reason  she would say   give battle    whereupon there was  at the privy  council  much discourse about the good and the evil that might result  therefrom  but the resolution arrived at was  that they who had arms in  their hands ought not to ask advice or orders from the court  and i was  despatched on the spot to tell them from the king and the queen  that  as  good and prudent captains  they were to do what they considered most  proper    next day  at ten in the morning  the armies met    then  every one   says la noue  one of the bravest amongst the reformers   leaders   steadied himself  reflecting that the men he saw coming towards  him were not spaniards  or english  or italians  but frenchmen  that is   the bravest of the brave  amongst whom there were some who were his own  comrades  relatives  and friends  and that within an hour they would have  to be killing one another  which created some sort of horror of the fact   without  however  diminution of courage            one thing worthy of  being noted   continues la noue   is the long duration of the fight  it  being generally seen in battles that all is lost or won within a single  hour  whereas this began about one p  m   and there was no issue until  after five   of a surety  there was marvellous animosity on both sides   whereof sufficient testimony is to be found in the number of dead  which  exceeded seven thousand  as many persons say  the majority whereof were  killed in the fight rather than the pursuit            another incident  was the capture of the two chiefs of the armies  a thing which rarely  happens  because generally they do not fight until the last moment and in  extremity  and often a battle is as good as won before they come to this  point   but in this case they did not put it off so long  for  at the  very first  each was minded to set his men an example of not sparing  themselves   the constable de montmorency was the first taken  and  seriously wounded  having always received wounds in seven battles at  which he was present  which shows the boldness that was in him   the  prince of conde was taken at the end  also wounded   as both of them had  good seconds  it made them the less fearful of danger to their own  persons  for the constable had m  de guise  and the prince of conde  admiral de coligny  who showed equally well to the front in the melley            finally i wish to bring forward another matter  which will be  supernumerary because it happened after the battle  and that is  the  courteous and honorable behavior of the duke of guise victorious towards  the prince of conde a prisoner  which most men  on one side as well as on  the other  did not at all think he would have been disposed to exhibit   for it is well known how hateful  in civil wars  are the chiefs of  parties  and what imputations are made upon them   nevertheless here  quite the contrary happened  for  when the prince was brought before the  duke  the latter spoke to him respectfully and with great gentleness of  language  wherein he could not pretend that there was any desire to pique  him or blame him   and whilst the prince staid in the camp  the duke  often dined with him   and forasmuch as on this day of the battle there  were but few beds arrived  for the baggage had been half plundered and  dispersed  the duke of guise offered his own bed to the prince of conde   which the prince would accept in respect of the half only   and so these  two great princes  who were like mortal foes  found themselves in one  bed  one triumphant and the other captive  taking their repast together      memoires de francois de la noue   in the  petitot  collection   st  series  t  xxxiv   pp               the results of the battle of dreux were serious  and still more serious  from the fate of the chiefs than from the number of the dead   the  commanders of the two armies  the constable de montmorency  and the  prince of conde  were wounded and prisoners   one of the triumvirs   marshal de saint andre  had been killed in action   the catholics   wavering ally  anthony de bourbon  king of navarre  had died before the  battle of a wound which he had received at the siege of rouen  and on his  death bed had resumed his protestant bearing  saying that  if god granted  him grace to get well  he would have nothing but the gospel preached  throughout the realm   the two staffs   etats majors    as we should now  say  were disorganized  in one  the duke of guise alone remained unhurt  and at liberty  in the other  coligny  in conde s absence  was elected  general in chief of the protestants   at paris  for a while  it was  believed that the battle was lost    if it had been   says montluc    i think that it was all over with france  for the state would have  changed  and so would the religion  a young king can be made to do as  you please   catherine de  medici showed a facile resignation to such a  change    very well   she had said   then we will pray to god in french    when the victory became known there was general enthusiasm for the duke   of guise  but he took only a very modest advantage of it  being more  anxious to have his comrades  merits appreciated than his own   at blois   as he handed the queen mother her table napkin at dinner time  he asked  her if he might have an audience of her after the repast    jesu  my dear  cousin   said catherine   whatever are you saying     i say it  madame   because i would fain show you in the presence of everybody what i have  done  since my departure from paris  with your army which you gave in  charge to me together with the constable  and also present to you all the  good captains and servants of the king and of yourself who have served  you faithfully  as well your own subjects as also foreigners  and  horsemen and foot   whereupon he discoursed about the battle of dreux    and painted it so well and so to the life   says brantome   that you  would have said that they were still about it  whereat the queen felt  very great pleasure            every one listened very attentively   without the least noise in the world  and he spoke so well that there was  none who was not charmed  for the prince was the best of speakers and  eloquent  not with a forced and overladen eloquence  but simple and  soldierly  with a grace of his own to match  so much so that the  queen mother said that she had never seen him in such good form     brantome   tries des brands capitaines   t  ii   pp             the good  form  however  was not enough to prevent the ill humor and jealousy felt  by the queen mother and her youthful son the king at such a great success  which made guise so great a personage   after the victory of dreux he had  written to the king to express his wish to see conferred upon a candidate  of his own choosing the marshal s baton left vacant by the death of  saint andre    see now   said charles ix  to his mother and some persons  who were by   if the duke of guise does not act the king well  you would  really say that the army was his  and that victory came from his hand   making no mention of god  who  by his great goodness  hath given it us   he thrusts the bargain into my fist  dictates to me    yet must i give  him a civil answer to satisfy him  for i do not want to make trouble in  my kingdom  and irritate a captain to whom my late father and i have  given so much credit and authority    the king almost apologized for  having already disposed of the baton in favor of the marquis de  vieilleville  and he sent the duke of guise the collar of the order for  two of his minions  and at the same time the commission of  lieutenant general of the kingdom and commander in chief of the army for  himself  guise thanked him  pretending to be satisfied  the king smiled  as he read his letter  and   non ti fidar  e non sarai gabbato    don t  trust  and you ll not be duped   he said in the words of the italian  proverb     he had not to disquiet himself for long about this rival   on the   th of  february        the duke of guise was vigorously pushing forward the  siege of orleans  the stronghold of the protestants  stoutly defended by  coligny   he was apprised that his wife  the duchess anne d este  had  just arrived at a castle near the camp with the intention of using her  influence over her husband in order to spare orleans from the terrible  consequences of being taken by assault   he mounted his horse to go and  join her  and he was chatting to his aide de camp rostaing about the  means of bringing about a pacification  when  on arriving at a cross road  where several ways met  he felt himself struck in the right shoulder   almost under the arm  by a pistol shot fired from behind a hedge at a  distance of six or seven paces   a white plume upon his head had made him  conspicuous  and as  for so short a ride  he had left off his cuirass   three balls had passed through him from side to side    that shot has  been in keeping for me a long while   said he   i deserve it for not  having taken precautions    he fell upon his horse s neck  as he vainly  tried to draw his sword from the scabbard  his arm refused its office      illustration  the duke of guise waylaid           when he had been removed to the castle  where the duchess  in tears   received him   i am vexed at it   said he   for the honor of france   and  to his son henry  prince of joinville  a boy of thirteen  he added   kissing him   god grant you grace  my son  to become a good man    he  languished for six days  amidst useless attentions paid him by his  surgeons  giving catherine de  medici  who came daily to see him  the  most pacific counsels  and taking of the duchess his wife the most tender  farewells mingled with the most straightforward and honest avowals    i  do not mean to deny   he said to her   that the counsels and frailties of  youth have led me sometimes into something at which you had a right to be  offended  i pray you to be pleased to excuse me and forgive me    his  brother  the cardinal de guise  bishop of metz  which the duke had so  gloriously defended against charles v   warned him that it was time to  prepare himself for death by receiving the sacraments of the church    ah  my dear brother   said the duke to him   i have loved you greatly in  times past  but i love you now still more than ever  for you are doing me  a truly brotherly turn    on the   th of february they still offered him  aliment to sustain his rapidly increasing weakness but  away  away   said  he   i have taken the manna from heaven  whereby i feel myself so  comforted that it seems to me as if i were already in paradise   this  body has no further need of nourishment   and so he expired on the   th  of february        an object  at his death  of the most profound regret  amongst his army and his party  as well as his family  after having been  during his life the object of their lively admiration    i do not  forget   says his contemporary stephen pasquier in reference to him    that it was no small luck for him to die at this period  when he was  beyond reach of the breeze  and when shifting fortune had not yet played  him any of those turns whereby she is so cunning in lowering the horn of  the bravest      it is a duty to faithfully depict this pious and guileless death of a  great man  at the close of a vigorous and a glorious life  made up of  good and evil  without the evil s having choked the good   this powerful  and consolatory intermixture of qualities is the characteristic of the  eminent men of the sixteenth century  catholics or protestants  soldiers  or civilians  and it is a spectacle wholesome to be offered in times when  doubt and moral enfeeblement are the common malady even of sound minds  and of honest men     the murderer of duke francis of guise was a petty nobleman of angoumois   john poltrot  lord of mere  a fiery catholic in his youth  who afterwards  became an equally fiery protestant  and was engaged with his relative la  renaudie in the conspiracy against the guises   he had been employed  constantly from that time  as a spy it is said  by the chiefs of the  reformers  a vocation for which  it would seem  he was but little  adapted  for the indiscretion of his language must have continually  revealed his true sentiments   when he heard  in       of the death of  anthony de bourbon  king of navarre   that   said he   is not what will  put an end to the war  what is wanted is the dog with the big collar     whom do you mean    asked somebody    the great guisard  and here s the  arm that will do the trick     he used to show   says d aubigne   bullets  cast to slay the guisard  and thereby rendered himself ridiculous    after the battle of dreux he was bearer of a message from the lord of  soubise to admiral de coligny  to whom he gave an account of the  situation of the reformers in dauphiny and in lyonness   his report no  doubt interested the admiral  who gave him twenty crowns to go and play  spy in the camp of the duke of guise  and  some days later  a hundred  crowns to buy a horse   it was thus that poltrot was put in a position to  execute the design he had been so fond of proclaiming before he had any  communication with coligny   as soon as  on the   th of february         in the outskirts of orleans  he had  to use his own expression  done his  trick  he fled full gallop  so as not to bear the responsibility of it   but  whether it were that he was troubled in his mind  or that he was ill  acquainted with the region  he wandered round and round the place where  he had shot the duke of guise  and was arrested on the   th of february  by men sent in search of him   being forthwith brought before the privy  council  in the presence of the queen mother  and put to the torture  he  said that admiral de coligny  theodore de beze  la rochefoucauld   soubise  and other huguenot chiefs had incited him to murder the duke of  guise  persecutor of the faithful   as a meritorious deed in the eyes of  god and men    coligny repudiated this allegation point blank   shrinking  from the very appearance of hypocrisy  he abstained from any regret at  the death of the duke of guise    the greatest blessing   said he   which  could come to this realm and to the church of god  especially to myself  and all my house   and he referred to conversations he had held with the  cardinal of lorraine and the duchess of guise  and to a notice which he  had sent  a few days previously  to the duke of guise himself   to take  care  for there was somebody under a bond to kill him    lastly  he  demanded that  to set in a clear light  his integrity  innocence  and  good repute   poltrot should be kept  until peace was made  in strict  confinement  so that the admiral himself and the murderer might be  confronted   it was not thought to be obligatory or possible to comply  with this desire  amongst the public there was a passionate outcry for  prompt chastisement   poltrot  removed to paris  put to the torture and  questioned by the commissioners of parliament  at one time confirmed and  at another disavowed his original assertions   coligny  he said  had not  suggested the project to him  but had cognizance of it  and had not  attempted to deter him   the decree sentenced poltrot to the punishment  of regicides   he underwent it on the   th of march        in the place  de greve  preserving to the very end that fierce energy of hatred and  vengeance which had prompted his deed   he was heard saying to himself in  the midst of his torments  and as if to comfort himself   for all that   he is dead and gone   the persecutor of the faithful   and he will not  come back again    the angry populace insulted him with yells  poltrot  added   if the persecution does not cease  vengeance will fall upon this  city  and the avengers are already at hand      catherine de  medici  well pleased  perhaps  that there was now a  question personally embarrassing for the admiral and as yet in abeyance   had her mind entirely occupied apparently with the additional weakness  and difficulty resulting to the position of the crown and the catholic  party from the death of the duke of guise  she considered peace  necessary  and  for reasons of a different nature  chancellor de  l hospital was of the same opinion  he drew attention to  scruples of  conscience  the perils of foreign influence  and the impossibility of  curing by an application of brute force a malady concealed in the very  bowels and brains of the people    negotiations were entered into with  the two captive generals  the prince of conde and the constable de  montmorency  they assented to that policy  and  on the   th of march   peace was concluded at amboise in the form of an edict which granted to  the protestants the concessions recognized as indispensable by the crown  itself  and regulated the relations of the two creeds  pending  the  remedy of time  the decisions of a holy council  and the king s  majority    liberty of conscience and the practice of the religion   called reformed  were recognized  for all barons and lords  high justiciary  in their houses  with their families and dependants   for nobles having fiefs without vassals and living on the king s lands   but for them and their families personally    the burgesses were treated  less favorably  the reformed worship was maintained in the towns in  which it had been practised up to the  th of march in the current year   but  beyond that and noblemen s mansions  this worship might not be  celebrated save in the faubourgs of one single town in every bailiwick  or seneschalty   paris and its district were to remain exempt from any  exercise of the said  reformed religion      during the negotiations and as to the very basis of the edict of march            the protestants were greatly divided  the soldiers and the  politicians  with conde at their head  desired peace  and thought that  the concessions made by the catholics ought to be accepted   the majority  of the reformed pastors and theologians cried out against the  insufficiency of the concessions  and were astonished that there should  be so much hurry to make peace when the catholics had just lost their  most formidable captain   coligny  moderate in his principles  but always  faithful to his church when she made her voice heard  showed  dissatisfaction at the selfishness of the nobles    to confine the  religion to one town in every bailiwick   he said   is to ruin more  churches by a stroke of the pen than our enemies could have pulled down  in ten years  the nobles ought to have recollected that example had been  set by the towns to them  and by the poor to the rich    calvin  in his  correspondence with the reformed churches of france  severely handled  conde on this occasion   at the moment when peace was made  the pacific  were in the right  the death of the duke of guise had not prevented the  battle of dreux from being a defeat for the reformers  and  when war had  to be supported for long  it was especially the provincial nobles and the  people on their estates who bore the burden of it   but when the edict of  amboise had put an end to the first religious war  when the question was  no longer as to who won or lost battles  but whether the conditions of  that peace to which the catholics had sworn were loyally observed  and  whether their concessions were effective in insuring the modest amount of  liberty and security promised to the protestants  the question changed  front  and it was not long before facts put the malcontents in the right   between      and      murders of distinguished protestants increased  strangely  and excited amongst their families anxiety accompanied by a  thirst for vengeance   the guises and their party  on their side   persisted in their outcries for proceedings against the instigators   known or presumed  of the murder of duke francis   it was plainly against  admiral de coligny that these cries were directed  and he met them by a  second declaration  very frank as a denial of the deed which it was  intended to impute to him  but more hostile than ever to the guises and  their party    the late duke   said he   was of the whole army the man i  had most looked out for on the day of the last battle  if i could have  brought a gun to bear upon him to kill him  i would have done it  i would  have ordered ten thousand arquebusiers  had so many been under my  command  to single him out amongst all the others  whether in the field   or from over a wall  or from behind a hedge   in short  i would not have  spared any of the means permitted by the laws of war in time of hostility  to get rid of so great an enemy as he was for me and for so many other  good subjects of the king      after three years of such deadly animosity between the two parties and  the two houses  the king and the queen mother could find no other way  of stopping an explosion than to call the matter on before the privy  council  and cause to be there drawn up  on the   th of january         a solemn decree   declaring the admiral s innocence on his own  affirmation  given in the presence of the king and the council as before  god himself  that he had not had anything to do with or approved of the  said homicide   silence for all time to come was consequently imposed  upon the attorney general and everybody else  inhibition and prohibition  were issued against the continuance of any investigation or prosecution   the king took the parties under his safeguard  and enjoined upon them  that they should live amicably in obedience to him    by virtue of this  injunction  the guises  the colignies  and the montmorencies ended by  embracing  the first named accommodating themselves with a pretty good  grace to this demonstration   but god knows what embraces    words used  in la harenga  a satire of the day in burlesque verse upon the cardinal  of lorraine   six years later the st  bartholomew brought the true  sentiments out into broad daylight     at the same time that the war was proceeding amongst the provinces with  this passionate doggedness  royal decrees were alternately confirming and  suppressing or weakening the securities for liberty and safety which the  decree of amboise  on the   th of march        had given to the  protestants by way of re establishing peace   it was a series of  contradictory measures which were sufficient to show the party strife  still raging in the heart of the government   on the   th of june         protestants were forbidden to work  with shops open  on the days of  catholic festivals   on the   th of december        it was proclaimed  that protestants might not gather alms for the poor of their religion   unless in places where that religion was practised  and nowhere else   on the   th of june        a proclamation from the king interdicted the  exercise of the reformed religion within the precincts of any royal  residence   on the  th of august        the reformed churches were  forbidden to hold synods and make collections of money  and their  ministers to quit their places of residence and to open schools   on the    th of november        a king s ordinance interdicted the conferring of  judiciary offices on non catholics   in vain did conde and coligny cry  out loudly against these violations of the peace of amboise  in vain  on  the   th of august        at the moment of proclaiming the king s  majority  was an edict issued giving full and entire confirmation to the  edict of the   th of march preceding  with the addition of prescriptions  favorable to the royal authority  as well as  at the same time  to the  maintenance of the public peace  scarcely any portion of these  prescriptions was observed  the credit of chancellor de l hospital was  clearly very much on the decline  and  whilst the legal government was  thus falling to pieces or languishing away  gaspard de tavannes  a proved  soldier and royalist  who  however  was not yet marshal of france  was  beginning to organize  under the name of brotherhood of the holy spirit   a secret society intended to renew the civil war  if it happened that  occasion should offer for repressing and chastising them of the religion  called reformed    it was the league in its cradle   at the same time   the king had orders given for a speedy levy of six thousand swiss  and  an army corps was being formed on the frontiers of champagne   the  queen mother neglected no pains  no caresses  to hide from conde the true  moving cause at the bottom of all these measures  and as  he was   says  the historian davila   by nature very ready to receive all sorts of  impressions   he easily suffered himself to be lulled to sleep   one day   however  in june        he thought it about time to claim the fulfilment  of a promise that had been made him at the time of the peace of  amboise of a post which would give him the rank and authority of  lieutenant general of the kingdom  as his late brother  the king of  navarre  had been  and he asked for the sword of constable which  montmorency  in consequence of his great age  seemed disposed to resign  to the king  catherine avoided giving any answer  but her favorite son   henry  duke of anjou  who was as yet only sixteen  repudiated this idea  with so much haughtiness that conde felt called upon to ask some  explanations  there was no longer any question of war with spain or of  an army to be got together    what  pray  will you do   he asked   with  the swiss you are raising    the answer was   we shall find good  employment for them      it is the failing of a hypocritical and lying policy  however able  that   if it do not succeed promptly  a moment arrives when it becomes  transparent and lets in daylight   even conde could not delude himself  any longer  the preparations were for war against the reformers   he  quitted the court to take his stand again with his own party   coligny   d andelot  la rochefoucauld  la noue  and all the accredited leaders  amongst the protestants  whom his behavior  too full of confidence or of  complaisance towards the court  had shocked or disquieted  went and  joined him   in september        the second religious war broke out     it was short  and not decisive for either party   at the outset of the  campaign  success was with the protestants  forty towns  orleans   montereau  lagny  montauban  castres  montpellier  uzes   c   opened  their gates to them or fell into their hands     they were within an ace of surprising the king at monceaux  and he never  forgot  says montluc  that  the protestants had made him do the stretch  from meaux to paris at something more than a walk    it was around paris  that conde concentrated all the efforts of the campaign   he had posted  himself at st  denis with a small army of four thousand foot and two  thousand horse   the constable de montmorency commanded the royal army   having a strength of sixteen thousand foot and three thousand horse   attempts were made to open negotiations  but the constable broke them off  brusquely  roaring out that the king would never tolerate two religions   on the   th of november        the battle began at st  denis  and was  fought with alternations of partial success and reverse  which spread joy  and sadness through the two hosts in turn  but in resisting a charge of  cavalry  led to victory by conde  the constable fell with and under his  horse  a scot called out to him to surrender  for sole response  the aged  warrior   abandoned by his men  but not by his manhood   says d aubigne   smashed the scot s jaw with the pommel of his broken sword  and at the  same moment he fell mortally wounded by a shot through the body   his  death left the victory uncertain and the royal army disorganized   the  campaign lasted still four months  thanks to the energetic perseverance  of coligny and the inexhaustible spirits of conde  both of whom excelled  in the art of keeping up the courage of their men    where are you taking  us now   asked an ill tempered officer one day    to meet our german  allies   said conde    and suppose we don t find them     then we will  breathe on our fingers  for it is mighty cold    they did at last  at  pont a mousson  meet the german re enforcements  which were being brought  up by prince john casimir  son of the elector palatine  and which made  conde s army strong enough for him to continue the war in earnest   but  these new comers declared that they would not march any farther unless  they were paid the hundred thousand crowns due to them   conde had but  two thousand    thereupon   says la noue   was there nothing for it but  to make a virtue of necessity  and he as well as the admiral employed all  their art  influence  and eloquence to persuade every man to divest  himself of such means as he possessed for to furnish this contribution   which was so necessary   they themselves were the first to set an  example  giving up their own silver plate            half from love and  half from fear  this liberality was so general  that  down to the very  soldiers  varlets  every one gave  so that at last it was considered a  disgrace to have contributed little   when the whole was collected  it  was found to amount  in what was coined as well as in plate and gold  chains  to more than eighty thousand livres  which came in so timely   that without it there would have been a difficulty in satisfying the  reiters            was it not a thing worthy of astonishment to see an  army  itself unpaid  despoiling itself of the little means it had of  relieving its own necessities and sparing that little for the  accommodation of others  who  peradventure  scarcely gave them a thankee  for it      memoires de la noue  in the petitot collection    st series   t  xxxiv   p           so much generosity and devotion  amongst the humblest as well as the most  exalted ranks of the army  deserved not to be useless  but it turned out  quite differently   conde and coligny led back to paris their new army   which  it is said  was from eighteen to twenty thousand strong  and  seemed to be in a condition either to take paris itself  or to force the  royal army to enter the field and accept a decisive battle   to bring  that about  conde thought the best thing was to besiege chartres   the  key to the granary of paris   as it was called  and  a big thorn    according to la noue   to run into the foot of the parisians    but  catherine de  medici had quietly entered once more into negotiations with  some of the protestant chiefs  even with conde himself   charles ix   published an edict in which he distinguished between heretics and rebels   and assured of his protection all huguenots who should lay down arms   chartres seemed to be on the point of capitulating  when news came that  peace had just been signed at longjumeau  on the   d of march   the king  put again in force the edict of amboise of       suppressing all the  restrictions which had been tacked on to it successively   the prince of  conde and his adherents were reinstated in all their possessions   offices  and honors  and conde was  held and reputed good relative   faithful subject  and servant of the king    the reformers had to  disband  restore the new places they had occupied  and send away their  german allies  to whom the king undertook to advance the hundred thousand  gold crowns which were due to them   he further promised  by a secret  article  that he too would at a later date dismiss his foreign troops and  a portion of the french     this news caused very various impressions amongst the protestant camp and  people   the majority of the men of family engaged in the war  who most  frequently had to bear the expense of it  desired peace   the personal  advantages accruing to conde himself  made it very acceptable to him   but the ardent reformers  with coligny at their head  complained bitterly  of others being lured away by fine words and exceptional favors  and not  prosecuting the war when  to maintain it  there was so good an army and  the chances were so favorable   a serious dispute took place between the  pacific negotiators and the malcontents   chancellor de l hospital wrote   in favor of peace  a discourse on the pacific settlement of the troubles  of the year       containing the necessary causes and reasons of the  treaty  together with the means of reconciling the two parties to one  another  and keeping them in perpetual concord  composed by a high  personage  true subject  and faithful servant of the french crown   but   if the chancellor s reasons were sound  the hopes he hung upon them were  extravagant  the parties were at that pitch of passion at which reasoning  is in vain against impressions  and promises are powerless against  suspicions   concluded  through the vehemence of the desire to get home  again   as la noue says  the peace of longjumeau was none the less known  as the little peace  the patched up peace  the lame and rickety peace   and neither they who wished for it nor they who spurned it prophesied its  long continuance     scarcely six months having elapsed  in august        the third religious  war broke out   the written guarantees given in the treaty of longjumeau  for security and liberty on behalf of the protestants were misinterpreted  or violated   massacres and murders of protestants became more numerous   and were committed with more impunity than ever  in      and       at  amiens  at auxerre  at orleans  at rouen  at bourges  at troyes  and at  blois  protestants  at one time to the number of one hundred and forty or  one hundred and twenty  or fifty three  or forty  and at another singly   with just their wives and children  were massacred  burned  and hunted by  the excited populace  without any intervention on the part of the  magistrates to protect them or to punish their murderers   the  contemporary protestant chroniclers set down at ten thousand the number  of victims who perished in the course of these six months  which were  called a time of peace  we may  with de thou  believe this estimate to be  exaggerated  but  without doubt  the peace of longjumeau was a lie  even  before the war began again     during this interval conde was living in burgundy  at noyers  a little  fortress he possessed through his wife  frances of orleans  and coligny  was living not far from noyers  at tanlay  which belonged to his brother  d andelot   they soon discovered  both of them  not only what their party  had to suffer  but what measures were in preparation against themselves   agents went and sounded the depth of the moats of noyers  so as to report  upon the means of taking the place   the queen mother had orders given to  gaspard de tavannes to surround the prince of conde at noyers    the  queen is counselled by passion rather than by reason   answered the old  warrior   i am not the sort of man to succeed in this ill planned  enterprise of distaff and pen  if her majesty will be pleased to declare  open war  i will show how i understand my duty    shocked at the  dishonorable commands given him  tavannes resolved to indirectly raise  conde s apprehensions  in order to get him out of burgundy  of which he   tavannes  held the governorship  and he sent close past the walls of  noyers bearers of letters containing these words   the stag is in the  toils  the hunt is ready    conde had the bearers arrested  understood  the warning  and communicated it to coligny  who went and joined him at  noyers  and they decided  both of them  upon quitting burgundy without  delay  to go and seek over the loire at la rochelle  which they knew to  be devoted to their cause  a sure asylum and a place suitable for their  purposes as a centre of warlike operations   they set out together on the    th of august         conde took with him his wife and his four  children  two of tender age   coligny followed him in deep mourning  he  had just lost his wife  charlotte de laval  that worthy mate of his  who   six years previously  in a grievous crisis for his soul as well as his  cause  had given him such energetic counsels  she had left him one young  daughter and three little children  the two youngest still in the nurse s  arms   his sister in law  anne do salm  wife of his brother d andelot   was also there with a child of two years  whilst her husband was scouring  anjou and brittany to rally the friends of his cause and his house   a  hundred and fifty men  soldiers and faithful servants  escorted these  three noble and pious families  who were leaving their castles to go and  seek liberties and perils in a new war   when they arrived at the bank of  the loire  they found all points in the neighborhood guarded  the river  was low  and a boatman pointed out to them  near sancerre  a possible  ford   conde went over first  with one of his children in his arms      illustration  conde at the ford           they all went over singing the psalm   when israel went out of egypt    and on the   th of september        conde entered la rochelle    i fled  as far as i could   he wrote the next day   but when i got here i found  the sea  and  inasmuch as i don t know how to swim  i was constrained to  turn my head round and gain the land  not with feet  but with hands    he  assembled the burgesses of la rochelle  and laid before them the pitiable  condition of the kingdom  the wicked designs of people who were their  enemies as well as his own  he called upon them to come and help  he  promised to be aidful to them in all their affairs  and   as a pledge of  my good faith   said he   i will leave you my wife and children  the  dearest and most precious jewels i have in this world    the mayor of la  rochelle  la haise  responded by offering him  lives and property in the  name of all the citizens   who confirmed this offer with an outburst of  popular enthusiasm   the protestant nobles of saintonge and poitou  flocked in   a royal ally was announced  the queen of navarre  jeanne  d albret  was bringing her son henry  fifteen years of age  whom she was  training up to be henry iv   conde went to meet them  and  on the   th of  september        all this flower of french protestantism was assembled at  la rochelle  ready and resolved to commence the third religious war     it was the longest and most serious of the four wars of this kind which  so profoundly agitated france in the reign of charles ix   this one  lasted from the   th of august        to the  th of august        between  the departure of conde and coligny for la rochelle and the treaty of  peace of st  germain en laye  a hollow peace  like the rest  and only two  years before the st  bartholomew   on starting from noyers with coligny   conde had addressed to the king  on the   d of august  a letter and a  request  wherein   after having set forth the grievances of the  reformers  he attributed all the mischief to the cardinal of lorraine   and declared that the protestant nobles felt themselves constrained  for  the safety of the realm  to take up arms against that infamous priest   that tiger of france  and against his accomplices    he bitterly  reproached the guises  with treating as mere policists  that is  men who  sacrifice religion to temporal interests  the catholics inclined to make  concessions to the reformers  especially the chancellor de l hospital and  the sons of the late constable de montmorency    the guises  indeed  and  their friends did not conceal their distrust of de l hospital  any more  than he concealed his opposition to their deeds and their designs   whilst the peace of longjumeau was still in force  charles ix  issued a  decree interdicting all reformers from the chairs of the university and  the offices of the judicature  l hospital refused to seal it   god save  us from the chancellor s mass   was the remark at court   l hospital   convinced that he would not succeed in preserving france from a fresh  civil war  made up his mind to withdraw  and go and live for some time at  his estate of vignay  a little hamlet in the commune of gironville  near  etampes  seine et oise    the queen mother eagerly took advantage of his  withdrawal to demand of him the seals  of which  she said  she might have  need daily   l hospital gave them up at once  at the same time retaining  his title of chancellor  and letting the queen know  that he would take  pains to recover his strength in order to return to his post  if and when  it should be the king s and the queen s pleasure    from his rural home  he wrote to his friends   i am not downhearted because the violence of  the wicked has snatched from me the seals of the kingdom   i have not  done as sluggards and cowards do  who hide themselves at the first show  of danger  and obey the first impulses of fear   as long as i was strong  enough  i held my own   deprived of all support  even that of the king  and the queen  who dared no longer defend me  i retired  deploring the  unhappy condition of france   now i have other cares  i return to my  interrupted studies and to my children  the props of my old age and my  sweetest delight   i cultivate my fields   the estate of vignay seems to  me a little kingdom  if any man may consider himself master of anything  here below            i will tell you more  this retreat  which satisfies  my heart  also flatters my vanity  i like to imagine myself in the wake  of those famous exiles of athens or rome whom their virtues rendered  formidable to their fellow citizens   not that i dare compare myself with  those great men  but i say to myself that our fortunes are similar   i  live in the midst of a numerous family whom i love  i have books  i read   write  and meditate  i take pleasure in the games of my children  the  most frivolous occupations interest me   in fine  all my time is filled  up  and nothing would be wanting to my happiness if it were not for the  awful apparition hard by which sometimes comes  bringing trouble and  desolation to my heart      this  apparition hard by  was war  everywhere present or imminent in the  centre and south west of france  accompanied by all those passions of  personal hatred and vengeance which are characteristic of religious wars   and which add so much of the moral sufferings to the physical calamities  of life   l hospital  when sending the seals to the queen mother  who  demanded them of him  considered it his bounden duty to give her without  any mincing  and the king whom she governed  a piece of patriotic advice    at my departure   he says in his will and testament   i prayed of the  king and queen this thing  that  as they had determined to break the  peace  and proceed by war against those with whom they had previously  made peace  and as they were driving me from the court because they had  heard it said that i was opposed to and ill content with their  enterprise  i prayed them  i say  that if they did not acquiesce in my  counsel  they would  at the very least  some time after they had glutted  and satiated their hearts and their thirst with the blood of their  subjects  embrace the first opportunity that offered itself for making  peace  before that things were reduced to utter ruin  for  whatever there  might be at the bottom of this war  it could not but be very pernicious  to the king and the kingdom    during the two years that it lasted  from  august        to august        the third religious war under charles ix   entailed two important battles and many deadly faction fights  which  spread and inflamed to the highest pitch the passions of the two parties   on the   th of march        the two armies  both about twenty thousand  strong  and appearing both of them anxious to come to blows  met near  jarnac  on the banks of the charente  the royal army had for its chief  catherine de  medici s third son  henry  duke of anjou  advised by the  veteran warrior gaspard de tavannes  and supported by the young duke  henry of guise  who had his father to avenge and his own spurs to win      illustration  henry of lorraine  duke of guise               the prince of conde  with admiral de coligny for second  commanded the  protestant army   we make no pretension to explain and discuss here the  military movements of that day  and the merits or demerits of the two  generals confronted  the duke of aumale has given an account of them and  criticised them in his  histoire des princes de conde   with a complete  knowledge of the facts and with the authority that belongs to him    the  encounter on the   th of march        scarcely deserves   he says   to be  called a battle  it was nothing but a series of fights  maintained by  troops separated and surprised  against an enemy which  more numerous to  begin with  was attacking with its whole force united     a tragic  incident at the same time gave this encounter an importance which it has  preserved in history   admiral de coligny  forced to make a retrograde  movement  had sent to ask the prince of conde for aid  by a second  message he urged the prince not to make a fruitless effort  and to fall  back himself in all haste    god forbid   answered conde   that louis de  bourbon should turn his back to the enemy   and he continued his march   saying to his brother in law  francis de la rochefoucauld  who was  marching beside him   my uncle has made a  clerical error    pas de  clerc   a slip   but the wine is drawn  and it must be drunk    on  arriving at the battle field  whither he had brought with him but three  hundred horse  at the very moment when  with this weak escort  he was  preparing to charge the deep column of the duke of anjou  he received  from la rochefoucauld s horse a kick which broke one of the bones of his  leg  and he had already crushed an arm by a fall   we will borrow from  the duke of aumale the glorious and piteous tale of this incident    conde turned round to his men at arms  and showing first his injured  limbs and then the device   sweet is danger for christ and for  fatherland   which fluttered upon his banner in the breeze   nobles of  france   he cried   this is the desired moment remember in what plight  louis de bourbon enters the battle for christ and fatherland    then   lowering his head  he charges with his three hundred horse upon the eight  hundred lances of the duke of anjou   the first shock of this charge was  irresistible  such for a moment was the disorder amongst the catholics  that many of them believed the day was lost  but fresh bodies of  royalists arrive one after another   the prince has his horse killed  under him  and  in the midst of the confusion  hampered by his wounds  he  cannot mount another   in spite of all  his brave comrades do not desert  him  soubise and a dozen of them  covered with wounds  are taken  an old  man  named la vergne  who had brought with him twenty five sons or  nephews  is left upon the field with fifteen of them   all in a heap    says d aubigne   left almost alone  with his back against a tree  one  knee upon the ground  and deprived of the use of one leg  conde still  defends himself  but his strength is failing him  he sees two catholic  gentlemen to whom he had rendered service  saint jean and d argence  he  calls to them  raises the vizor of his helmet  and holds out to them his  gauntlets   the two horsemen dismount  and swear to risk their lives to  save his   others join them  and are eager to assist the glorious  captive   meanwhile the royal cavalry continues the pursuit  the  squadrons successively pass close by the group which has formed round  conde   soon he spies the red cloaks of the duke of anjou s guards   he  points to them with his finger   d argence understands him  and   hide  your face   he cries    ah d argence  d argence  you will not save me    replies the prince   then  like caesar  covering up his face  he awaited  death the poor soul knew only too well the perfidious character of the  duke of anjou  the hatred with which he was hunting him down  and the  sanguinary orders he would give   the guards had gone by when their  captain  montesquion  learned the name of this prisoner    slay  slay   mordioux   he shouted  then suddenly wheeling his

death of conde gave to the battle of jarnac an importance not its  own   a popular ditty of the day called that prince  the great enemy of  the mass     his end   says the duke of aumale   was celebrated by the  catholics as a deliverance  a solemn te deum was chanted at court and in  all the churches of france   the flags taken were sent to rome  where  pope pius iv  went with them in state to st  peter s   as for the duke of  anjou  he showed his joy and his baseness together by the ignoble  treatment he caused to be inflicted upon the remains of his vanquished  relative  a prince of the blood who had fallen sword in hand   at the  first rumor of conde s death  the duke of montpensier s secretary   coustureau  had been despatched from headquarters with baron de magnac to  learn the truth of the matter    we found him there   he relates   laid  upon an ass  the said sir baron took him by the hair of the head for to  lift up his face  which he had turned towards the ground  and asked me if  i recognized him   but as he had lost an eye from his head  he was  mightily disfigured  and i could say no more than it was certainly his  figure and his hair  and further than that i was unable to speak    meanwhile   continues the duke of aumale   the accounts of those present  removed all doubt  and the corpse  thus thrown across an ass  with arms  and legs dangling  was carried to jarnac  where the duke of anjou lodged  on the evening of the battle   there the body of conde was taken down  amidst the sobs of some protestant prisoners  who kissed  as they wept   the remains of their gallant chief   this touching spectacle did not stop  the coarse ribaldry of the duke of anjou and his favorites  and for two  days the prince s remains were left in a ground floor room  there exposed  to the injurious action of the air and  to the gross insults of the  courtiers   the duke of anjou at last consented to give up the body of  conde to the duke of longueville  his brother in law  who had it interred  with due respect at vendome in the burial place of his ancestors      when in      he thus testified  from a mixture of hatred and fear  an  ignoble joy at the death of louis de conde  the valiant chief of  protestantism  the duke of anjou did not foresee that  nearly twenty  years later  in       when he had become henry iii   king of france  he  would also testify  still from a mixture of hatred and fear  the same  ignoble joy at sight of the corpse of henry de guise  the valiant chief  of catholicism  murdered by his order and in his palace     as soon as conde s death was known at la rochelle  the queen of navarre   jeanne d albret  hurried to tonnay charente  whither the protestant army  had fallen back  she took with her her own son henry  fifteen years old   and henry de bourbon  the late prince of conde s son  who was seventeen   and she presented both of them to the army   the younger  the future  henry iv   stepped forward briskly    your cause   said he   is mine   your interests are mine  i swear on my soul  honor  and life  to be  wholly yours    the young conde took the same oath   the two princes were  associated in the

possessed  and which  elizabeth  the queen of england  took in pledge for the twenty thousand  pounds sterling she lent him   the queen of navarre reviewed the army   which received her with bursts of pious and warlike enthusiasm  and  leaving to coligny her two sons  as she called them  she returned alone  to la rochelle  where she received a like reception from the inhabitants    rough and loyal people   says la noue   and as warlike as mercantile    after her departure  a body of german horse  commanded by count mansfeld   joined coligny in the neighborhood of limoges   their arrival was an

such dispositions on one side and the other  war was resumed and  pushed forward eagerly from june        to june        with alternations  of reverse and success   on the   d of june        a fight took place at  roche l abeille  near st  yrieix in limousin  wherein the protestants had  the advantage   the young catholic noblemen  with henry de guise at their  head  began it rashly  against the desire of their general  gaspard de  tavannes  to show off their bravery before the eyes of the queen mother  and the cardinal of lorraine  both of whom considered the operations of  the army too slow and its successes too rare   they lost five hundred men  and many prisoners  amongst others philip strozzi  whom charles ix  had  just made colonel general of the infantry   they took their revenge on  the  th of september        by forcing coligny to raise the siege of  poitiers  which he had been pushing forward for more than two months  and  on the  d of october following  at the battle of moncontour in poitou   the most important of the campaign  which they won brilliantly  and in  which the protestant army lost five or six thousand men and a great part  of their baggage   before the action began   two gentlemen on the side of  the catholics  being in an out of the way spot  came to speech   says la  noue   with some of the  protestant  religion  there being certain  ditches between them      illustration  parley before the battle of moncontour             sirs   said they   we bear the marks of enemies  but we do not hate you  in any wise  or your party   warn the admiral to be very careful not to  fight  for our army is marvellously strong by reason of re enforcements  that have come in to it  and it is very determined withal   let the  admiral temporize for a month only  for all the nobles have sworn and  said to monseigneur that they will not wait any longer  that he must  employ them within that time  and they will then do their duty   let the  admiral remember that it is dangerous to stem the fury of frenchmen  the  which  however  will suddenly ooze away  if they have not victory  speedily  they will be constrained to make peace  and will offer it you  on advantageous terms   tell him that we know this from a good source   and greatly desired to advertise him of it    afterwards they retired   the others   continues la noue   went incontinently to the admiral for to  make their report  which was to his taste   they told it also to others  of the principals  and some there were who desired that it should be  acted upon  but the majority opined that this notice came from suspected  persons  who had been accustomed to practise fraud and deceit  and that  no account should be made of it    the latter opinion prevailed  and the  battle of moncontour was fought with extreme acrimony  especially on the  part of the catholics  who were irritated by the cruelties  as la noue  himself says  which the protestants had but lately practised at the fight  of la roche l abeille   coligny was wounded in the action  after having  killed with his own hand the marquis philibert of baden  and the melley  had been so hot that the admiral s friends found great difficulty in  extricating him and carrying him off the field to get his wound attended  to   three weeks before the battle  on the   th of september  coligny had  been sentenced to death by the parliament of paris  and hanged in effigy  on the place de greve  and a reward of fifty thousand gold crowns had  been offered to whosoever should give him up to the king s justice dead  or alive  words added  it is said  to the decree at the desire of charles  ix  himself   family sorrows were in coligny s case added to political  reverses  on the   th of may  in this same year       he had lost his  brother d andelot  his faithful comrade in his religious as well as his  warlike career    he found himself   says d aubigne   saddled with the  blame due to accident  his own merits being passed over in silence  with  the remnant of an army which  when it was whole  was in despair even  before the late disaster  with weak towns  dismayed garrisons  and  foreigners without baggage  himself moneyless  his enemies very powerful   and pitiless towards all  especially towards him  abandoned by all the  great  except one woman  the queen of navarre  who  having nothing but  the title  had advanced to niort in order to lend a hand to the afflicted  and to affairs in general   this old man  worn down by fever  endured all  these causes of anguish and many others that came to rack him more  painfully than his grievous wound   as he was being borne along in a  litter  lestrange  an old nobleman  and one of his principal counsellors   travelling in similar fashion  and wounded likewise  had his own litter   where the road was broad  moved forward in front of the admiral s  and  putting his head out at the door  he looked steadily at his chief   saying  with tears in his eyes   yet god is very merciful    thereupon  they bade one another farewell  perfectly at one in thought  without  being able to say more   this great captain confessed to his intimates  that these few friendly words restored him  and set him up again in the  way of good thoughts and firm resolutions for the future    he was so  much restored  that  between the end of      and the middle of       he  marched through the south and the centre of france the army which he had  reorganized  and with which  wherever he went  he restored  if not  security  at any rate confidence and zeal  to his party     on arriving at arnay le duc  in burgundy  he found himself confronted by  marshal de cosse with thirteen thousand men of the king s troops   coligny had barely half as many  but he did not hesitate to attack  and  on the   th of june        he was so near victory that the road was left  open before him   on the  th of july he arrived at charite sur loire   alarm prevailed at paris   a truce for ten days was signed  and  negotiations were reopened for a fresh attempt at peace      if any one  in these lamentable wars  worked hard  both with body and  mind   says la noue   it may be said to have been the admiral  for  as  regards the greatest part of the burden of military affairs and  hardships  it was he who supported them with much constancy and buoyancy   and he was as respectful in his bearing towards the princes his superiors  as he was modest towards his inferiors   he always had piety in singular  esteem  and a love of justice  which made him valued and honored by them  of the party which he had embraced   he did not seek ambitiously for  commands and honors  they were thrust upon him because of his competence  and his expertness   when he handled arms and armies  he showed that he  was very conversant with them  as much so as any captain of his day  and  he always exposed himself courageously to danger   in difficulties  he  was observed to be full of magnanimity and resource in getting out of  them  always showing himself quite free from swagger and parade   in  short  he was a personage worthy to re establish an enfeebled and a  corrupted state   i was fain to say these few words about him in passing   for  having known him and been much with him  and having profited by his  teaching  i should have been wrong if i had not made truthful and  honorable mention of him      memoires de la noue  in the petitot  collection    st series  t  xxxiv   p           the negotiations were short   the war had been going on for two years   the two parties  victorious and vanquished by turns  were both equally  sick of it   in vain did philip ii   king of spain  offer charles ix  an  aid of nine thousand men to continue it   in vain did pope pius v  write  to catherine de  medici   as there can be no communion between satan and  the children of the light  it ought to be taken for certain that there  can be no compact between catholics and heretics  save one full of fraud  and feint     we have beaten our enemies   says montluc   over and over  again  but notwithstanding that  they had so much influence in the king s  council that the decrees were always to their advantage   we won by arms   but they won by those devils of documents    peace was concluded at st   germain en laye on the  th of august        and it was more equitable and  better for the reformers than the preceding treaties  for  besides a  pretty large extension as regarded free exercise of their worship and  their civil rights in the state  it granted  for two years  to the  princes of navarre and conde and twenty noblemen of the religion  who  were appointed by the king  the wardenship of the towns of la rochelle   cognac  montauban  and la charite  whither those of the religion who  dared not return so soon to their own homes might retire    all the  members of the parliament  all the royal and municipal officers  and the  principal inhabitants of the towns where the two religions existed were  further bound over on oath  to maintenance of the edict      peace was made  but it was the third in seven years  and very shortly  after each new treaty civil war had recommenced   no more was expected  from the treaty of st  germain en laye than had been effected by those of  amboise and longjumeau  and on both sides men sighed for something more  stable and definitive   by what means to be obtained and with what  pledges of durability   a singular fact is apparent between      and        there is a season  as it were  of marriages and matrimonial  rejoicings   charles ix  went to receive at the frontier of his kingdom  his affianced bride  archduchess elizabeth of austria  daughter of the  emperor  maximilian ii   who was escorted by the archbishop of treves   chancellor of the empire  the nuptials were celebrated at mezieres  on  the   th of november        the princes and great lords of the protestant  party were invited  they did not think it advisable to withdraw  themselves from their asylum at la rochelle  but coligny wrote to the  queen mother to excuse himself  whilst protesting his forgetfulness of  the past and his personal devotion   four months afterwards  coligny  himself married again  it was three years since he had lost his noble  wife  charlotte de laval  and he had not contemplated anything of the  kind  when  in the concluding weeks of       he received from the castle  of st  andre de briord  in le bugey  a letter from a great lady  thirty  years of age  jacqueline de montbel  daughter of count d entremont   herself a widow  who wrote to him  that she would fain marry a saint and  a hero  and that he was that hero     i am but a tomb   replied coligny   but jacqueline persisted  in spite of the opposition shown by her  sovereign  emmanuel philibert  duke of savoy  who did not like his fair  subjects to marry foreigners  and in february        she furtively  quitted her castle  dropped down the rhone in a boat as far as lyons   mounted on horseback  and  escorted by five devoted friends  arrived at  la rochelle   all coligny s friends were urgent for him to accept this  passionate devotion proffered by a lady who would bring him territorial  possessions valuable to the protestants   for they were an open door to  geneva    coligny accepted  and the marriage took place at la rochelle on  the   th of march          madame jacqueline wore  on this occasion    says a contemporary chronicler   a skirt in the spanish fashion  of black  gold tissue  with bands of embroidery in gold and silver twist  and   above  a doublet of white silver tissue embroidered in gold  with large  diamond buttons    she was  nevertheless  at that moment almost as poor as  the german arquebusiers who escorted her litter  for an edict issued by  the duke of savoy on the   st of january        caused her the loss of  all her possessions in her own country   she was received in france with  the respect due to her  and when  five months after the marriage   charles  ix  summoned coligny to paris   to serve him in his most  important affairs  as a worthy minister  whose virtues were sufficiently  known and tried   he sent at the same time to madame l amirale a  safe conduct in which he called her my fair cousin   was there any one  belonging to that august and illustrious household who had  at that time   a presentiment of their impending and tragic destiny     at the same period  the queen of navarre  jeanne d albret  obtained for  her young nephew  henry de bourbon  prince of conde  son of the hero of  jarnac  and companion of henry of navarre  the hand of his cousin  mary  of cleves  and there was still going on in london  on behalf of one of  charles ix  s brothers   at one time the duke of anjou and at another the  duke of alencon   the negotiation which was a vain attempt to make queen  elizabeth espouse a french prince     coincidently with all these marriages or projects of marriage amongst  princes and great lords came the most important of all  that which was to  unite henry of navarre and charles ix  s sister  marguerite de valois   there had already  thirteen or fourteen years previously  been some talk  about it  in the reign of king henry ii   when henry of navarre and  margaret de valois  each born in       were both of them mere babies   this union between the two branches of the royal house  one catholic and  the other protestant  ought to have been the most striking sign and the  surest pledge of peace between catholicism and protestantism   the  political expediency of such a step appeared the more evident and the  more urgent in proportion as the religious war had become more direful  and the desire for peace more general   charles ix  embraced the idea  passionately   at the outset he encountered an obstacle   the young duke  of guise had already paid court to marguerite  and had obtained such  marked favor with her that the ambassador of spain wrote to the king    there is no public topic in france just now save the marriage of my lady  marguerite with the duke of guise    people even talked of a tender  correspondence between the princess and the duke  which was carried on  through one of the queen s ladies  the countess of mirandola  who was  devoted to the guises and a favorite with marguerite    if it be so    said charles ix   savagely   we will kill him   and he gave such  peremptory orders on this subject  that henry de guise  somewhat  disquieted  avoided for a while taking part in the royal hunts  and  thought it well that there should be resumed on his behalf a project of  marriage with catherine of cleves  widow of the prince of portien  le  porcien  and the wealthy heiress to some great domains  especially the  countship of eu   so long as he had some hope of marrying marguerite de  valois  the duke of guise had repudiated  not without offensiveness  all  idea of union with catherine of cleves    anybody who can make me marry  the princess of portien   said he   could make me marry a negress    he   nevertheless  contracted this marriage  so greatly disdained  on the  th  of october        and at this price recovered the good graces of charles  ix   the queen mother charged the cardinal louis de lorraine  him whom  the people called cardinal bottles  from his conviviality   to publicly  give the lie to any rumor of a possible engagement between her daughter  marguerite and henry de guise  and a grand council of the kings  after  three holdings  adopted in principle the marriage of marguerite de valois  with  the little prince of bearn      charles ix  at once set his hand to the work to turn this resolution to  good account  being the only means  he said  of putting a stop at last to  this incessantly renewed civil war  which was the plague of his life as  well as of his kingdom   he first of all sent marshal de cosse to la  rochelle  to sound coligny as to his feelings upon this subject  and to  urge him to thus cut short public woes and the reformers  grievances    the king has always desired peace   said the marshal   he wishes it to  be lasting  he has proved only too well  to his own misery and that of  his people  that of all the evils which can afflict a state  the most  direful is civil war   but what means this withdrawal  since the signing  of peace at st  germain  of the queen of navarre and her children  of the  prince of conde  and so many lords and distinguished nobles  still  separated from their houses and their families  and collected together in  a town like rochelle  which has great advantages by land and sea for all  those who would fain begin the troubles again   why have they not  returned home   during the hottest part of the war  they ardently desired  to see once more their houses  their wives  and their children  and now   when peace leaves them free to do so  they prefer to remain in a land  which is in some sort foreign  and where  in addition to great expenses   they are deprived of the conveniences they would find at home   the king  cannot make out such absurdity  or  rather  he is very apprehensive that  this long stay means the hatching of some evil design    the protestants  defended themselves warmly against this supposition  they alleged  in  explanation of their persistent disquietude  the very imperfect execution  of the conditions granted by the peace of st  germain  and the insults   the attacks which they had still to suffer in many parts of the kingdom   and quite recently at rouen and at orange   the king attempted  without  any great success  to repress these disorders amongst the populace   the  queen of navarre  the two princes  coligny  and many protestant lords  remained still at la rochelle  where was being held at this time a  general synod of the reformed churches   charles ix  sent thither marshal  de biron  with formal orders to negotiate the marriage of marguerite de  valois and the prince of navarre  and to induce that prince  his mother  the queen of navarre  and coligny to repair to the court in order to  conclude the matter   the young prince was at that time in warn   the  queen  his mother  answered   that she would consult her spiritual  advisers  and  as soon as her conscience was at rest  there were no  conditions she would not accept with a view of giving satisfaction to the  king and the queen  of marking her obedience and respect towards them   and of securing the tranquillity of the state  an object for which she  would willingly sacrifice her own life            but   she added   i  would rather sink to the condition of the humblest damoisel in france  than sacrifice to the aggrandizement of my family my own soul and my  son s      in september        charles ix  and the queen mother repaired to blois   and at their urgent request coligny went thither to talk over the  projected marriage and the affairs of europe   the king received him with  emotional satisfaction  calling him my father  and saying to him   now we  have you  and you shall not escape us when you wish to    jeanne  d albret  more distrustful  or  one ought rather to say  more  clear sighted  refused to leave la rochelle  and continued to negotiate  vaguely and from a distance   catherine de  medici insisted    satisfy    she wrote to her   the extreme desire we have to see you in this company   you will be loved and honored therein as accords with reason and with  what you are    jeanne still waited   it was only in the following year   at the end of january  that  having earnestly exhorted her son  to remain  bearn wards whilst she was at the court of france   she set out for  blois  where charles ix  received her most affectionately  calling her my  good aunt  my dear aunt  and lavishing upon her promises as well as  endearments   jeanne was a strict and a judicious person  and the manners  and proceedings of the court at blois displeased her   on the  th of  march        she wrote to her son   i find it necessary to negotiate  quite contrariwise to what i had expected and what had been promised me   i have no liberty to speak to the king or my lady marguerite  only to the  queen mother  who treats me as if i were dirt            seeing  then   that no advance is made  and that the desire is to make me hurry matters   and not conduct them orderly  i have thrice spoken thereof to the queen   who does nothing but make a fool of me  and tell everybody the opposite  of what i told her  in such sort that my friends find fault with me  and  i know not how to bring her to book  for when i say to her   madame  it  is reported that i said so and so to you   though it was she herself who  reported it  she denies it flatly  and laughs in my face  and uses me in  such wise that you might really say that my patience passes that of  griselda            thenceforward i have a troop of huguenots  who come  to converse with me  rather for the purpose of being spies upon me than  of assisting me   then i have some of another humor  who hamper me no  less  and who are religious hermaphrodites   i defend myself as best i  may         i am sure that if you only knew the trouble i am in  you  would have pity upon me  for they give me empty speeches and raillery  instead of treating with me gravely  as the matter deserves  in such sort  that i am bursting  because i am so resolved not to lose my temper that  my patience is a miracle to see            i found your letter very much  to my taste  i will show  it to my lady marguerite if i can   she is  beautiful  and discreet  and of good demeanor  but brought up in the most  accursed and most corrupt society that ever was   i would not  for  anything in the world  have you here to remain here   that is why i  desire to get you married  and you and your wife withdraw from this  corruption  for though i believed it to be very great  i find it still  more so   here it is not the men who solicit the women  it is the women  who solicit the men   if you were here  you would never escape without a  great deal of god s grace       illustration  admiral gaspard de coligny            side by side with this motherly and christianly scrupulous negotiation   coligny set on foot another  noble and dignified also  but even less in  harmony with the habits and bent of the government which it concerned   the puritan warrior was at the same time an ardent patriot  he had at  heart the greatness of france as much as he had his personal creed  the  reverses of francis i  and the preponderance of spain in europe oppressed  his spirit with a sense of national decadence  from which he wanted  france to lift herself up again   the moment appeared to him propitious   let the king ally himself with queen elizabeth of england  the prince of  orange in the low countries  and the protestant princes of germany  here  was for france a certain guarantee of power in europe  and at the same  time a natural opportunity for conquering flanders  a possession so  necessary to her strength and her security   but high above this policy   so thoroughly french  towered a question still more important than that  of even the security and the grandeur of france  that was the partition  of europe between catholicism and protestantism  and it was in a country  catholic in respect of the great majority  and governed by a kingship  with which catholicism was hereditary  that  in order to put a stop to  civil war between french catholics and protestants  coligny pressed the  king to put himself at the head of an essentially protestant coalition   and make it triumphant in europe   this was  in the sixteenth century  a  policy wholly chimerical  however patriotic its intention may have been   and the french protestant hero who recommended it to charles ix  did not  know that protestantism was on the eve of the greatest disaster it would  have to endure in france     a fact of a personal character tended to mislead coligny   by his renown   by the loftiness of his views  by the earnest gravity of his character  and his language he had produced a great effect upon charles ix   a young  king of warm imagination and impressible and sympathetic temperament   but  at the same time  of weak judgment   he readily gave way  in  coligny s company  to outpourings which had all the appearance of perfect  and involuntary frankness    speaking one day to the admiral about the  course of conduct to be adopted as to the enterprise against flanders   and well knowing that the queen mother lay under his suspicion   my dear  father   said he   there is one thing herein of which we must take good  heed  and that is  that the queen  my mother  who likes to poke her nose  everywhere  as you know  learn nothing of this enterprise  at any rate as  regards the main spring of it  for she would spoil all for us     as you  please  sir  but i take her to be so good a mother  and so devoted to the  welfare of your kingdom  that when she knows of it she will do nothing to  spoil it     you are mistaken  my dear father   said the king   leave it  to me only  i see quite well that you do not know my mother  she is the  greatest meddler in all the world     another time  when he was speaking  likewise to teligny  coligny s son in law  about this enterprise against  flanders  the king said   wouldst have me speak to thee freely  teligny   i distrust all these gentry  i am suspicious of tavannes  ambition   vieilleville loves nothing but good wine  cosse is too covetous   montmorency cares only for his hunting and hawking  the count de retz is  a spaniard  the other lords of my court and those of my council are mere  blockheads  my secretaries of state  to hide nothing of what i think  are  not faithful to me  insomuch that  to tell the truth  i know not at what  end to begin    this tone of freedom and confidence had inspired coligny  with reciprocal confidence  he believed himself to have a decisive  influence over the king s ideas and conduct  and when the protestants  testified their distrust upon this subject  he reproached them vehemently  for it  he affirmed the king s good intentions and sincerity  and he  considered himself in fact  said catherine de  medici with temper    a second king of france      how much sincerity was there about these outpourings of charles ix  in  his intercourse with coligny  and how much reality in the admiral s  influence over the king   we are touching upon that great historical  question which has been so much disputed  was the st  bartholomew a  design  long ago determined upon and prepared for  of charles ix  and his  government  or an almost sudden resolution  brought about by events and  the situation of the moment  to which charles ix  was egged on  not  without difficulty  by his mother catherine and his advisers     we recall to mind here what was but lately said in this very chapter as  to the condition of minds and morals in the sixteenth century  and as to  the tragic consequences of it   massacre  we add no qualifying term to  the word  was an idea  a habit  we might say almost a practice  familiar  to that age  and one which excited neither the surprise nor the horror  which are inseparable from it in our day   so little respect for human  life and for truth was shown in the relations between man and man   not  that those natural sentiments  which do honor to the human race  were  completely extinguished in the hearts of men  they reappeared here and  there as a protest against the vices and the crimes of the period  but  they were too feeble and too rare to struggle effectually against the  sway of personal passions and interests  against atrocious hatreds and  hopes  against intellectual aberrations and moral corruption   to betray  and to kill were deeds so common that they caused scarcely any  astonishment  and that people were almost resigned to them beforehand   we have cited fifteen or twenty cases of the massacres which in the reign  of charles ix   from      to       grievously troubled and steeped in  blood such and such a part of france  without leaving any lasting traces  in history   previously to the massacre called the st  bartholomew  the  massacre of vassy is almost the only one which received and kept its true  name   the massacre of vassy was  undoubtedly  an accident  a deed not at  all forecast or prepared for   the st  bartholomew massacre was an event  for a long time forecast and announced  promised to the catholics and  thrown out as a threat to the protestants  written beforehand  so to  speak  in the history of the religious wars of france  but  nevertheless   at the moment at which it was accomplished  and in the mode of its  accomplishment  a deed unexpected so far as the majority of the victims  were concerned  and a cause of contest even amongst its originators   accordingly it was  from the very first  a subject of surprise and  horror  throughout europe as well as in france  not only because of the  torrents of blood that were shed  but also because of the extraordinary  degree in which it was characterized by falsehood and ferocious hatred     we will bring forward in support of this double assertion only such facts  and quotations as appear to us decisive     in       charles ix  and catherine de  medici had an interview at bayonne  with the duke of alba  representative of philip ii   to consult as to the  means of delivering france from heretics    they agreed at last   says  the contemporary historian adriani  continuer of guicciardini  he had  drawn his information from the  journal of cosmo de  medici   grand duke  of tuscany  who died in         in the opinion of the catholic king  who  thought that this great blessing could not have accomplishment save by  the death of all the chiefs of the huguenots  and by a new edition  as  the saying was  of the sicilian vespers    take the big fish   said the  duke of alba   and let the small fry go  one salmon is worth more than a  thousand frogs    they decided that the deed should be done at moulins in  bourbonness  whither the king was to return   the execution of it was  afterwards deferred to the date of the st  bartholomew  in       at  paris  because of certain suspicions which had been manifested by the  huguenots  and because it was considered easier and more certain to get  them all together at paris than at moulins      catherine de  medici charged cardinal santa croce to assure pope pius v    that she and her son had nothing more at heart than to get the admiral  and all his confidants together some day and make a massacre   un  macello   of them  but the matter   she said   was so difficult that  there was no possibility of promising to do it at one time more than at  another      la noue bears witness in his  memoires  to  the resolution taken at  bayonne  with the duke of alba aiding  to exterminate the huguenots of  france and the beggars   gueux   of flanders  whereof warning had been  given by those about whom there was no doubt   all these things  and many  others as to which i am silent  mightily waked up those   he adds   who  had no desire to be caught napping   and i remember that the chiefs of  the religion held  within a short time  three meetings  as well at valeri  as at chatillon  to deliberate upon present occurrences  and to seek out  legitimate and honorable expedients for securing themselves against so  much alarm  without having recourse to extreme remedies      de thou regards these facts as certain  and  after having added some  details  he sums them all up in the words   this is what passed at  bayonne in           in       after the third religious war and the peace of  st  germain en laye  marshal de tavaunes wrote to charles ix    peace  has a chance of lasting  because neither of the two parties is willing  or able to renew open war  but  if one of the two sees quite a safe  opportunity for putting a complete end to what is at the root of the  question  this it will take  for to remain forever in the state now  existing is what nobody can or ought to hope for   and there is no such  near approximation to a complete victory as to take the persons   for to  surprise what they  the reformers  hold  to put down their religion  and  to break off all at once the alliances which support them  this is  impossible   thus there is no way but to take the chiefs all together  for to make an end of it      next year  on the   th of august        when the st  bartholomew broke  out  tavannes took care to himself explain what he meant in      by those  words  to take the chiefs all together for to make an end of it   being  invested with the command in paris   he went about the city all day    says brantome   and  seeing so much blood spilt  he said and shouted to  the people   bleed  bleed  the doctors say that bleeding is as good all  through this month of august as in may       in the year which preceded the outbreak of the massacre  when the  marriage of marguerite de valois with the prince of navarre was agreed  upon  and coligny was often present at court  sometimes at blois and  sometimes at paris  there arose between the king and the queen mother a  difference which there had been up to that time nothing to foreshadow   it was plain that the union between the two branches  catholic and  protestant  of the royal house and the patriotic policy of coligny were  far more pleasing to charles ix  than to his mother     on the matrimonial question the king s feeling was so strong that he  expressed it roughly   jeanne d albret having said to him one day that  the pope would make them wait a long while for the dispensation requested  for the marriage   no  no  my clear aunt   said the king   i honor you  more than i do the pope  and i love my sister more than i fear him   i am  not a huguenot  but no more am i an ass   if the pope has too much of his  nonsense  i will myself take margot by the hand and carry her off to be  married in open conventicle    toligny  for his part  was so pleased with  the measures that charles ix  had taken in favor of the low countries in  their quarrels with philip ii   and so confident himself of his influence  over the king  that when tavannes was complaining in his presence  that  the vanquished should make laws for the victors   coligny said to his  face   whoever is not for war with spain is not a good frenchman  and has  the red cross inside him    the catholics were getting alarmed and  irritated   the guises and their partisans left the court   it was near  the time fixed for the marriage of henry of navarre and marguerite de  valois  the new pope  gregory xiii   who had at first shown more pliancy  than his predecessor pius v   attached to the dispensation conditions to  which neither the intended husband nor king charles ix  himself was  inclined to consent   the queen of navarre  jeanne d albret  who had gone  to paris in preparation for the marriage  had died there on the  th of  june        a death which had given rise to very likely ill founded  accusations of poisoning    a princess   says d aubigne   with nothing of  a woman but the sex  with a soul full of everything manly  a mind fit to  cope with affairs of moment  and a heart invincible in adversity    it  was in deep mourning that her son  become king of navarre  arrived at  court  attended by eight hundred gentlemen  all likewise in mourning    but   says marguerite de valois herself   the nuptials took place a few  days afterwards with such triumph and magnificence as none others of my  quality  the king of navarre and his troop having changed their mourning  for very rich and fine clothes  and i being dressed royally  with crown  and corset of tufted ermine  all blazing with crown jewels  and the grand  blue mantle with a train four ells long borne by three princesses  the  people choking one another down below to see us pass    the marriage was  celebrated on the   th of august  by the cardinal of bourbon  in front of  the principal entrance of notre dame   when the princess marguerite was  asked if she consented  she appeared to hesitate a moment  but king  charles ix  put his hand a little roughly on her head  and made her lower  it in token of assent   accompanied by the king  the queen mother  and  all the catholics present  marguerite went to hear mass in the choir   henry and his protestant friends walked about the cloister and the nave   marshal de damville pointed out to coligny the flags  hanging from the  vaulted roof of notre dame  which had been taken from the vanquished at  the battle of moncontour    i hope   said the admiral   that they will  soon have others better suited for lodgement in this place    he was  already dreaming of victories over the spaniards     meanwhile charles ix  was beginning to hesitate   he was quite willing  to disconnect himself from the king of spain  and even to incur his  displeasure  but not to be actively embroiled with him and make war upon  him  he could not conceal from himself that this policy  thoroughly  french though it was  was considered in france too protestant for a  catholic king   coligny urged him vehemently    if you want men   he  said   i have ten thousand at your service   whereupon tavannes said to  the king   sir  whoever of your subjects uses such words to you  you  ought to have his head struck off   how is it that he offers you that  which is your own   it is that he has won over and corrupted them  and  that he is a party leader to your prejudice    tavannes  a rough and  faithful soldier  did not admit that there could be amongst men moral  ties of a higher kind than political ties   charles ix   too weak in mind  and character to think and act with independence and consistency in the  great questions of the day  only sought how to elude them  and to leave  time  that inscrutable master  to settle them in his place   his  indecision brought him to a state of impotence  and he ended by inability  to do anything but dodge and lie  like his mother  and even with his  mother   whilst he was getting his sister married to the king of navarre  and concerting his policy with coligny  he was adopting towards the three  principal personages who came to talk over those affairs with him three  different sorts of language  to cardinal alessandrino  whom pope pius v   had sent to him to oppose the marriage  he said   my lord cardinal  all  that you say to me is sound  i acknowledge it  and i thank the pope and  you for it  if i had any other means of taking vengeance on my enemies   i would not make this marriage  but i have no other    with jeanne  d albret  he lauded himself for the marriage as the best policy he could  pursue    i give my sister   he said   not to the prince of navarre  but  to all the huguenots  to marry them as it were  and take from them all  doubt as to the unchangeable fixity of my edicts    and to humor his  mother catherine  he said to her  on the very evening of his interview  with jeanne d albret   what think you  madam   do i not play my partlet  well     yes  very well  but it is nothing if it is not continued    and  charles continued to play his part  even after the bartholomew was over   for he was fond of saying with a laugh   my big sister margot caught all  those huguenot rebels in the bird catching style   what has grieved me  most is being obliged to dissimulate so long      his contemporary catholic biographer  papirius masson  who was  twenty eight years old at the time of the st  bartholomew  says of him    he is impatient in waiting  ferocious in his fits of anger  skilfully  masked when he wishes  and ready to break faith as soon as that appears  to his advantage       illustration  charles ix  and catherine de  medici            such was the prince  fiery and flighty  inconsistent and artful   accessible to the most opposite sympathies as well as hatreds  of whom  catherine de  medici and admiral coligny were disputing the possession     in the spring of      coligny might have considered himself the victor in  this struggle  at his instance charles ix  had written on the   th of  april to count louis of nassau  leader of the protestant insurrection in  hainault   that he was determined  so far as opportunities and the  arrangements of his affairs permitted him  to employ the powers which god  had put into his hands for the deliverance of the low countries from the  oppression under which they were groaning    fortified by this promise of  the king s  coligny had raised a body of french protestants  and had sent  it under the command of la noue to join the army of louis of nassau   the  reformers had at first had some successes  they had taken valenciennes  and mons  but the duke of alba restored the fortunes of the king of  spain  he re entered valenciennes and he was besieging mons   coligny  sent to the aid of that place a fresh body of french under the orders of  senlis  one of his comrades in faith and arms   before setting out   senlis saw charles ix   received from him money together with  encouragement  and  in the corps he led  some catholics were mixed with  the protestants   but from the very court of france there came to the  duke of alba warnings which put him in a position to surprise the french  corps  and senlis was beaten and made prisoner on the   th of july    i have in my hands   the duke of alba sent word to his king   a letter  from the king of france which would strike you dumb if you were to see  it  for the moment  it is expedient to say nothing about it     news of  the defeat of senlis   says tavannes   comes flying to court  and changes  hearts and counsels   disdain  despite  is engendered in the admiral  who  hurls this defeat upon the heads of those who have prevented the king  from declaring himself  he raises a new levy of three thousand foot  and   not regarding who he is and where he is  he declares  in the presumption  of his audacity  that he can no longer hold his partisans  and that it  must be one of two wars  spanish or civil   it is all thunder storm at  court  everyone remains on the watch at the highest pitch of resolution    a grand council was assembled   coligny did not care   he had already  at  the king s request  set forth in a long memorial all the reasons for his  policy of a war with spain  the king had appeared struck with them  but    as he only sought   says de thou   to gain time without its being  perceived   he handed the admiral s memorial to the keeper of the seals   john de morvilliers  requesting him to set forth also all the reasons for  a pacific policy   coligny  a man of resolution and of action  did not  take any pleasure in thus prolonging the discussion  nevertheless he  again brought forward and warmly advocated  at the grand council  the  views he had so often expressed   they were almost unanimously rejected   coligny did not consider himself bound to give them up    i have  promised   said he   on my own account  my assistance to the prince of  orange  i hope the king will not take it ill if by means of my friends   and perhaps in person  i fulfil my promise    this reservation excited  great surprise    madam   said coligny to the queen mother   the king is  to day shunning a war which would promise him great advantages  god  forbid that there should break out another which he cannot shun    the  council broke up in great agitation    let the queen beware   said  tavannes   of the king her son s secret councils  designs  and sayings   if she do not look out  the huguenots will have him   at any rate  before  thinking of anything else  let her exert herself to regain the mother s  authority which the admiral has caused her to lose      the king was hunting at brie   the queen mother went and joined him  she  shut herself up with him in a cabinet  and  bursting into tears  she  said   i should never have thought that  in return for having taken so  much pains to bring you up and preserve to you the crown  you would have  had heart to make me so miserable a recompense   you hide yourself from  me  me who am your mother  in order to take counsel of your enemies   i  know that you hold secret counsels with the admiral  you desire to plunge  rashly into war with spain  in order to give your kingdom  yourself  and  the persons that are yours  over as a prey to them of the religion   if i  am so miserable a creature  yet before i see that  give me leave to  withdraw to the place of my birth  remove from you your brother  who may  call himself unfortunate in having employed his own life to preserve  yours  give him at least time to withdraw out of danger and from the  presence of enemies made in doing you service  huguenots who desire not  war with spain  but with france  and the subversion of all the estates in  order to set up themselves      tavannes himself terms these expressions  an artful harangue   but he  says   it moved  astounded  and dismayed the king  not so much on the  score of the huguenots as of his mother and brother  whose subtlety   ambition  and power in the state he knew  he marvelled to see his  counsels thus revealed  he avowed them  asked pardon  promised obedience   having sown this distrust  having shot this first bolt  the queen mother   still in displeasure  withdrew to monceaux   the trembling king followed  her  he found her with his brother and sieurs de tavannes  de retz  and  the secretary of state de sauve  the last of whom threw himself upon his  knees and received his majesty s pardon for having revealed his counsels  to his mother   the infidelity  the bravado  the audacity  the menaces   and the enterprises of the huguenots were magnified with so much of truth  and art that from friends behold them converted into enemies of the king   who  nevertheless  wavering as ever  could not yet give up the desire he  had conceived of winning glory and reputation by war with spain      a fresh incident increased the agitation in the royal circle   in july         the throne of poland had become vacant   a polish embassy came to  offer it to the duke of anjou   on his part and his mother s  there was  at first great eagerness to accept it  catherine was charmed to see her  favorite son becoming a king    if we had required   says a polish  historian   that the french should build a bridge of solid gold over the  vistula  they would have agreed    hesitation soon took the place of  eagerness  henry demanded information  and took time to reply   he had  shown similar hesitation at the time of the negotiations entered upon in  london  in       with a view of making him the husband of elizabeth   queen of england  coligny  who was very anxious to have him away  pressed  charles ix  to insist upon a speedy solution    if monsieur   said he    who would not have england by marriage  will not have poland either by  election  let him declare once for all that he will not leave france    the relations between the two brothers became day by day more  uncomfortable  two years later  henry  for a brief period king of poland   himself told the story of them to his physician miron    when  by any  chance   he said   the queen mother and i  after the admiral s departure   approached the king to speak to him of any matters  even those which  concerned merely his pleasure  we found him marvellously quick tempered  and cross grained  with rough looks and bearing  and his answers still  more so   one day  a very short time before the st  bartholomew  setting  out expressly from my quarters to go and see the king  somebody told me  on inquiry that he was in his cabinet  whence the admiral  who had been  alone with him a very long while  had just that instant gone out   i  entered at once  as i had been accustomed to do   but as soon as the king  my brother perceived me  he  without saying anything to me  began walking  about furiously and with long steps  often looking towards me askance and  with a very evil eye  sometimes laying his hand upon his dagger  and in  so excited a fashion that i expected nothing else but that he would come  and take me by the collar to poniard me   i was very vexed that i had  gone in  reflecting upon the peril i was in  but still more upon how to  get out of it  which i did so dexterously  that  whilst he was walking  with his back turned to me  i retreated quickly towards the door  which i  opened  and  with a shorter obeisance than at my entry  i made my exit   which was scarcely perceived by him until i was outside   and straightway  i went to look for the queen my mother  and  putting together all  reports  notifications  and suspicions  the time  and past circumstances   in conjunction with this last meeting  we remained both of us easily  persuaded  and as it were certain  that it was the admiral who had  impressed the king with some bad and sinister opinion of us  and we  resolved from that moment to rid ourselves of him      one idea immediately occurred to catherine and her son   two persons felt  a passionate hatred towards coligny  they were the widow of duke francis  of guise  anne d este  become duchess of nemours by a second marriage   and her son henry de guise  a young man of twenty two   they were both  convinced that coligny had egged on poltrot to murder duke francis  and  they had sworn to exact vengeance   being informed of the queen mother s  and the duke of anjou s intention  they entered into it eagerly  the  young duke of guise believed his mother quite capable of striking down  the admiral in the very midst of one of the great assemblies at court   the fair ladies of the sixteenth century were adepts in handling dagger  and pistol   in default of the duchess of nemours  her son was thought of  for getting rid of coligny    it was at one time decided   says the duke  de bouillon in his memoires   that m  de guise should kill the admiral  during a tilt at the ring which the king gave in the garden of the  louvre  and in which all messieurs were to lead sides   i was on that of  the duke  who was believed to have an understanding with the admiral   on  this occasion  it was so managed that our dresses were not ready  and the  late duke and his side did not tilt at all   the resolution against the  admiral was changed prudently  inasmuch as it was very perilous  for the  person of the king and of messieurs  to have determined to kill him in  that place  there being present more than four hundred gentlemen of the  religion  who might have gone very far in case of an assault upon that  lord  who was so much beloved by them    everything considered  it was  thought more expedient to employ for the purpose an inferior agent   catherine and the duke of anjou sent for a gascon captain  a dependant of  the house of lorraine  whom they knew to be resolute and devoted    we had him shown the means he should adopt   says the duke of anjou    in attacking him whom we had in our eye  but  having well scanned him   himself and his movements  and his speech and his looks  which had made  us laugh and afforded us good pastime  we considered him too hare brained  and too much of a wind bag to deal the blow well    they then applied to  an officer  of practice and experience in murder   charles de louviers   sieur de maurevert  who was called the king s slaughterman   le tueur du  roi    because he had already rendered such a service  and they agreed  with him as to all the circumstances of place  time  and procedure most  likely to secure the success of the deed  whilst giving the murderer  chances of escape     in such situations there is scarcely any project the secret of which is  so well kept that there does not get abroad some rumor to warn an  observant mind  and when it is the fate of a religious or a popular hero  that is in question  there is never any want of devoted friends or  servants about him  ready to take alarm for him   when coligny mounted  his horse to go from chatillon to paris  a poor countrywoman on his  estates threw herself before him  sobbing   ah  sir  ah  our good master   you are going to destruction  i shall never see you again if once you go  to paris  you will die there  you and all those who go with you    at  paris  on the approach of the st  bartholomew  the admiral heard that  some of his gentlemen were going away    they treat you too well here    said one of them  langoiran  to him   better to be saved with the fools  than lost for the sake of being thought over wise     the admiral was  beset by letters which reminded him of the queen mother s crooked ways   and the detestable education of the king  trained to every sort of  violence and horrible sin  his bible is macchiavelli  he has been  prepared by the blood of beasts for the shedding of human blood  he has  been persuaded that a prince is not bound to observe an edict extorted by  his subjects    to all these warnings coligny replied at one time by  affirming the king s good faith  and at another by saying   i would  rather be dragged dead through the muck heaps of paris than go back to  civil war    this great soul had his seasons  not of doubt as to his  faith or discouragement as to his cause  but of profound sorrow at the  atrocious or shameful spectacles and the public or private woes which had  to be gone through     charles ix  himself felt some disquietude as to the meeting of the guises  and coligny at his court   the guises had quitted it before the   th of  august  the day fixed for the marriage of king henry of navarre with  marguerite de valois   when the marriage was over  they were to return   and they did   at the moment of their returning  the king said to  coligny  with demonstrations of the most sincere friendship   you know   my dear father  the promise you made me not to insult any of the guises  as long as you remained at court   on their side  they have given me  their word that they will have for you  and all the gentry of your  following  the consideration you deserve   i rely entirely upon your  word  but i have not so much confidence in theirs  i know that they are  only looking for an opportunity of letting their vengeance burst forth  i  know their bold and haughty character  as they have the people of paris  devoted to them  and as  on coming hither  under pretext of the  rejoicings at my sister s marriage  they have brought a numerous body of  well armed soldiers  i should be inconsolable if they were to take  anything in hand against you  such an outrage would recoil upon me   that  being so  if you think as i do  i believe the best thing for me is to  order into the city the regiment of guards  with such and such captains   he mentioned none but those who were not objects of suspicion to  coligny   this re enforcement   added the king   will secure public  tranquillity  and  if the factious make any disturbance  there will be  men to oppose to them    the admiral assented to the king s proposal   he  added that he was ready to declare  that never had he been guilty or  approving of the death of duke francis of guise  and that he set down as  a calumniator and a scoundrel whoever said  that he had authorized it    though frequently going to the palace  both he and the guises  they had  not spoken when they met   charles had promised the lorraine princes  not  to force them to make friends with coligny more than was agreeable to  them    he believed that he had taken every precaution necessary to  maintain in his court  for some time at least  the peace he desired     on friday  the   d of august        coligny was returning on foot from  the louvre to the rue des fosses  st  germain l auxerrois  where he  lived  he was occupied in reading a letter which he had just received   a shot  fired from the window of a house in the cloister of  st  germain l auxerrois  smashed two fingers of his right hand and  lodged a ball in his left arm  he raised his eyes  pointed out with his  injured hand the house whence the shot had come  and reached his  quarters on foot   two gentlemen who were in attendance upon him rushed  to seize the murderer  it was too late  maurevert had been lodging there  and on the watch for three days at the house of a canon  an old tutor to  the duke of guise  a horse from the duke s stable was waiting for him at  the back of the house  and  having done his job  he departed at a  gallop   he was pursued for several leagues without being overtaken     coligny sent to apprise the king of what had just happened to him    there   said he   was a fine proof of fidelity to the agreement between  him and the duke of guise     i shall never have rest  then   cried  charles  breaking the stick with which he was playing tennis with the  duke of guise and teligny  the admiral s son in law  and he immediately  returned to his room   the duke of guise took himself off without a word   teligny speedily joined his father in law   ambrose pare had already  attended to him  cutting off the two broken fingers  somebody expressed a  fear that the balls might have been poisoned    it will be as god pleases  as to that   said coligny  and  turning towards the minister  merlin  who  had hurried to him  he added   pray that he may grant me the gift of  perseverance    towards midday  marshals de damville  de cosse  and de  villars went to see him  out of pure friendship   they told him   and not  to exhort him to endure his mishap with patience  we know that you will  not lack patience     i do protest to you   said coligny   that death  affrights me not  it is of god that i hold my life  when he requires it  back from me  i am quite ready to give it up   but i should very much  like to see the king before i die  i have to speak to him of things which  concern his person and the welfare of his state  and which i feel sure  none of you would dare to tell him of     i will go and inform his  majesty            rejoined damville  and he went out with villars and  teligny  leaving marshal de cosse in the room    do you remember   said  coligny to him   the warnings i gave you a few hours ago   you will do  well to take your precautions      about two p  m   the king  the queen mother  and the dukes of anjou and  alencon  her two other sons  with many of their high officers  repaired  to the admiral s    my dear father   said the king  as he went in   the  hurt is yours  the grief and the outrage mine  but i will take such  vengeance that it shall never be forgotten   to which he added his usual  imprecations    then the admiral  who lay in bed sorely wounded   says  the duke of anjou himself  in his account of this interview   requested  that he might speak privately to the king  which the king granted  readily  making a sign to the queen my mother  and to me  to withdraw   which we did incontinently into the middle of the room  where we remained  standing during this secret colloquy  which caused us great misgiving   we saw ourselves surrounded by more than two hundred gentlemen and  captains of the admiral s party  who were in the room and another  adjoining  and  besides  in a ball below  the which  with sad faces and  the gestures and bearing of malcontents  were whispering in one another s  ears  frequently passing and repasssing before and behind us  not with so  much honor and respect as they ought to have done  and as if they had  some suspicion that we had somewhat to do with the admiral s hurt   we  were seized with astonishment and fear at seeing ourselves shut in there   as my mother has since many times confessed to me  saying that she had  never been in any place where there was so much cause for fright  and  whence she had gone away with more relief and pleasure   this  apprehension caused us to speedily break in upon the conversation the  admiral was having with the king  under a polite excuse invented by the  queen my mother  who  approaching the king  said out loud that she had no  idea he would make the admiral talk so much  and that she saw quite well  that his physicians and surgeons considered it bad for him  as it  certainly was very dangerous  and enough to throw him into a fever  which  was  above everything  to be guarded against   she begged the king to put  off the rest of their conversation to another time  when the admiral was  better   this vexed the king mightily  for he was very anxious to hear  the remainder of what the admiral had to say to him   however  he being  unable to gainsay so specious an argument  we got the king away   and  incontinently the queen mother  and i too  begged the king to let us know  the secret conversation which the admiral had held with him  and in which  he had been unwilling that we should be participators  which the king  refused several times to do   but finding himself importuned and hard  pressed by us  he told us abruptly and with displeasure  swearing by  god s death that what the admiral said was true  that kings realized  themselves as such in france only in so far as they had the  power of  doing harm or good to their subjects and servants  and that this power  and management of affairs had slipped imperceptibly into the hands of the  queen my mother and mine     this superintendent domination  the admiral  told me  might some day be very prejudicial to me and to all my kingdom   and that i should hold it in suspicion and beware of it  of which he was  anxious to warn me  as one of my best and most faithful subjects  before  he died   there  god s death  as you wish to know  is what the admiral  said to me    this  said as it was with passion and fury  went straight  home to our hearts  which we concealed as best we might  both of us   however  defending ourselves in the matter   we continued this  conversation all the way from the admiral s quarters to the louvre   where  having left the king in his room  we retired to that of the queen  my mother  who was piqued and hurt to the utmost degree at this language  used by the admiral to the king  as well as at the credence which the  king seemed to accord to it  and was fearful lest it should bring about  some change and alteration in our affairs and in the management of the  state   being unable to resolve upon any course at the moment  we  retired  putting off the question till the morrow  when i went to see my  mother  who was already up   i had a fine racket in my head  and so had  she  and for the time there was no decision come to save to have the  admiral despatched by some means or other   it being impossible any  longer to employ stratagems and artifices  it would have to be done  openly  and the king brought round to that way of thinking   we agreed  that  in the afternoon  we would go and pay him a visit in his closet   whither we would get the sieur de nevers  marshals de tavannes and de  retz  and chancellor de birague to come  merely to have their opinion as  to the means to be adopted for the execution  which we had already  determined upon  my mother and i      on saturday  the   d of august  in the afternoon  the queen mother  the  duke of anjou  marshals do tavannes and de retz  the duke of nevers  and  the chancellor de birague met in the king s closet  who was irresolute  and still talking of exacting from the guises heavy vengeance for the  murderous attack upon coligny   catherine  represented to him that the  party of the huguenots had already seized this occasion for taking up  arms against him  they had sent   she said   several despatches to  germany to procure a levy of ten thousand reiters  and to the cantons of  the swiss for another levy of ten thousand foot  the french captains   partisans of the huguenots  had already  most of them  set out to raise  levies within the kingdom time and place of meeting had already been  assigned and determined   all the catholics  on their side   added  catherine   disgusted with so long a war and harassed by so many kinds of  calamities  have resolved to put a stop to them  they have decided  amongst them to elect a captain general  to form a league offensive and  defensive against the huguenots   the whole of france would thus be seen  armed and divided into two great parties  between which the king would  remain isolated  without any command and with about as much obedience   for so much ruin and calamity in anticipation and already within a  finger s reach  and for the slaughter of so many thousands of men  a  preventive may be found in a single sword thrust  all that is necessary  is to kill the admiral  the head and front of all the civil wars  the  designs and the enterprises of the huguenots will die with him  and the  catholics  satisfied with the sacrifice of two or three men  will remain  forever in obedience to the king              at the beginning   continues  the duke of anjou  in his account   the king would not by any means  consent to have the admiral touched  feeling  however  some fear of the  danger which we had so well depicted and represented  to him  he desired  that  in a case of such importance  every one should at once state his  opinion    when each of those present had spoken  the king appeared still  undecided   the queen mother then resolved  to let him hear the truth in  toto from marshal de retz  from whom she knew that he would take it  better than from any other   says his sister marguerite de valois in her  memoires   as one who was more in his confidence and favor than any  other   the which came to see him in the evening  about nine or ten  and  told him that  as his faithful servant  he could not conceal from him the  danger he was in if he were to abide by his resolution to do justice on  m  de guise  because it was necessary that he should know that the attack  upon the admiral was not m  de guise s doing alone  but that my brother  henry  the king of poland  afterwards king of france  and the queen my  mother  had been concerned in it  which m  de guise and his friends would  not fail to reveal  and which would place his majesty in a position of  great danger and embarrassment    towards midnight  the queen mother went  down to the king  followed by her son henry and four other councillors   they found the king more put out than ever   the conversation began  again  and resolved itself into a regular attack upon the king    the  guises   he was told   will denounce the king himself  together with his  mother and brother  the huguenots will believe that the king was in  concert with the party  and they will take the whole royal family to  task   war is inevitable   better to win a battle in paris  where we hold  all the chiefs in our clutches  than put it to hazard in the field   after a struggle of an hour and a half  charles  in a violent state of  agitation  still hesitated  when the queen mother  fearing lest  if there  were further delay  all would be discovered  said to him   permit me and  your brother  sir  to retire to some other part of the kingdom    charles  rose from his seat    by god s death   said he   since you think proper  to kill the admiral  i consent  but all the huguenots in paris as well   in order that there remain not one to reproach me afterwards   give the  orders at once     and he went back into his room     in order to relieve and satisfy her own passions and those of her  favorite son  which were fear and love of power  the queen mother had  succeeded in working her king son into a fit of weakness and mad anger   anxious to profit by it   she gave orders on the instant for the signal   which was not to have been given until an hour before daybreak   says de  thou   and  instead of the bell at the palace of justice  the tocsin was  sounded by the bell of st  germain auxerrois  which was nearer      even before the king had given his formal consent  the projectors of the  outrage had carefully prepared for its execution  they had apportioned  out amongst themselves or to their agents the different quarters of the  city   the guises had reserved for themselves that in which they  considered they had personal vengeance as well as religious enmity to  satisfy  the neighborhood of st  germain l auxerrois  and especially rue  de bethisy and rue des fosses st  germain   awakened by the noise around  his house  and  before long  by arquebuse shots fired in his court yard   coligny understood what was going to happen  he jumped out of bed  put on  his dressing gown  and  as he stood leaning against the wall  he said to  the clergyman  merlin  who was sitting up with him   m  merlin  say me a  prayer  i commit my soul to my saviour    one of his gentlemen  cornaton   entered the room    what is the meaning of this riot   asked ambrose  pare  who had also remained with the admiral      my lord   said cornaton to coligny   it is god calling us     i have  long been ready to die   said the admiral   but you  my friends  save  yourselves  if it is still possible    all ran up stairs and escaped  the  majority by the roof  a german servant  nicholas muss  alone remained  with the admiral   as little concerned   says cornaton   as if there were  nothing going on around him    the door of his room was forced   two men   servants of the guises  entered first   one of them  behme  attached to  the duke of guise s own person  came forward  saying   art thou not the  admiral     young man   said coligny   thou comest against a wounded and  an aged man   thou lt not shorten my life by much    behme plunged into  his stomach a huge pointed boar spear which he had in his hand  and then  struck him on the head with it   coligny fell  saying   if it were but a  man   but  tis a horse boy

certain is that  a few days afterwards   mandelot  governor of lyons  wrote to the king   i have received  sir   the letter your majesty was pleased to write to me  whereby you tell me  that you have been advertised that there is a man who has set out from  over yonder with the head he took from the admiral after killing him  for  to convey it to rome  and to take care  when the said man arrives in this  city  to have him arrested  and to take from him the said head   whereupon i incontinently gave such strict orders  that  if he presents  himself  the command which it pleases your majesty to lay upon me will be  acted upon   there hath not passed  for these last few days  by way of  this city  any person going romewards save a squire of the duke of  guise s  named paule  the which had departed four hours previously on the  same day on which i received the said letter from your majesty      we do not find anywhere  in reference to this incident  any information  going further than this reply of the governor of lyons to charles ix   however it may be  the remains of coligny s body  after having been hung  and exposed for some days on the gibbet of montfaucon  were removed by  duke francis de montmorency  the admiral s relative and friend  who had  them transferred to chantilly and interred in the chapel of the castle   after having been subjected  in the course of three centuries  at one  time to oblivion and at others to divers transferences  these sad relics  of a great man  a great christian  and a great patriot  have been  resting  for the last two and twenty years  in the very castle of  chatillon sur loing  his ancestors  own domain having once more become  the property of a relative of his family  the duke of luxembourg  to whom  count anatole de montesquiou transferred them  and who  in       had them  sealed up in a bit of wall in ruins  at the foot of an old tower  under  the site of the bed chamber of the duchesses of chatillon  where  in all  probability  coligny was born   the more tardy the homage  the greater     the actual murderers of coligny  the real projectors of the  st  bartholomew  catherine de  medici and her son the duke of anjou  at  the very moment when they had just ordered the massacre  were seized with  affright at the first sound of their crime   the duke of anjou finishes  his story with this page  after but two hours  rest during the night   just as the day was beginning to break  the king  the queen my mother   and i went to the frontal of the louvre  adjoining the tennis court  into  a room which looks upon the area of the stable yard  to see the  commencement of the work   we had not been there long when  as we were  weighing the issues and the consequence of so great an enterprise  on  which  sooth to say  we had up to that time scarcely bestowed a thought   we heard a pistol shot fired   i could not say in what spot  or whether  it knocked over anybody  but well know i that the sound wounded all three  of us so deeply in spirit that it knocked over our senses and judgment   stricken with terror and apprehension at the great troubles which were  then about to set in   to prevent them  we sent a gentleman at once and  with all haste to m  de guise  to tell him and command him expressly from  us to retire into his quarters  and be very careful to take no steps  against the admiral  this single command putting a stop to everything  else  because it had been determined that in no spot in the city should  any steps be taken until  as a preliminary  the admiral had been killed   but soon afterwards the gentleman returning told us that m  de guise had  answered him that the command came too late  that the admiral was dead   and the work was begun throughout the rest of the city   so we went back  to our original determination  and let ourselves follow the thread and  the course of the enterprise      the enterprise  in fact  followed its thread and natural course without  its being in the power of anybody to arrest or direct it   it had been  absolutely necessary to give information of it the evening before to the  provost of tradesmen of paris  le charron  president in the court of  taxation  board of excise   and to the chief men of the city   according  to brantome   they made great difficulties and imported conscience into  the matter  but m  de tavannes  in the king s presence  rebuked them  strongly  and threatened them that  if they did not make themselves busy   the king would have them hanged   the poor devils  unable to do aught  else  thereupon answered   ha  is that the way you take it  sir  and you   monsieur   we swear to you that you shall hear news thereof  for we will  ply our hands so well right and left that the memory shall abide forever  of a right well kept st  bartholomew      wherein they did not fail    continues brantome   but they did not like it at first    according to  other reports  the first opposition of the provost of tradesmen  le  charron  was not without effect  it was not till the next day that he let  the orders he had received take their course  and it was necessary to  apply to his predecessor in his office  the ex provost marcel  a creature  of the queen mother s  to set in motion the turbulent and the fanatical  amongst the populace   which it never does to  blood   for it is  afterwards more savage than is desirable    once let loose upon the  st  bartholomew  the parisian populace was eager indeed  but not alone in  its eagerness  for the work of massacre  the gentlemen of the court took  part in it passionately  from a spirit of vengeance  from religious  hatred  from the effect of smelling blood  from covetousness at the  prospect of confiscations at hand   teligny  the admiral s son in law   had taken refuge on a roof  the duke of anjou s guards make him a mark  for their arquebuses   la rochefoucauld  with whom the king had been  laughing and joking up to eleven o clock the evening before  heard a  knocking at his door  in the king s name  it is opened  enter six men in  masks and poniard him   the new queen of navarre  marguerite de valois   had gone to bed by express order of her mother catherine    just as i was  asleep   says she   behold a man knocking with feet and hands at the door  and shouting  navarre   navarre   my nurse  thinking it was the king my  husband  runs quickly to the door and opens it   it was a gentleman named  m  de leran  who had a sword cut on the elbow  a gash from a halberd on  the arm  and was still pursued by four archers  who all came after him  into my bedroom   he  wishing to save himself  threw himself on to my  bed  as for me  feeling this man who had hold of me  i threw myself out  of bed towards the wall  and he after me  still holding me round the  body   i did not know this man  and i could not tell whether he had come  thither to offer me violence  or whether the archers were after him in  particular  or after me   we both screamed  and each of us was as much  frightened as the other   at last it pleased god that m  de nanqay   captain of the guards  came in  who  finding me in this plight  though he  felt compassion  could not help laughing  and  flying into a great rage  with the archers for this indiscretion  he made them begone  and gave me  the life of that poor man who had hold of me  whom i had put to bed and  attended to in my closet  until he was well       illustration  the queen of navarre and the huguenot            we might multiply indefinitely these anecdotical scenes of the massacre   most of them brutally ferocious  others painfully pathetic  some generous  and calculated to preserve the credit of humanity amidst one of its most  direful aberrations   history must show no pity for the vices and crimes  of men  whether princes or people  and it is her duty as well as her  right to depict them so truthfully that men s souls and imaginations may  be sufficiently impressed by them to conceive disgust and horror at them   but it is not by dwelling upon them and by describing them minutely  as  if she had to exhibit a gallery of monsters and madmen  that history can  lead men s minds to sound judgments and salutary impressions  it is  necessary to have moral sense and good sense always in view  and set high  above great social troubles  just as sailors  to struggle courageously  against the tempest  need to see a luminous corner where the sky is  visible  and a star which reveals to them the port   we take no pleasure   and we see no use  in setting forth in detail the works of evil  we  should be inclined to fear that  by familiarity with such a spectacle   men would lose the perception of good  and cease to put hope in its  legitimate and ultimate superiority   nor will we pause either to discuss  the secondary questions which meet us at the period of which we are  telling the story  for example  the question whether charles ix  fired  with his own hand on his protestant subjects whom he had delivered over  to the evil passions of the aristocracy and of the populace  or whether  the balcony from which he is said to have indulged in this ferocious  pastime existed at that time  in the sixteenth century  at the palace of  the louvre  and overlooking the seine   these questions are not without  historic interest  and it is well for learned men to study them  but we  consider them incapable of being resolved with certainty  and  even were  they resolved  they would not give the key to the character of charles  ix  and to the portion which appertains to him in the deed of cruelty  with which his name remains connected   the great historic fact of the  st  bartholomew is what we confine ourselves to  and we have attempted to  depict it accurately as regards charles ix  s hesitations and equally  feverish resolutions  his intermixture of open heartedness and  double dealing in his treatment of coliguy  towards whom he felt himself  drawn without quite understanding him  and his puerile weakness in  presence of his mother  whom he feared far more than he trusted   when he  had plunged into the orgies of the massacre  when  after having said    kill them all   he had seen the slaughter of his companions in his royal  amusements  teligny and la rochefoucauld  charles ix  abandoned himself  to a fit of mad passion   he was asked whether the two young huguenot  princes  henry of navarre and henry de conde  were to be killed also   marshal de retz had been in favor of it  marshal de tavannes had been  opposed to it  and it was decided to spare them   on the very night of  the st  bartholomew  the king sent for them both    i mean for the  future   said he   to have but one religion in my kingdom  the mass or  death  make your choice    henry of navarre reminded the king of his  promises  and asked for time to consider  henry de conde  answered that  he would remain firm in the true religion though he should have to give  up his life for it     seditious madman  rebel  and son of a rebel   said  charles   if within three days you do not change your language  i will  have you strangled    at this first juncture  the king saved from the  massacre none but his surgeon  ambrose pare  and his nurse  both  huguenots  on the very night after the murder of coligny  he sent for  ambrose pare into his chamber  and made him go into his wardrobe  says  brantome   ordering him not to stir  and saying that it was not  reasonable that one who was able to be of service to a whole little world  should be thus massacred    a few days afterwards   now   said the king  to pare   you really must be a catholic     by god s light   answered  pars   i think you must surely remember  sir  to have promised me  in  order that i might never disobey you  never  on the other hand  to bid me  do four things  find my way back into my mother s womb  catch myself  fighting in a battle  leave your service  or go to mass    after a  moment s silence charles rejoined   ambrose  i don t know what has come  over me for the last two or three days  but i feel my mind and my body  greatly excited  in fact  just as if i had a fever  meseems every moment   just as much waking as sleeping  that those massacred corpses keep  appearing to me with their faces all hideous and covered with blood   i  wish the helpless and the innocent had not been included     and in  consequence of the reply made to him   adds sully in his   economies  royales  t  i   p       in the petitot collection    he next day issued  his orders  prohibiting  on pain of death  any slaying or plundering  the  which were  nevertheless  very ill observed  the animosities and fury of  the populace being too much inflamed to defer to them      the historians  catholic or protestant  contemporary or researchful   differ widely as to the number of the victims in this cruel massacre   according to de thou  there were about two thousand persons killed in  paris the first day  d aubigne says three thousand  brantome speaks of  four thousand bodies that charles ix  might have seen floating down the  seine  la popeliniere reduces them to one thousand   there is to be  found  in the account books of the city of paris  a payment to the  grave diggers of the cemetery of the innocents for having interred eleven  hundred dead bodies stranded at the turns of the seine near chaillot   auteuil  and st  cloud  it is probable that many corpses were carried  still farther  and the corpses were not all thrown into the river   the  uncertainty is still greater when one comes to speak of the number of  victims throughout the whole of france  de thou estimates it at thirty  thousand  sully at seventy thousand  perefixe  archbishop of paris in the  seventeenth century  raises it to one hundred thousand  papirius masson  and davila reduce it to ten thousand  without clearly distinguishing  between the massacre of paris and those of the provinces  other  historians fix upon forty thousand   great uncertainty also prevails as  to the execution of the orders issued from paris to the governors at the  provinces  the names of the viscount d orte  governor of bayonne  and of  john le hennuyer  bishop of lisieux  have become famous from their having  refused to take part in the massacre  but the authenticity of the letter  from the viscount d orte to charles ix  is disputed  though the fact of  his resistance appears certain  and as for the bishop  john le hennuyer   m  de formeville seems to us to have demonstrated in his  histoire de  l ancien eveche comte de lisieux   t  ii   pp             that there was  no occasion to save the protestants of lisieux  in       because they did  not find themselves in any danger of being massacred  and that the merit  of it cannot be attributed to anybody  to the bishop  le hennuyer  any  more than to captain fumichon  governor of the town   it was only the  general course of events and the discretion of the municipal officers of  lisieux that did it all    one thing which is quite true  and which it is  good to call to mind in the midst of so great a general criminality  is  that  at many spots in france  it met with a refusal to be associated in  it  president jeannin at dijon  the count de tende in provence  philibert  de la guiche at macon  tanneguy le veneur de carrouge at rouen  the count  de gordes in dauphiny  and many other chiefs  military or civil  openly  repudiated the example set by the murderers of paris  and the municipal  body of nantes  a very catholic town  took upon this subject  as has been  proved from authentic documents by m  vaurigaud  pastor of the reformed  church at nantes  in his  essai sur l histoire des eglises reformees de  bretagne   t  i   pp             a resolution which does honor to its  patriotic firmness as well as to its christian loyalty      illustration  chancellor michael de l hospital              a great  good man  a great functionary  and a great scholar  in disgrace  for six years past  the chancellor michael de l hospital  received about  this time  in his retreat at vignay  a visit from a great philosopher   michael de montaigne   anxious   said the visitor   to come and testify  to you the honor and reverence with which i regard your competence and  the special qualities which are in you  for  as to the extraneous and the  fortuitous  it is not to my taste to put them down in the account    montaigne chose a happy moment for disregarding all but the personal  and  special qualities of the chancellor  shortly after his departure   l hospital was warned that some sinister looking horsemen were coming   and that he would do well to take care of himself    no matter  no  matter   he answered   it will be as god pleases when my hour has come    next day he was told that those men were approaching his house  and he  was asked whether he would not have the gates shut against them  and have  them fired upon  in case they attempted to force an entrance    no   said  he   if the small gate will not do for them to enter by  let the big one  be opened    a few hours afterwards  l hospital was informed that the  king and the queen mother were sending other horsemen to protect him    i didn t know   said the old man   that i had deserved either death or  pardon    a rumor of his death flew abroad amongst his enemies  who  rejoiced at it    we are told   wrote cardinal granvelle to his agent at  brussels  october            that the king has had chancellor de  l hospital and his wife despatched  which would be a great blessing    the agent  more enlightened than his chief  denied the fact  adding    they are a fine bit of rubbish left  l hospital and his wife    charles  ix  wrote to his old adviser to reassure him   loving you as i do    some  time after  however  he demanded of him his resignation of the title of  chancellor  wishing to confer it upon la birague  to reward him for his  co operation in the st  bartholomew   l hospital gave in his resignation  on the  st of february        and died six weeks afterwards  on the   th  of march    i am just at the end of my long journey  and shall have no  more business but with god   he wrote to the king and the queen mother    i implore him to give you his grace  and to lead you with his hand in  all your affairs  and in the government of this great and beautiful  kingdom which he hath committed to your keeping  with all gentleness and  clemency towards your good subjects  in imitation of himself  who is good  and  patient in bearing our burdens  and prompt to forgive you and pardon  you everything      from the   th to the   st of august        the bearing and conduct of  charles ix  and the queen mother produced nothing but a confused mass of  orders and counter orders  affirmations and denials  words and actions  incoherent and contradictory  all caused by a habit of lying and the  desire of escaping from the peril or embarrassment of the moment   on the  very first day of the massacre  about midday  the provost of tradesmen  and the sheriffs  who had not taken part in the  paris matins   came  complaining to the king  of the pillage  sack  and murder which were  being committed by many belonging to the suite of his majesty  as well as  to those of the princes  princesses  and lords of the court  by noblemen   archers  and soldiers of the guard  as well as by all sorts of gentry and  people mixed with them and under their wing    charles ordered them  to  get on horseback  take with them all the forces in the city  and keep  their eyes open day and night to put a stop to the said murder  pillage   and sedition arising   he said   because of the rivalry between the  houses of guise and chatillon  and because they of guise had been  threatened by the admiral s friends  who suspected them of being at the  bottom of the hurt inflicted upon him    he  the same day  addressed to  the governors of the provinces a letter in which he invested the  disturbance with the same character  and gave the same explanation of it   the guises complained violently at being thus disavowed by the king  who  had the face to throw upon them alone the odium of the massacre which he  had ordered   next day  august     the king wrote to all his agents  at  home and abroad  another letter  affirming that  what had happened at  paris had been done solely to prevent the execution of an accursed  conspiracy which the admiral and his allies had concocted against him   his mother  and his brothers   and  on the   th of august  he went with  his two brothers to hold in state a bed of justice  and make to the  parliament the same declaration against coligny and his party    he could  not   he said   have parried so fearful a blow but by another very  violent one  and he wished all the world to know that what had happened  at paris had been done not only with his consent  but by his express  command    whereupon it was enjoined upon the court  says de thou   to  cause investigations to be made as to the conspiracy of coligny  and to  decree what it should consider proper  conformably with the laws and with  justice    the next day but one  august     appeared a royal manifesto  running   the king willeth and intendeth that all noblemen and others  whosoever of the religion styled reformed be empowered to live and abide  in all security and liberty  with their wives  children  and families  in  their houses  as they have heretofore done and were empowered to do by  benefit of the edicts of pacification   and nevertheless  for to obviate  the troubles  scandals  suspicion  and distrust  which might arise by  reason of the services and assemblies that might take place both in the  houses of the said noblemen and elsewhere  as is permitted by the  aforesaid edicts of pacification  his majesty doth lay very express  inhibitions and prohibitions upon all the said noblemen and others of the  said religion against holding assemblies  on any account whatsoever   until that  by the said lord the king  after having provided for the  tranquillity of his kingdom  it be otherwise ordained   and that  on pain  of confiscation of body and goods in case of disobedience      these tardy and lying accusations officially brought against coligny and  his friends  these promises of liberty and security for the protestants   renewed in the terms of the edicts of pacification  and  in point of  fact  annulled at the very moment at which they were being renewed  the  massacre continuing here and there in france  at one time with the secret  connivance and at another notwithstanding the publicly given word of the  king and the queen mother  all this policy  at one and the same time  violent and timorous  incoherent and stubborn  produced amongst the  protestants two contrary effects  some grew frightened  others angry   at court  under the direct influence of the king and his surroundings    submission to the powers that be  prevailed  many fled  others  without  abjuring their religion  abjured their party   the two reformer princes   henry of navarre and henry de conde  attended mass on the   th of  september  and  on the  d of october  wrote to the pope  deploring their  errors and giving hopes of their conversion   far away from paris  in the  mountains of the pyrenees and of languedoc  in the towns where the  reformers were numerous and confident  at sancerre  at montauban  at  nimes  at la rochelle  the spirit of resistance carried the day   an  assembly  meeting at milhau  drew up a provisional ordinance for the  government of the reformed church   until it please god  who has the  hearts of kings in his keeping  to change that of king charles ix  and  restore the state of france to good order  or to raise up such  neighboring prince as is manifestly marked out  by his virtue and by  distinguishing signs  for to be the liberator of this poor afflicted  people    in november        the fourth religious war broke out   the  siege of la rochelle was its only important event   charles ix  and his  councillors exerted themselves in vain to avoid it   there was everything  to disquiet them in this enterprise  so sudden a revival of the religious  war after the grand blow they had just struck  the passionate energy  manifested by the protestants in asylum at la rochelle  and the help they  had been led to hope for from queen elizabeth  whom england would never  have forgiven for indifference in this cause   marshal de biron  who was  known to favor the reformers  was appointed governor of la rochelle  but  he could not succeed in gaining admittance within the walls  even alone  and for the purpose of parleying with the inhabitants   the king heard  that one of the bravest protestant chiefs  la noue  ironarm   had retired  to mons with prince louis of nassau   the duke of longueville  his old  enemy  induced him to go to paris   the king received him with great  favor  gave up to him the property of teligny  whose sister la noue had  married  and pressed him to go to la rochelle and prevail upon the  inhabitants to keep the peace   la noue refused  saying that he was not  at all fitted for this commission   the king promised that he would ask  nothing of him which could wound his honor   la noue at last consented   and repaired  about the end of november        to a village close by la  rochelle  whither it was arranged that deputies from the town would come  and confer with him   and they came  in fact  but at their first meeting    we are come   they said   to confer with m  de la noue  but we do not  see him here    la noue got angry    i am astonished   he said   that you  have so soon forgotten one who has received so many wounds and lost an  arm fighting for you     yes  there is a m  de la noue  who was one of  us  and who bravely defended our cause  but he never flattered us with  vain hopes  he never invited us to conferences to betray us    la noue  got more fiercely angry    all i ask of you is  to report to the senate  what i have to say to them    they complied  and came back with  permission for him to enter the town   the people looked at him  as he  passed  with a mixture of distrust and interest   after hearing him  the  senate rejected the pacific overtures made to them by la noue    we have  no mind to treat specially and for ourselves alone  our cause is that of  god and of all the churches of france  we will accept nothing but what  shall seem proper to all our brethren   for yourself  we give you your  choice between three propositions  remain in our town as a simple  burgess  and we will give you quarters  if you like better to be our  commandant  all the nobility and the people will gladly have you for  their head  and will fight with confidence under your orders  if neither  of these propositions suits you  you shall be welcome to go aboard one of  our vessels and cross over to england  where you will find many of your  friends    la noue did not hesitate  he became  under the authority of  the mayor jacques henri  the military head of la rochelle  whither  charles ix  had sent him to make peace   the king authorized him to  accept this singular position   la noue conducted himself so honorably in  it  and everybody was so convinced of his good faith as well as bravery   that for three months he commanded inside la rochelle  and superintended  the preparations for defence  all the while trying to make the chances of  peace prevail   at the end of february        he recognized the  impossibility of his double commission  and he went away from la  rochelle  leaving the place in better condition than that in which he had  found it  without either king or rochellese considering that they had any  right to complain of him     biron first and then the duke of anjou in person took the command of the  siege   they brought up  it is said  forty thousand men and sixty pieces  of artillery   the rochellese  for defensive strength  had but twenty two  companies of refugees or inhabitants  making in all thirty one hundred  men  the siege lasted from the   th of february to the   th of june         six assaults were made on the place  in the last  the ladders had  been set at night against the wall of what was called gospel bastion  the  duke of guise  at the head of the assailants  had escaladed the breach   but there he discovered a new ditch and a new rampart erected inside   and  confronted by these unforeseen obstacles  the men recoiled and fell  back   la rochelle was saved   charles ix  was more and more desirous of  peace  his brother  the duke of anjou  had just been elected king of  poland  charles ix  was anxious for him to leave france and go to take  possession of his new kingdom   thanks to these complications  the peace  of la rochelle was signed on the  th of july         liberty of creed and  worship was recognized in the three towns of la rochelle  montauban  and  nimes   they were not obliged to receive any royal garrison  on condition  of giving hostages to be kept by the king for two years   liberty of  worship throughout the extent of their jurisdiction continued to be  recognized in the case of lords high justiciary   everywhere else the  reformers had promises of not being persecuted for their creed  under the  obligation of never holding an assembly of more than ten persons at a  time   these were the most favorable conditions they had yet obtained     certainly this was not what charles ix  had calculated upon when he  consented to the massacre of the protestants    provided   he had said    that not a single one is left to reproach me    the massacre had been  accomplished almost without any resistance but that offered by certain  governors of provinces or towns  who had refused to take part in it   the  chief leader of french protestantism  coligny  had been the first victim   far more than that  the parliament of paris had accepted the royal lie  which accused coligny of conspiring for the downfall of the king and the  royal house  a decree  on that very ground  sentenced to condemnation the  memory  the family  and the property of coligny  with all sorts of  rigorous  we should rather say atrocious  circumstances   and after  having succeeded so well against the protestants  charles ix  saw them  recovering again  renewing the struggle with him  and wresting from him  such concessions as he had never yet made to them   more than ever might  he exclaim   then i shall never have rest    the news that came to him  from abroad was not more calculated to satisfy him      illustration  the st  bartholomew            the st  bartholomew had struck europe with surprise and horror  not only  amongst the princes and in the countries that were protestant  in  england  scotland  and northern europe  but in catholic germany itself   there was a very strong feeling of reprobation  the emperor maximilian  ii  and the elector palatine frederic iii   called the pious  showed it  openly  when the duke of anjou  elected king of poland  went through  germany to go and take possession of his kingdom  he was received at  heidelberg with premeditated coolness   when he arrived at the gate of  the castle  not a soul went to meet him  alone he ascended the steps  and  found in the hall a picture representing the massacre of st  bartholomew   the elector called his attention to the portraits of the principal  victims  amongst others that of coligny  and at table he was waited upon  solely by french protestant refugees   at rome itself  in the midst of  official satisfaction and public demonstrations of it exhibited by the  pontifical court  the truth came out  and pope gregory xiii  was touched  by it when certain of my lords the cardinals who were beside him  asked  wherefore he wept and was sad at so goodly a despatch of those wretched  folk  enemies of god and of his holiness   i weep   said the pope   at  the means the king used  exceeding unlawful and forbidden of god  for to  inflict such punishment  i fear that one will fall upon him  and that he  will not have a very long bout of it  will not live very long    i fear   too  that amongst so many dead folk there died as many innocent as  guilty      brantome   t  iv   p        he attributes this language to  pope pius v   who died four months before the st  bartholomew

event  and he offered  charles ix   the assistance of his army  if he had need of it  against  what there was remaining of heretics in his kingdom     charles ix  had not mind or character sufficiently sound or sufficiently  strong to support  without great perturbation  the effect of so many  violent  repeated  and often contradictory impressions   catherine de  medici had brought up her three sons solely with a view of having their  confidence and implicit obedience    all the actions of the  queen mother   said the venetian ambassador sigismund cavalli  who had  for a long while resided at her court   have always been prompted and  regulated by one single passion  the passion of ruling    her son charles  had yielded to it without an effort in his youth    he was accustomed to  say that  until he was five and twenty  he meant to play the fool  that  is to say  to think of nothing but of enjoying his heyday  accordingly he  showed aversion for speaking and treating of business  putting himself  altogether in his mother s hands   now  he no longer thinks and acts in  the same way   i have been told that  since the late events  he requires  to have the same thing said more than three times over by the queen   before obeying her    it was not with regard to his mother only that  charles had changed    his looks   says cavalli   have become melancholy  and sombre  in his conversations and audiences he does not look the  speaker in the face  he droops his head  closes his eyes  opens them all  at once  and  as if he found the movement painful  closes them again with  no less suddenness   it is feared that the demon of vengeance has  possessed him  he used to be merely severe  it is feared that he is  becoming cruel   he is temperate in his diet  drinks nothing but water   to tire himself at any price  is his object   he remains on horseback for  twelve or fourteen consecutive hours  and so he goes hunting and coursing  through the woods the same animal  the stag  for two or three days  never  stopping but to eat  and never resting but for an instant during the  night    he was passionately fond of all bodily exercises  the practice  of arms  and the game of tennis    he had a forge set up for himself    says brantome   and i have seen him forging cannon  and horseshoes  and  other things as stoutly as the most robust farriers and forgemen    he   at the same time  showed a keen and intelligent interest in intellectual  works and pleasures   he often had a meeting  in the evening  of poets   men of letters  and artists  ronsard  amadis jamin  jodelle  daurat   baif  in      he gave them letters patent for the establishment of an  academy of poetry and music  the first literary society founded in france  by a king  but it disappeared amidst the civil wars   charles ix   himself sang in the choir  and he composed a few hunting airs   ronsard  was a favorite  almost a friend  with him  he used to take him with him  on his trips  and give him quarters in his palace  and there was many an  interchange of verse between them  in which ronsard did not always have  the advantage   charles gave a literary outlet to his passion for  hunting  he wrote a little treatise entitled la chasse royale  which was  not published until       and of which m  henry chevreul brought out  in        a charming and very correct edition   charles ix  dedicated it to  his lieutenant of the hunt  mesnil  in terms of such modest and  affectionate simplicity that they deserve to be kept in remembrance    mesnil   said the king   i should feel myself far too ungrateful  and  expect to be chidden for presumption  if  in this little treatise that i  am minded to make upon stag hunting  i did not  before any one begins to  read it  avow and confess that i learnt from you what little i know            i beg you  also  mesnil  to be pleased to correct and erase what  there is wrong in the said treatise  the which  if peradventure it is so  done that there is nothing more required than to re word and alter  the  credit will be firstly yours for having so well taught me  and then mine  for having so well remembered   well  then  having been taught by so good  a master  i will be bold enough to essay it  begging you to accept it as  heartily as i present it and dedicate it to you      these details and this quotation are allowable in order to shed full  light upon the private and incoherent character of this king  who bears  the responsibility of one of the most tragic events in french history   in the spring of       at the age of twenty three years and eleven  months  and after a reign of eleven years and six months  charles ix   was attacked by an inflammatory malady  which brought on violent  hemorrhage  he was revisited  in his troubled sleep  by the same bloody  visions about which  a few days after the st  bartholomew  he had spoken  to ambrose pare   he no longer retained in his room anybody but two of  his servants and his nurse   of whom he was very fond  although she was a  huguenot   says the contemporary chronicler peter de l estoile    when  she had lain down upon a chest  and was just beginning to doze  hearing  the king moaning  weeping  and sighing  she went full gently up to the  bed    ah  nurse  nurse   said the king   what bloodshed and what  murders   ah  what evil counsel have i followed   o  my god  forgive me  them and have mercy upon me  if it may please thee   i know not what hath  come to me  so bewildered and agitated do they make me   what will be the  end of it all   what shall i do   i am lost  i see it well   then said  the nurse to him   sir  the murders be on the heads of those who made you  do them   of yourself  sir  you never could  and since you are not  consenting thereto  and are sorry therefor  believe that god will not put  them down to your account  and will hide them with the cloak of justice  of his son  to whom alone you must have recourse   but for god s sake   let your majesty cease weeping    and thereupon  having been to fetch him  a pocket handkerchief  because his own was soaked with tears  after that  the king had taken it from her hand  he signed to her to go away and  leave him to his rest      on sunday  may           whitsunday  about three in the afternoon   charles ix  expired  after having signed an ordinance conferring the  regency upon his mother catherine   who accepted it   was the expression  in the letters patent   at the request of the duke of alencon  the king  of navarre  and other princes and peers of france    according to  d aubigne  charles used often to say of his brother henry  that   when he  had a kingdom on his hands  the administration would find him out  and  that he would disappoint those who had hopes of him    the last words he  said were   that he was glad not to have left any young child to succeed  him  very well knowing that france needs a man  and that  with a child   the king and the reign are unhappy            chapter xxxiv     henry iii  and the religious wars                   illustration  henry iii            though elected king of poland on

been scarcely four  months king of poland when he was apprised  about the middle of june   that his brother charles had lately died  on the   th of may  and that he  was king of france    do not waste your time in deliberating   said his  french advisers   you must go and take possession of the throne of france  without abdicating that of poland  go at once and without fuss    henry  followed this counsel   he left cracow  on the   th of june  with a very  few attendants   some poles were apprehensive of his design  but said  nothing about it   he went a quarter of a league on foot to reach the  horses which were awaiting him  set off at a gallop  rode all night  and  arrived next day early on the frontier of moravia  an austrian province   the royal flight created a great uproar at cracow  the noblemen  and even  the peasants  armed with stakes and scythes  set out in pursuit of their  king   they did not come up with him  they fell in with his chancellor  only  guy du faur  sieur de pibrac  who had missed him at the appointed  meeting place  and who  whilst seeking to rejoin him  had lost himself in  the forests and marshes  concealed himself in the osiers and reeds  and  been obliged now and then to dip his head  in the mud to avoid the arrows  discharged on all sides by the peasants in pursuit of the king   being  arrested by some people who were for taking him back to cracow and paying  him out for his complicity in his master s flight  he with great  difficulty obtained his release and permission to continue his road   destined to become more celebrated by his writings and by his quatrains  moraux than by his courtly adventures  pibrac rejoined king henry at  vienna  where the emperor maximilian ii  received him with great  splendor   delivered from fatigue and danger  henry appeared to think of  nothing but resting and diverting himself  he tarried to his heart s  content at vienna  venice  ferrara  mantua  and turin   he was everywhere  welcomed with brilliant entertainments  which the emperor maximilian and  the senators of venice accompanied with good advice touching the  government of france in her religious troubles  and the nominal sovereign  of two kingdoms took nearly three months in going from that whence he had  fled to that of which he was about to take possession   having started  from cracow on the   th of june        he did not arrive until the  th of  september at lyons  whither the queen mother had sent his brother  the  duke of alencon  and his brother in law  the king of navarre  to receive  him  going herself as far as bourgoin in dauphiny  in order to be the  first to see her darling son again     the king s entry into france caused  says de thou  a strange revulsion in  all minds    during the lifetime of charles ix   none had seemed more  worthy of the throne than henry  and everybody desired to have him for  master   but scarcely had he arrived when disgust set in to the extent of  auguring very ill of his reign   there was no longer any trace in this  prince  who had been nursed  so to speak  in the lap of war  of that  manly and warlike courage which had been so much admired   he no longer  rode on horseback  he did not show himself amongst his people  as his  predecessors had been wont to do  he was only to be seen shut up with a  few favorites in a little painted boat which went up and down the saone  he no longer took his meals without a balustrade  which did not allow him  to be approached any hearer  and if anybody had any petitions to present  to him  they had to wait for him as he came out from dinner  when he took  them as he hurried by   for the greater part of the day he remained  closeted with some young folks  who alone had the prince s ear  without  any body s knowing how

passionately extolled by the  independent thinker michael de montaigne in his essais  of which nine  editions were published between      and       and evidently very much  read in the world of letters   an intellectual movement so active and  powerful could not fail to have a potent effect upon political life   before the st  bartholomew  the great religious and political parties   the catholic and the protestant  were formed and at grips  the house of  lorraine at the head of the catholics  and the house of bourbon  conde   and coligny at the head of the protestants  with royalty trying feebly  and vainly to maintain between them a hollow peace   to this stormy  and precarious  but organized and clearly defined condition  the  st   bartholomew had caused anarchy to succeed   protestantism   vanquished but not destroyed  broke up into provincial and municipal  associations without recognized and dominant heads  without discipline  or combination in respect of either their present management or their  ultimate end   catholicism  though victorious  likewise underwent a  break up  men of mark  towns and provinces  would not accept the  st  bartholomew and its consequences  a new party  the party of the  policists  sprang up  opposed to the principle and abjuring the practice  of persecution  having no mind to follow either the catholics in their  outrages or royalty in its tergiversations  and striving to maintain in  the provinces and the towns  where it had the upper hand  enough of order  and of justice to at least keep at a distance the civil war which was  elsewhere raging   languedoc owed to marshal de damville  second son of  the constable anne de montmorency  this comparatively bearable position   but the degree of security and of local peace which it offered the people  was so imperfect  so uncertain  that the break up of the country and of  the state went still farther   in a part of languedoc  in the vivarais   the inhabitants  in order to put their habitations and their property in  safety  resolved to make a league amongst themselves  without consulting  any authority  not even marshal de damville  the peace seeking governor  of their province   their treaty of alliance ran  that arms should be  laid down throughout the whole of the vivarais  that none  foreigner or  native  should be liable to trouble for the past  that tillers of the  soil and traders should suffer no detriment in person or property  that  all hostilities should cease in the towns and all forays in the country   that there should everywhere be entire freedom for commerce  that cattle  which had been lifted should be immediately restored gratis  that  concerted action should be taken to get rid of the garrisons out of the  country and to raze the fortresses  according as the public weal might  require  and finally that whosoever should dare to violate these  regulations should be regarded as a traitor and punished as a disturber  of the public peace    as soon as the different authorities in the state   marshal de damville as well as the rest  were informed of this novelty    says de thou   they made every effort to prevent it from taking effect    nothing could be of more dangerous example   they said   than to suffer  the people to make treaties in this way and on their own authority   without waiting for the consent of his majesty or of those who  represented him in the provinces   the folks of the vivarais  on the  contrary  presumed to justify themselves by saying that the step they had  taken did not in any way infringe the king s authority  that it was  rather an opening given by them for securely establishing tranquillity in  the kingdom  that nothing was more advantageous or could contribute more  towards peace than to raze all those fortresses set up in the heart of  the state  which were like so many depots of revolt  that by a diminution  of the garrisons the revenues of his majesty would be proportionately  augmented  that  at any rate  there would result this advantage  that the  lands  which formed almost the whole wealth of the kingdom  would be  cultivated  that commerce would flourish  and that the people  delivered  from fear of the many scoundrels who  found a retreat in those places   would at last be able to draw breath after the many misfortunes they had  experienced      it was in this condition of disorganization and red hot anarchy that  henry iii   on his return from poland  and after the st  bartholomew   found france  it was in the face of all these forces  full of life  but  scattered and excited one against another  that  with the aid of his  mother  catherine  he had to re establish unity in the state  the  effectiveness of the government  and the public peace   it was not a task  for which the tact of an utterly corrupted woman and an irresolute prince  sufficed   what could the artful manoeuvrings of catherine and the  waverings of henry iii  do towards taming both catholics and protestants  at the same time  and obliging them to live at peace with one another   under one equitable and effective power   henry iv  was as yet unformed   nor was his hour yet come for this great work   henry iii  and catherine  de  medici failed in it completely  their government of fifteen years  served only to make them lose their reputation for ability  and to  aggravate for france the evils which it was their business to heal   in        a year only after henry iii  s accession  revolt penetrated to the  royal household   the duke of alencon  the king s younger brother  who   since his brother s coronation  took the title of duke of anjou  escaped  on the   th of september from the louvre by a window  and from paris by a  hole made in the wall of

name of no religious significance between the two old  parties   on the   th of september  in his manifesto  he gave as reasons  for his revolt  excessive taxation  waste of the public revenues  the  feebleness of the royal authority  incapable as it was of putting a stop  to the religious troubles  and the disgrace which had been inflicted upon  himself  by pernicious ministers who desire to have the government in  their sole patronage  excluding from it the foremost and the most  illustrious of the court  and devouring all that there is remaining to  the poor people    he protested his

himself apparently to his pleasures alone   two of his faithful servants  the poet historian d aubigne was one of  them  heard him one night sighing as he lay in bed  and humming half  aloud this versicle from the eighty eighth psalm                       removed from friends  i sigh alone                  in a loathed dungeon laid  where none                 a visit will vouchsafe to me

of your friends and faithful servants  and all the while they are  together  sighing because of yours and laboring for your freedom   but  you have only tears in your eyes  and they  arms in hand  are fighting  your enemies   as for us two  we were talking of taking to flight  tomorrow  when your voice made us draw the curtain   bethink you  sir   that  after us  the hands that will serve you would not dare refuse to  employ poison and the knife    henry  much moved  resolved to follow the  example of the duke of anjou   his departure was fixed for the  d of  february         he went and slept at senlis  hunted next day very early   and  on his return from hunting  finding his horses baited and ready    what news   he asked    sir   said d aubigne   we are betrayed  the king  knows all  the road to death and shame is paris  that to life and glory  is anywhere else     that is more than enough  away   replied henry   they rode all night  and arrived without misadventure at alencon   two  hundred and fifty gentlemen  having been apprised in time  went thither  to join the king of navarre   he pursued his road in their company   from  senlis to the loire he was silent but when he had crossed the river    praised be god  who has delivered me   he cried   at paris they were the  death of my mother  there they killed the admiral and my best servants   and they had no mind to do any better by me  if god had not had me in his  keeping   i return thither no more unless i am dragged   i regret only  two things that i have left behind at paris  mass and my wife   as for  mass  i will try to do without it  but as for my wife  i cannot  i mean  to see her again    he disavowed the appearances of catholicism he had  assumed  again made open profession of protestantism by holding at the  baptismal font  in the conventicle  the daughter of a physician amongst  his friends   then he reached bearn  declaring that he meant to remain  there independent and free   a few days before his departure he had  written to one of his bearnese friends   the court is the strangest you  ever saw   we are almost always ready to cut one another s throats   we  wear daggers  shirts of mail  and very often the whole cuirass under the  cape   i am only waiting for the opportunity to deliver a little battle   for they tell me they will kill me  and i want to be beforehand    mesdames de carnavalet and de sauve  two of his fair friends  had warned  him that  far from giving him the lieutenant generalship  which had been  so often promised him  it had been decided to confer this office on the  king s brother  in order to get him back to court and seize his person as  soon as he arrived     it was the increasing preponderance of the guises  at court as well as in  the country  which caused the two princes to take this sudden resolution   since henry iii  s coming to the throne  war had gone on between the  catholics and the protestants  but languidly and with frequent  suspensions through local and shortlived truces   the king and the  queen mother would have been very glad that the st  bartholomew should be  short lived also  as a necessary but transitory crisis  it had rid them  of their most formidable adversaries  coligny and the reformers of note  who were about him   henry and catherine aspired to no more than resuming  their policy of manoeuvring and wavering between the two parties engaged  in the struggle  but it was not for so poor a result that the ardent  catholics had committed the crime of the st  bartholomew  they promised  themselves from it the decisive victory of their church and of their  supremacy   henry de guise came forward as their leader in this grand  design  there are to be read  beneath a portrait of him done in the  sixteenth century  these verses  also of that date                       the virtue  greatness  wisdom from on high                  of yonder duke  triumphant far and near                  do make

at his glance                  a prop for holy church is his good lance                  his eye is ever mild to those he loves      guise cultivated very carefully this ardent confidence on the part of  catholic france  he recommended to his partisans attention to little  pious and popular practices    i send you some paternosters  meaning  in  the plural  the beads of a chaplet  or the chaplet entire    he wrote to  his wife  catherine of cleves   you will have strings made for them and  string them together   i don t know whether you dare offer some of them  to the queens and to my lady mother   ask advice of mesdames de retz and  de villeroy about it    the flight and insurrection of the duke of anjou  and the king of navarre furnished the duke of guise with a very natural  occasion for re engaging in the great struggle between catholicism and  protestantism  wherein the chief part belonged to him   let us recur  for  a moment  to the origin of that struggle and the part taken in it  at the  outset  by the princes of the house of lorraine    as early as the year        twenty six years before the affair of the barricades   says m   vitet in the excellent introduction which he has put at the head of his  beautiful historic dramas from the last half of the sixteenth century    cardinal charles of lorraine  being at the council of trent  conceived  the plan of a holy league  or association of catholics  which was to have  the triple object of defending  by armed force  the romish church in  france  of obtaining for the cardinal s brother  duke francis de guise   the lieutenant generalship of the kingdom  and of helping him to ascend  the throne  in case the line of the valois should become extinct   the  death of duke francis  murdered in front of orleans by poltrot  did not  permit the cardinal to carry out his plan   five years afterwards  henry  de guise  eldest son of francis  and then eighteen years of age  caused  to be drawn up  for the first time  a form of oath whereby the  dignitaries bound themselves to sacrifice their goods and lives in  defence of the catholic religion in the face of and against all  except  the king  the royal family  and the princes of their connection   this  form was signed by the nobility of champagne and brie  a province of  which henry de guise was governor  and on the   th of july        the  bishop and clergy of troyes signed it likewise   the association is  named  in the form   holy league  christian and royal    up to the year       it remained secret  and did not cross the boundaries of champagne    to this summary of m  vitet s may be added that independently of the  champagnese league of      and in the interval between      and       there had been formed  in some provinces and towns  other local  associations for the defence of the catholic church against the heretics   when  in       first the duke of anjou and after him the king of navarre  were seen flying from the court of henry iii  and commencing an  insurrection with the aid of a considerable body of german auxiliaries  and french refugees  already on french soil and on their way across  champagne  the peril of the catholic church appeared so grave and so  urgent that  in the threatened provinces  the catholics devoted  themselves with ardor to the formation of a grand association for the  defence of their cause   then and thus was really born the league  secret  at first  but  before long  publicly and openly proclaimed  which held so  important a place in the history of the sixteenth century   picardy and  champagne were the first scene of its formation  but in the neighboring  provinces the same travail took place and brought forth fruits   at  paris  a burgess named la roche blond  and devoted to the guises  a  perfumer named peter de la bruyere and his son matthew de la bruyere   councillor at the chatelet  were  says de thou  the first and most  zealous preachers of the union    at their solicitation   continues the  austere magistrate   all the debauchees there were in this great city   all folks whose only hope was in civil war for the indulgence of their  libertinism or for a safe means of satisfying their avarice or their  ambition  enrolled themselves emulously in this force   many  even of the  richest burgesses  whose hatred for protestants blinded them so far as  not to see the dangers to which such associations expose public  tranquillity in a well regulated state  had the weakness to join the  seditious      many asked for time to consider  and  before making any engagement  they  went to see president de thou  christopher  premier president of the  parliament of paris since       and father of the historian james  augustus de thou   informed him of these secret assemblies and all that  went on there  and begged him to tell them whether he approved of them   and whether it was true that the court authorized them   m  de thou  answered them at once  with that straightforwardness which was innate in  him  that these kinds of proceedings had not yet come to his knowledge   that he doubted whether they had the approbation of his majesty  and that  they would do wisely to hold aloof from all such associations   the  authority of this great man began to throw suspicion upon the designs of  the unionists  and his reply prevented many persons from casting in their  lot with the party  but they who found themselves at the head of this  faction were not the folks to so easily give up their projects  for they  felt themselves too well supported at court and amongst the people   they  advised the lorraine princes to have the union promulgated in the  provinces  and to labor to make the nobility of the kingdom enter it     henry de guise did not hesitate   at the same time that he avowed the  league and labored to propagate it  he did what was far more effectual  for its success  he entered the field and gained a victory   the german  allies and french refugees who had come to support prince henry de conde  and the duke of anjou in their insurrection advanced into champagne   guise had nothing ready  neither army nor money  he mustered in haste  three thousand horse  who were to be followed by a body of foot and a  moiety of the king s guards    i haven t a son   he wrote to his wife    take something out of the king s chest  if there is anything there   provided you know that there is something there  don t be afraid  take it  and send it me at once   as for the  reitres   they are more afraid of us  than we of them  don t be frightened about them on my account  the  greatest danger i shall run will be that a glass of wine may break in my  hand    he set out in pursuit of the germans  came up with them on the    th of october        at port a binson  on the marne  and ordered them  to be attacked by his brother the duke of mayenne  whom he supported  vigorously   they were broken and routed   the hunt  according to the  expression at the time  lasted all the rest of the day and during the  night    a world of dead covers the field of battle   wrote guise   he  had himself been wounded  he went in obstinate pursuit of a mounted foe  whom he had twice touched with his sword  and who  in return  had fired  two pistol shots  of which one took effect in the leg  and the other  carried away part of his cheek and his left ear   thence came his name of  henry the scarred   le balafre    which has clung to him in history      illustration  henry le balafre            scarcely four years had rolled away since the st  bartholomew   in vain  had been the massacre of ten thousand protestants  according to the  lowest  and of one hundred thousand  according to the highest estimates   besides nearly all the renowned chiefs of the party   charles ix  s  earnest prayer   that none remain to reproach me   was so far from  accomplishment that the war between catholicism and protestantism  recommenced in almost every part of france with redoubled passion  with a  new importance of character  and with symptoms of much longer duration  than at its first outbreak   both parties had found leaders made  both  from their position and their capacity  to command them   admiral coligny  was succeeded by the king of navarre  who was destined to become henry  iv   and duke francis of guise by his son henry  if not as able  at any  rate as brave a soldier  and a more determined catholic than he   amongst  the protestants  sully and da plessis mornay were assuming shape and  importance by the side of the king of navarre   catherine de  medici  placed at her son s service her italian adroitness  her maternal  devotion  and an energy rare for a woman between sixty and seventy years  of age  for forty three years a queen  and worn out by intrigue  and  business  and pleasure   finally  to the question of religion  the  primary cause of the struggle  was added a question of kingship  kept in  the background  but ever present in thought and deed  which of the three  houses of valois  bourbon  and lorraine should remain in or enter upon  possession of the throne of france   the interests and the ambition of  families and of individuals were playing their part simultaneously with  the controversies and the passions of creed     this state of things continued for twelve years  from      to       with  constant alternations of war  truce  and precarious peace  and in the  midst of constant hesitation  on the part of henry iii   between alliance  with the league  commanded by the duke of guise  and adjustment with the  protestants  of whom the king of navarre was every day becoming the more  and more avowed leader   between      and       four treaties of peace  were concluded  in       the peace called monsieur s  signed at chastenay  in orleanness  in       the peace of bergerac or of poitiers  in        the peace of nerac  in       the peace of fleix in perigord   in  november        the states general were convoked and assembled at blois   where they sat and deliberated up to march        without any important  result   neither these diplomatic conventions nor these national  assemblies had force enough to establish a real and lasting peace between  the two parties  for the parties themselves would not have it  in vain  did henry iii  make concessions and promises of liberty to the  protestants  he was not in a condition to guarantee their execution and  make it respected by their adversaries   at heart neither protestants nor  catholics were for accepting mutual liberty  not only did they both  consider themselves in possession of all religious truth  but they also  considered themselves entitled to impose it by force upon their  adversaries   the discovery  and the term is used advisedly  so slow to  come and so long awaited has been the fact which it expresses   the  discovery of the legitimate separation between the intellectual world and  the political world  and of the necessity  also  of having the  intellectual world free in order that it may not make upon the political  world a war which  in the inevitable contact between them  the latter  could not support for long  this grand and salutary discovery  be it  repeated  and its practical influence in the government of people cannot  be realized save in communities already highly enlightened and  politically well ordered   good order  politically  is indispensable  if liberty  intellectually  is to develop itself regularly and do the  community more good than it causes of trouble and embarrassment   they  only who have confidence in human intelligence sincerely admit its right  to freedom  and confidence in human intelligence is possible only in the  midst of a political regimen which likewise gives the human community the  guarantees whereof its interests and its lasting security have absolute  need   the sixteenth century was a long way from these conditions of  harmony between the intellectual world and the political world  the  necessity of which is beginning to be understood and admitted by only the  most civilized and best governed amongst modern communities   it is one  of the most tardy and difficult advances that people have to accomplish  in their life of labor   the sixteenth century helped france to make  considerable strides in civilization and intellectual development  but  the eighteenth and nineteenth have taught her how great still  in the art  of governing and being governed as a free people  are her children s want  of foresight and inexperience  and  to what extent they require a strong  and sound organization of political freedom in order that they may  without danger enjoy intellectual freedom  its pleasures and its glories     from      to       henry iii  had seen the difficulties of his government  continuing and increasing   his attempt to maintain his own independence  and the mastery of the situation between catholics and protestants  by  making concessions and promises at one time to the former and at another  to the latter  had not succeeded  and in      it became still more  difficult to practise   on the   th of june in that year henry iii  s  brother  the duke of anjou  died at chateau thierry   by this death the  leader of the protestants  henry  king of navarre  became lawful heir to  the throne of france   the leaguers could not stomach that prospect   the  guises turned it to formidable account   they did not hesitate to make  the future of france a subject of negotiation with philip ii  of spain   at that time her most dangerous enemy in europe   by a secret convention  concluded at joinville on the   st of december        between philip and  the guises  it was stipulated that at the death of henry iii  the crown  should pass to charles  cardinal of bourbon  sixty four years of age  the  king of navarre s uncle  who  in order to make himself king  undertook to  set aside his nephew s hereditary right  and forbid  absolutely   heretical worship in france   he published on the   st of march         a declaration wherein he styled himself premier prince of the blood  and  conferred upon the duke of guise the title of lieutenant general of the  league   by a bull of september           sixtus v   but lately elected  pope  excommunicated the king of navarre as a heretic and relapsed   denying him any right of succession to the crown of france  and releasing  his narvarrese subjects from their oath of fidelity   sixtus v  did not  yet know what manner of man he was thus attacking   the king of navarre  did not confine himself to protesting in france  on the   th of june         against this act of the pope s  he had his protest placarded at  rome itself upon the statues of pasquin and marforio  and at the very  doors of the vatican  referring the pope  as to the question of heresy   to a council which he claimed at an early date  and at the same time  appealing against this alleged abuse of power to the court of peers of  france   of whom   said he   i have the honor to be the premier    the  whole of italy  including sixtus v  himself  a pope of independent mind  and proud heart  was struck with this energetic resistance on the part of  a petty king    it would be a good thing   said the pope to marquis  pasani  henry iii  s ambassador   if the king your master showed as much  resolution against his enemies as the king of navarre shows against those  who attack him    at the first moment henry iii  had appeared to unravel  the intentions of the league and to be disposed to resist it  by an edict  of march           he had ordered that its adherents should be  prosecuted  but catherine de  medici frightened him with the war which  would infallibly be kindled  and in which he would have for enemies all  the catholics  more irritated than ever   and henry iii  very easily took  fright   catherine undertook to manage the recoil for him    i care not  who likes it and who doesn t   she was wont to say in such cases   she  asked the duke of guise for an interview  which took place  first of all  at epernay  and afterwards at rheims   the hard demands of the lorrainers  did not deter the queen mother  and  on the  th of july        a treaty  was concluded at nemours between henry iii  and the league  to the effect   that by an irrevocable edict the practice of the new religion should be  forbidden  and that there should henceforth be no other practice of  religion  throughout the realm of france  save that of the catholic   apostolic  and roman  that all the ministers should depart from the  kingdom within a month  that all the subjects of his majesty should be  bound to live according to the catholic religion and make profession  thereof within six months  on pain of confiscation both of person and  goods  that heretics  of whatsoever quality they might be  should be  declared incapable of holding benefices  public offices  positions  and  dignities  that the places which had been given in guardianship to them  for their security should be taken back again forthwith  and  lastly   that the princes designated in the treaty  amongst whom were all the  guises at the top  should receive as guarantee certain places to be held  by them for five years      this treaty was signed by all the negotiators  and specially by the  queen mother  the cardinals of bourbon and guise  and the dukes of guise  and mayenne   it was the decisive act which made the war a war of  religion     on the   th of july following  henry iii   on his way to the palace of  justice to be present at the publication of the edict he had just issued  in virtue of this treaty with the league  said to the cardinal of  bourbon   my dear uncle  against my conscience  but very willingly  i  published the edicts of pacification  because they were successful in  giving relief to my people  and now i am going to publish the revocation  of those edicts in accordance with my conscience  but very unwillingly   because on its publication hangs the ruin of my kingdom and of my  people    when he issued from the palace  cries of  long live the king    were heard   at which astonishment was expressed   says peter de  l estoile  t  i   p         because for a long time past no such favor  had been shown him   but it was discovered that these acclamations were  the doing of persons posted about by the leaguers  and that  for doing  it  money had been given to idlers and sweetmeats to children    some  days afterwards  the king of navarre received news of the treaty of  nemours   he was staying near bergerac  at the castle of the lord of la  force  with whom he was so intimate that he took with him none of his  household  as he preferred to be waited upon by m  de la force s own  staff    i was so grievously affected by it   said he himself at a later  period to m  de la force   that  as i pondered deeply upon it and held my  head supported upon my hand  my apprehensions of the woes i foresaw for  my country were such as to whiten one half of my mustache      memoires  du due de la force   t  i   p       henry iii   for his part  was but  little touched by the shouts of long live the king  that he heard as he  left the palace  he was too much disquieted to be rejoiced at them   he  did not return the greeting of the municipal functionaries or of the mob  that blocked his way    you see how reluctant he is to embroil himself  with the huguenots   said the partisans of the guises to the people     it was the recommencement of religious civil war  with more deadliness  than ever   the king of navarre left no stone unturned to convince  everybody  friends and enemies  great lords and commonalty  frenchmen and  foreigners  that this recurrence of war was not his doing  and that the  leaguers forced it upon him against his wish and despite of the justice  of his cause   he wrote to henry iii    monseigneur  as soon as the  originators of these fresh disturbances had let the effects appear of  their ill will towards your majesty and your kingdom  you were pleased to  write to me the opinion you had formed  with very good title  of their  intentions  you told me that you knew  no matter what pretext they  assumed  that they had designs against your person and your crown  and  that they desired their own augmentation and aggrandizement at your  expense and to your detriment   such were the words of your letters  mon  seigneur  and you did me the honor  whilst recognizing the connection  between my fortunes and those of your majesty  to add expressly that they  were compassing my ruin together with your own            and now   monseigneur  when i hear it suddenly reported that your majesty has made  a treaty of peace with those who have risen up against your service   providing that your edict be broken  your loyal subjects banished  and  the conspirators armed  and armed with your power and your authority  against me  who have the honor of belonging to you  i leave your majesty  to judge in what a labyrinth i find myself            if it is i whom  they seek  or if under my shadow  on my account  they trouble this realm   i have begged that  without henceforth causing the orders and estates of  this realm to suffer for it  and without the intervention of any army   home or foreign  this quarrel be decided in the duke of guise s person  and my own  one to one  two to two  ten to ten  twenty to twenty  in any  number that the said lord of guise shall think proper  with the arms  customary amongst gentlemen of honor        it will be a happiness for  us  my cousin  henry de conde  and myself  to deliver  at the price of  our blood  the king our sovereign lord from the travails and trials that  are a brewing for him  his kingdom from trouble and confusion  his  noblesse from ruin  and all his people from extreme misery and calamity      the duke of guise respectfully declined  at the same time that he thanked  the king of navarre for the honor done him  saying that he could not  accept the offer  as he was maintaining the cause of religion  and not a  private quarrel   on his refusal  war appeared to everybody  and in fact  became  inevitable   at his re engagement in it  the king of navarre lost  no time about informing his friends at home and his allies abroad  the  noblesse  the clergy  and the third estate of france  the city of paris   the queen of england   the protestant princes of germany  and the swiss  cantons  of all he had done to avoid it  he evidently laid great store  upon making his conduct public and his motives understood   he had for  his close confidant and his mouth piece philip du plessis mornay  at  that time thirty six years of age  one of the most learned and most  hard working as well as most zealous and most sterling amongst the  royalist protestants of france   it was his duty to draw up the  documents  manifestoes  and letters published by the king of navarre   when henry did not himself stamp upon them the seal of his own language   vivid  eloquent  and captivating in its brevity     henry iii  and the queen mother were very much struck with this  intelligent energy on the part of the king of navarre  and with the  influence he acquired over all that portion of the french noblesse and  burgesses which had not fanatically enlisted beneath the banner of the  league   catherine  accustomed to count upon her skill in the art of  seductive conversation  was for putting it to fresh proof in the case of  the king of navarre   louis di gonzaga  duke of nevers  an italian  like  herself  and one of her confidants  was sent in advance to sound henry of  navarre   he wrote to henry iii    such  sir  as you have known this  prince  such is he even now  nor years nor difficulties change him  he is  still agreeable  still merry  still devoted  as he has sworn to me a  hundred times  to peace and your majesty s service    catherine proposed  to him an interview   henry hesitated to comply   from jarnac  where he  was  he sent viscount de turenne to catherine to make an agreement with  her for a few days  truce    catherine gave turenne to understand that   in order to have peace  the king of navarre must turn catholic  and put a  stop to the exercise of the reformed religion in the towns he held    when this was reported by his envoy  henry  who had set out for the  interview  was on the point of retracing his steps  he went on  however   as he was curious to see catherine  to satisfy his mind upon the point  and to answer her    they met on the   th of december        at the  castle of st  brice  near cognac  both of them with gloomy looks   catherine asked henry whether turenne had spoken to him about what  she  said  was her son s most express desire      i am astounded   said henry   that your majesty should have taken so  much pains to tell me what my ears are split with hearing  and likewise  that you  whose judgment is so sound  should delude yourself with the  idea of solving the difficulty by means of the difficulty itself   you  propose to me a thing that i cannot do without forfeiture of conscience  and honor  and without injury to the king s service   i should not carry  with me all those of the religion  and they of the league would be so  much the more irritated in that they would lose their hope of depriving  me of the right which i have to the throne   they do not want me with  you  madame  for they would then be in sorry plight  you better served   and all your good subjects more happy    the queen mother did not dispute  the point   she dwelt  upon the inconveniences henry suffered during the  war     i bear them patiently  madame   said henry   since you burden me  with them in order to unburden yourself of them    she reproached him  with not doing as he pleased in rochelle    pardon me  madame   said he    i please only as i ought    the duke of nevers  who was present at the  interview  was bold enough to tell him that he could not impose a tax  upon rochelle    that is true   said henry   and so we have no italian  amongst us    he took leave of the queen mother  who repeated what she  had said to viscount de turenne   charging him to make it known to the  noblesse who were of his following     it is just eighteen months   madame   said he   since i ceased to obey the king   he has made war upon  me like a wolf  you like a lioness     the king and i seek nothing but  your welfare     excuse me  madame  i think it would be the contrary     my son  would you have the pains i have taken for the last six months  remain without fruit     madame  it is not i who prevent you from resting  in your bed  it is you who prevent me from lying down in mine     shall i  be always at pains  i who ask for nothing but rest     madame  the pains  please you and agree with you  if you were at rest you could not live  long    catherine had brought with her what was called her flying  squadron of fair creatures of her court  but   madame   said henry  as he  withdrew   there is nothing here for me      before taking part in the war which was day by day becoming more and more  clearly and explicitly a war of religion  the protestant princes of  germany and the four great free cities of strasbourg  ulm  nuremberg  and  frankfort resolved to make  as the king of navarre had made  a striking  move on behalf of peace and religious liberty   they sent to henry iii   ambassadors  who  on the   th of october        treated him to some frank  and bold speaking    our princes and masters   they said to him   have  been moved with surprise and christian compassion towards you  as  faithful friends and good neighbors of yours  on hearing that you  not  being pleased to suffer in your kingdom any person not of the roman  religion  have broken the edict of peace which was so solemnly done and  based upon your majesty s faith and promise  and which is the firm prop  of the tranquillity of your majesty and your dominions  the which changes  have appeared to them strange  seeing that your royal person  your  dominions  your conscience  your honor  your reputation and good fame  happened to be very much concerned therewith    shocked at so rude an  admonition  henry iii  answered   it is god who made me king  and as i  bear the title of most christian king  i have ever been very zealous for  the preservation of the catholic religion            it appertains to me  alone to decide  according to my discernment  what may contribute to the  public weal  to make laws for to procure it  to interpret those laws  to  change them  and to abolish them  just as i find it expedient   i have  done so hitherto  and i shall still do so for the future   and he  dismissed the ambassadors   that very evening  on reflecting upon his  words  and considering that his answer had not met the requirements of  the case  he wrote with his own hand on a small piece of paper   that  whoever said that in revoking the edict of pacification he had violated  his faith or put a blot upon his honor  had lied   and he ordered one of  his officers  though the night was far advanced  to carry that paper to  the ambassadors  and read it to them textually   they asked for a copy   but henry iii   always careful not to have to answer for his words  had  bidden his officer to suppress the document after having read it  and the  germans departed  determined upon war as well as quite convinced of the  king s arrogant pusillanimity     except some local and short lived truces  war was already lazing  throughout nearly the whole of france  in provence  in dauphiny  in  nivernais  in guienne  in anjou  in normandy  in picardy  in champagne   we do not care to follow the two parties through the manifold but  monotonous incidents of their tumultuous and passionate strife  we desire  to review only those events that were of a general and a decisive  character   they occurred  naturally  in those places which were the  arena  and in those armies which were under the command  of the two  leaders  duke henry of guise and king henry of navarre   the former took  upon himself the duty of repulsing  in the north west of france  the  german and swiss corps which were coming to the assistance of the french  reformers  the latter put himself at the head of the french protestant  forces summoned to face  in the provinces of the centre and south west   the royalist armies   guise was successful in his campaign against the  foreigners  on the   th of october        his scouts came and told him  that the germans were at vimory  near montargis  dispersed throughout the  country  without vedettes or any of the precautions of warfare  he was at  table with his principal officers at courtenay  almost seven leagues away  from the enemy  he remained buried in thought for a few minutes  and then  suddenly gave the order to sound boot and saddle   boute selle    i e   put on saddle     what for  pray   said his brother  the duke of  mayenne    to go and fight     pray reflect upon  what you are going to  do     reflections that i haven t made in a quarter of an hour i  shouldn t make in a year    mounting at once  the leader and his  squadrons arrived at midnight at the gates of vimory  they found   it is said  the germans drunk  asleep  and scattered  according to the  reporters on the side of the league  the victory of guise was complete   he took from the germans twenty eight hundred horses  the protestants  said that the body he charged were nothing but a lot of horse boys  and  that the two flags he took had for device nothing but a sponge and a  currycomb   but fifteen days later  on the   th of november  at auneau   near chartres  guise gained an indisputable and undisputed victory over  the germans  and their general  baron dohna  and some of his officers  only saved themselves by cutting their way through sword in hand   the  swiss  being discouraged  and seeing in the army of henry iii  eight  thousand of their countrymen  who were serving in it not  like  themselves  as adventurers  but under the flags and with the  authorization of their cantons  separated from the germans and withdrew   after receiving from henry iii   four hundred thousand crowns as the  price of their withdrawal   in burgundy  in champagne  and in orleanness   the campaign terminated to the honor of guise  which henry iii  was far  from regarding as a victory for himself     but almost at the same time at which the league obtained this success in  the provinces of the east and centre  it experienced in those of the  south west a reverse more serious for the leaguers than the duke of  guise s victory had been fortunate for them   henry iii  had given the  command of his army south of the loire to one of his favorites  anne   duke of joyeuse  a brilliant  brave  and agreeable young man  whose  fortunes he had advanced beyond measure  to the extent of marrying him to  marguerite de lorraine  the queen s sister  and raising for him the  viscountship of joyeuse to a duchy peerage  giving him rank  too  after  the princes of the blood and before the dukes of old creation   joyeuse  was at the head of six thousand foot  two thousand horse  and six pieces  of cannon   he entered poitou and marched towards the dordogne  whilst  the king of navarre was at la rochelle  engaged in putting into order two  pieces of cannon  which formed the whole of his artillery  and in  assembling round him his three cousins  the prince of conde  the count of  soissons  and the prince of conti  that he might head the whole house of  bourbon at the moment when he was engaging seriously in the struggle with  the house of valois and the house of lorraine   a small town  coutras   situated at the confluence of the two rivers of l isle and la dronne  in  the gironde  offered the two parties an important position to occupy    according to his wont   says the duke of aumale in his  histoire des  princes de conde    the bearnese was on horseback whilst his adversary  was banqueting    he outstripped joyeuse  and when the latter drew near  to contras  he found the town occupied by the protestant advance guard   and had barely time to fall back upon la roche chalais   the battle began  on the   th of october        shortly after sunrise   we will here borrow  the equally dramatic and accurate account of it given by the duke of  aumale   at this solemn moment the king of navarre calls to his side his  cousins and his principal officers  then  in his manly and sonorous  voice  he addresses his men at arms   my friends  here is a quarry for  you very different from your past prizes   it is a brand new bridegroom   with his marriage money still in his coffers  and all the cream of the  courtiers are with him   will you let yourselves go down before this  handsome dancing master and his minions   no  they are ours  i see it by  your eagerness to fight   still we must all of us understand that the  event is in the hands of god   pray we him to aid us   this deed will be  the greatest that we ever did  the glory will be to god  the service to  our sovereign lord the king  the honor to ourselves  and the benefit to  the state    henry uncovers  the clergymen chandieu and damours intone  the army s prayer  and the men at arms repeat in chorus the twenty fourth  versicle of the hundred and eighteenth psalm   this is the day which the  lord hath made  we will rejoice and be glad in it    as they were  hastening each to his post  the king detains his cousins a moment    gentlemen   he shouts   i have just one thing to say  remember that you  are of the house of bourbon  and  as god liveth  i will let you see that  i am your senior     and we will show you some good juniors   answered  conde      before midday the battle was won and the royalist army routed  but  not without having made a valiant stand   during the action  d epinay  saint luc  one of the bravest royalist soldiers  met the duke of joyeuse  already wounded    what s to be done   he asked    die   answered  joyeuse  and a few moments afterwards  as he was moving away some paces  to the rear in order to get near to his artillery  says d aubigne  he was  surrounded by several huguenots  who recognized him    there are a  hundred thousand crowns to be gained   he shouted  but rage was more  powerful than cupidity  and one of them shattered his skull with a  pistol shot    his body was taken to the king s quarters  there it lay   in the evening  upon a table in the very room where the conqueror s  supper had been prepared  but the king of navarre ordered all who were in  the chamber to go out  had his supper things removed else whither  and   with every mark of respect  committed the remains of the vanquished to  the care of viscount de turenne  his near relative   henry showed a  simple and modest joy at his splendid triumph   it was five and twenty  years since the civil war commenced  and he was the first protestant  general who had won a pitched battle  he had to regret only  twenty five killed  whereas the enemy had lost more than three thousand   and had abandoned to him their cannon  together with twenty nine flags or  standards   the victory was so much the more glorious in that it was  gained over an army superior in numbers and almost equal in quality   it was owing to the king s valor  decision  vigilance  quick eye   comprehension of tactics  and that creative instinct which he brought  into application in politics as well as in war  and which was destined to  render him so happily inspired in the beautiful defensive actions of  arques  at the affair of ivry  and on so many other occasions      histoire des princes de conde   c    by m  le due d aumale  t  ii   pp               and what was henry iii   king of france  doing whilst two great parties  and two great men were thus carrying on  around his throne and in his  name  so passionate a war  on the one side to maintain the despotic unity  of catholic christianism  and on the other to win religious liberty for  christian protestantism   we will borrow here the words of the most  enlightened and most impartial historian of the sixteenth century  m  de  thou  if we acted upon our own personal impressions alone  there would be  danger of appearing too severe towards a king whom we profoundly despise      after having staid some time in bourbonness  henry iii  went to lyons in  order to be within hail of his two favorites  joyeuse and epernon  who  were each on the march with an army   whilst he was at lyons as  unconcerned as if all the realm were enjoying perfect peace  he took to  collecting those little dogs which are thought so much of in that town   everybody was greatly surprised to see a king of france  in the midst of  so terrible a war and in extreme want of money  expending upon such  pleasures all the time he had at disposal and all the sums he could  scrape together   how lavish soever this prince may have been  yet  if  comparison be made between the expenditure upon the royal household and  that incurred at lyons for dogs  the latter will be found infinitely  higher than the former  without counting expenses for hunting dogs and  birds  which always come to a considerable sum in the households of  kings  it cost him  every year  more than a hundred thousand gold crowns  for little lyonnese dogs  and he maintained at his court  with large  salaries  a multitude of men and women who had nothing to do but to feed  them   he also spent large sums in monkeys  parrots  and other creatures  from foreign countries  of which he always kept a great number   sometimes he got tired of them  and gave them all away then his passion  for such creatures returned  and they had to be found for him at no  matter what cost   since i am upon the subject of this prince s  attachment to matters anything but worthy of the kingly majesty  i will  say a word about his passion for those miniatures which were to be found  in manuscript prayer books  and which  before the practice of printing   were done by the most skilful painters   henry iii  seemed to buy such  works  intended for princes and laid by in cabinets of curiosities  only  to spoil them  as soon as he had them  he cut them out  and then pasted  them upon the walls of his chapels  as children do   an incomprehensible  character of mind  in certain things  capable of upholding his rank  in  some  rising above his position  in others  sinking below childishness      histoire universelle de f  a  de thou   t  ix   p           a mind and character incomprehensible indeed  if corruption  lassitude   listlessness  and fear would not explain the existence of everything that  is abnormal and pitiable about human nature in a feeble  cold  and  selfish creature  excited  and at the same time worn out  by the business  and the pleasures of kingship  which henry iii  could neither do without  nor bear the burden of   his perplexity was extreme in his relations with  the other two henries  who gave  like himself  their name to this war   which was called by contemporaries the war of the three henries   the  successes of henry de guise and of henry de bourbon were almost equally  disagreeable to henry de valois   it is probable that  if he could have  chosen  he would have preferred those of henry de bourbon  if they caused  him like jealousy  they did not raise in him the same distrust  he knew  the king of navarre s loyalty  and did not suspect him of aiming to  become  whilst he himself was living  king of france   besides  he  considered the protestants less powerful and less formidable than the  leaguers   henry de guise  on the contrary  was evidently  in his eyes   an ambitious conspirator  determined to push his own fortunes on to the  very crown of france if the chances were favorable to him  and not only  armed with all the power of catholicism  but urged forward by the  passions of the league  perhaps further and certainly more quickly than  his own intentions travelled   since       the leaguers had  at paris   acquired strong organization amongst the populace  the city had been  partitioned out into five districts under five heads  who  shortly  afterwards  added to themselves eleven others  in order that  in the  secret council of the association  each amongst the sixteen quarters of  paris might have its representative and director   thence the famous  committee of sixteen  which played so great and so formidable a part in  the history of that period   it was religious fanaticism and democratic  fanaticism closely united  and in a position to impose their wills upon  their most eminent leaders  upon the duke of guise himself     in vain did henry iii  attempt to resume some sort of authority in paris   his government  his public and private life  and his person were daily  attacked  insulted  and menaced from the elevation of the pulpit and in  the public thoroughfares by qualified preachers or mob orators   on the    th of december        the sorbonne voted  after a deliberation which   it was said  was to be kept secret   that the government might be taken  away from princes who were found not what they ought to be  just as the  administration of a property from a guardian open to suspicion    on the    th of december  the king summoned to the louvre his court of parliament  and the faculty of theology    i know of your precious resolution of the    th of this month   said he to the sorbonne   i have been requested to  take no notice of it  seeing that it was passed after dinner   i have no  mind to avenge myself for these outrages  as i might  and as pope sixtus  v  did when he sent to the galleys certain cordeliers for having dared to  slander him in their sermons   there is not one of you who has not  deserved as much  and more  but it is my good pleasure to forget all  and  to pardon you  on condition of its not occurring again   if it should  i  beg my court of parliament  here present  to exact exemplary justice  and  such as the seditious  like you  may take warning by  so as to mind their  own business    at their exit after this address  the parliament and the  sorbonne  being quite sure that the king would not carry the matter  further  withdrew smiling  and saying   he certainly has spirit  but not  enough of it    habet quidem animum  sed non satis animi     the duke of  guise s sister  the duchess of montpensier  took to getting up and  spreading about all sorts of pamphlets against the king and his  government    the king commanded her to quit his city of paris  she did  nothing of the kind  and three days after she was even brazen enough to  say that she carried at her waist the scissors which would give a third  crown to brother henry de valois    at the close of       the duke of  guise made a trip to rome   with a suite of five  and he only remained  three days  so disguised that he was not recognized there  and discovered  himself to nobody but cardinal pelleve  with whom he was in communication  day and night      journal de l estoile   t  i   p        eighteen months  previously  the cardinal had given a very favorable reception to a case  drawn up by an advocate in the parliament of paris  named david  who  maintained that   although the line of the capets had succeeded to the  temporal administration of the kingdom of charlemagne  it had not  succeeded to the apostolic benediction  which appertained to none but the  posterity of the said charlemagne  and that  the line of capet being some  of them possessed by a spirit of giddiness and stupidity  and others  heretic and excommunicated  the time had come for restoring the crown to  the true heirs   that is to say  to the house of lorraine  which claimed  to be issue of charlemagne   this case was passed on  it is said  from  rome to philip ii   king of spain  and m  de saint goard  ambassador of  france at madrid  sent henry iii  a copy of it     memoires de la ligue    t  i   pp           whatever may have been the truth about this trip to rome on the part of  the duke of guise  and its influence upon what followed  the chiefs of  the leaguers resolved to deal a great blow   the lorraine princes and  their intimate associates met at nancy in january        and decided that  a petition should be presented to the king  that he should be called upon  to join himself more openly and in good earnest to the league  and to  remove from offices of consequence all the persons that should be pointed  out to him  that the holy inquisition should be established  at any rate  in the good towns  that important places should be put into the hands of  specified chiefs  who should have the power of constructing  fortifications there  that heretics should be taxed a third  or at the  least  a fourth of their property as long as the war lasted  and  lastly   that the life should be spared of no enemy taken prisoner  unless upon  his swearing and finding good surety to live as a catholic  and upon  paying in ready money the worth of his property if it had not already  been sold   these monstrous proposals  drawn up in eleven articles  were  immediately carried to the king   he did not reject them  but he demanded  and took time to discuss them with the authors   the negotiation was  prolonged  the ferment in paris was redoubled  the king  it was said   meant to withdraw  his person must be secured  the committee of sixteen  took measures to that end  one of its members got into his hands the keys  of the gate of st  denis   from soissons  where he was staying  the duke  of guise sent to paris the count of brissac  with four other captains of  the league  to hold themselves in readiness for any event  and he ordered  his brother the duke of aumale to stoutly maintain his garrisons in the  places of picardy  which the king  it was said  meant to take from him    if the king leaves paris   the duke wrote to bernard de mendoza  philip  ii  s ambassador in france   i will make him think about returning  thither before he has gone a day s march towards the picards    philip  ii  made guise an offer of three hundred thousand crowns  six thousand  lanzknechts  and twelve hundred lances  as soon as he should have broken  with henry iii    the abscess will soon burst   wrote the ambassador to  the king his master     on the  th of may        at eleven p  m   the duke of guise set out from  soissons  after having commended himself to the prayers of the convents  in the town   he arrived the next morning before paris  which he entered  about midday by the gate of st  martin   the leaguers had been expecting  him for several days   though he had covered his head with his cloak  he  was readily recognized and eagerly cheered  the burgesses left their  houses and the tradesmen their shops to see him and follow him  shouting    hurrah  for guise  hurrah  for the pillar of the church    the crowd  increased at every step   he arrived in front of the palace of catherine  de  medici  who had not expected him  and grew pale at sight of him    my dear cousin   said she to him   i am very glad to see you  but i  should have been better pleased at another time     madame  i am come to  clear myself from all the calumnies of my enemies  do me the honor to  conduct me to the king yourself    catherine lost no time in giving the  king warning by one of her secretaries   on receipt of this notice  henry  iii   who had at first been stolid  and silent  rose abruptly from his  chair    tell my lady mother that  as she wishes to present the duke of  guise to me  i will receive him in the chamber of the queen my wife    the envoy departed   the king  turning to one of his officers  colonel  alphonso corso  said to him   m  de guise has just arrived at paris   contrary to my orders   what would you do in my place     sir  do you  hold the duke of guise for friend or enemy    the king  without speaking   replied by a significant gesture    if it please your  majesty to give me  the order  i will this very day lay the duke s head at your feet    the  three councillors who happened to be there cried out   the king held his  peace   during this conversation at the louvre  the duke of guise was  advancing along the streets  dressed in a doublet of white damask  a  cloak of black cloth  and boots of buffalo hide  he walked on foot   bareheaded  at the side of the queen mother in a sedan chair   he was  tall  with fair clustering hair and piercing eyes  and his scar added to  his martial air   the mob pressed upon his steps  flowers were thrown to  him from the windows  some  adoring him as a saint  touched him with  chaplets which they afterwards kissed  a young girl darted towards him   and  removing her mask  kissed him  saying   brave prince  since you are  here  we are all saved    guise  with a dignified air   saluted and  delighted everybody   says a witness   with eye  and gesture  and  speech     by his side   said madame de retz   the other princes are  commoners     the huguenots   said another   become leaguers at the very  sight of him    on arriving at the louvre  he traversed the court between  two rows of soldiers  the archers on duty in the hall  and the forty five  gentlemen of the king s chamber at the top of the staircase    what  brings you hither   said the king  with difficulty restraining his anger    i entreat your majesty to believe in my fidelity  and not allow yourself  to go by the reports of my enemies     did i not command you not to come  at this season so full of suspicions  but to wait yet a while       sir  i was not given to understand that my coming would be disagreeable  to you    catherine drew near  and  in a low tone  told her son of the  demonstrations of which the duke had been the object on his way   guise  was received in the chamber of the queen  louise de vaudemont  who was  confined to her bed by indisposition  he chatted with her a moment  and   saluting the king  retired without being attended by any one of the  officers of the court   henry iii  confined himself to telling him that  results should speak for the sincerity of his words     guise returned to his house in the faubourg st  antoine  still  accompanied by an eager and noisy crowd  but somewhat disquieted at heart  both by the king s angry reception and the people s enthusiastic welcome   brave as he was  he was more ambitious in conception than bold in  execution  and he had not made up his mind to do all that was necessary  to attain the end he was pursuing   the committee of sixteen  his  confidants  and all the staff of the league  met at his house during the  evening and night between the  th and   th of may  preparing for the  morrow s action without well knowing what it was to be  proposing various  plans  collecting arms  and giving instructions to their agents amongst  the populace   an agitation of the same sort prevailed at the louvre  the  king  too  was deliberating with his advisers as to what he should do on  the morrow  guise would undoubtedly present himself at his morning levee   should he at once rid himself of him by the poniards of the five and  forty bravoes which the duke of epernon had enrolled in gascony for his  service   or would it be best to summon to paris some troops  french and  swiss  to crush the parisian rebels and the adventurers that had hurried  up from all parts to their aid   but on the   th of may  guise went to  the louvre with four hundred gentlemen well armed with breastplates and  weapons under their cloaks   the king did nothing  no more did guise   the two had a long conversation in the queen mother s garden  but it led  to no result   on the   th of may  in the evening  the provost of  tradesmen  hector de perreuse  assembled the town council and those of  the district colonels on whom he had reliance to receive the king s  orders   orders came to muster the burgher companies of certain  districts  and send them to occupy certain positions that had been  determined upon   they mustered slowly and incompletely  and some not at  all  and scarcely had they arrived when several left the posts which had  been assigned to them   the king  being informed of this sluggishness   sent for the regiment of the french guards  and for four thousand swiss  cantoned in the outskirts of paris  and he himself mounted his horse  on  the   th of may  in the morning  to go and receive them at the gate of  st  honord   these troops  filed along  without fife or drum  towards the  cemetery of the innocents    the populace regarded them as they passed  with a feeling of angry curiosity and uneasy amazement   when all the  corps had arrived at the appointed spot   they put themselves in motion  towards different points  now making a great noise with their drums and  fifes  which marvellously astonished the inhabitants of the quarter    noise provokes noise    in continently   says l estoile   everybody  seizes his arms  goes out on guard in the streets and cantons  in less  than no time chains are stretched across and barricades made at the  corners of the streets  the mechanic leaves his tools  the tradesman his  business  the university their books  the attorneys their bags  the  advocates their bands  the presidents and councillors themselves take  halberds in hand  nothing is heard but shouts  murmurs  and the seditious  speeches that heat and alarm a people    the tocsin sounded everywhere   barricades sprang up in the twinkling of an eye  they were made within  thirty paces of the louvre   the royal troops were hemmed in where they  stood  and deprived of the possibility of moving  the swiss  being  attacked  lost fifty men  and surrendered  holding up their chaplets and  exclaiming that they were good catholics   it was thought sufficient to  disarm the french guards   the king  remaining stationary at the louvre   sent his marshals to parley with the people massed in the thoroughfares   the queen mother had herself carried over the barricades in order to go  to guise s house and attempt some negotiation with him   he received her  coldly  demanding that the king should appoint him lieutenant general of  the kingdom  declare the huguenot princes incapacitated from succeeding  to the throne  and assemble the states general   at the approach of  evening  guise determined to go himself and assume the conqueror s air by  putting a stop to the insurrection   he issued from his house on  horseback  unarmed  with a white wand in his hand  he rode through the  different districts  exhorting the inhabitants to keep up their  barricades  whilst remaining on the defensive and leaving him to complete  their work   he was greeted on all sides with shouts of  hurrah  for  guise    you wrong me  my friends   said he   you should shout   hurrah   for the king     he had the french guards and the swiss set at liberty   and they defiled before him  arms lowered and bareheaded  as before their  preserver   next morning  may     he wrote to d entragues  governor of  orleans   notify our friends to come to us in the greatest haste  possible  with horses and arms  but without baggage  which they will  easily be able to do  for i believe that the roads are open hence to you   i have defeated the swiss  and cut in pieces a part of the king s guards   and i hold the louvre invested so closely that i will render good account  of whatsoever there is in it   this is so great a victory that it will be  remembered forever    that same day  the provost of tradesmen and the  royalist sheriffs repaired to the louvre  and told the king that  without  great and immediate concessions  they could not answer for anything  the  louvre was not in a condition of defence  there were no troops to be  depended upon for resistance  no provisions  no munitions  the investment  was growing closer and closer every hour  and the assault might commence  at any instant   henry iii  sent his mother once more to the duke of  guise  and himself went out about four o clock  dressed in a country suit  and scantily attended  as if for a walk in the tuileries   catherine  found the duke as inflexible as he had been the day before   he  peremptorily insisted upon all the conditions he had laid down already   the lieutenant generalship of the kingdom for himself  the unity of the  catholic faith  forfeiture on the part of the king of navarre and every  other huguenot prince as heir to the throne  perpetual banishment of the  king s favorites  and convocation of the states general    the king   he  said   purposes to destroy all the grandees of the kingdom and to harry  all those who oppose his wishes and the elevation of his minions  it is  my duty and my interest to take all the measures necessary for my own  preservation and that of the people    catherine yielded on nearly every  point  at the same time  however  continually resuming and prolonging the  discussion   one of the duke s most trusty confidants  francis de  mainville  entered and whispered in his ear    madame   cried the duke    whilst your majesty has been amusing me here  the king is off from paris  to harry me and destroy me    henry iii   indeed  had taken horse at the  tuileries  and  attended by his principal councillors  unbooted and  cloakless  had issued from the new gate  and set out on the road to st   cloud   equipping him in haste  his squire  du halde  had put his spur on  wrong  and would have set it right  but   that will do   said the king    i am not going to see my mistress  i have a longer journey to make    it  is said that the corps on guard at the nesle gate fired from a distance a  salute of arquebuses after the fugitive king  and that a crowd assembled  on the other bank of the river shouted insults after him   at the height  of chaillot henry pulled up  and turning round towards paris   ungrateful  city   he cried   i have loved thee more than my own wife  i will not  enter thy walls again but by the breach      it is said that on hearing of the duke of guise s sudden arrival at  paris  pope sixtus v  exclaimed   ah  what rashness   to thus go and put  himself in the hands of a prince he has so outraged    and some days  afterwards  on the news that the king had received the duke of guise and  nothing had come of it   ah  dastard prince  poor creature of a prince   to have let such a chance escape him of getting rid of a man who seems  born to be his destruction     de thou   t  x   p           when the king was gone  guise acted the master in paris   he ordered the  immediate delivery into his hands of the bastille  the arsenal  and the  castle of vincennes   ornano  governor of the bastille  sent an offer to  the king  who had arrived at chartres  to defend it to the last  extremity    i will not expose to so certain a peril a brave man who may  be necessary to me elsewhere   replied the king   guise caused to be  elected at paris a new town council and a new provost of tradesmen  all  taken from amongst the most ardent leaguers   he at the same time exerted  himself to restore order  he allowed all royalists who wished to depart  to withdraw to chartres  he went in person and pressed the premier  president of parliament  achille de harlay  to resume the course of  justice    it is great pity  sir   said harlay   when the servant drives  out the master  this assembly is founded  seated  on the fleur de lis   being established by the king  it can act only for his service   we will  all lose our lives to a man rather than give way a whit to the contrary     i have been in many battles   said guise  as he went out   in assaults  and encounters the most dangerous in the world  and i have never been so  overcome as at my reception by this personage    at the same time that he  was trying to exercise authority and restore order  unbridled violence  and anarchy were making head around him  the sixteen and their friends  discharged from the smallest offices  civil or religious  whoever was not  devoted to them  they changed all the captains and district officers of  the city militia  they deposed all the incumbents  all the ecclesiastics  whom they termed huguenots and policists  the pulpits of christians  became the platforms of demagogues  the preachers guiticestre  boucher   rose  john prevost  aubry  pigenat  cueilly  pelletier  and a host of  others whose names have fallen into complete obscurity  were the popular  apostles  the real firebrands of the troubles of the league  says  pasquier  there was scarcely a chapel where there were not several  sermons a day    you know not your strength   they kept repeating to  their auditors   paris knows not what she is worth  she has wealth enough  to make war upon four kings  france is sick  and she will never recover  from that sickness till she has a draught of french blood given her            if you receive henry de valois into your towns  make up your  minds to see your preachers massacred  your sheriffs hanged  your women  violated  and the gibbets garnished with your members    one of these  raving orators  claude trahy  provincial of the cordeliers  devoted  himself to hounding on the populace of auxerre against their bishop   james amyot  the translator of plutarch  whom he reproached with  having  communicated with henry iii  and administered to him the eucharist    brother john moresin  one of trahy s subalterns  went about brandishing a  halberd in the public place at auxerre  and shouting   courage  lads   messire amyot is a wicked man  worse than henry de valois  he has  threatened to have our master trahy hanged  but he will repent it   and    at the voice of this madman  there hurried up vine dressers  boatmen   and marchandeaux  costermongers   a whole angry mob  who were for having  amyot s throat cut  and trahy made bishop in his stead      whilst the blind passions of fanatics and demagogues were thus let loose   the sensible and clear sighted spirits  the earnest and moderate  royalists  did not all of them remain silent and motionless   after the  appearance of the letters written in      by the duke of guise to explain  and justify his conduct in this crisis  a grandson of chancellor de  l hospital  michael hurault  sieur du fay  published a document  entitled  frank and free discourse upon the condition of france  one of the most  judicious and most eloquent pamphlets of the sixteenth century  a  profound criticism upon the acts of the duke of guise  their causes and  consequences  and a true picture of the falsehoods and servitude into  which an eminent man may fall when he makes himself the tool of a popular  faction in the hope of making that faction the tool of his personal  ambition   but even the men who were sufficiently enlightened and  sufficiently courageous to tell the league and its leader plain truths  spoke only rather late in the day  and at first without giving their  names  the document written by l hospital s grandson did not appear until        after the death of henry iii  and henry de guise  and it remained  anonymous for some time   one cannot be astonished at such timidity   guise himself was timid before the leaguers  and he always ended by  yielding to them in essentials  after having attempted to resist them  upon such and such an incidental point   his own people accused him of  lacking boldness  and his sister  the duchess of montpensier  openly  patronized the most violent preachers  whilst boasting that she wielded  more influence through them than her brother by his armies   henry iii    under stress of his enemies  zeal and his own servants  weakness   catherine de  medici included  after having fled from paris and taken  refuge at chartres to escape the triumph of the barricades  once more  began to negotiate  that is  to capitulate with the league  he issued at  rouen  on the   th of july        an edict in eleven articles  whereby he  granted more than had been demanded  and more than he had promised in       by the treaty of nemours  over and above the measures contained in  that treaty against the huguenots  in respect of the present and the  future  he added four fresh surety towns  amongst others bourges and  orleans  to those of which the leaguers were to remain in possession   he declared  moreover   that no investigation should be made into any  understandings  associations  and other matters into which our catholic  subjects might have entered together  inasmuch as they have given us to  understand and have informed us that what they did was but owing to the  zeal they felt for the preservation and maintenance of the catholic  religion    by thus releasing the league from all responsibility for the  past  and by giving this new treaty the name of edict of union  henry  iii  flattered himself  it is said  that he was thus putting himself at  the head of a new grand catholic league which would become royalist  again  inasmuch as the king was granting it all it had desired   the  edict of union was enregistered at the parliament of paris on the   st of  july   the states general were convoked for the   th of october  following    on tuesday  august    his majesty   says l estoile   being  entertained by the duke of guise during his dinner  asked him for drink   and then said to him   to whom shall we drink     to whom you please   sir   answered the duke   it is for your majesty to command     cousin    said the king   drink we to our good friends the huguenots     it is well  said  sir   answered the duke    and to our good barricaders   said the  king   let us not forget them    whereupon the duke began to laugh a  little   adds l estoile   but a sort of laugh that did not go beyond the  knot of the throat  being dissatisfied at the novel union the king was  pleased to make of the huguenots with the barricaders    what must have  to some extent reassured the duke of guise was  that a te deum was  celebrated at notre dame for the king of navarre s exclusion from all  right to the crown  and that  on the   th of august henry de guise was  appointed generalissimo of the royal armies      illustration  the castle of blois            the states general met at blois on the   th of october         they  numbered five hundred and five deputies  one hundred and ninety one of  the third estate  one hundred and eighty of the noblesse  one hundred and  thirty four of the clergy   the king had given orders  to conduct each  deputy as they arrived to his cabinet  that he might see  hear  and know  them all personally    when the five hundred and five deputies had taken  their places in the hall  the duke of guise went to fetch the king  who  made his entry attended by the princes of the blood  and opened the  session with the dignity and easy grace which all the valois seemed to  have inherited from francis i   the duke of guise  in a coat of white  satin  was seated at the king s feet  as high steward of his household   scanning the whole assembly with his piercing glance  as if to keep watch  over those who were in his service    he seemed   says a contemporary    by a single flash of his eye to fortify them in the hope of the  advancement of his designs  his fortunes  and his greatness  and to say  to them  without speaking  i see you    the king s speech was long  able   well delivered  and very much applauded  save by guise himself and his  particular friends  the firmness of tone had displeased them  and one  sentence excited in them a discontent which they had found difficulty in  restraining  certain grandees of my kingdom have formed such leagues and  associations as  in every well ordered monarchy  are crimes of high  treason  without the sovereign s permission   but  showing my wonted  indulgence  i am quite willing to let bygones be bygones in this respect   guise grew pale at these words   on leaving the royal session  he got his  private committee to decide that the cardinal of guise and the archbishop  of lyons should go to see the king  and beg him to abandon the printing  of his speech  and meanwhile guise himself sent to the printer s to stop  the immediate publication   discussion took place next day in the king s  cabinet  and a threat was held out to him that a portion of the deputies  would quit the meeting of states   the queen mother advised her son to  compromise   the king yielded  according to his custom  and gave  authority for cutting out the strongest expressions  amongst others those  just quoted    the correction was accordingly made   says m  picot  the  latest and most able historian of the states general   and henry iii   had to add this new insult to all that were rankling at the bottom of his  heart since the affair of the barricades      this was  for the duke of guise  a first trial of his power  and great  was his satisfaction at this first success   on leaving the opening  session of the states general  he wrote to the spanish ambassador  mendoza   i handled our states so well that i made them resolve to  require confirmation of the edict of union  of july    preceding  as  fundamental law of the state   the king refused to do so  in rather sharp  terms  to the deputies who brought the representation before him  and  from that it is presumed that he inclines towards a peace with the  heretics   but  at last  he was so pressed by the states  the which were  otherwise on the point of breaking up  that he promised to swear the  edict and have it sworn before entering upon consideration of any  matter      the next day but one  in fact  on the   th of october  at the second  session of the states general   the edict of july    was read and  published with the greatest solemnity  the king swore to maintain it in  terms calculated to dissipate all anxieties on the part of the catholics   the deputies swore after him   the archbishop of bourges delivered an  address on the sanctity of oaths  and those present began to think the  session over  when the king rose a second time to recommend the deputies  not to leave blois before the papers were drawn up and the ordinances  made   he reminded them that at the last assembly of the states the  suggestions and counsels of the three estates had been so ill carried out  that  instead of a reformation and an establishment of good laws   everything had been thrown into confusion   accordingly the king added to  this suggestion a solemn oath that he would not budge from the city until  he had made an edict  sacred and inviolable   the enthusiasm of the  deputies was at its height  a rush took place to the church of st   sauveur to chant a te deum   all the princes were there to give thanks to  god   never were king  court  and people so joyous    the duke of guise  wrote to the spanish ambassador   at length we have  in full assembly of  the states  had our edict of union solemnly sworn and established as  fundamental law of this realm  having surmounted all the difficulties and  hinderances which the king was pleased to throw in the way  i found  myself four or five times on the point of rupture  but i was verily  assisted by so many good men      after as well as before the opening of the states general  the friends of  the duke of guise were far from having  all of them  the same confidence  that he had in his position and in his success    stupid owl of a  lorrainer   said sieur de vins  commanding  on behalf of the league  in  dauphiny  on reading the duke s despatches   has he so little sense as to  believe that a king whose crown he  by dissimulating  has been wanting to  take away  is not dissimulating in turn to take away his life     as they  are so thick together   said m  de vins  sister  when she knew that the  duke of guise was at blois with the king   you will hear  at the very  first opportunity  that one or the other has killed his fellow    guise  himself was no stranger to this idea    we are not without warnings from  all quarters that there is a design of attempting my life   he wrote on  the   st of september         but i have  thank god  so provided against  it  both by the gathering i have made of a good number of my friends  and  in having  by presents and money  secured a portion of those whose  services are relied upon for the execution of it  that  if once things  begin  i shall finish more roughly than i did at paris      after the opening of the states general and the success he obtained  thereat  guise appeared  if not more anxious  at any rate more attentive  to the warnings he received   on the   th of december        he wrote to  commander moreo  confidential agent from the king of spain to him   you  cannot imagine what alarms have been given me since your departure   i  have so well provided against them that my enemies have not seen their  way to attempting anything            but expenses have grown upon me to  such an extent that i have great need of your prompt assistance            i have now so much credit with this assembly that i have hitherto made it  dance to my tune  and i hope that as to what remains to be decreed i  shall be quite able to maintain the same authority    some of his  partisans advised him to go away for a while to orleans  but he  absolutely refused  repeating  with the archbishop of lyons   he who  leaves the game loses it    one evening  in a little circle of intimates   on the   st of december  a question arose whether it would not be  advisable to prevent the king s designs by striking at his person   the  cardinal of guise begged his brother to go away  assuring him that his  own presence would suffice for the direction of affairs  but   they are  in such case  my friend   said the balafre   that  if i saw death coming  in at the window  i would not consent to go out by the door to avoid it    his cousin  the duke of elbeuf  paid him a visit at night to urge him to  withdraw himself from the plot hatched against him    if it were  necessary to lose my life in order to reap the proximate fruits of the  states  good resolution   said guise   that is what i have quite made up  my mind to   though i had a hundred lives  i would devote them all to the  service of god and his church  and to the relief of the poor people for  whom i feel the greatest pity   then  touching the duke of elbeuf upon  the shoulder  he said   go to bed  cousin   and  taking away his hand and  laying it upon his own heart  he added   here is the doublet of  innocence    on the evening of the   d of december        when charlotte  de semblancay  marchioness of noirmoutiers  to whom he was tenderly  attached  pressed him to depart  or at any rate not to be present at the  council next day  the only answer he made her was to hum the following  ditty  by desportes  a poet of the day                       my little rose  a little spell                 of absence changed that heart of thine                  and i  who know the change full well                  have found another place for mine                  no more such fair but fickle she                 shall find me her obedient                  and  flighty shepherdess  we ll see                 which of the twain will first repent      henry iii   was scarcely less disturbed  but in quite a different way   than the duke of guise   for a long time past he had been thinking about  getting rid of the latter  just as he had thought for a long time  twenty  years before  about getting rid of admiral de coligny  but since the date  of his escape from the popular rising on the day of the barricades  he  had hoped that  thanks to the adoption of the edict of union and to the  convocation of the states general  he would escape the yoke of the duke  of guise   he saw every day that he had been mistaken  the league  and  consequently the duke of guise  had more power than he with the  states general  in vain had the king changed nearly all his ministers  in  vain had he removed his principal favorite  the duke of epernon  from the  government of normandy to that of provence  he did not obtain from the  states general what he demanded  that is  the money he wanted  and the  states required of him administrative reforms  sound enough at bottom   but suggested by the duke of guise with an interested object  and  calculated to shackle the kingly authority even more than could be done  by guise himself directly   at the same time that guise was urging on the  states general in this path  he demanded to be made constable  not by the  king any longer  but by the states themselves   the kingship was thus  being squeezed between the haughty supremacy of the great lords   substitutes for the feudal regimen  and the first essays of that free  government which is nowadays called the parliamentary regimen   henry  iii  determined with fear and trembling to disembarrass himself of his  two rivals  of the duke of guise by assassination  and of the  states general by packing them off home   he did not know how intimately  the two great questions of which the sixteenth century was the great  cradle  the question of religious liberty and that of political liberty   were connected one with the other  and would be prosecuted jointly or  successively in the natural progress of christian civilization  or  through what trials kings and people would have to pass before  succeeding in any effectual solution of them     on the   th of december        during an entertainment given by catherine  de  medici on the marriage of her niece  christine de lorraine  with  ferdinand de  medici  grand duke of tuscany  henry iii  summoned to his  cabinet three of his most intimate and safest confidants  marshal  d aumont  nicholas d angennes  lord of rambouillet  and sieur de beauvais  nangis   after having laid before them all the duke of guise s intrigues  against him and the perils of the position in which they placed him    what ought i to do   he said   help me to save myself by some speedy  means    they asked the king to give them twenty four hours to answer in   next day  the   th  sieur de maintenon  brother of rambouillet  and  alphonso corso d ornano were added to the party  only one of them was of  opinion that the duke of guise should at once be arrested and put upon  his trial  the four others were for a shorter and a surer process  that  of putting the duke to death by a sudden blow   he is evidently making  war upon the king  they said  and the king has a right to defend himself   henry iii   who had his mind made up  asked crillon  commandant of the  regiment of guards   think you that the duke of guise deserves death     yes  sir     very well  then i choose you to give it him     i am ready  to challenge him     that is not what is wanted  as leader of the  league  he is guilty of high treason     very well  sir  then let him be  tried and executed     but  crillon  nothing is less certain than his  conviction in a court of law  he must be struck down unexpectedly     sir  i am a soldier  not an assassin    the king did not persist  but  merely charged crillon  who promised  to keep the proposal secret   at  this very time guise was requesting the king to give him a constable s  grand provost and archers to form his guard in his quality of  lieutenant general of the kingdom   the king deferred his reply   catherine de  medici supported the lorrainer prince s request    in two  or three days it shall be settled   said henry   he had ordered twelve  poniards from an armorer s in the city  on the   st of december he told  his project to loignac  an officer of his guards  who was less  scrupulous than crillon  and undertook to strike the blow  in concert  with the forty five trusty guards   at the council on the   d of  december  the king announced his intention of passing christmas in  retreat at notre dame de cleri  and he warned the members of the council  that next day the session would take place very early in order to  dispose of business before his departure  on the evening of the   d  the  duke of guise  on sitting down at table  found under his napkin a note  to this effect   the king means to kill you    guise asked for a pen   wrote at the bottom of the note   he dare not   and threw it under the  table   next day  december     henry iii   rising at four a  m   after a  night of great agitation  admitted into his cabinet by a secret  staircase the nine guards he had chosen  handed them the poniards he had  ordered  placed them at the post where they were to wait for the meeting  of the council  and bade charles d entragues to go and request one of  the royal chaplains  to say mass  that god might give the king grace to  be able to carry out an enterprise which he hoped would come to an issue  within an hour  and on which the safety of france depended    then the  king retired into his closet   the members of the council arrived in  succession  it is said that one of the archers on duty  when he saw the  duke of guise mounting the staircase  trod on his foot  as if to give  him warning  but  if he observed it  guise made no account of it  any  more than of all the other hints he had already received   before  entering the council chamber  he stopped at a small oratory connected  with the chapel  said his prayer  and as he passed the door of the  queen mother s apartments  signified his desire to pay his respects and  have a few words with her   catherine was indisposed  and could not  receive him   some vexation  it is said  appeared in guise s face  but  he said not a word   on entering the council chamber he felt cold  asked  to have some fire lighted  and gave orders to his secretary  pericard   the only attendant admitted with him  to go and fetch the silver gilt  shell he was in the habit of carrying about him with damsons or other  preserves to eat of a morning   pericard was some time gone  guise was  in a hurry  and   be kind enough   he said to m  de morfontaines   to  send word to m  de saint prix  first groom of the chamber to henry  iii    that i beg him to let me have a few damsons or a little preserve  of roses  or some trifle of the king s    four brignolles plums were  brought him  and he ate one   his uneasiness continued  the eye close to  his scar became moist  according to m  de thou  he bled at the nose   he  felt in his pocket for a handkerchief to use  but could not find one    my people   said he   have not given me my necessaries this morning   there is great excuse for them  they were too much hurried    at his  request  saint prix had a handkerchief brought to him   pericard passed  his bonbon box to him  as the guards would not let him enter again   the  duke took a few plums from it  threw the rest on the table  saying    gentlemen  who will have any    and rose up hurriedly upon seeing the  secretary of state revol  who came in and said to him   sir  the king  wants you  he is in his old cabinet      as soon as he knew that the duke of guise had arrived  and whilst these  little incidents were occurring in the council chamber  henry iii  had in  fact given orders to his secretary revol to go on his behalf and summon  the duke   but nambu  usher to the council  faithful to his instructions   had refused to let anybody  even the king s secretary  enter the hall   revol  of a timid disposition  and impressed  it is said  with the  sinister importance of his commission  returned to the cabinet with a  very troubled air   the king  in his turn  was troubled  fearing lest his  project had been discovered    what is the matter  revol   said he   what  is it   how pale you are   you will spoil all   rub your cheeks  rub your  cheeks     there is nothing wrong  sir  only m  de nambu would not let  me in without your majesty s express command    revol entered the  council chamber and discharged his commission   the duke of guise pulled  up his cloak as if to wrap himself well in it  took his hat  gloves  and  his sweetmeat box  and went out of the room  saying   adieu  gentlemen    with a gravity free from any appearance of mistrust   he crossed the  king s chamber contiguous to the council hall  courteously saluted  as he  passed  loignac and his comrades  whom he found drawn up  and who   returning him a frigid obeisance  followed him as if to show him respect   on arriving at the door of the old cabinet  and just as he leaned down to  raise the tapestry that covered it  guise was struck five poniard blows  in the chest  neck  and reins    god ha  mercy   he cried  and  though  his sword was entangled in his cloak  and he was himself pinned by the  arms and legs and choked by the blood that spurted from his throat  he  dragged his murderers  by a supreme effort of energy  to the other end of  the room  where he fell down backwards and lifeless before the bed of  henry iii   who  coming to the door of his room and asking  if it was  done   contemplated with mingled satisfaction and terror the inanimate  body of his mighty rival   who seemed to be merely sleeping  so little  was he changed     my god   how tall he is   cried the king   he looks  even taller than when he was alive       illustration  henry iii   and the murder of guise             they are killing my brother   cried the cardinal of guise  when he heard  the noise that was being made in the next room  and he rose up to run  thither   the archbishop of lyons  peter d espinac  did the same   the  duke of aumont held them both back  saying   gentlemen  we must wait for  the king s orders    orders came to arrest them both  and confine them in  a small room over the council chamber   they had  eggs  bread  wine from  the king s cellar  their breviaries  their night gowns  a palliasse  and  a mattress   brought to them there  and they were kept under ocular  supervision for four and twenty hours   the cardinal of guise was  released the next morning  but only to be put to death like his brother   the king spared the archbishop of lyons      i am sole king   said henry iii  to his ministers  as he entered the  council chamber  and shortly afterwards  going to see the queen mother   who was ill of the gout   how do you feel   he asked    better   she  answered    so do i   replied the king   i feel much better  this morning  i have become king of france again  the king of paris is dead     you  have had the duke of guise killed   asked catherine  have you reflected  well   god grant that you become not king of nothing at all   i hope the  cutting is right  now for the sewing    according to the majority of the  historians  catherine had neither been in the secret nor had anything to  do with the preparations for the measure   granted that she took no  active part in it  and that she avoided even the appearance of having any  previous knowledge of it  she was not fond of responsibility  and she  liked better to negotiate between the different parties than to make her  decisive choice between them  prudent tendencies grow with years  and in       she was sixty nine   it is difficult  however  to believe that   being the habitual confidant of her favorite son  she was ignorant of a  design long meditated  and known to many persons many days before its  execution   the event once accomplished  ill as she was  and contrary to  the advice of her physicians  she had herself carried to the cardinal of  bourbon s  who was still under arrest by the king s orders  to promise  him speedy release    ah  madame   said the cardinal  as he saw her  enter   these are some of your tricks  you are death to us all    however  it may be  thirteen days after the murder of the duke of guise  on the   th of january        catherine de  medici herself died   nor was her  death  so far as affairs and the public were concerned  an event  her  ability was of the sort which is worn out by the frequent use made  of it  and which  when old age comes on  leaves no long or grateful  reminiscence   time has restored catherine de  medici to her proper place  in history  she was quickly forgotten by her contemporaries     she had good reason to say to her son  as her last advice   now for the  sewing    it was not long before henry iii  perceived that to be king  it  was not sufficient to have murdered his rival   he survived the duke of  guise only seven months  and during that short period he was not really  king  all by himself  for a single day  never had his kingship been so  embarrassed and impotent  the violent death of the duke of guise had  exasperated much more than enfeebled the league  the feeling against his  murderer was passionate and contagious  the catholic cause had lost its  great leader  it found and accepted another in his brother the duke of  mayenne  far inferior to his elder brother in political talent and prompt  energy of character  but a brave and determined soldier  a much better  man of party and action than the sceptical  undecided  and indolent henry  iii   the majority of the great towns of france  paris  rouen  orleans   toulouse  lyons  amiens  and whole provinces declared eagerly against the  royal murderer   he demanded support from the states general  who refused  it  and he was obliged to dismiss them   the parliament of paris   dismembered on the   th of january        by the council of sixteen   became the instrument of the leaguers   the majority of the other  parliaments followed the example set by that of paris   the sorbonne   consulted by a petition presented in the name of all catholics  decided  that frenchmen were released from their oath of allegiance to henry iii    and might with a good conscience turn their arms against him   henry made  some obscure attempts to come to an arrangement with certain chiefs of  the leaguers  but they were rejected with violence   the duke of mayenne   having come to paris on the   th of february  was solemnly received at  notre dame  amidst shouts of  hurrah for the catholic princes  hurrah for  the house of lorraine    he was declared lieutenant general of the crown  and state of france   he organized a council general of the league   composed of forty members and charged with the duty of providing for all  matters of war  the finance and the police of the realm  pending a fresh  convocation of states general   to counterbalance in some degree the  popular element  mayenne introduced into it fourteen personages of his  own choice and a certain number of magistrates and bishops  the delegates  of the united towns were to have seats at the council whenever they  happened to be at paris    never   says m  henry martin   histoire de  france   t  i   p       very truly   could the league have supposed  itself to be so near becoming a government of confederated municipalities  under the directorate of paris      there was clearly for henry iii  but one possible ally who had a chance  of doing effectual service  and that was henry of navarre and the  protestants   it cost henry iii  a great deal to have recourse to that  party  his conscience and his pusillanimity both revolted at it equally   in spite of his moral corruption  he was a sincere catholic  and the  prospect of excommunication troubled him deeply   catholicism  besides   was in a large majority in france  how  then  was he to treat with its  foes without embroiling himself utterly with it   meanwhile the case was  urgent   henry was apprised by one of his confidants  nicholas de  rambouillet  that one of the king of navarre s confidants  sully  who was  then only sieur de rosny  was passing by blois on his way to his master   he saw him and expressed to him his  desire for a reconciliation with the  king of navarre  and to employ him on confidential service   the  difficulty was to secure to the protestant king and his army  then  engaged in the siege of chatellerault  a passage across the loire   rosny  undertook henry iii  s commission   he at the same time received another  from sieur de brigueux  governor of the little town of beaugency  who  said to him   i see well  sir  that the king is going the right way to  ruin himself by timidity  irresolution  and bad advice  and that  necessity will throw us into the hands of the league  for my part  i will  never belong to it  and i would rather serve the king of navarre   tell  him that i hold  at beaugency  a passage over the loire  and that if he  will be pleased to send to me you or m  de rebours  i will admit into the  town him whom he sends to me    upon receiving these overtures  the king  of navarre thought a while  scratching his head  then he said to rosny    do you think that the king has good intentions towards me  and means to  treat with me in good faith     yes  sir  for the present  and you need  have no doubt about it  for his straits constrain him thereto  having  nothing to look to in his perils but your assistance    he had some  dinner brought into his own cabinet for rosny  and then made him post off  at once   on arriving in the evening at tours  whither henry iii  had  fallen back  rosny was taken to him  about midnight  at the top of the  castle  the king sent him off that very night  he consented to everything  that the king of navarre proposed  promised him a town on the loire  and  said he was ready to make with him not a downright peace just at first   but  a good long truce  which  in their two hearts  would at once be an  eternal peace and a sincere reconciliation      when rosny got back to chatellerault   there was nothing but rejoicing   everybody ran to meet him  he was called  god rosny   and one of his  friends said to the rest   do you see yon man   by god  we shall all  worship him  and he alone will restore france  i said so six years ago   and villandry was of my opinion       thus was the way paved and the beginning made  between the two kings  of  an alliance demanded by their mutual interests  and still more strongly  by the interests of france  ravaged and desolated  for nearly thirty  years past  by religious civil wars   henry of navarre had profound  sympathy for his country s sufferings  an ardent desire to put a stop to  them  and at the same time the instinct to see clearly that the day had  come when the re establishment of harmony and common action between  himself and henry de valois was the necessary and at the same time  possible means of attaining that great result   on the  th of march         soon after the states of blois had been dismissed  he set before  france  in an eloquent manifesto  the expression of his anxieties and his  counsels   i will speak freely   said he   to myself first and then to  others  that we may be all of us without excuse   let us not be puffed up  with pride on one side or another   as for me  although i have received  more favors from god in this than in all past wars  and  whilst the two  other parties  how sad that they must be so called   are enfeebled  mine   to all appearance  has been strengthened  nevertheless i well know that   whenever i go beyond my duty  god will no longer bless me  and i shall do  so whenever  without reason and in sheer lightness of heart  i attack my  king and trouble the repose of his kingdom            i declare  then   first of all to those who belong to the party of the king my lord  that  if they do not counsel him to make use of me  and of the means which god  hath given me  for to make war  not on them of lorraine  not on paris   orleans  or toulouse  but on those who shall hinder the peace and the  obedience owed to this crown  they alone will be answerable for the woes  which will come upon the king and the kingdom            and as to those  who still adhere to the name and party of the league  i  as a frenchman   conjure them to put up with their losses as i do with mine  and to  sacrifice their quarrels  vengeance  and ambition to the welfare of  france  their mother  to the service of their king  to their own repose  and ours   if they do otherwise  i hope that god will not abandon the  king  and will put it into his heart to call around him his servants   myself the first  who wish for no other title  and who shall have  sufficient might and good right to help him wipe out their memory from  the world and their party from france            i wish these written  words to go proclaiming for me throughout the world that i am ready to  ask my lord the king for peace  for the repose of his kingdom and for my  own            and finally  if i find one or another so sleepy headed or  so ill disposed that none is moved thereby  i will call god to my aid   and  true servant of my king  worthy of the honor that belongs to me as  premier prince of this realm  though all the world should have conspired  for its ruin  i protest  before god and before man  that  at the risk of  ten thousand lives  i will essay  all alone  to prevent it      it is pleasing to think that this patriotic step and these powerful words  were not without influence over the result which was attained   the king  of navarre set to work  at the same time with rosny  one  of the most  eminent  and with philip du plessis mornay  the most sterling of his  servants  and a month after the publication of his manifesto  on the  d  of april        a truce for a year was concluded between the two kings   it set forth that the king of navarre should serve the king of france  with all his might and main  that he should have  for the movements of  his troops on both banks of the loire  the place of saumur  that the  places of which he made himself master should be handed over to henry  iii   and that he might not anywhere do anything to the prejudice of the  catholic religion  that the protestants should be no more disquieted  throughout the whole of france  and that  before the expiration of the  truce  king henry iii  should give them assurance of peace   this  negotiation was not concluded without difficulty  especially as regarded  the town of saumur  there was a general desire to cede to the king of  navarre only some place of less importance on the loire  and when  on the    th of april  du plessis mornay  who had been appointed governor of it   presented himself for admittance at the head of his garrison  the  royalist commandant  who had to deliver the keys to him  limited himself  to letting them drop at his feet   mornay showed alacrity in picking them  up     on the   th of april  the two kings had  each on his own behalf  made  their treaty public   henry iii  sent word to the king of navarre that he  wished to see him and have some conversation with him   many of the king  of navarre s friends dissuaded him from this interview  saying   they  are traitors  do not put yourself in their power  remember the  st  bartholomew    this counsel was repeated to him on the   th of april   at the very moment when he was stepping aboard the boat to cross the  loire and go to pay henry iii  a visit at the castle of plessis les   tours   the king of navarre made no account of it    god hath bidden me  to cross and see him   he answered   it is not in the power of man to  keep me back  for god is guiding me and crossing with me   of that i am  certain   and he crossed the river    it is incredible   says l estoile    what joy everybody felt at this interview  there was such a throng of  people that  notwithstanding all efforts to preserve order  the two kings  were a full quarter of an hour in the roadway of plessis park holding out  their hands to one another without being able to join them  people  climbed trees to see them  all shouted with great vigor and exultation   hurrah for the king  hurrah for the king of navarre  hurrah for the  kings   at last  having joined hands  they embraced very lovingly  even  to tears   the king of navarre  on retiring in the evening  said   i  shall now die happy  since god hath given me grace to look upon the face  of my king and make him an offer of my services    i know not if those  were his own words  but what is certain is  that everybody at this time   both kings and people  except fanatical leaguers  regarded peace as a  great public blessing  and were rejoiced to have a prospect of it before  their eyes   the very day of the interview  the king of navarre wrote to  du plessis mornay   m  du plessis  the ice is broken  not without numbers  of warnings that if i went i was a dead man   i crossed the water   commending myself to god  who  by his goodness  not only preserved me   but caused extreme joy to appear on the king s countenance  and the  people to cheer so that never was the like  even shouting  hurrah for the  kings  whereat i was much vexed       some days afterwards  during the night of may    the duke of mayenne made  an attack upon tours  and carried for the moment the faubourg st   symphorien  which gave henry iii  such a fright that he was on the point  of leaving the city and betaking himself to a distance   but the king of  navarre  warned in time  entered tours  and at his approach the leaguers  fell back    when the white scarfs appeared  coming to the king s rescue   the duke of mayenne and his troops began shouting to them   back  white  scarfs  back  chatillon  we are not set against you  but against the  murderers of your father   meaning thereby that they were set against  king henry de valois only  and not against the huguenots   but chatillon   amongst the rest  answered them   you are all of you traitors to your  country  i trample under foot all vengeance and all private interests  when the service of my prince and of the state is concerned   which he  said so loudly that even his majesty heard it  and praised him for it   and loved him for it    the two kings determined to move on paris and  besiege it  and towards the end of july their camp was pitched before the  walls     great was the excitement throughout europe as well as france  at the  courts of madrid and rome as well as in the park of plessis les tours   a very serious blow for philip ii   and a very bad omen for the future  of his policy  was this alliance between henry de valois and henry of  navarre  between a great portion of the catholics of france and the  protestants   philip ii  had plumed himself upon being the patron of  absolute power in religious as well as political matters  and the  dominant power throughout europe in the name of catholicism and spain   in both these respects he ran great risk of being beaten by a king of  france who was a protestant or an ally of protestants and supported by  the protestant influence of england  holland  and germany   in italy  itself and in catholic europe philip did not find the harmony and support  for which he looked   the republic of venice was quietly but certainly  well disposed towards france  and determined to live on good terms with a  king of france  a friend of protestants or even himself protestant   and  what hurt philip ii  still more was  that pope sixtus v  himself  though  all the while upholding the unity and authority of the roman church   was bent upon not submitting to the yoke of spain  and upon showing a  favorable disposition towards france    france is a very noble kingdom    he said to the venetian ambassador gritti   the church has always  obtained great advantages from her   we love her beyond measure  and we  are pleased to find that the signiory shares our affection    another day  he expressed to him his disapprobation of the league    we cannot praise   indeed we must blame  the first act committed by the duke of guise  which  was to take up arms and unite with other princes against the king  though  he made religion a pretext  he had no right to take up arms against his  sovereign    and again   the union of the king of france with the  heretics is no longer a matter of doubt  but  after all  henry of navarre  is worth a great many of henry iii   this latter will have the measure he  meted to the guises    so much equity and mental breadth on the pope s  part was better suited for the republic of venice than for the king of  spain    we have but one desire   wrote the doge cicogna to badoero  his  ambassador at rome   and that is to keep the european peace   we cannot  believe that sixtus v   that great pontiff  is untrue to his charge   which is to ward off from the christian world the dangers that threaten  it  in imitation of him whom he represents on earth  he will show mercy   and not proceed to acts which would drive the king of france to despair    during the great struggle with which europe was engaged in the sixteenth  century  the independence of states  religious tolerance  and political  liberty thus sometimes found  besides their regular and declared  champions  protectors  useful on occasion although they were timid  even  amongst the habitual allies of charles v  s despotic and persecuting  successor     on arriving before paris towards the end of july        the two kings  besieged it with an army of forty two thousand men  the strongest and the  best they had ever had under their orders    the affairs of henry iii     says de thou   had changed face  fortune was pronouncing for him    quartered in the house of count de retz  at st  cloud  he could thence  see quite at his ease his city of paris    yonder   said he   is the  heart of the league  it is there that the blow must be struck   it was  great pity to lay in ruins so beautiful and goodly a city   still  i must  settle accounts with the rebels who are in it  and who ignominiously  drove me away     on tuesday  august    at eight a   m   he was told    says l estoile   that a monk desired to speak with him  but that his  guards made a difficulty about letting him in    let him in   said the  king   if he is refused  it will be said that i drive monks away and will  not see them    incontinently entered the monk  having in his sleeve a  knife unsheathed   he made a profound reverence to the king  who had just  got up and had nothing on but a dressing gown about his shoulders  and  presented to him despatches from count de brienne  saying that he had  further orders to tell the king privately something of importance   then  the king ordered those who were present to retire  and began reading the  letter which the monk had brought asking for a private audience  afterwards  the monk  seeing the king s attention taken up with reading   drew his knife from his sleeve and drove it right into the king s small  gut  below the navel  so home that he left the knife in the hole  the  which the king having drawn out with great exertion struck the monk a  blow with the point of it on his left eyebrow  crying   ah  wicked monk   he has killed me  kill him    at which cry running quickly up  the guards  and others  such as happened to be nearest  massacred this assassin of a  jacobin who  as d aubigne says  stretched out his two arms against the  wall  counterfeiting the crucifix  whilst the blows were dealt him   having been dragged out dead from the king s chamber  he was stripped  naked to the waist  covered with his gown and exposed to the public      whilst henry de valois was thus struck down at st  cloud  henry of  navarre had moved with a good number of troops to the pre aux clercs   and seeing rosny  who was darting along  pistol in hand  amongst the  foremost  he called one of his gentlemen and said   maignan  go and tell  m  de rosny to come back  he will get taken or wounded in that rash  style     i should not care to speak so to him   answered maignan    i  will tell him that your majesty wants him    meanwhile up came a  gentleman at a gallop  who said three or four words in the king of  navarre s ear    my friend   said henry to rosny   the king has just been  wounded with a knife in the stomach  let us go and see about it  come  with me    henry took with him five and twenty gentlemen   the king  received him affectionately  exhorted him to change his religion for his  salvation s sake in another world and his fortunes in this  and   addressing the people of quality who thronged his chamber  he said   i do  pray you as my friends  and as your king i order you  to recognize after  my death my brother here   for my satisfaction and as your bounden duty   i pray you to swear it to him in my presence    all present took the  oath   henry iii  spoke in a firm voice  and his wound was not believed  to be mortal   letters were sent in his name to the queen  to the  governors of the provinces and to the princes allied to the crown  to  inform them of the accident that had happened to the king   which  please  god  will turn out to be nothing    the king of navarre asked for some  details as to the assassin   james clement was a young dominican who   according to report  had been a soldier before he became a monk   he was  always talking of waging war against henry de valois  and he was called   captain clement    he told a story about a vision he had of an angel   who had bidden him  to put to death the tyrant of france  in return for  which he would have the crown of martyrdom    royalist writers report  that he had been placed in personal communication with the friends of  henry de guise  even with his sister the duchess of montpensier  and his  brother the duke of mayenne   when well informed of the facts  the king  of navarre returned to his quarters at meudon  and rosny to his lodging  at the foot of the castle   whilst rosny was at supper  his secretary  came and said to him   sir  the king of navarre  peradventure the king of  france  wants you   m  d orthoman writes to him to make haste and come to  st  cloud if he would see the king alive    the king of navarre at once  departed   just as he arrived at st  cloud  he heard in the street cries  of  ah  my god  we are lost    he was told that the king was dead   henry  iii   in fact  expired on the  d of august        between two and three  in the morning   the first persons henry of navarre encountered as he  entered the hotel de retz were the officers of the scottish guard  who  threw themselves at his feet  saying   ah  sir  you are now our king and  our master       illustration  henry of navarre and the scotch guard            end of volume iv
